President Felipe Calderón this weekend pledged £21m to 'rescue' Acapulco, the Pacific resort whose sewage-stained beaches are barely recognisable from its 1950s heyday. Calderón said he would spend 440m pesos over four years to improve sanitation services in Acapulco, which is struggling with an explosion in its local population and of the luxury hotels that draw hordes of US spring break tourists and weekend visitors from Mexico City.Tourism is one of Mexico's main economic motors and Calderón vowed during his 2006 election campaign to restore the Pacific coast resort to its former glory. Once a sparkling playground for the Hollywood set, including Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth, Acapulco has grown grubbier as the city has expanded and its tourism industry has ballooned. Six million tourists visit the resort each year. But barely treated sewage and waste water flow into its famous bay, leaving the sea murky brown and foamy in places, and egg-like odours hang over the port's pretty central square. The lack of infrastructure means poor families living in the city's outskirts suffer water shortages while foreigners splash about in bubbling hot tubs and landscaped swimming pools in hotels along the seafront. Calderón said he would bring clean water to poor neighbourhoods, improve the city's drains and upgrade sewage treatment plants. 'This is an indispensable step to improve the quality of life for all the local residents as well as the more than six million national and international tourists,' he said. Acapulco, famed for its huge crescent-shaped bay, has also been scarred by the presence of child-sex tourists and by rising crime after being sucked into a turf war between violent drug cartels.
