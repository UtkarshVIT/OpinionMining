Tensions between Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands have escalated after they summoned each other’s ambassadors.John Freeman, the British ambassador, was called in by Argentina’s deputy foreign minister, Eduardo Zuain, who is said to have demanded Freeman account for the “silence of the British government” after allegations made by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden last week that British agents spied on Argentina between 2006 and 2011.In a meeting in Buenos Aires on Thursday, Zuain is said to have warned Freeman that Argentina would prosecute oil companies working in waters off the Falklands, and repeated complaints about British plans to boost defences on the islands.A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that Freeman was summoned on Thursday, but declined to comment further.On Wednesday the Foreign Office called in Argentina’s ambassador to London over comments made by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner on 2 April, the 33rd anniversary of the start of the Falklands war. Fernández reportedly said: “International law and dialogue, not militarisation, are the path to a reunion and sovereignty. We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It’s not just wishful thinking.”The remarks were made in response to the announcement by Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, that two Chinook helicopters and an upgraded surface-to-air missile system would be part of a new defence package for the Falkland Islands.The Foreign Office said: “The UK has no doubt about its sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and surrounding maritime areas, nor about the Falkland Islanders’ right to decide their own future.“We object strongly to recent statements by the Argentine president and the Argentine ambassador to London and so summoned the ambassador to account for these.”Last week Britain dismissed the threat of prosecution against three oil and gas firms. The companies – Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas – announced they had found oil and gas in a remote field north of the islands.In 2013, Falkland Islanders took part in a referendum, voting by 1,513 to three to remain a British overseas territory.
