Keeping it Christmassy, that wise man Michael Gove appears to spotted something shiny in the east. Weary now of Swedish models and American charter schools, he's fallen for the sciencey approach to primary education that keeps Hong Kong and Singapore in business.The Sunday Times reports that Gove is "particularly impressed by the sophisticated subjects pupils in Asia tackle in primary school". Apparently they learn "how machines work" and "how plastic is made".All this excitement is going to set the new national curriculum back a bit, with 2014 now the target date for its introduction. Labour says that the government's expert panel has been sent back to the drawing board for failing to reflect Gove's "ideological creed".• Gove's ideological creed may allow private schools who want to become state academies to go on picking their pupils by ability, according to Daniel Boffey in the Observer. He reveals that:He quotes Roskilly as saying:• Oxford has accepted 32 black students for undergraduate study this year, the highest number in 10 years, the university has disclosed. The acceptance rate for black students among this year's intake was 14%, an improvement on last year's admissions round, when 8.8% of black applicants were successful compared with 24.1% of white applicants.• The Open University student association is strongly resisting the fees increase and has launched an e-petition to ask the government to rethink its proposals for higher education. It says:Great headteachers inspire more than they direct: Does education policy put too much faith in the dated concept of directive leadership when the commercial world has dumped it?• NUT leader Christine Blower says a deal is close with the government on teachers' pensions on a key day of negotiations, the BBC reports. A deadline of 3pm has been set by the government for union responses to its offer.• Universities are to make lower grade offers to poor students, says the Telegraph. Growing numbers of students applying to university face checks on their school and family background as part of a drive to "break the middle-class monopoly" on places.• History is being banished from classrooms in some parts of the country, the Telegraph claims. More than 150 comprehensives failed to enter a single pupil in GCSE history exams last year, according to a report produced by Tory MP Chris Skidmore.• The Independent reported at the weekend that thousands of trainee teachers had to re-sit basic literacy and numeracy tests last year, with one candidate taking a literacy paper 36 times.• Debbie McVitty on wonke.com (@wonke) spares a thought for the "poor neglected postgraduate student.• In the mood for watching a school being blown up?
