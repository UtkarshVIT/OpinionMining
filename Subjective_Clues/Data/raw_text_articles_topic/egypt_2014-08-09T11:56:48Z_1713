An Egyptian court has dissolved the Freedom and Justice party, the political wing of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.A court banned the Muslim Brotherhood itself in September, but that ruling did not cover its political wing, leaving open the possibility that it could be allowed to run in parliamentary elections. But the latest ruling, made on Saturday, effectively bans the Brotherhood from formal participation in electoral politics.The government of President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has cracked down on the Islamist movement and other political opponents in the past year.The Brotherhood was declared a terrorist group in December. Last July, Sisi, who was then head of the military, ousted former FJP leader Mohammed Morsi, the first Egyptian president elected following the 2011 uprisings that ended Hosni Mubarak's 29-year regime.
