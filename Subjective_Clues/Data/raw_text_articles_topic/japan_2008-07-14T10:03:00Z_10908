NHK, Japan's public service broadcaster, has banned share dealings by its journalists and all staff, totalling 5,700 employees, who have access to its news information management system. They must give a written pledge that they will not trade in stocks. Those who fail to do so will be refused access to the system. The ban follows the revelation that two reporters and a director made share transactions using information obtained from the system. All three were fired in March. (Via Japan News)
