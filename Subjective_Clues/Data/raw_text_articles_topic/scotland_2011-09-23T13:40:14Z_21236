Scotland could teach the rest of the UK a thing or two when it comes to a streamlined model of government, says Sir John Elvidge, former permanent secretary to the Scottish government.Elvidge sets out 12 lessons that could be learnt from Scotland's first 12 years of devolved government in a paper launched on Friday.He said that radical changes he made under the minority SNP party in 2007 – which involved abolishing departments, redefining top civil service roles and aligning the entire Scottish public sector around a single framework of national purpose that would be tracked and measured – were a world first."In partnership between civil service and political leadership, a radical Scottish model of government has developed since 2007, building on the learning from the earlier period of devolution. It is based on the effort to have government function as a single organisation, working towards a single defined government purpose based on outcomes, and establishing a partnership based on that purpose with the rest of the public sector which is capable of being joined by other parts of civil society."It places strategic leadership and the facilitation of co-operation between organisations and sections of society at the heart of the role of central government, rather than a managerialist view of the relationship of central government to others. It is an explicit rejection of departmentalism as a basis for effective government and involves the abolition of a departmental structure within the Scottish government."Elvidge writes in his paper, which was launched at the Institute for Government's inside devolution conference, that the shake-up was to pull apart entrenched silos that had become a feature of a coalition government."One of the consequences of coalition was to strengthen the desire of individual ministers to maximise their own degree of autonomy and, consequently, that of their department." But this did not exploit "the potential benefits of being able to address the wide range of responsibilities within a relatively compact central government". By unifying the system, he said, the Scottish government was able to manage spending reductions in 2009 and 2010.Elvidge's paper comes a day after the British civil service was criticised for its "institutional inertia, complacency and a lack of specialist expertise", which was keeping its head down over reform.He said the Scottish civil service had played "a central role" in effecting and establishing change. "As well as providing essential continuity of understanding about the processes of government, it has displayed agility and energy in assisting the adaptation of that understanding to fresh challenges," he said.Elvidge, once the most senior civil servant in Scotland, praised the Scottish public leadership forum, which was set up in 2006 and brings together all Scottish public sector leaders, for aiding the new style of government.While he is keen to emphasise that the paper makes no comment on Scottish politics, "my central proposition is that we are making less use than we could and should within the UK of the opportunities for transferable learning from the experience of devolution," he said.Lord Adonis, director of the Institute for Government, said: "Whitehall and Westminster have not woken up to the big changes north of the border. The new Scottish model offers a real challenge to the departmental way of doing business. IfG has already looked at ways of better joining up within current structures – Sir John's paper shows that, with political consent, a different way is possible".This article is published by Guardian Professional.
