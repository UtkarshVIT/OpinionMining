Canadian police on Thursday mounted a massive hunt for a 24-year-old gunman they suspect shot dead three officers in one of the worst losses of life for the country's national force in a decade.Police cordoned off a large area in the northwest of Moncton, New Brunswick, and ordered city residents to stay inside as officers searched for a suspect named on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Twitter feed as Justin Bourque of Moncton, who was considered armed and dangerous.Local media in Moncton published a photograph of a man in camouflage clothing and a black headband carrying a rifle.If you live in the marked area stay inside / lock doors. Roads blocked. Traffic disrupted. Avoid area #Codiac #RCMPNB http://t.co/Oqz389LqTlThe RCMP have been hunting Bourque after three officers were killed late on Wednesday and two more were taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.A large blue armoured police truck entered the cordoned off area early on Thursday morning and a helicopter hovered overhead.A Facebook page purporting to belong to the shooter was filled with posts critical of the police and those who backed gun control.Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada and the killings have spurred an outpouring of grief on social media. Police told residents not to tweet the locations of officers for fear they could be helping the gunman.Construction worker Danny Leblanc, 42, said he saw the shooter in the distance on Wednesday evening wearing a camouflage outfit and standing in the middle of the street with his gun pointed at police cars. He thought it was an RCMP officer until he heard a burst of automatic gunfire that sent him running into his home, where he remained behind locked doors with his family.Resident Will Njoku said at first he thought the shots had been firecrackers but then he heard sirens."My neighbour called and said there was a gunman on the loose and they were just down the road and it kind of freaked us out," he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. "I jumped out of my house and started directing traffic away ... I knew people going down there would be in danger."City officials said there had been no murders in Moncton in all of 2013 and none had been recorded this year until Wednesday.The Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, said in a statement the deaths of the officers would be honoured and remembered.Four Canadian RCMP officers, known as Mounties, were killed in March 2005 by a gunman on a farm in the province of Alberta. The shootings at Mayerthorpe, a small town, represented the RCMP's worst single-day loss of life in more than 100 years.The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report
