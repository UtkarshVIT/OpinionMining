Your correspondent is misconceived in her assertion that it is a "travesty" Dr Derek Keilloh be struck off the medical register (Letters, 27 December). The GMC had no choice in its decision as, apart from all their other findings of fault, the panel found that Dr Keilloh has been dishonest on oath, not once but twice. The first time was his evidence to the Baha Mousa court martial in December 2006 and the second his evidence to the Baha Mousa inquiry in November 2009. On this last occasion the chair, William Gage, specifically gave him a final opportunity to redeem himself, asking him after his evidence had concluded if he wanted to take the opportunity to say anything else to the inquiry. He said no. The GMC, acting in the public interest, had to remove him for such conduct to restore public confidence in the profession.Phil ShinerSolicitor, Public Interest Lawyers• However "brave" Sally Roberts's fight to determine her son's treatment (Letters, 28 December), it would be wrong to allow any implication that doctors' carefully considered and tested recommendations should be ignored in favour of untested and often harmful treatments. Sick people and their relatives are in a vulnerable state and clutch at straws. If this results in them abandoning treatments known to have some probability of reducing disease, they are causing the result they are trying to prevent. Cancer is a scourge and the treatment can be harrowing. But it is an illusion to think that there are wizards who can treat it effectively with lights and magic potions, whose methods are being ignored by the medical profession.Karl SabbaghAuthor, Magic or Medicine?
