On Thursday, Iran and the P5+1 powers announced a historic breakthrough in nuclear negotiations, which could end a 13-year nuclear standoff come June. The “political understanding”, in which Iran promised to make drastic cuts to its nuclear programme in return for the gradual lifting of economic sanctions, followed 18 months of intense negotiations, culminating in the last round of talks in Lausanne, Switzerland.We want to hear your views on the future of Iran. What do you think will change in Iran once the nuclear deal is agreed? How will the lifting of sanctions change your daily life? How did you celebrate the “framework” announcement?
