Environmental groups are fighting a rearguard action to stop the destruction of one of Europe's most pristine coastlines after the Greek government signalled it would rethink draft legislation to develop the shoreline, but not scrap it altogether.Amid mounting international outrage over the proposed law, Athens's ruling coalition was forced to freeze plans that would have allowed unchecked construction and commercial activity along the country's extensive Mediterranean coast.On Wednesday the Ministry of Environment was presented with a petition signed by more than 110,000 people demanding that the bill be annulled.Theodota Nantsou, head of environmental policy at WWF Greece, told the Guardian: "Everything about this draft law is very, very dangerous for this country's coastline. Existing legislation is neither clear nor sufficient but it offers some basic protection and this would roll back even that."In sharp contrast to other major tourist destinations, Greece has not been afflicted by the runaway development of its shoreline. Policies that have wreaked havoc on countries such as Italy and Spain have been avoided, in part because of a bureaucratic machine that has succeeded in deterring even the most hardened of investors.But environmentalists say Greece will go the way of those countries if the legislation is ever adopted.In its current form the draft law would allow unrestricted exploitation of what is widely regarded as one of the most unspoilt coastlines on the continent of Europe: simplifying building permits for beachside hotels; allowing businesses to pay fines to legalise buildings deemed illicit, and permitting vendors to litter shorelines with umbrellas and sunbeds. Free access to public beaches, a right enshrined in the Greek constitution, would also be severely limited according to associations of lawyers and judges who have joined the burgeoning ranks of opponents to the bill.Announcing the legislation last month, the conservative-dominated coalition vehemently denied it would have disastrous effects for Greece's unique natural beauty. The ministry of finance, which drafted the law, insisted that with the debt-crippled country emerging from its worst recession in living memory after narrowly escaping economic collapse, the proposed bill would enable entrepreneurs to tap a source rich in unexploited potential.The ministry said: "The economic importance of the coastal zone is huge and the huge possibilities for economic development it provides must be unlocked."But clearly taken aback by the scale of the outcry barely two weeks before European elections, a close aide to prime minister Antonis Samaras unexpectedly declared that the government would reconsider the bill and take "a final position" after the poll.By late Tuesday, hours before the announcement, thousands of beach-loving Greeks had either signed online petitions or inundated official government sites in a massive display of disapproval for the legislation.After years of being ground down by biting austerity – the price of €240bn in international rescue funds from the EU and IMF – many feared the measures would not only cut off access to one of the few free assets the nation can enjoy but result in the degradation of its greatest tourist attraction: its natural beauty.With the country braced to accept a record 18.5 million foreign visitors this year alone – and aiming to raise that number to 24 million by 2021 following the loss of more than a quarter of its economic worth to the crisis – environmentalists agree that a compromise has to be found. But they are also digging in their heels."We have to start discussing how we can avoid the mistakes of Italy and Spain," Nantsou said WWF's Theodota Nantsou, warning that the nation's economic crisis is being brazenly used to enforce measures that previously few would have dared propose. "We are not saying 'no'. All we are saying is that whatever is passed has to be in harmony with the natural environment and that has to start with the withdrawal of this law."
