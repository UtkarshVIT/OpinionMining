In what is perhaps the operatic equivalent of selling ice to the Inuit, Damon Albarn is planning to take his rapturously received Monkey: Journey to the West show on a world tour that will involve it going back east to China.Those behind the show, who hope it will prove a hit with mainstream family audiences during its forthcoming run at the O2 in London despite being narrated in Mandarin and based on an ancient Chinese folk tale, plan to have two versions of the show on a permanent global tour. The opera - overseen by Chinese director Chen Shi-Zheng with a score by Albarn and visuals, stage and costume design by his Gorillaz partner Jamie Hewlett - will tonight begin a month-long run at a tented village attached to the arena in Greenwich. Rob Hallett, senior vice-president of promoter AEG Live, said it had invested Â£3m in the show and planned to take it across central Europe, Asia and the US next year. Noting the popularity of Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas, he said a version of the show could play there tooTelling the story of Monkey's quest for redemption and enlightenment as he accompanies the monk Tripitaka on a mission to bring back sacred Bhuddist scrolls from India, the opera features 40 Chinese performers, including acrobats, dancers, contortionists and martial artists.The show has played to more than 100,000 people in Manchester, Paris, Charleston in the US and London's Royal Opera House. Chris Morrison, who has been Albarn's manager in Blur and various subsequent projects for 16 years, said he was "absolutely blown away" when he first saw the finished show.
