Italian police have arrested 13 people on charges of faking cremations at a Tuscan cemetery and hiding the corpses before burning them in groups to pocket the savings on cremation costs. Investigators found bodies stashed at the cemetery in Massa ready for group cremations, as well as hidden plastic sacks containing about 600kg of mixed ashes - the fruits of a scam that ran from 2005 to 2007, involving 500 bodies, police said. The police round-up of cemetery and funeral home staff, as well as a former police officer allegedly involved in the scheme, has now left locals wondering whose ashes they were handed following cremations. Emiliano Pianini, a lawyer representing relatives of the dead, said: "Hopes of identifying ashes are almost non-existent since it is impossible to carry out DNA testing." Police unearthed the racket after discovering that coffins and other religious accessories supposedly burnt in cremations were surfacing on the second-hand market, sold by cemetery staff. Last year an employee gave evidence of the scam to police, prompting the investigation that led to this week's arrests.
