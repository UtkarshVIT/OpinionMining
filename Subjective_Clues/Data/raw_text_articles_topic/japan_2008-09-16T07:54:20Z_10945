The Bank of Japan ploughed ¥2.5 trillion (£13.5bn) into markets today in an attempt to limit the fallout from the Lehman Brothers collapse, and as jitters over the knock-on effect of the US bank's woes hit financial stocks across Asia.The central bank took the unusual step of releasing ¥1.5tn even before the markets opened in anticipation of volatility caused by Lehman's collapse and Bank of America's rushed $50bn ($28bn) takeover of Merrill Lynch yesterday.Lehman's Japanese unit filed for bankruptcy protection today with debts totalling ¥3.43tn, making it the second-biggest bankruptcy in Japan since the end of second world war.The BoJ's injection of funds was not enough to stop the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average plunging 4.95%, or 605.04 points, to close at 11,609, its lowest level since July 2005. The yen rose quickly against the dollar to the ¥104-level, from around ¥107 to the dollar at the end of last week, as confidence in the US currency was rocked by the continuing turmoil on Wall Street.BoJ officials held emergency talks with cabinet ministers and vowed to maintain stability in the world's second-biggest economy, a day after the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank all moved swiftly to prop up financial systems.The BoJ's governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, said in a statement: "The Bank of Japan will closely watch development surrounding the latest US financial institutions and its impact, and will continue to take appropriate measures to maintain smooth settlement and stability in the financial market."Japanese banks, which are among Lehman's biggest creditors, tried to play down fears they would be stung badly by the mounting credit crisis on the other side of the Pacific.Today was the first opportunity Japanese markets have had to gauge the fallout from Lehman's collapse as they were closed yesterday for a public holiday.Lehman owes seven Japanese banks $1.62bn in outstanding loans, according to the US bank's bankruptcy filing.Aozora bank, Lehman's largest unsecured Japanese creditor with an exposure of $463m, said its risk had been overstated in the bankruptcy filings, since they failed to assume "reasonable recoveries" against Lehman's Japanese unit and market pricing for recoveries against the US parent firm."The reported exposure of $463m reflects the maximum amount of a contingent guarantee" by Lehman for the Japanese unit's loan obligations to Aozora, the Japanese bank said.Instead, Aozora said, projected exposure was "less than $25m," or less than 6% of amount reported by Lehman yesterday.Among other Japanese lenders, Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings said it had loaned ¥15bn to Lehman and Chiba bank almost ¥5bn. Mizuho Trust and Banking, meanwhile, said it expected ¥11.8bn in losses.Aozora and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group led the biggest decline in banking stocks since the "Black Monday" stock market crash of October 1987. The Topix banks index fell by as much as 10% in morning trading, while financial stocks in China, South Korea and Australia also plunged.Shares in Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan's largest bank, had fallen more than 8% by late morning, while Aozora dropped 19% - its biggest fall ever - and Shinsei bank, which is owed $231m fell 16%.The Financial Services Agency ordered Lehman to suspend all operations in Japan, except the return of assets, for 12 days from Monday, and to keep certain assets inside the country.The financial services minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, attempted to allay fears that, having survived the worst of the sub-prime crisis, Japan was about to be hurled into the turmoil currently rocking the economies of the US and Europe."So far, we haven't confirmed any signs that Japanese financial institutions are seriously affected," he told reporters.The finance minister, Bunmei Ibuki, said he was confident Japan's would have limited exposure to Lehman's collapse."Considering the conditions of each financial institution's self-owned capital, we do not have to worry about the Japanese financial system, though those entities have extended loans to Lehman," he said.
