Europe's recovery from its debt crisis took two significant steps forward on Wednesday as Greece posted a primary budget surplus and Portugal made a successful return to the bond markets for the first time in three years.The European commission paved the way for Greece to begin debt relief talks with its creditors by announcing that the country had been left with a surplus of about €1.5bn (£1.2bn) last year, or 0.8% of national output,once its hefty debt payments and the cost of recapitalising its banks had been stripped out.The EU's executive arm said Greece's finances were ahead of the targets agreed with its lenders, describing it as a "reflection of the remarkable progress that Greece has made in repairing its public finances since 2010".The commission, a member of the troika that bailed out Greece, alongside the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, with packages worth more than €200bn, said it believed the country's debts were sustainable.Greek ministers said the long years of sacrifices since accepting a bailout in 2010 were paying off. "After these years that were very tough on households and businesses, the country and its economy are in a definitely better position," said the deputy finance minister, Christos Staikouras.The primary surplus means that, technically, Greek government revenues now exceed expenditure. However, it was only reached by ignoring the interest payments on Greece's borrowings, the cost of recapitalising its banks, and other one-off measures.Greece's total national debt actually rose to 175% of national output in 2013, up from 157% of GDP the previous year. Much is held by other eurozone governments, which must decide whether to help Athens by cutting the interest rates on its bonds or extending the maturities on those debts.Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group, said Greece would start pushing hard for debt relief, which could be tied to a future financial programme once the current bailout expires at the end of 2014."As long as the new reform programme comes with tough conditions, some minimal debt relief will likely be forthcoming," he predicted.Portugal's hopes of avoiding a second bailout were bolstered when investors showed solid interest in its first debt sale since 2011. It sold €750m of 10-year bonds at an interest rate of 3.5752%, the lowest in eight years, in an auction that was more than three times oversubscribed.The sale boosted hopes that Lisbon can follow Ireland and make a clean return to the financial markets when its €78bn bailout ends this year.The Spanish finance minister, Luis de Guindos, added to optimism in the eurozone by predicting that Spain's economy would grow faster than forecast. He forecast GDP would rise by around 1.5% in 2014, up from a previous estimate of 1%, with higher tax revenues meaning Spain would need to borrow less this year.But France's government raised its own borrowing forecasts, predicting a deficit of 3.8% of GDP this year, up from the previous forecast of 3.6%. This is expected to fall to 3% in 2015, compared with the previous forecast of 2.8%, barely hitting the deficit reduction targets agreed with Brussels.The latest survey of Europe's manufacturing sector, from Markit, showed that France's private companies continued to lag behind their German rivals.Activity in the French service sector has barely increased this month, while factory managers also reported a slowdown. Firms continued to cut jobs, and appear jittery over France's recovery."Until we see a decisive shift in confidence, the business climate looks set to remain frail," warned Markit's Jack Kennedy.Activity in Germany's private sector has risen this month, though, with output, new business growth and employment levels all up as firms respond to stronger domestic and overseas demand.
