Great minds think alike, or doing the bleedin' obvious? Monkey only asks after the good people of London dance station Kiss 100 announced they would mark tomorrow's Australia Day by ... turning their schedule upside down! So drivetime DJ Jez Welham will host breakfast, and breakfast presenters Rickie, Melvin and Charlie will... oh, you get the idea. Over at BBC 6Music, they will also be celebrating Australia Day. How? By turning their schedule upside down! So Steve Lamacq gets breakfast, and Shaun Keaveny goes to... yes, drivetime, like you hadn't guessed. Celebrity Big Brother, meanwhile, will mark the day by turning its contestants upside down. And leaving them there.
