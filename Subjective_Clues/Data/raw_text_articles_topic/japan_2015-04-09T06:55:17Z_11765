Black Sabbath have reportedly pulled out of the gig that was being billed as their farewell. Blabbermouth reports that the metal legends have been replaced on the bill for Ozzfest in Japan in November with a solo show by Ozzy Osbourne. No reason has been given for Sabbath’s decision to pull out.The metal website the PRP received a statement from the band, reading: “Despite previous reports, Black Sabbath will not appear on this year’s Ozzfest Japan, the show will instead feature the festival’s namesake, Ozzy Osbourne (and friends).”The gig was announced last month, when Sharon Osbourne, Ozzy’s wife and manager, issued a video statement containing the words: “And this will be Black Sabbath’s farewell.”Blabbermouth suggests Osbourne’s choice of words was unfortunate – that perhaps this was to be Sabbath’s last Japanese show, rather than their last performance of any kind. However, if that was the case, it was not made clear even to those who work with the band. When the Guardian asked the UK publicity firm that works for Sabbath if one of its other clients, Josh Homme, could write a tribute to Sabbath in the wake of the announcement, the answer was only about Homme’s availability – there was no denial of the story itself.The Guardian has contacted Sabbath’s publicists for further comment, and we will update this story when any is made.
