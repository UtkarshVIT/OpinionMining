A strong aftershock hit southern Greece today two hours after the same area was shaken by a powerful earthquake felt as far away as Egypt and Italy. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.The epicentre of the first quake - which registered a preliminary magnitude of 6.5 according to the Athens Geodynamic Institute - struck shortly after noon (10am GMT) off the coast of Kalamata on the Peloponnese peninsula, around 140 miles (225km) south-west of Athens. The US Geological Survey initially put the magnitude at 7.3 but later revised this to 6.7. Greek television stations warned people in areas near the epicentre to stay away from buildings. "It was incredibly strong and lasted a long time," said Theodoros Salantis, mayor of Koroni, a seaside town near Kalamata.A seismologist, Efthymios Lekkas, said the quake struck at a depth of about 18 miles beneath the seabed, adding that initial indications were that it was the main earthquake rather than a preliminary one. Residents in the Greek capital also felt the tremors for at least 15 seconds, witnesses told Reuters news agency. "We were shaken for quite a long time, swaying back and forth," said Tanya Spiropoulou from the northern Athens suburb of Marousis. In January, a 6.5 quake struck another part of southern Greece, also causing no damage. Earthquakes are common in the country, which is riddled with faultlines. In 1999, a 5.9-magnitude quake near Athens killed 143 people and left thousands more homeless.
