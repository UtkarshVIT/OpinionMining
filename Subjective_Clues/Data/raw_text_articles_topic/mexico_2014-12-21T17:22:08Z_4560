Your story (Mexico authorities knew about attack on students as it happened, 16 December) does not reflect the reality of the disappearance of 43 students in the Mexican state of Guerrero and the ongoing investigations around this event. Without any other source of information than a story published in a Mexican magazine – on which the attorney general’s office has already requested an appropriate rectification – the Guardian admits that it has not been able to verify not only the alleged leaked government documents but the magazine’s account.The Mexican government is committed to a thorough transparent investigation, with the findings double-checked and assessed by different NGOs, independent groups and experts.Diego Gomez PickeringAmbassador of Mexico to the UK
