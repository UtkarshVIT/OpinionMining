It's primary election day in Alabama, Mississippi and New Mexico – and it's Alabama that has the most interesting contests on both the Republican and Democratic sides of the aisle.In the Democratic primary, Artur Davis is challenging to become the first black governor of Alabama, and he's doing so in an unusual fashion, as the New York Times reports:Mr Davis, 42, is among the nation's new guard of black political figures. But since he was elected to Congress in 2002, he has often been at odds with much of the state's black political establishment. He never sought — or earned — their blessing to run for governor. And the civil rights organizations that have long carried influence over many black voters in the state have lined up behind Mr Davis's opponent, Ron Sparks, the state agriculture commissioner, who is white.The fight between Davis and Sparks has been rancorous, but Davis's attempt is seen by some as reminiscent of Barack Obama's presidential campaign: not directly courting the black vote.But neither Davis nor Sparks have more than a slim hope come November in the 2010 midterm elections, regardless of which of them wins the nomination. The Republican primary battle for the vacant Alabama governor's position has attracted a crowded field of seven runners, since the state is solidly Republican and can be expected to elect the winner of the primary.As previously mentioned, the candidates include Tim James of the tasteful "This is Alabama, we speak English" campaign ads. If no one candidate wins a majority, as seems likely, there will be a run-off election between the top two on 13 June.Also in Alabama, turncoat former Democratic congressman Parker Griffith will learn his fate after switching parties, and he looks likely to lose his bid for the Republican nomination in Alabama's fifth congressional district.The only other primary of note today is in the Republican nomination for New Mexico governor. Five Republicans are competing to take on Diane Denish, the sole Democratic nominee and current deputy governor who is attempting to become the state's first woman governor.Politics geeks can follow the action this evening on a liveblog at the Swing State Project blog.
