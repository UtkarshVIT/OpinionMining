A pair of giant pandas arrived in Taiwan from China today after a highly symbolic journey that highlights the gradual thawing of relations between the self-governing island and the mainland.In the latest example of so-called "panda diplomacy" – the most famous example of which saw Mao Zedong send a pair of the animals to the US in 1972 after Richard Nixon's historic visit – Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan were packed into special portable cages and loaded on to a charter flight in south-west China.Chinese state TV carried live footage as the plane, its interior decorated with panda pictures, took off from Chengdu airport in Sichuan province at the start of the three-hour flight to Taiwan."I wish them a happy life in Taiwan," said a tearful Qu Chunmao, one of the pandas' keepers at the Wolong breeding centre where they were raised.Another keeper and a vet flew with the animals to make sure they suffered no ill effects from the journey. The plane carried about half a tonne of Sichuanese bamboo and some steamed corn buns in case the pair initially reject the food served at the zoo in Taipei, Taiwan's capital.Taiwanese TV later showed its own live footage of the Eva Airways Boeing 747 touching down in Taipei.The four-year-old pandas – or "furry goodwill ambassadors", as one report called them – will spend a month in quarantine before emerging before the public in time for the lunar new year public holiday.Beijing first offered the pandas in 2005 but they were rejected by the then president, Chen Shui-bian, whose Democratic Progressive party (DPP) supported moves towards independence for Taiwan. The island split politically from the mainland in 1949 after nationalist forces routed by Mao's communists fled there.Taiwan's new president, Ma Ying-jeou, has tried to forge closer ties with China and accepted the pandas as a goodwill gesture.Pandas have long been an important symbol of Chinese diplomatic overtures to both allies and former foes. In the past, Beijing has given the animals to countries including North Korea, the Soviet Union and Japan.The dispatch of Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan has received heavy media coverage in China, beginning today with a pre-dawn ceremony at the breeding centre in which children dressed up as pandas performed a dance as the animals were loaded on to a truck. A special set of stamps has been issued marking the event.Some in Taiwan are suspicious of the gift. When put together, the names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan mean "reunion" in Chinese. Beijing insists Taiwan is a rogue province and has long threatened to bring it back under Chinese rule by force.The lavish farewell ceremony at Chengdu airport, involving speeches and more dancing, carefully avoided any statements of overt political intent from Beijing."Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan will sow the seeds of peace, solidarity and friendship on Taiwan's soil," said Zheng Lizhong, from Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, according to the AFP news agency. The pandas were leaving "with the good wishes of the 1.3 billion mainland compatriots", Zheng said.While many Taiwanese want to see a reunion, others view it as a threat to the island's democratic system and higher living standards. A spokesman for the DPP, now in opposition, said the pandas "will not cover up China's military threat against us".China still has hundreds of missiles aimed at Taiwan but in recent years it has focused less on sabre rattling and more on increasing economic and social ties. A significant proportion of Taiwan's economy is now reliant on factories on the mainland, and Beijing has offered Taiwanese investors assistance to weather the global economic downturn.In the wake of direct shipping and postal links, this summer also saw the first direct flights across the Taiwan Straits since the civil war, with passenger services now running daily.
