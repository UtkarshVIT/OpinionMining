Tom McMillan is fixing some stray tiles on his roof when I first ring him. It is as elevated as he gets these days, as he and his wife Lorraine are unequivocally committed to limiting and reducing their carbon footprint. "We can't be green and fly," he says. "It's an oxymoron, unless you hang-glide."Arguments about restricted flying and aviation companies greening their fleet cut no ice with this environmental scientist. "If we are going to achieve an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050, we need to rethink how we travel â€“ radically. Technological improvements won't be enough," he says.Being this green usually means that dreams of seeing the world are traded in for a fortnight's staycation. That's not an option for the McMillans, for whom travel is life. In 2008 they travelled from Scotland to Singapore in 85 days, using 22 buses, 14 trains, 11 boats and an unknown number of tuk tuks. That journey provided the inspiration for flightlesstravel.com, a social networking website that allows travellers to share their experiences and help others reach their destination by land and sea alone. Its database of journeys includes camel treks and freight routes.The project was born partly out of frustration. When Tom researched the Singapore trip, every itinerary presupposed flights. He also found that travel agents who arrange bespoke overground trips are useless for those on a budget: "You pay five to 10 times more than if you bought your ticket at the point of departure."Flightlesstravel.com could be eco travel's answer to Freecycle: a free-flowing exchange of information, ideas and secret tips on the best train journeys, little-known ferry routes, or even how to cadge a lift on a cargo ship. Bon voyage.
