Two Falkland Islands oil exploration firms have announced a £57m deal just hours after Argentina elected a leader with a milder attitude towards the territorial dispute with Britain over the islands.If the deal goes ahead, it will bring together two companies that have suffered some of the most precipitous declines in stock market value in recent years.Rockhopper Exploration said it had agreed an all-share takeover of Falklands Oil & Gas (FOGL) that values the target company at £57m.The combined firm would own the largest oil exploration licence in the offshore area north of the Falklands, where an expected oil bonanza has so far failed to materialise.The Falklands were once seen as the next frontier for major oil discoveries, but excitement has fizzled out as well after well came up dry or not commercially viable.The disappointment prompted shares in Rockhopper to slump 93% from a peak of £5.10 in September 2010 to just 35p.

Rockhopper investors will own 65% of the combined company.
