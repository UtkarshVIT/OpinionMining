An American missionary and human rights activist who was arrested after entering North Korea on Christmas Day has returned to the US.Robert Park, 28, was detained for 43 days after crossing the border from China carrying a letter to North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il. He is believed to have been attempting to draw attention to the tens of thousands of political prisoners said to be held in the communist state.The Korean-American, from Tucson, Arizona, was welcomed by family at Los Angeles international airport. Earlier he had flown to Beijing from Pyongyang.Park reportedly looked pale and thin as he arrived at the airport, but his brother, Paul Park, told reporters he was in good condition. "Hugging him, there didn't seem to be anything broken," he said.Paul Park said the family only became aware that Robert intended to cross the border 14 hours before he set off. "I have to admit, I didn't believe it until I saw it on the international news," he said. "To say that the family wasn't prepared would be putting it mildly."Paul Park said the family had not asked Robert if he had been mistreated while in custody, and the 28-year-old did not respond to reporters' questions.The South Korean government estimates North Korea holds 154,000 political prisoners in six camps across the country. It is regarded as having one of the world's worst human rights records, but denies the existence of prison camps.North Korean state news agency KCNA reported on Friday that Park was to be released. KCNA also carried an interview with Park, who works for Pax Koreana, a conservative Seoul-based group that calls for North Korea to improve its human rights record.Park was quoted as saying he had been treated in a "kind and gentlemanly manner", and explaining that his understanding of North Korea had been tarnished by "false propaganda made by the west. This false propaganda prompted me, a Christian, to entertain a biased view."
