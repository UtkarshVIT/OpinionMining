The Foreign and Commonwealth Office this evening lifted its advisory against all but essential travel to Mexico, meaning that tour operators can resume outbound holidays to the country.The FCO said: "Following a decline in the number of reported new swine influenza cases in Mexico since its peak on 26 April, we no longer advise against all but essential travel." It adds that "British Nationals should continue to follow local advice on precautions to take to avoid exposure to the influenza".Manuel Diaz Cebrian, from the Mexican Tourism Board in London, said: "This is like seeing light at the end of the tunnel and we are very happy. It means tour operators will go ahead with their flights and people will start considering Mexico again as a destination. It's the first step to the recovery of the perception of Mexico. But it's going to take almost a year to recover fully."He added that Mexico will bring forward a TV, print and radio promotional campaign it had planned for June to the end of May.Thomson and First Choice have cancelled all outbound holidays to the beach resorts of Cancún and Cozumel until 22 May, but said: "In light of this updated advice, we are planning to begin operations to Mexico once again in the very near future, although we are not in a position to advise of an exact date at this time."The tour operators said that before they resume flights, they will need to have confirmation of when hotels will be re-opening, as many were closed due to lack of guests, and will need to make "resort standard set-up checks".Thomas Cook, which also flies to Cancún, said it will resume flights on May 23.
