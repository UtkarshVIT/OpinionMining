The Obama administration reversed its decision to expand offshore drilling today, saying it had learned a lesson from the BP oil disaster.The announcement from the interior secretary, Ken Salazar, bans new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts until 2017.It would not block a highly controversial $3.5bn project by Royal Dutch Shell to open up pristine Arctic waters to drilling. However, Salazar said Shell would have to upgrade its oil spill response plan, which could delay the planned start of the drilling next summer.There could also be delays on opening up new areas of the central and western Gulf of Mexico to drilling as more stringent safety measures are put in place.In a conference call with reporters, Salazar made repeated reference to the Deepwater Horizon blowout last April 20 – barely a month after Obama opened up new areas of the Gulf and Atlantic to drilling. "The change from March to today is essentially based on lessons we have learned from the Deepwater Horizon spill," he said.Salazar also said repeatedly that the decision had been guided by scientific findings in the wake of the BP oil disaster, but he offered no specifics.It was also unclear how the latest decision fits in with the Obama administration's overall energy strategy.The announcement was immediately condemned by the oil and gas industry, and welcomed by environmental organisations. However, they criticised the decision to allow Arctic drilling to go ahead."Until oil companies prove they can contain and clean up an oil gusher in rough, remote Arctic waters, Shell should not be allowed to drill its planned exploratory wells there this summer," Adam Kolton of the National Wildlife Federation said.Obama had already weathered criticism from Republicans and the oil and gas industry for imposing a temporary ban on deepwater drilling after the blow-out. The administration lifted the ban in October, claiming it had used the time to put in place more stringent safety requirements for industry and stepped up inspections from the government's regulatory agency. Republicans and local leaders in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi said the ban had hurt the economy – a charge certain to be aired once more after today's announcement.Giving the go-ahead to more drilling was an attempt to lure Republican support for climate change legislation before Congress. The ploy angered environmentalists and political leaders in Florida, where the tourism industry relies on safe and clean beaches – even before the Deepwater Horizon went down.Obama now faces an additional challenge to the March decision from the commission he appointed to investigate the spill. Under that plan, about two-thirds of the Gulf would have been opened up to the oil and gas industry, and drilling could take place up to 125 miles off the Florida coast.Officials dealing with the environment told the commission they were not consulted in the decision to expand offshore drilling – even though Obama claimed it had been carefully considered for over a year.The commission is to hold public deliberations on Thursday on whether BP and its partners on Deepwater Horizon, including Transocean and Horizon, put cost-saving ahead of safety considerations.
