A newly married Briton has drowned while on honeymoon in Spain, the Foreign Office said today.A spokeswoman said Russell Kenneth Hawkes died at the Spanish seaside resort of Fuengirola, on the Costa del Sol, yesterday afternoon.According to reports in the Malaga-based Sur newspaper, the 39-year-old, from Basildon, in Essex, was drowned after a strong undercurrent swept him out to sea. It is believed his wife raised the alarm after he failed to return to the Carvajal beach. Surfers pulled Hawkes unconscious from the sea, but resuscitation attempts on the beach failed.
