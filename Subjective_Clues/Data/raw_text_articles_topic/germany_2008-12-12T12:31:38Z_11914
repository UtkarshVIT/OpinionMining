The row between Britain and Germany over the best way to respond to the global recession intensified last night, with the budget spokesman for Angela Merkel's CDU party blaming Gordon Brown for presiding over a "complete failure" of economic policy. This followed an attack earlier this week by the German finance minister, who critiqued Brown's fiscal stimulus plan as "crass Keynesianism".Hitting back, Brown has blamed "internal German politics" on the outbursts. So who is right? Should Brown stop lecturing Germany and listen to what it has to say? Is Brown right to have faith in his economic plan for Britain? Or is this just another example of the divide between Anglo Saxon and European economic models?
