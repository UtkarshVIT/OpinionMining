Two articles on Brazil within days, one on converting guns to World Cup goalposts (15 December), the other about drug smuggling (18 December). I'm just back from a research visit to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. There I saw a country whose redistributionist President Lula left office in 2010 with an 83% approval rating, and whose current President Dilma's rating is "only" 72%. Where there are no fees for those who can get in to study at its internationally respected public universities. Where there are over 2,500 peer-reviewed academic journals. Where there is a national development bank, four times the size of the World Bank, with its own credit card scheme for SMEs at less-than-market credit card interest rates. Where there are phenomenally stocked newspaper and magazine kiosks on every other downtown corner. Where people sit in cafes and bars, eat healthily, and get on with each other, irrespective of whether their ethnic origins are European, Japanese, African, Arab, or Jewish. This benign Brazil might be only half the story. But it's not your fantasy criminal Brazil. Oh, and I landed in Manchester in a Brazilian-built Embraer aeroplane.Professor Bill CookeLancaster University
