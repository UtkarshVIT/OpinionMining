The ocean is usually a sign of freedom, immense freedom. Standing on the shore the sea stretches the horizon. Even the sky is a reflection of its colour. Walking along the shore, taking in the sounds of the ocean drowns out the noise of the city. As you train your gaze on its vastness, it can put you into a state of reverie, help bring about a moment’s peace. But this is not true for everyone. In Iran, the ocean doesn’t signify freedom to women, or all men. For more than 30 years now, women have not experienced the seaside with a sense of ease. They have to remain clothed and watch from the shore as men swim and children play.Should they want to cool down, they have to find an area designated for them. Walls made of fabric or plastic mark that space. They limit their movement and keep their day dreams in check. The other option women have is to seek out an unpopulated area and wade in just a feet or two. weighed down in a menteau and headscarf.For Iranian women, the meaning of the sea is different from the rest of the world. It reeks of inequality and limitation.
