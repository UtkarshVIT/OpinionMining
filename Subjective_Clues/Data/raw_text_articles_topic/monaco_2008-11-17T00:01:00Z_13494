The Conservatives yesterday blamed an administrative error after it emerged that the teenage daughter of a foreign arms dealer was recorded as giving £47,000 to the party, even though she did not have the funds to make such a donation.The Tories said they would be reporting a clerical error after the party was forced to admit it had accepted donations in the name of Rasha Said, the daughter of Wafic Said, a multimillionaire businessman who, as a non-UK resident, is barred from making donations to political parties.Ms Said told the Sunday Times she had instructed her parents to make donations on her behalf but that some of the cash might have come from them.She is reported as making four donations in 2005, when she was 19, including £35,000 in cash. She said she had asked her parents to donate on her behalf. Her mother, known as Rosemary, who is entitled to donate under British electoral law, gave £154,000 under the name Ann R Said. Wafic Said has homes in London and Oxfordshire, but resides in Monaco for tax purposes. He said his daughter had been mistaken in thinking she had given money to the Conservatives, as she only had £200. He said all her donations were in fact made by his wife, Rosemary. The donations had been wrongly accredited to Rasha by the party: "The problem is, both of them have the same initial."A statement from the Conservative party yesterday said: "In 2005, a number of donations from Rosemary were incorrectly registered with the Electoral Commission as coming from her daughter Rasha. This was an administrative error for which we take full responsibility. It occurred because of a misreading of the electoral roll during compliance checks."
