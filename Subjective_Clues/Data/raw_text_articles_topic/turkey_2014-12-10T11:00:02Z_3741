Britain is requesting that its intelligence agencies are given more information on UK citizens when they are detained in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State (Isis) in Syria.The requests have been made during meetings between the UK prime minister, David Cameron, and his Turkish counterparts amid fears that British citizens are crossing the country’s 800-miles border with Syria and Iraq.Despite international concerns about Turkey’s human rights record, both countries unveiled an agreement to share intelligence and work “hand in glove” at a press conference in Ankara between Cameron and the country’s prime minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu.At a further dinner with the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who holds the real power in the country, Cameron discussed British agents being given more access to information about UK citizens who are boarding flights and being detained in Turkey.The prime minister is not thought to have raised reports of Turkish human rights abuses at the dinner, particularly growing concerns about freedom of expression and the suppression of anti-government protests. Human Rights Watch released a report in September warning that the country is becoming increasingly authoritarian and controlling of the internet and media.It is understood the UK believes Turkey is receptive to its plan to temporarily take away passports.Cameron and Erdoğan, meeting at the 1,000-room presidential palace, agreed to deeper co-operation between their respective spying agencies over a dinner of grouper and poached pear.Although Erdoğan is known for his anti-western rhetoric, Cameron and the president are believed to have built a rapport over years of contact.Earlier, Cameron faced an awkward diplomatic moment as the prime minister, Davutoğlu, publicly criticised the foreign “propaganda” about Islamic State fighters passing through Turkey.Sharing a platform with Cameron, he said: “Turkey has never tolerated their transit through our territory or their existence in Syria … In some of the foreign press there is propaganda as if the foreign fighters are passing through Turkey … but Isis actually emerged in Iraq and when Iraq was under US control they developed with the support of the Syrian regime.”Cameron had just specifically identified Turkey as a potential route for fighters from the UK and other countries to pass into and out of Syria.Davutoğlu’s comments reflect Turkish senstivity to the charge from the EU and US that it has not been doing enough to stop jihadis.
