A German court has upheld a country-wide ban on sales of Samsung's flagship Galaxy Tab after a second successful claim by Apple.DÃ¼sseldorf regional court judge Johanna Brueckner-Hoffmann ruled on Friday the Galaxy Tab tablet computer had a "clear impression of similarity" to Apple's iPad.Samsung has been locked in a patent battle with Apple over the flagship device since April. Apple is seeking to block sales of Samsung's Galaxy range of tablet computers and smartphones in a number of territories, including Australia and Japan. Samsung has counter-sued the US electronics giant, claiming Apple infringes its wireless patents.The ban will prevent Samsung from distributing more Galaxy Tab computers to German retailers, who will be allowed to sell their existing stock.Samsung successfully fought a previous order that temporarily blocked the sale of its tablet computers in all EU countries, except the Netherlands.But the South Korean manufacturer has been hard hit by the patents battle, after it was forced to stop promoting its new range of products at Europe's largest consumer electronics fair, IFA, in Berlin last month.In a statement, Samsung vowed to appeal the ruling and claimed it would have a harmful impact on consumer choice in Germany."We are disappointed with this ruling and believe it severely limits consumer choice in Germany," it said. "We also believe that by imposing an injunction based on this very generic design right, this ruling restricts design innovation and progress in the industry."It added: "Samsung will actively and immediately appeal this ruling in order to ensure that consumer choice in Germany is restored. It should be noted that today's decision is inconsistent with the Dutch court's ruling on 24 August, which found the designs of Samsung's Galaxy range of products are distinctive and do not violate the cited design right.""To defend our intellectual property rights and protect our freedom to innovate, Samsung will take all available legal options including continuing to aggressively pursue Apple for its ongoing violation of Samsung's wireless technology patents around the world."
