The photo of US Col James Steele with your article on the involvement of US covert forces in torture in Iraq awakened chilling memories for me (Report, 7 March). I came across Steele while filming a documentary in El Salvador in 1982. This was at the height of the dirty war and the targeted assassination of anyone deemed to sympathise with those attempting to bring democracy to this impoverished Central American country. We met Steele at Robert d'Aubuisson's office and his behaviour clearly indicated he knew his way around and had the aura of a man in charge. He certainly had close links with the rightwing death squads linked to d'Aubuisson, who was held responsible for the assassination of Archbishop Romero. Steele smilingly refused to be interviewed by us. The evidence of horrendous torture and killing of thousands of innocent peasants in El Salvador clearly did no harm to his career. His official posting to Iraq shows that US covert policies have not changed. John GreenLondon
