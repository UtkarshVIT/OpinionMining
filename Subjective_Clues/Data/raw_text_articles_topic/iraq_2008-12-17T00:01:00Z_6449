Understanding Bilal Abdulla's alleged links to an Iraqi insurgent group is complicated by the fact there are two Sunni Muslim organisations with similar names but distinct agendas.A letter addressed to the "Soldiers of the Islamic States of Iraq" could be a reference to a group known as the Islamic Army of Iraq, which was founded after the 2003 US-led invasion.The IAI was one of several of underground Ba'athist and Islamist groups formed at the time. But although it has an Islamic title, it combines Islamism with Iraqi nationalism and was for a time thought to be the largest of the Sunni resistance groups fighting the US.It has claimed responsibility for hostage-taking and assassinations, including an attempt on the life of Ahmed Chalabi, leader of the Iraqi National Congress, in which two of his bodyguards were killed. Last year the IAI was involved in an internal war against al-Qaida in Iraq during which some of its members defected to join the US-backed Sahwa "awakening" groups fighting jihadi militants.It is distinct from the Islamic State in Iraq, an umbrella organisation of Salafi or jihadi groups, including al-Qaida in Iraq. That was established in late 2006 "to protect [Iraqis] from US attacks and defend Islam". Abdulla pointed out that he was not in Iraq at that time.The ISI is composed of, and supported by, a variety of groups, including its predecessor, the Mujahideen Shura Council, al-Qaida, Jund al-Sahaba, Ansar al-Tawhid wal Sunnah and some Sunni clans. Much about it is mysterious: its leader was named as Abu Omar al-Baghdadi (likely to be a pseudonym) and has variously been reported killed or captured. According to one source he was a fictional character, played by an actor, created to give an Iraqi "face" to a foreign-led al-Qaida operation.Broadly speaking, the Sunni insurgent groups are on the back foot, but this group is active: this week its media arm, al-Furqan, claimed an attack on an Iraqi army checkpoint in Diyala province. In April, Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, said in an answer to questions submitted to him on jihadi websites that the Islamic State in Iraq was the main force confronting the "crusaders and their collaborators".
