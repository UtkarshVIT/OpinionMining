Mexico City markets were flooded with export-quality tomatoes yesterday after a salmonella scare in the US stopped them crossing the border.There is no proof that the contaminated tomatoes in the US came from Mexico. The US Food and Drug Administration is still tracing the source of the outbreak that has left at least 167 people ill since mid-April.The FDA has cleared imports from at least six countries but not Mexico, which sends 80% of its tomato exports to the United States. Florida tomatoes are also under suspicion. But some US consumers already associate the outbreak with Mexican produce, and exports from Baja California came to a halt this week.Jesus Macias, the sales manager at the Productora Agricola Industrial del Noreste, normally ships 50,000 boxes a day to California. Since the scare, "we can't sell a single box of tomatoes", he said. Instead, he is shipping his top quality tomatoes to Mexican markets, and letting the lesser-quality produce rot.In Mexico City consumers can now buy top quality tomatoes for a third less than normal prices.Mexican officials insist there's nothing to worry about. "The Mexican tomato is safer and cleaner than ever," the agriculture secretary, Alberto CÃ¡rdenas, told Televisa network yesterday. Even US officials agree that certified Mexican exporters are among the safest in the world. Vegetables sold on the national market are not subject to the same standards. Associated Press
