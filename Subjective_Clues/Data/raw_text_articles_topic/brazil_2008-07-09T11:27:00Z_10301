Brazil's media giant Organizacoes Globo may be on the verge of getting bigger still. According to an AP report, it is considering buying Group Estado, owner of the country's second-largest newspaper, Estado de S. Paulo.Globo already controls the nation's largest TV network and a host of radio stations, magazines and newspapers including O Globo Extra and Diaro de S. Paulo.But, aside from the possibility of greater concentration of ownership, the other problem facing the Brazilian media is a growing threat to freedom of expression. A São Paulo newspaper, Jornal da Tarde has been forbidden by a federal judge from publishing a report about an official investigation into alleged financial irregularities by a doctors' organisation. The reporter was still working on the story when the president of the doctors' institution applied to the court for an injunction.The paper's editor-in-chief, Claudia Belfort, regards it as a form of judicial censorship, arguing that it is an unconstitutional decision. She and her lawyers are preparing an appeal.Three weeks ago, another judge imposed a fine on the three of Brazil's leading media outlets - O Estado de São Paulo, Veja Magazine and Folha de São Paulo - because they published interviews with candidates in a forthcoming election.The judge considered them to be advertisements, which are not allowed for a set period before an election. As a senior journalist remarked, the judge did not appear to know the difference between journalism and advertisement.Some editors are arguing that the censorship of 40 years ago, when the country was under military dictatorship, is returning, not least due to a lack of judicial knowledge.
