A Brisbane law student charged with sedition by Singaporean authorities over a citizen journalism website has vowed to continue publishing in a city state that she has said “stifles dissenting voices”.Ai Takagi and her Singaporean partner, Yang Kaiheng, face up to 21 years’ jail and $35,000 in fines each after their arrest in March over material on their website, the Real Singapore.Police alleged one article – which incorrectly claimed an incident during a Hindu festival was provoked by a Filipino migrant’s noise complaint about drums – promoted “ill will and hostility between different classes of the Singapore population”, which an offence under the Sedition Act.Takagi, 22, who is based in Singapore but in the final year of a law degree at the University of Queensland, indicated on Thursday that she hoped to avoid jail time.“I believe that the court is fair so I believe that it shouldn’t be [the maximum penalty] based on the severity of the offences,” she told ABC radio. “Obviously this is stressing out everyone involved but I’m staying positive.”Takagi said the website she developed with Kaiheng was meeting an untapped demand for everyday people in Singapore to vent their “opinions and frustrations” outside a mainstream media that was “heavily censored by the government”.The couple, who appeared in court on Tuesday also charged with failing to produce documents relating to advertising revenue, were continuing to receive legal advice, Takagi said.“This is actually a law that is recognised to be used for stifling dissent. It has been used in the past and I and everyone involved in the website have always known there is a risk in doing what we do.”Her family in Brisbane had told her “good luck and be careful”, Takagi said.Police investigators had indicated the website’s “misreporting had caused local Singaporeans to be angry at the foreign nationals who complained and caused the incident” at the festival, Takagi said.This was enough to trigger the Sedition Act, police told Takagi.Meanwhile, the Real Singapore, one of a number of emerging citizen or crowdsourced journalist websites in Singapore, plans to keep publishing.“The mainstream media for itself is heavily censored by the government and then you won’t find dissenting voices and everything … looks very happy in the mainstream media,” Takagi said.“That’s one of the main reasons websites like the Real Singapore exist – because people feel that their voices are not actually being heard, which is why so many people are willing to send their opinions and complaints in because there isn’t the space for that in the mainstream media.”Many of the contributions to the Real Singapore related to “complaints about how certain policies have affected people’s lives. A lot of times it’s to do with their jobs.”“Definitely you can see that people are not really happy with a lot of the policies the government is putting out here,” she said. “It’s obviously not everybody but it’s a section of the population that are not heard.”She said newspapers tended to follow government announcements of policy by selectively interviewing people who were enthusiastically supportive without “the balance of [other] people saying this might be a problem”.Takagi described the Australian media landscape as “slightly more balanced”, with more outlets to represent competing views.
