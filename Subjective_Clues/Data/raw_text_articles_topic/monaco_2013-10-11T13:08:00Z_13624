Nicole Kidman is planning to produce and star in a film adaptation of The Silent Wife, the bestselling novel about a disintegrating marriage that drives a woman to murder.According to Deadline, Kidman's own company, Blossom Films, have optioned the novel, which would appear to offer a leading role tailor made for Kidman. Described in the Guardian as "ultimately, a frighteningly possible portrait of a marriage, of how things can slip so far without either party realising", The Silent Wife revolves around a wealthy woman who apparently overlooks her husband's infidelities. The Silent Wife, whose writer ASA Harrison died shortly before publication, was marketed heavily on its apparent similarity to another successful thriller, Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, which is itself on its way to the screen, with David Fincher directing Rosamund Pike in the lead role of Amy.
