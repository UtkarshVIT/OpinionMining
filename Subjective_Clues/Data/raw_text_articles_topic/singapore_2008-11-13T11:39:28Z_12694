Three white Bengal tigers mauled a zoo cleaner to death in Singapore today after the man jumped into a moat surrounding their enclosure, the zoo said.The tigers, which each weigh more than 100kg (220lb), pounced on Nordin bin Mondong, a 32-year-old Malaysian, according to Biswajit Guha, the Singapore Zoo's assistant director.Fellow zoo workers managed to distract the tigers and pull Nordin away, but he died on the way to a hospital, Guha said."A Malaysian contract worker jumped into the moat at the white tiger exhibit and was attacked by three white tigers," Guha said in a statement. "The worker tragically succumbed to his wounds."The zoo has temporarily closed the tiger exhibit and police are investigating the incident, Guha said.He did not say why Nordin jumped into the tigers' area.Bengal white tigers in the wild are found in South Asia, mostly in India.
