Journalists in Pakistan have agreed to reunite the three factions of their trades union, which separated some 36 years ago.The leaderships of all three splinter groups of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) have agreed to form a unified organisation, reports Dawn.Given that the country's journalists are under life-threatening pressures from a variety of paramilitary gangs, plus certain sections within Pakistan's security forces, the reunification makes sense.The PFUJ's break-up began after the 1977 imposition of martial law by the late General Zia-ul-Haq. A group of largely right-wing journalists immediately left the PFUJ to form PFUJ-Dastoor.The PFUJ also faced a setback last year when two groups, one led by Afzal Butt and another by Pervaiz Shaukat, went their separate ways after disputed elections.But Dawn reports that the representatives of the three factions - Afzal Butt, Pervez Shoukat and Idrees Bakhtiar - have signed a unity memorandum. Mazhar Abbas, a former president of the PFUJ, said: "Times are changing and now there is no alternative to unity."Idrees Bakhtiar said there was no major difference between the constitutions of the three factions. However, the three executive councils will need to give their approval to the deal agreed by their leaders. A final decision is expected on 30 August.The early signs, according to copies of emails copied to me, suggest there is enthusiastic grassroots support for the reunification.Source: Dawn
