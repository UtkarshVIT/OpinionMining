Almost 170 people have died in recent severe floods in North Korea, with a further 400 missing and more than 84,000 made homeless across the country, according to the state media.The official Korean Central News Agency said floods and a typhoon also displaced about 212,200 people and submerged more than 65,000 hectares (160,000 acres) of farmland between late June and the end of July.The flooding occurred after a severe drought and renewed concerns about North Korea's ability to feed its people. In June, the UN said two-thirds of the country's 24 million people were facing chronic food shortages.The UN World Food Programme announced on Friday the details of its first batch of emergency food aid to the country, although it did not state when it would arrive.The WFP said the emergency aid will provide the flood victims "with an initial ration of 400g of maize per day for 14 days".According to reports from the UN and Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency, the flooding has destroyed more than 45,000 hectares of farmland.A UN mission recently found considerable damage to maize, soybean and rice fields, the WFP said.A recent UN report classified 7.2 million of the population as "chronic poor", and said one in three children suffered from poor nutrition.
