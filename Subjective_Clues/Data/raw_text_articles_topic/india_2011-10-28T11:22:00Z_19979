I went to India in 2009 to watch the massive efforts taking place to wipe out polio from its remaining enclaves. What I saw, in Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, was pretty impressive - I wrote about it here.The photographer with whom I was working, Jean-Marc Giboux, went back recently to Bihar, the hardest region for the vaccinators to reach. This is the film of his visit, which offers hope that we may finish the job. India has not had a polio case now for nine months.
