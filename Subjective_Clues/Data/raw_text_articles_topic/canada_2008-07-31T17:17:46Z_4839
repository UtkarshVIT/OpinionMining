The passenger then severed the man's head with a large knife.Caton said other passengers raced from the bus, and that he and the driver held the door shut from the outside while awaiting police.He said the attacker calmly came to the front of the bus to show off the head.Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day called it a "horrific" incident, but did not discuss details of the attack, saying he did not want to jeopardise the investigation."We want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible, a full legal process, and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law," he said.
