Spain’s economy is growing at its fastest pace since before the global economic crisis in 2007, official figures showed on Thursday, boosting hopes that the eurozone is bouncing back, despite the ongoing turmoil in Greece.The expansion of Spain's economic activity has been driven by important structural reformsSpain, which received a €100bn (£73bn) bailout for its teetering banking sector in 2012, recorded a 0.9% increase in GDP in the first quarter of this year.The news underscored the growing divide between the fortunes of Greece and the other bailed-out eurozone countries, as Athens battles to meet its next repayment to the International Monetary Fund, due next week.Spain’s strong performance led analysts to suggest that the eurozone – where a €60bn-a-month quantitative easing programme was launched in March – could be set to outpace its rivals in 2015 as growth slows in the US and the UK.Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg bank, predicted that when the full data for member countries emerged over the next fortnight it was likely to show that the eurozone economy expanded by 0.4% in the first quarter, against 0.2% in the US and 0.3% in the UK.He said Spain’s recovery “shows that reforms work, it should help reduce unemployment much further and thus political fragility and it serves as a shining example to Greeks of what their country could have if its government finally returns to the path of virtue”. The Spanish unemployment rate remains very high, though, at 23%.

The government insisted that any problems were due to a technical glitch, but the spectacle of a queue of pensioners waiting outside the National Bank of Greece in Athens added to fears that the government may be caught in a cash crisis.Negotiations on unlocking bailout funds have resumed with the IMF and the European Union, after prime minister Alexis Tsipras reshuffled his team for the talks, sidelining controversial finance minister Yanis Varoufakis.Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers, issued a stern rebuke to Tsipras and his media-savvy colleagues: “I wish that less time would be given to interviews and more on extraordinarily conscientiously working on keeping Greece from the threatening abyss”.Ratings agency Moody’s claimed that the odds were shortening on Greece leaving the eurozone as the talks went on. Moody’s analyst Alastair Wilson said investors should not be complacent about the knock-on effects if Greece left the single currency area.“The direct impact might be limited because of Greece’s limited trade links and lower financial market exposure to Greece in other euro area countries. But its exit could nevertheless cause a confidence shock and disrupt government debt markets.” While Greece’s travails are continuing, the rest of the eurozone appears to be stepping back from the brink of a deflationary slump. Official inflation figures, published on Thursday, showed that prices were flat across the eurozone in April, after falling in March. Boosting inflation was one of the key motivations for launching QE.However, City analysts warned that the eurozone was not yet out of the woods. Timo del Carpio, of RBC Capital Markets, said: “There are still real risks associated with a prolonged period of low-but-positive inflation rates across the euro area, not least as it complicates the post-crisis adjustment process.”Spain’s impressive recovery may help to strengthen the hand of its government, led by prime minister Mariano Rajoy, in arguing that the country should stick to the path of spending cuts and economic reforms, instead of a Greek-style rejection of austerity.Rajoy, who must hold a general election by the end of the year, faces a tough challenge from the anti-austerity party, Podemos. He recently raised his government’s economic growth forecast for 2015 from 2.4% to 2.9%.
