Three years ago the Malacca straits were the world's most hazardous seas. Pirate attacks occurred almost weekly. Insurance premiums jumped on the 70,000 vessels that took 40% of the world's trade through the 550-mile conduit every year.Then Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia allocated considerable naval firepower for coordinated "aggressive patrols", starting in 2004. It paid dividends. This year, the International Maritime Bureau in Kuala Lumpur, which tracks shipping attacks worldwide, has noted only two attacks in the straits - down from 38 in 2004. The south-east Asian governments are fortunate in having no safe havens, in the form of failed states, where pirates can cosset hijacked ships. But Noel Choong, of the bureau, says: "The pirates aren't being detained, they're just lying low ... we maintain our piracy warning for the Malacca straits."The bureau is not complacent. It saw a piracy surge in the South China Sea this year as pirates emerged from the Anambas Islands, Indonesia, and patrols were tipped off. "I'm sure a lot of criminal syndicates are watching events in Somalia with great interest," says Choong. "The Somali pirates are making so much money and have been facing very low risk."Ramli Nik, of the Maritime Institute of Malaysia, thinks partnership in Asia is the key - more difficult for Somalia, he says, given the lack of cooperation of states around the Gulf of Aden.
