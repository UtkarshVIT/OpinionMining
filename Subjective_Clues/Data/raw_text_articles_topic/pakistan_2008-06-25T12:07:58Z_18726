Authorities in north-west Pakistan today said a local Taliban militia killed 22 members of a rival tribe and left their bodies dumped on a roadside.The bodies were discovered outside the town of Jandola, following their abduction earlier this week.About 27 people from a pro-government tribe were taken by militants loyal to notorious Taliban commander Baitullah Mehsud when they overran the town on Monday."Some have bullet wounds but there were some who were killed with knives," Barkatullah Marvat, the top government official in the region, told Reuters.The abducted men were members of the Bhittani tribe and belonged to a government-run group promoting peace."It was inevitable they would be killed because they were very active and they had an old tribal feud with the Mehsuds," the official said.Mehsud, a member of the south Waziristan tribe, has emerged as Pakistan's most feared militant over the past year.He has been linked to a string of suicide attacks across the country, including the December violence that killed the former prime-minister, Benazir Bhutto.Jandola is on the road to the south Waziristan Pashtun tribal region on the Afghan border. Residents said Mehsud's men had withdrawn from Jandola since Monday, fearing military reprisal, and handed over control to some allies from the Bhittani tribe.
