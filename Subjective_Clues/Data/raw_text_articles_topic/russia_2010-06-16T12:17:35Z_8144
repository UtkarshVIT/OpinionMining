Britain is to stop giving aid to China and Russia as part of a government plan to target financial help to the world's poorest nations, the development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, said today.Announcing a review into the 90 countries that currently share the £2.9bn a year dispensed by the UK in bilateral aid, Mitchell said the money should be spent where it did most good."For some countries, aid is a vital safety net that saves lives every day. UK money should be spent helping the poorest people in the poorest countries, with every penny making a real difference by giving families the chance of a better future," the development secretary said."It is not justifiable to continue to give aid money to China and Russia. Other country programmes which are less effective will be closed or reduced and the savings will be redirected towards those countries where they can make the most difference."China, the world's third biggest and fastest growing economy, received just over £40m a year from the UK in 2008-09. Russia, a member of the elite G8 group of developed nations, received £373,000.The government has ringfenced the Department for International Development from spending cuts and pledged to meet the legally binding target set by Labour of providing an aid budget of 0.7% of national output.Mitchell said he wanted redirected money to be spent on poverty reduction measures including programmes to improve maternal health, women's right to family planning and protection against deadly diseases such as malaria.The scrutiny of bilateral aid follows Mitchell's announcement last week that he will review how Britain's multilateral aid is spent by bodies such as the World Bank and the United Nations.Oxfam today said that Britain was the biggest single donor to the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) – a fund for the very poorest nations – but had no guarantees that the money was being spent on poverty reduction. The bank is currently negotiating a new round of IDA funding, seeking at least $25bn (£17bn) from rich countries."If the UK government is going to hand over money to the World Bank, it needs to make sure that the bank spends it on the poorest, and on helping countries reach the millennium development goals," said Elizabeth Stuart, Oxfam's head of relations with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. "That's just basic accountability."
