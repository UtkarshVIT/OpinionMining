In the city's canals and rivers, fish have been dying due to lack of oxygen.Hundreds of people have had to be rescued from dozens of overheated high-speed German trains in recent days after air conditioning systems broke down. It was discovered they were not designed to cope with temperatures higher than the mid-30s.Meteorologists have put the heatwave down to a zone of low pressure north of the UK and high pressure around the Mediterranean, which has pushed air from Africa across Europe.The conditions are expected to have a devastating effect on agriculture. Wheat crops in Germany were burnt in the heat and strawberries left rotting because they could not be picked fast enough.
