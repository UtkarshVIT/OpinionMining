Japan CO2 hits recordSource: ReutersJapan's greenhouse gas emissions rose to a record high in the year to March, putting the world's fifth-largest carbon dioxide producer at risk of an embarrassing failure to achieve its Kyoto target over the next four years. The increase of 2.3% last year, largely due to the closure of Japan's biggest nuclear power plant after an earthquake, will ratchet up the pressure for it to give up its efforts to control emissions through voluntary measures and adopt tougher limits on industry like the European Union and Australia.Global investors urge action on climate changeSource: ReutersGlobal institutional investors holding more than $6tr (Â£3.93tr) in assets pushed policymakers Tuesday to quickly hash out a binding agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean technology. More than 130 big investors, including London Pensions Fund Authority, want countries to agree to reduce the climate-warming emissions by 50% to 80% by 2050. Those numbers are in line with global warming policy favored by US president-elect Barack Obama, who supports an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by mid-century.Darwin's mockingbird threatened with extinctionSource: IndependentA mockingbird that sowed the seeds of evolution in the mind of Charles Darwin stands on the precipice of extinction, with no more than about 100 breeding pairs left alive in its home on the enchanted Pacific islands of the Galapagos Archipelago. The Floreana mockingbird is the unsung hero in the story of evolution. It played a pivotal role by making Darwin realise that species were not stable units but changing entities subject to the vagaries of competition and the forces of natural selection.Ancient migration routes of octopuses revealed by marine censusSource: Times OnlineCold Antarctic seas were the nursery for octopuses before they swam northwards to colonise deep waters around the world in a move that cost them their ink sacs, researchers have found. Deep sea octopuses were confined to the Southern Ocean until 33m years ago when global thermohaline circulation, the hugely powerful currents driven by heat and salinity, began.Fish farms among new chances for arid nationsSource: ReutersSolar energy, ecotourism and even fish farms can create new jobs in arid regions of developing nations as global warming strains scant water supplies, a UN report said on Tuesday. A four-year study of drylands in eight countries, ranging from China to Tunisia, showed that people could shift to less water-intensive farming and set up new businesses, sometimes helped by microcredits, to cope with climate change.Report calls for overhaul of power grid to handle renewablesSource: New York TimesAdding electricity from the wind and the sun could increase the frequency of blackouts and reduce the reliability of the nation's electrical grid, an industry report says. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation says in a report scheduled for release Monday that unless appropriate measures are taken to improve transmission of electricity, rules reducing carbon dioxide emissions by utilities could impair the reliability of the power grid.
