Japan goes to the polls on Sunday, in a snap election called by the prime minister Shinzo Abe. His Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are unlikely to lose the election, and instead the question is whether the LDP will increase its number of seats to help increase its mandate for the economic reforms introduced under Abe since 2012.A surprise fall into recession prompted the snap election. It is being framed - not least by the prime minister himself - as a referendum on “Abenomics”, the premier’s flagship economic policies of fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reform. “It’s an election that is asking voters whether to continue with Abenomics, or to put a stop to it,” he said.While it may be the economy, stupid, there are other issues bubbling under the surface, from Japan’s pacifist constitution to the future of the country’s nuclear power generation plants. Which is why we’re looking to you to help us build a picture of the country ahead of this surprise election. Where in Japan do you live, and what’s the mood there? Will you be voting in the election?
