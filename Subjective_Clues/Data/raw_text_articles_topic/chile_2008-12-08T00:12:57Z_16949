Italy (M&S, £5.99, down from £7.99) Bubbles are a ﬁne way to begin on Christmas day and these, from north-east Italy, are pink. Tinged with the suggestion of sugared raspberries and strawberries, they slip down very easily.Bio Bio Valley, Chile (Majestic, £5.99, down from £7.49 when you buy two Chilean wines) On the other hand, the cool, mineralic swoosh of this riesling, glittering with sharp citrus ﬂavours, from one of the much talked-about cooler climate areas in Chile, would make a lively aperitif and be a good match for canapes. Vin de Pays d'Oc, France (Waitrose, £4.39, down from £5.49) This creamy-textured wine is a good option if you're going to drink white with Christmas dinner because the richness the viognier brings works well with the fruity accompaniments, from the cranberries to the dried fruit in the stuffing.France (Asda, £4.08) Light red wines are good with a traditional Christmas spread. The brightness of the redberry ﬂavours acts like a chutney against the turkey and isn't wrong-footed by sharply astringent cranberry sauce. France (M&S, £5.99) Soft, smooth and unoaked, but ﬁlled with dark fruit ﬂavours, this wine, made from the fruit of old vines, is good with turkey and trimmings. It has intensity and juiciness but isn't heavy or dry with tannins that might only emphasise any dryness in the meat. France (£3.99 for 37.5cl, Sainsbury's) Dessert wines don't need to be as expensive as Sauternes: this one, with a gentle apricot taste and honeyed sweetness, is a bargain, and not so unctuous that you'll need a crane to lift you from the table after drinking it with Christmas pudding.
