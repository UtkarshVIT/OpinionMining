While British property prices continue their dispiriting tumble, speculators who look slightly further afield might find that there is still money to be made on development. According to Major General Barney White-Spunner, just back in the UK from his post commanding British forces in southern Iraq, the market in Basra is hot."Property prices have more than doubled since March. One house is going for £90,000, a threefold increase," White-Spunner said, citing the city's myriad attractions, such as newly-opened restaurants along the scenic corniche. With 30 civilian flights daily and a booming port, Basra is welcoming an influx of returning residents from the Iraqi diaspora, as well as foreigners – particularly Kuwaitis who come laden with oil money, driving prices up. Is Basra the new Monaco? And will you be moving there anytime soon?
