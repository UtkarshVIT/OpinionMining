A raid on the Paris offices of Auto Plus magazine has prompted a row over press freedom in France. Prosecutors seized computers and documents after a complaint by Renault that the magazine had published unauthorised pictures of one of the car maker's new models. Editor Laurent Chiapello said the raid allowed officials to "gain access to all our sources and that poses a real problem to our way of working independently." Two of the country's biggest journalists' unions have protested at the action. See also Gawker's comment. (Via Reuters)
