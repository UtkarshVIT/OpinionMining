With much of Mexico still reeling from the death, destruction and chaos caused by the impact of two tropical weather systems two days ago, forecasters are warning of more storms ahead.Tens of thousands of holidaymakers remain trapped in the resort city of Acapulco, so far the most visible victims of tropical storm Manuel that came in from the west on Monday, their frustration increasingly obvious in the long queues to get on the waiting lists for flights out of the city organised by the army and commercial airlines.Reports of rich families skipping the queues to take off in private jets threatened to further blacken the mood, as authorities urged tourists not to attempt to leave the city by land, with roads out expected to remain blocked by landslides until at least.Both in Acapulco and across the country, many thousands more have been forced out of their homes by both Manuel and hurricane Ingrid, which hit Mexico from the east almost simultaneously.The army and emergency services have been distributing food and water in shelters and the most devastated neighbourhoods, although reports are increasing of scarcity as well as panic buying and rapidly rising prices.The chaos has been accompanied by looting. Hundreds of people waded waste-deep through flood waters to ransack everything from toilet paper to personal computers from one Costco store in Acapulco.Meanwhile, the government raised the death toll to 57, with officials warning that it could increase further once communication is re-established. Many towns and villages are currently cut off by landslides and overflowing rivers. Adverse conditions continued to impede even information-gathering flights over some of these areas, giving rise to rumours that later faded such as 300 dead in one town.With emergency services stretched and desperation mounting, the remnants of Manuel regrouped into a tropical storm forecast to hit Mexico's north-west coaston Thursday . While this region was not badly affected by the earlier storms, the rainfall from the new storm is expected to spread into regions that were.A new tropical system has also formed in the south-east, although forecasters do not yet know if it is likely to roll into Mexico along a similar path to Ingrid, or perhaps head north to Texas or Louisiana in the US.
