For most of the 33 years since General Franco died the memories of his pernicious dictatorship have been swept under the carpet. Slowly that is changing. Now the process has gone 2.0, so to speak, with the public being asked to help identify the Rojo Archives - 3,000 poorly captioned photos showing the ruins of Madrid after the Franco bombardment.Whether you speak Spanish or not, you can browse the images to get an idea of the destruction.Along with the Archivo Rojo, the Museum of Historical Memory is due to open in Salamanca in 2011. [Here is a rough English translation of the story.] Wigs used to disguise a communist leader, censored poems and a list of prisoners to face the firing squad are among the artefacts likely to go on show from 157,000 boxes of archives. The boxes were saved by civil servants who ignored orders to destroy them.The archives are another step in Spain's remembering of its Franco years. After his death, Spain quietly got on with modernising itself. And it did it pretty successfully, despite the current economic dip.I've never heard my parents-in-law, who lived in Andalucia and Catalonia during the Franco years, talk about the 1936-39 civil war or what life was like in the following decades. Unlike, say, my grandparents who often evoked memories of wartime England.But in the past few years, things have begun to change. Local pressure from the relatives of people who disappeared has brought about the disinterment of mass graves.While the Spanish prime minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero - whose grandfather was shot by nationalist troops in the war - brought in the historical memories law making it easier, among other things, to remove Franco plaques and statues.
