After a heated recount of last month's mayoral election results in Chile, an electoral tribunal has determined that Maya Fernández Allende, the granddaughter of former president Salvador Allende, did not win the seat for the district of Ñuñoa as originally announced.The reversal, which has reignited decades-old enmities, came with an announcement on Tuesday that the incumbent mayor, Pedro Sabat, was the winner by the thinnest of margins – 30 votes out of an estimated 68,000 cast in the middle-class neighbourhood of Santiago.In the original vote count, Fernández Allende was credited with a 20-vote victory that appeared to have ended Sabat's 16 years in the post.Leaders of the Socialist party, of which Fernández Allende is an official candidate, have stated they will appeal to a higher electoral body over the ruling, but few political observers in Chile believe there will be any further change in the election results.Controversy erupted within days of Ñuñoa's election results as the slim margin of Fernández Allende's victory did not include two polling centres with minor discrepancies between the number of voters who showed up and the number of actual votes cast.Under Chilean election law a discrepancy, suggestive of either deliberate voter manipulation or bureaucratic incompetence, means the entire bloc of votes is invalidated. Lawyers for the rightwing National Renovation party appealed against that decision and the government electoral body authorised a recount.This year Chile is introducing a radical change in its voting system. Previously only registered voters could cast a ballot and they were required to do so, at times with threats of heavy fines.For the first time, in the October 2012 mayoral elections, all adults aged 18 and over were automatically registered. Equally significant, voting became voluntary.From the moment last month's elections were launched, chaos was evident on multiple fronts. Hundreds of voting supervisors – chosen randomly from computer generated lists – were paid $30, given a bag lunch and basically left to their own to figure out how to sort out the electoral process.The votes are marked by graphite pencils, which are far from indelible. And the lists of eligible voters were so scrambled that one list included former Chilean president Salvador Allende who shot himself as Pinochet troops invaded the Presidential Palace on 11 September 1973.Over the ensuing fortnight, comments on Facebook and Twitter had pro-Fernández-Allende and pro-right wing forces at each other's throats. The vitriol and hatred of the comments leave little doubt that, even after 40 years, the wounds of the Pinochet and Allende years remain painful and have yet to heal.
