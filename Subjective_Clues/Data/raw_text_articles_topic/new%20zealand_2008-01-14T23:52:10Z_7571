The men, both from Sydney, set off in their small fibreglass craft on November 13 in an attempt to become the first Australians to "cross the ditch" by kayak. They had hoped to reach New Zealand before Christmas but strong winds and ocean currents forced them to go round in circles, adding an extra 600 miles and 20 days to the journey. As a result, the first Australians to do the crossing in a kayak were a crew of four who did it in the other direction, reaching Sydney on December 30.Encountering swells of more than 30ft, the men described the conditions at sea as "like being bounced around in a washing machine". Lack of sleep also took its toll and towards the end of the trip they were reduced to eating only once a day.A final effort aided by good weather conditions got them to New Zealand where they were applauded by other kayakers and given a Maori welcome as they stepped ashore."We're so, so happy. It's really required every single bit of motivation, brain power and willpower to make it happen," said Castrission.Both men paid tribute to another Australian kayaker Andrew McCauley who died during a solo attempt at the same crossing last year.
