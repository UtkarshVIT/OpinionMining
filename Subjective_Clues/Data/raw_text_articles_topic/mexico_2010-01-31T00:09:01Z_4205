On Christmas Eve in Mexico I tried to pay a restaurant bill with my Capital­ One card. The terminal rejected the card three times. I persuaded the manager to phone the bank. After 45 minutes answering security questions,­ he got irate. He accused me of wasting their time. At 1am he called the police, who took my passport and driving licence and escorted me to my hotel. I phoned Capital One. It said the card was fine and it was the restaurant's problem. Police took me to a cash machine to pay the bill. I moved on to Los Angeles where I discovered another restaurant bill in Mexico had been charged twice to my credit card. Capital One said I had to sort it out with the restaurant, even though I was now in the US. SK, BrightonCapital One has listened to your phone calls and apologises for poor service. It says the restaurant's card terminal was issuing invalid authorisation requests and blames the manager's poor English for failing to sort it out. It admits it should have accepted the language problem sooner, and told you to use a different method of paying.It also apologies for not being more helpful when you phoned about the duplicate charge. It has refunded the overpayment, refunded the cost of the international calls and offered you £100 compensation for the distress.• Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
