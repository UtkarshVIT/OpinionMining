A Japanese woman who was allegedly abducted by North Korean agents more than 30 years ago is alive and could soon be allowed to meet her family.The unexpected move, reported by Japanese media today, offers hope to the families of other Japanese nationals who were taken to North Korea in the 1970s and 80s to teach their language and customs to spies.Tokyo claims that 17 of its citizens were abducted at the height of the cold war as the communist state attempted to nurture a generation of agents that could operate inside Japan without attracting suspicion.In 2002 North Korea admitted abducting 13 Japanese citizens and allowed five to return home later that same year. It said the eight others had died. The remaining four on Japan's list had never entered the country, said Pyongyang.The woman at the centre of the reports, Kyoko Matsumoto, was 29 when she went missing on her way to a knitting class near her home in Tottori, western Japan, in September 1977.Though Pyongyang denies any knowledge of her alleged abduction, the Kyodo news agency reported that Matsumoto, now married, is living in North Korea and works alongside an unidentified Japanese couple who may also have been abducted.Her brother, Hajime, said he had been given the information last month by a Chinese businessman with trading interests in North Korea. Their meeting in Tokyo was arranged by a group campaigning for the return of the abductees.Hajime said a woman believed to be Kyoko Matsumoto had passed a message to the Chinese contact that included personal details only his sister could have known."Say hello to Ina-chan for me," she reportedly said, an apparent reference to a woman with whom she worked before her abduction.The contact told Hajime that North Korean officials were planning to arrange the first meeting for 31 years between his sister, now 60, and her family in Japan."It has become increasingly likely that Kyoko is still alive," Hajime told the news agency. "It is hard to tell how reliable the information is but I would go and meet her if asked."The Japanese government said it was taking the report seriously. "If the information is true we will try to resolve it through diplomatic channels," the foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone, said in a TV interview.Five of the abductees were allowed to return to Japan in October 2002 after a landmark summit in Pyongyang between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, and the then Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi.The abductees included Hitomi Soga, wife of the US deserter Charles Jenkins, who joined her in Japan with their two daughters in 2004.The best-known of those Japan believes are still in North Korea is Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she disappeared on her way home from school in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, in November 1977.North Korea said Yokota, who married a North Korean with whom she had a daughter, now 21, had committed suicide in 1994 while being treated in a psychiatric hospital for depression. Japan refuses to believe the claim and DNA tests on "remains" North Korea said belonged to Yokota proved inconclusive.Her plight, and her parents' high-profile campaign for her return, have kept the abductions near the top of the domestic political agenda for six years.Last month, Japan's new prime minister, Taro Aso, vowed to do all he could to bring the abductees home. "Without a resolution there can be no normalisation of relations," he said. "What we are waiting for is action by North Korea. Thirty years have passed, and this is a battle against time."But Japan, a member of the six-party talks on the North's nuclear weapons programme, now risks losing diplomatic traction in its bid to resolve the abduction issue.It created tension between Japan and the US last month when Washington removed North Korea from its list of states that sponsor terrorism. That move came hours after the regime agreed to resume dismantling its nuclear facilities and allow visits by international inspectors.The US said it had removed North Korea – once a member of George Bush's axis of evil – from the terror list to breathe life into the stalled nuclear negotiations and would continue to pressure Pyongyang to resolve the abduction issue.Japan refuses to normalise diplomatic ties or provide aid until the matter is settled, just as the US, China, Russia and South Korea are considering resuming energy assistance amid progress on the nuclear issue. Under a 2007 agreement, North Korea stands to receive a million tons of fuel oil in return for abandoning its plutonium-based nuclear programme. According to a Japanese newspaper report, the North has decided to cancel another investigation into the abductions because it sees no diplomatic mileage in doing so. Earlier this week it also threatened to adopt an "ultra-hard line" against Japan unless it dropped the issue and relaxed sanctions.North Korea's abduction programme is one of the most bizarre episodes of the East Asian cold war. It abducted more than a dozen Japanese men and women between 1977 and 1983.Most of the victims were employed teaching Japanese to spies, while older abductees were rumoured to have been killed and their identities adopted by agents working inside Japan.There are unsubstantiated claims that others were murdered after stumbling on North Korean agents operating on Japanese soil.The first abduction came seven years after members of the Japanese Red Army hijacked a Japan Airlines passenger jet and forced it to land in Pyongyang, where the hijackers were granted political asylum.After years of inaction by the Japanese government, the abductees' plight became a cause celebre in 2002 after Megumi Yao, the wife of a Red Army hijacker, told a court she had tricked one of the abductees, Keiko Arimoto, into flying to Pyongyang.Arimoto, who married another Japanese abductee, was studying in England when she was approached by Yao.The National Association for the Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea, a pressure group with links to rightwing politicians, believes that the regime abducted as many as 100 Japanese citizens.It claims that citizens were also seized from more than 10 other countries, including South Korea, Romania and Thailand.
