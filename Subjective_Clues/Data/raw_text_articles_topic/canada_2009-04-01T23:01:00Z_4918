Mark Twain once exclaimed of a winter: "Cold! If the thermometer had been an inch longer we'd all have frozen to death." That just about sums up what life is like for the inhabitants of The Pole of Cold in eastern Siberia, the coldest inhabited region of the world. A record low of -71.2C (-96.2F) was logged at the village of Oymyakon in January 1926. The inhabitants there regularly use fires under the fuel tanks of their diesel cars and trucks to prevent the fuel from freezing solid. And because water freezes in outdoor pipes, all water supplies are trucked in by tankers.Spitting into the freezing air can be quite an experience. As Jack London related in his story... To Build a Fire, about a man trying to survive in the Yukon in Canada: "He spat speculatively. There was a sharp, explosive crackle that startled him." A similar experience was reported by two weather observers at Snag airport in the Yukon when the temperature sank to -63C (-81F) on 3 February 1947. They, too, saw spit and liquid water freeze solid before hitting the ground. "We threw a dish of water high into the air, just to see what would happen. Before it hit the ground, it made a hissing noise, froze, and fell as tiny round pellets of ice the size of wheat kernels." There was little danger of the men becoming lost, because their breath left behind a trail of frozen fog in the air for 15 minutes.
