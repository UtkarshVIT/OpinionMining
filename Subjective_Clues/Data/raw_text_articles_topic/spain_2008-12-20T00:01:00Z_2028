Grappling with rising unemployment and a moribund economy, the Spanish government proposed new rules yesterday to limit the influx of immigrants. The measures would let police hold immigrants without papers for longer pending expulsion and make it harder for foreign-born residents to bring relatives over.A few years ago Spain was Europe's top job creator. In 2005 it granted amnesty to 600,000 illegal immigrants, many of whom worked as labourers in the booming property sector. But the economy is on the verge of recession and unemployment has soared to 11.3%. Among immigrants the jobless rate surpasses 17%.The labour minister, Celestino Corbacho, said the government must limit immigrants so as not to swell the ranks of the unemployed. "Immigration has to be linked to the labour market," he said.The plans will go before government advisory bodies, then to parliament for debate and a vote next year. About 4.3 million foreigners live in Spain legally, about 10% of its population. The government has no figure for those without papers.One measure would raise from 40 to 60 the number of days that police can hold people caught entering illegally. Many Africans arrive without passports so they cannot be identified. After 40 days the government is forced to release them.
