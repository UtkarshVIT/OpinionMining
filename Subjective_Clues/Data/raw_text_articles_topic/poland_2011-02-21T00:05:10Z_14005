Your article (Polish MEP and gay rights critic fights to lead David Cameron's allies in Europe, 17 February) caricatures MEP Ryszard Legutko in a deeply unfair manner. Prof Legutko is a greatly respected intellectual figure in Poland. As a former deputy president of the senate and minister of education, he has been known for his ideological moderation and his efforts to reach consensus. His moral views are generally shared by the representatives of Christian Democracy in Europe. You also refer to the professor's book Why I Am Not Tolerant. This is a collection of short flippant pieces on modern life, not a political statement. For his view on tolerance you should consult his scholarly work, including his major work on toleration debate in early modern Europe.Tomasz Poreba MEPDeputy chairman, Law and Justice delegation in the European parliament
