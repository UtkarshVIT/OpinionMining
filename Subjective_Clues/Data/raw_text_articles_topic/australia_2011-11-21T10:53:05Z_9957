After successful stints in the West End and on Broadway, War Horse will open in Australia next year.The production will run at the Arts Centre's State theatre in Melbourne in late 2012 with a local cast playing both humans and horses.War Horse, based on Michael Morpurgo's novel of the same name, premiered in 2007 at the National theatre. The Australian production will be produced by Global Creatures, the company behind Walking with Dinosaurs – The Arena Spectacular and the forthcoming production of King Kong: Live on Stage, set to open in 2013.Premier of Victoria Ted Baillieu told the Age that the show's arrival in Melbourne would confirm the city's status as "the theatre capital of Australia".He continued, "Melbourne's and Victoria's reputation as a world centre for theatre will be further enhanced by the War Horse partnership between the Victorian Major Events Company, the Arts Centre, Australian producers Global Creatures and the National theatre."Carmen Pavlovic, CEO of Global Creatures, said: "We expect War Horse to have a great resonance in this country, not only because of our connection to world war one but because themes of the land, loss and the ultimate triumph of friendship have a special place in the Australian psyche.''War Horse is fast becoming the National theatre's cash cow. In October, the theatre announced the production had brought in £13.9 million in the last financial year, which ended before its official opening on Broadway. That production, in turn, sold in excess of 240,000 tickets in its first four months, with more than 1.4 million people having seen the production in London.
