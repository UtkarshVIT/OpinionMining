Suicide bombers are said to have killed at least five people and wounded dozens more in almost simultaneous attacks on two cities in Pakistan.A leading anti-Taliban Muslim cleric died in the blast at a religious school in the eastern city of Lahore while a suicide bomber in a pick-up truck set off explosives at a mosque and reportedly destroyed its roof in the north-western garrison town of Nowshera.The attacks, which came soon after Friday prayers, were the latest in a wave of suicide bombings and other incidents mounted in response to military operations against the Taliban in the Swat valley and elsewhere. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the explosions.A moderate cleric, Sarfraz Naeemi, who had issued a fatwa against suicide bombings, died in the Lahore explosion, which destroyed offices in the seminary. Television station al-Jazeera reported that a lone suicide attacker entered the school before detonating the bomb near the cleric.The cleric's brother, Tajwar Naeemi, said seven people were wounded in the attack. "When I came out of the office a few people went in and the suicide bomber was probably among them," he told Reuters.In Nowshera the explosion at the mosque within a military cantonment is said to have killed at least three people and injured more than 100, with more fatalities feared. The roof of the mosque, where both military personnel and civilians are thought to have been worshipping, collapsed, said al-Jazeera.
