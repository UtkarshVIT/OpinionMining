Canada's prime minister had a narrow escape from being the first leader of a major industrialised country to lose his job because of the economic crisis.Stephen Harper, who leads a conservative minority government, took the extraordinary step of seeking the suspension of parliament until next January to head off a confidence vote he was bound to lose. The country's governor general granted his request on Thursday.Harper is now under immense pressure to show he can deliver economic relief when parliament resumes on January 26.He has said his "first order of business" will be a new budget that he hopes will satisfy the Liberal and New Democratic Party opponents who wanted to vote him out.But it could be a struggle for Harper to come up with an economic plan that will satisfy his political opposition or Canadian voters. New figures today showed Canada suffering its worst month of job losses since 1982, raising the unemployment rate to 6.3%. Ontario, the country's largest province and its manufacturing base, was especially hard hit.Meanwhile, the Canadian-based arm of Chrysler has said it is seeking a $1.5bn government bail-out to keep it from shutting operations.After producing an economic plan last week that contained no stimulus measures but that would defund Canada's political parties, news reports today said the conservative leader is looking to aid the auto industry as part of a broader rescue plan.Other measures that could satisfy the opposition include more infrastructure spending on transit and waterworks; money for housing construction and retrofitting; aid for manufacturers and forestry companies; and eased employment-insurance restrictions.The political damage to Harper may not be lasting. An opinion poll conducted for the national broadcaster CBC before Canada's political drama came to a head, today showed Harper on 44% support, a rise on the 37% he won in the elections last October.The prime minister was also more trusted on the economy than his main opponent, the Liberal leader St√©phane Dion.Another poll for The Globe and Mail newspaper also showed a majority of Canadians wanted Harper to stay on, but 55% felt the country was on the wrong track.
