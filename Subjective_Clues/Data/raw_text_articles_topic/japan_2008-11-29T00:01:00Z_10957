Even the chaste Japanese film industry wasn't immune to the sexual revolution of the 1960s. In fact, once the bug had bitten, they went further, quicker than Europe or the US. The films here are charged with eroticism but also laced with artistry, politics and cultural commentary. A Woman Called Sada Abe delivers a different take on the tale that inspired Oshima's In The Realm Of The Senses, while Blue Film Woman and Woods Are Wet should satisfy the more extreme tastes.â€¢ BFI Southbank, SE1, Mon 1 to Dec 30
