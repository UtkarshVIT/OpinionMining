After the Fukushima nuclear disaster caused by last year's earthquake and tsunami, all 50 of Japan's working nuclear reactors were turned off.The decision was taken to take the reactors offline to complete routine maintenance. As a result the country has been without nuclear power since 5 May this year – the first time since 1970, when the then reactors were shut for maintenance for five days.Remarking on the decision in June to turn the Ohi reactor back on, the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said: "Cheap and stable electricity is vital. If all the reactors that previously provided 30% of Japan's electricity supply are halted, or kept idle, Japanese society cannot survive."Supporters of the restart have warned that, without nuclear power, utilities would be more dependent on fossil fuels, driving up electricity bills and putting Japan's climate change obligations at risk.On Sunday the Ohi nuclear plant's reactor No 3 was restarted, despite protests from anti-nuclear activists and concerns from the Japanese public over the safety of nuclear power since Fukushima.Are the protesters' concerns valid? Would Japan be able to operate without nuclear power? We asked Twitter followers of @guardian for their reaction, but we want to hear more:@guardianThe country managed last summer when the reactors were down, they could manage again this year, but that wouldn't please the CEOs.— Matthew Loten (@intheinaka) July 2, 2012@guardian whether you are in #Japan or not, a nuclear meltdown sucks. But if you don't have that electricity, how can they meet the demand?— Kai Kurihara (@kaikurihara) July 2, 2012This is the thread for you to share your views on the restarting of the Ohi reactor and the debate over nuclear power, especially if you are living or working in Japan.
