While I am accustomed to the hyperbole of pro-Palestinian spokesmen, I found the comment of Ernest Rodker (Letters, 16 May) that Israel is "one of the most vindictive and oppressive governments in the Middle East" strained readers' credulity. We read of civilians being killed by government forces daily in Syria – perhaps Mr Rodker has other sources of information, but I am not aware of deaths on a similar scale in Israel. Most readers are aware that women in Saudi Arabia struggle for equality – in Israel women are prominent as politicians, judges etc.In most other states in the Middle East, minorities, such as the Copts in Egypt, are hardly able to complain at mistreatment – in Israel Palestinian spokesmen like Sheikh Raed Salah sit in the Knesset and propound their opinions, even supporting Hamas's policy that Israel should itself cease to exist. In view of these facts, how can anyone take seriously Mr Rodker's claim?Martin D SternSalford
