A court annulled Greece's only two same-sex marriages, officials said today, after a backlash from the government and religious leaders. The two couples‚ one male, one female‚ used a loophole in a law that did not specify gender in civil weddings, and were married last June by the mayor of the Aegean sea island of Tilos. The government declared the marriages illegal and a court in nearby Rhodes annulled the marriages on Mondayyesterday. Both couples said they would appeal, and one of the women, Evangelia Vlami, said she was prepared to take her case to the European court of human rights. Associated Press in Athens
