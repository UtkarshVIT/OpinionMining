Melanie Martin is a chatty 11 year old with an annoying brother and two clever parents. The whole family are going on a trip to Spain. Melanie's mum's old boyfriend Antonio is there to greet everyone in Spain. Antonio has a son called Miguel (let's just say Melanie has an interest in him!). Throughout the trip Melanie keeps a diary of her trip so far.Carol Weston has some cool characters. My favourite character was Melanie she is made really realistic by Carol by the way she speaks, her attitude and personality. I think you will enjoy this book if you are going to go to Spain in the summer or are 11 yourself or as just an easy read. Overall it was an alright book. For mostly girls but I think a boy could read the book too. Want to tell the world about a book you've read? Join the site and send us your review!
