Almost 100 alleged Cosa Nostra "godfathers" and rank-and-file mobsters were arrested today in an operation that Italy's chief anti-mafia prosecutor said had smashed an attempt to reconstitute the crime syndicate's "high command".More than 1,200 paramilitary carabinieri took part in the raids, which included operations in the sedate, prosperous region of Tuscany. Helicopter and dog-handling units were also used as part of Operation Perseus – an allusion to the hero of Greek mythology who decapitated the gorgon Medusa.Pietro Grasso, the head of the national anti-mafia prosecution service, said an extensive operation in June 2006 had brought the Cosa Nostra "to its knees"."With Operation Perseus, we have stopped it from rising up again, by cutting off all the strategic, thinking heads of a new command structure that was meant to have deliberated, as in the past, on serious matters."What sort of "serious matters" the new body was being set up to decide is not yet clear. Little has been heard of Cosa Nostra's top decision-making body, known as the Provincial Commission, since the early 1990s when the Sicilian mafia embarked on a full-scale war of terror aimed at the Italian state. Under the leadership of Salvatore "Totò" Riina, known as The Animal, the Cosa Nostra assassinated the country's two most expert anti-mafia prosecutors and bombed targets on the mainland.The other unresolved issue is who was intended to lead the new provincial commission. One Italian media report today quoted an investigator as saying the inquiry that led to the raids had revealed the existence of a "tough and dangerous conflict" within Cosa Nostra over the appointment.The last undisputed capo di tutti i capi or "boss of bosses" was Bernardo Provenzano, arrested two years ago. The most senior mobster still at large is thought by investigators to be 46-year-old Matteo Messina Denaro, the so-called "playboy Godfather", who has a reputation for living life in the fast lane. But Messina Denaro is from Trapani, outside the province of Palermo from which all the mafia's previous leaders have been recruited.Residents in some areas of Palermo, the regional capital, and of at least two nearby towns woke up this morning to find themselves under virtual siege by heavily armed carabinieri. One said the scenes recalled those of 20-odd years ago when prosecutors ordered police into action on the basis of the first disclosures made by so-called 'pentiti' (mafiosi who start to collaborate with police).On this occasion, however, the key evidence was said by investigators to have come, not from supergrasses, but listening devices.Several hundred searches were carried. Among the charges levelled at the 99 alleged mafiosi arrested this morning were extortion, arms trafficking and drugs trafficking.It was widely believed that Cosa Nostra had been forced by rival Italian mafia groups to take a subsidiary role in the import of narcotics, and particularly cocaine. But evidence gathered during the investigation reportedly suggested that the Sicilian mafia remained active in international trafficking.
