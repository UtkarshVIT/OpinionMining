Japan's economy shrank at record pace in the last quarter amid a collapse in exports and spending cuts by businesses and consumers.Its gross domestic product shrank at an annual pace of 15.2% in the January-March period, the cabinet office said today, the steepest fall since records began in 1955 and the fourth straight quarter of decline.The data may force the prime minister, Taro Aso, to delay a general election until the autumn after a series of stimulus packages showed little sign of boosting domestic demand.Aso conceded that poor corporate spending had now been joined by belt-tightening among households, forced to behave cautiously by cuts in wages and overtime, and rising unemployment."This is a very serious situation and we need to respond accordingly," he told reporters.Although Japan has often boasted it will be the first developed nation to emerge from recession, today's figures show its economy is performing badly compared with those of the eurozone, which shrank by 2.5% in the last quarter, and the US, where the contraction was 1.6%.Japan is being disproportionately punished for its huge industrial base, the driving force behind an export-led economy that has been battered by a collapse in demand in the US, Europe and China. Exports fell a record 26% in the first three months of the year compared with the previous quarter, the government said.Its export woes are being mirrored by a slowdown in spending at home. Business investment in factories and equipment fell by 10.4% from the last quarter, while consumer spending dropped 1.1%.The news is not all bad, however. The decline in exports is slowing and firms are managing to trim their once bloated inventories of cars and consumer electronics. It is too early to gauge the full impact of the most recent $150bn (Â£97bn) stimulus package, which includes incentives for consumers to buy green gadgets and cars.The economy minister, Kaoru Yosano, said: "While the economy will continue to be in a severe state, I expect less pressure from inventory adjustments and the stimulus package to provide support."Some economists predict the world's second biggest economy will record positive growth this quarter, followed by a marked improvement towards the end of the summer as exporters benefit from an anticipated recovery in China, a huge market for Japanese goods."From the April-June quarter, GDP is likely to turn positive mainly due to an expected recovery in Japan's exports led by demand from Asia," Kyohei Morita, the chief economist at Barclays Capital Japan, told Reuters."Also, Japan's stimulus measures are expected to be felt from that quarter, and consumer spending is likely to show plus figures and public investment is expected to increase."
