So Israel vows to keep building homes in illegally occupied East Jerusalem (Report, 19 November). Today the British security corporation G4S and the French company Veolia, which collects waste for UK local authorities and universities, will stand accused of complicity in Israeli human rights violations. Israeli academic Dalit Baum will give evidence in London to a tribunal on Palestine that G4S is aiding her country's war crimes by providing equipment for checkpoints, prisons and illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank. Moreover, Adri Neiuwhof, a Swiss-based expert on public contract regulations, will cite Veolia's profits from the occupation as a partner in the Jerusalem light rail project that links west Jerusalem to settlements.The tribunal, named after the philosopher Bertrand Russell, will hear from witnesses from Israel, Palestine, Britain, the US and mainland Europe, who will testify before a jury including UK barristers Anthony Gifford QC, and Michael Mansfield QC. Whatever the jury's verdict on Monday, world leaders must act to ensure a just peace in the region.Stephane HesselArchbishop Desmond TutuKen Loach Mark Thomas Jeremy Irons Alice Walker John Berger Juliet Stevenson John Pilger Miriam Margolyes Ilan Pappe Saffron Burrows Paul Laverty Colin Salmon Ghada Karmi Karma Nabulsi
