Pakistan's supreme court has paved the way for the dismissal of prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf less than two months after his predecessor was ousted for disobeying the court under identical circumstances.Further inflaming chronic political instability, the court on Wednesday summoned Ashraf to appear on 27 August to explain his refusal to obey its demand that he ask authorities in Switzerland to reopen a money-laundering inquiry against the president, Asif Ali Zardari.The move represents an almost exact rerun of the political and legal saga involving the former prime minister Yousef Raza Gilani, who resisted the demands for months before finally being given a token 30-second jail term by the supreme court.The conviction was enough, after yet more legal wrangling, to force him to stand down from parliament and the premiership in June. The court's demands imperil the hopes of the government, led by the Pakistan People's party, to survive until the end of the year and become the first in the country's history to serve a full five-year term.
