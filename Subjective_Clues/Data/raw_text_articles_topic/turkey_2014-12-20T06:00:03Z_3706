Michelle Obama’s diet has been scrutinised since her husband took office, and more so since she started campaigning to improve American children’s diets. She often breakfasts on turkey sausages (with scrambled eggs, and a grapefruit). They are hard to find in the UK, so try these patties instead.Makes eight Mix 500g turkey mince with 1 tsp fresh, finely chopped sage; 1 tbsp fresh, finely chopped parsley; a pinch of fennel seed, crushed; ¾ tsp black pepper; a generous pinch of nutmeg; ½ tsp salt; ½ tsp smoked hot or sweet paprika; a crushed clove of garlic (optional); 1 heaped tbsp wholegrain mustard. Over a medium heat, fry a small piece of the mix in a knob of butter – taste and check for seasoning, adding more spice, herbs or mustard if you like. Divide into eight 1cm-thick patties and cook for three minutes a side, until browned and cooked through. Serve with scrambled eggs.• Follow Rebecca on Twitter.
