The Swiss canton of Uri is more used to holidaymakers flocking to see its stunning Alpine vistas and the statue, in the capital Altdorf, dedicated to national hero William Tell.But the diminutive state could be readying itself for a different kind of influx next year after it was claimed to be the subject of a DVD, also featuring fellow cantons Geneva and Zurich, that is being circulated in the City. It is claimed the cantons are trying to poach disaffected London bankers who may be looking for a fresh start in a country where bonuses attract less scrutiny – and, crucially, lower levels of tax.The DVD's existence could not be verified today, but one could hazard a guess at the contents. While it is likely to highlight opportunities for dog sledding, mountain biking and cable car rides in the environs of Altdorf, even the canton's official tourism website carries a special section highlighting the "attractive tax conditions". The website suggests a Uri-based banker who earns around £180,000, would attract income tax at rate of just 11%. It also flags that tax applied to an individual's savings is one of the lowest rates in Switzerland at 0.001%.The generous regime also allows qualifying "resident aliens" to pay income tax as a one-off sum that is based on living expenses.There is nothing new in the attractions of Switzerland as a financial centre, given its benevolent tax laws and reputation for discretion. However, the industry has begun to branch out from traditional centres such as Geneva and Zurich to quieter spots such as Pfaffikon, a small Swiss town on the shores of lake Zurich. Pfaffikon has become a mecca for hedge funds including Man Group, which also has a base there.With 1,000 investment bankers already estimated to have resigned from state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland alone, movement has already begun in the sector. Bankers are said to follow the deals and experts predict America, the Middle-East and China would also be high on the list for those without family ties to the UK.It remains to be seen whether they heed the Swiss siren call – as Uri's website puts it: "See you soon in Uri."
