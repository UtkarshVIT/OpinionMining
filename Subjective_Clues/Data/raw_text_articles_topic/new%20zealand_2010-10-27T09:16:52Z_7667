In The Hobbit, JRR Tolkien's much-loved fantasy tale, a group of adventurers sets out to retrieve a long-lost treasure trove from a cunning dragon. Earlier today, the New Zealand film industry was celebrating the restoration of its own financial fortunes after it was confirmed that the forthcoming big-screen adaptations will be shot in the country after all.Prime Minister John Key emerged from two days of talks with executives from Hollywood studio Warner Bros – who had flown all the way to Wellington to reassure themselves that a row over pay and conditions with a local union was not a sign that New Zealand was becoming an "unstable" location – to confirm that The Hobbit film would be brought to life in the same location as The Lord of the Rings."I am delighted we have achieved this result," Key said. "Making the movies here will not only safeguard work for thousands of New Zealanders, but will also allow us to follow the success of The Lord of the Rings."The successful talks followed street protests across New Zealand on Monday by thousands concerned the country could lose out on a production whose predecessors made it seem a viable location for big-budget films. There was no indication of whether ministers had been forced to offer financial incentives to assuage Hollywood fears, though Key had earlier indicated this was unlikely to occur. He did, however, raise the possibility of changing union laws to ensure the row between film-maker Peter Jackson and the New Zealand Actors' Equity union, which almost caused the country to lose the films, was unlikely to be repeated.Economists had said the loss of the production could cost the country's film industry as much as $1.5bn and damage it in the long term, though many felt a move to a new site was unlikely given that sets for key locations such as Hobbiton remained in New Zealand. The union boycott – backed by bodies across the globe – was resolved last week, but producers were talking up the possibility of moving the production to the UK, Australia, Canada or eastern Europe as late as Thursday.Jackson will return to direct the new films, with The Office star Martin Freeman set to portray the title character, Bilbo Baggins – a homely Hobbit who in Tolkien's tale is bamboozled into joining a thrilling adventure by a wizard named Gandalf. Richard Armitage, of BBC TV series Spooks, will play the role of Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the dwarves.Filming on the two-part adaptation is due to start in February, with releases pencilled in for December 2012 and December 2013.
