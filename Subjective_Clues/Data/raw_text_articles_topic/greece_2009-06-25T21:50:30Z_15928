The family of two children who died on holiday in Greece have criticised the travel firm Thomas Cook for prolonging their wait for justice by eight months.Paul Wood, stepfather of Christianne Shepherd, seven, and her brother Robert, six, accused the firm of playing "legal games" with the memories of the children after a trial due to start in Corfu on Thursday was adjourned until February next year.The trial was postponed at the request of three defendants, including one of two Thomas Cook reps due to face charges of negligence leading to manslaughter. The children, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, died in October 2006 when carbon monoxide fumes leaked from a next-door room into the bungalow apartment where they slept.The children's father Neil Shepherd, and his partner Ruth Beatson both fell into comas and were admitted to hospital.Wood said: "Thomas Cook led us to believe they wouldn't request for the case to be adjourned. Therefore they continue to play legal games. They continue to play these games with the memory of our children Christi and Bobby and we find this extremely disrespectful."The defendants, including reps Richard Carson, 27, and Nicola Gibson, 25, are accused of causing manslaughter by negligence and of causing bodily injury by negligence to Shepherd and Beatson.Ten Greeks, including staff from the Louis Corcyra Beach hotel in Gouvia, where the family were staying, were also due to be tried.A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said it had "no desire" to see the trial delayed but that a lawyer for one of the defendants had been summoned to another court at short notice. She added: "We are confident that our colleagues acted properly and should not be blamed in any way."
