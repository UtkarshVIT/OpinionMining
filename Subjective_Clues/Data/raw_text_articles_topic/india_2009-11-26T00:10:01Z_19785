India's army is the second largest in the world, but its security forces were left flailing by the Mumbai attacks.Fifteen policemen were killed and, according to reports, others simply abandoned their posts. Some officers who confronted the attackers were armed only with canes.One senior officer was shot dead even though he was wearing a bullet-proof vest: the armour was so old it came apart in the volley of bullets. The raid left the force, in the words of one policeman, "demoralised and looking like we could not take a bullet".The response of the authorities has been to beef up security, with armed guards in public areas and doorway metal detectors in stations and hotels. But at the main railway terminal commuters still dodge security checks and bags are not searched. The new police commissioner, D Sivanandan, appointed in June, says he has a "mission to motivate" and has bought troop carriers, amphibious craft and an arsenal of 2,000 heavy weapons including machine guns and high-velocity sniper rifles. Another 1,000 men have been deployed in anti-terror quick response squads. He has also asked for 4,800 new security cameras to cover the city's hot spots. "We have to accept a terrorist attack can happen anywhere," said Sivanandan. "London, Madrid, New York. We are not perfect. In the west you have better homeland security, but you spend a lot more money. We are inching towards perfection."His ultimate boss, however, India's home minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, was more circumspect. Last month he said: "My assessment of the vulnerability is that it has remained the same since 26/11."
