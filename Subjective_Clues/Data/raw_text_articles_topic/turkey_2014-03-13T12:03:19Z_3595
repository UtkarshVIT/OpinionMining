Two people have died during protests across cities in Turkey, following the funeral of Berkin Elvan, in Istanbul on Wednesday. Fifteen-year-old Berkin was hit by a police teargas canister during anti-government demonstrations last year and he died on Tuesday. Many readers shared photos and videos of last June’s protests with GuardianWitness. If you took part then – or are participating in the demonstrations now – we would like to hear from you. You can share photos and videos or tell us how you feel about the situation. Has anything changed for you since last year, stayed the same or got worse?
