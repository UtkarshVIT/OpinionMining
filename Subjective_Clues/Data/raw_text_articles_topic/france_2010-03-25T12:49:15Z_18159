An unemployed man suspected of hacking into Twitter accounts including those of Barack Obama and Britney Spears could face up to two years in prison after French police and the FBI tracked him down.The man, whose real name has not been released but who allegedly adopted the username Hacker Croll online, was arrested this week by police in Clermont-Ferrand, in the Auvergne, and released last night after questioning by French and US authorities.Last July the FBI discovered that an anonymous hacker, traced to France, had gained access to Twitter as an administrator and taken screengrabs of individuals' accounts. According to the technology website TechCrunch, which came under fire for publishing information sent to it by Croll, he began with Twitter employees and branched out through accounts with Gmail, PayPal, Amazon and others.French police said today they did not believe the hacker, aged 25, had been working for financial profit. "It was more a challenge," said a source.Adeline Champagnat, from the police's cybercrime unit, said the hacker appeared to have been motivated by curiosity. "He didn't want to make any money out of it," she told a French radio station.In an interview last year with the French online magazine Zataz, Croll said his work was solely motivated by a desire to show what he could do. "I hack therefore I am," he said. "But no question of damaging or destroying. I could easily resell what I have found, but that's out of the question."Champagnat said the police believed Croll had used simple but time-intensive techniques to recover passwords of the accounts he targeted, trawling blogs and forums in order to try to guess crucial information.The suspect, who lives in the Puy de DÃ´me area of central France, has been ordered to stand trial on 24 June in Clermont-Ferrand.
