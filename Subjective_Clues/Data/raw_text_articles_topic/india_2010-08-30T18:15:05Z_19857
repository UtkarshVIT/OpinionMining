The Indian government has lifted a threat to block certain BlackBerry communication services following moves by the technology firm Research in Motion that could allow the country's security authorities greater access to snoop on messages.Stepping back from the brink of a crackdown, India's ministry of home affairs said RIM had made "certain proposals for lawful access by law enforcement agencies and these would be operationalised immediately". It did not offer any detail on these concessions and RIM, which is based in Toronto, declined to comment.RIM has been sucked into a series of showdowns with governments in Asia and the Middle East over the level of privacy provided by its ubiquitous handheld devices.India had previously set a deadline of the end of August for the Canadian technology company to make corporate emails and instant messaging more accessible to its security forces.Following RIM's apparent concessions, the Indian government said today the situation would be reviewed in 60 days' time. It added that the country's telecoms ministry was examining whether all the subcontinent's BlackBerry communications could be routed through a server physically located in India.The Indian government's disquiet over BlackBerrys is thought to date back to a series of co-ordinated bombings and shootings in Mumbai in November 2008 that killed more than 150 people. Officials suspect that terrorists involved in the attacks communicated using encrypted messages on the devices.Striking the right balance between privacy and national security has become a significant headache for RIM, which has faced similar threats of a ban on Blackberry services in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates.
