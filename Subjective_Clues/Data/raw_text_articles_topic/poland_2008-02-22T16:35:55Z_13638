The European commission today rebuked Poland and Romania for their late responses to requests to clarify their role in the US extraordinary rendition programme.The EU justice and home affairs commissioner, Franco Frattini, wrote to Warsaw and Bucharest last July urging them to conduct in-depth inquiries into the findings by the European parliament indicating their complicity in extraordinary rendition â€“ the controversial practice of transporting terror suspects to secret locations where they risk being tortured. Neither country has responded in an adequate manner, said an EU commission spokesman, Johannes Laitenberger."We have not received a reply from Poland and the information from Romania was not considered complete. Frattini sent reminders in January and we're currently awaiting replies," Laitenberger said.Romania and Poland have firmly denied allegations of running secret CIA prisons or of helping the US in transferring terror suspects to illegal detention facilities.The former Romanian defence minister, Ioan Mircea Pascu, has described the EU's calls for further inquiries as unwelcome and that the EU was simply ignoring Bucharest's denials that such prisons were allowed on Romanian soil. The European parliament and the council of Europe, a human rights watchdog, have accused at least 14 European states of colluding with US intelligence on the Bush administration's extraordinary rendition programme.Britain yesterday admitted that US rendition flights carrying terror suspects twice landed on British soil. David Miliband, the foreign secretary, was forced to apologise to MPs that contrary to previous US assurances, two flights did in fact land at Diego Garcia, the British Indian Ocean territory where the US has a large air base.Lib Dem MP Sarah Ludford said after Britain's admission "we might be pushing into a slightly more open door. They've used us and abused us." She said the UK government had "turned a blind eye" to the renditions.Human rights groups have demanded a full accounting of the CIA's rendition programme. "It's high time the agency is held accountable," said Julia Hall of Human Rights Watch. She also sought an investigation into the British role in the programme."The US flew hundreds of flights across Europe so the only way to have full accountability is for [Britain] to launch a thorough, national investigation."Britain appears to have accepted the "administrative error" explanation given by the Bush administration, but it has said it wants to review logs related to US operations at Diego Garcia.Following Miliband's apology, a senior MEP called on the European parliament to reopen its inquiry into secret CIA transfers of terrorism suspects in Europe.Claudio Fava, who wrote a highly critical report on CIA secret flights and prisons last year, said a follow-up was necessary."Yesterday's revelations confirm that the European parliament has a moral duty to continue its inquiry," Fava told Reuters in Rome. "We still don't know everything that we have the right to know about this issue."Last February the EU approved Fava's report accusing European governments and services of accepting and concealing secret US flights of terrorism suspects.Italy has one of the best documented cases of what prosecutors believe was CIA rendition. Twenty six Americans - nearly all believed to be CIA agents - are being tried in absentia in Milan on charges of kidnapping a terrorism suspect in 2003 and secretly flying him to Egypt, where he says he was tortured.
