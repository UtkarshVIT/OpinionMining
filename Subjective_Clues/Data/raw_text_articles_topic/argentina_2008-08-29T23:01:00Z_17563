Two former generals were sentenced to life in prison yesterday for the murder of a senator during Argentina's seven-year military dictatorship.Retired generals Antonio Bussi and Luciano Menéndez were found guilty of kidnapping, torturing and murdering Senator Guillermo Vargas Aignasse.Vargas Aignasse disappeared on the day of a military coup on March 24 1976. The military later said it had released him from prison, but he was never seen again.Judge Gabriel Casas described the generals' actions as "crimes against humanity." He read the verdict to cheers from the courtroom audience in the northern city of in San Miguel de Tucuman, where the victim was senator. Government estimates say between 13,000 and 30,000 people were killed in the purge on leftists.Argentine human rights secretary, Eduardo Luis Duhalde, praised the verdict. "We are witnessing the end of impunity and the restoration of the truth, memory and justice," he said.Bussi, 82, will be allowed to remain under house arrest because he is over 75, a decision that enraged human rights activists outside the courtroom, who threw rocks and attacked police with sticks. Police used teargas to restrain the crowd.Menéndez, 81, will remain in prison in another province, where he was convicted in July of human rights violations.After democracy was restored in 1983, Bussi was accused of kidnappings and assassinations, but an amnesty law prevented him from being prosecuted. He was elected mayor of Tucuman in 2003, then arrested three months later for the disappearance of Vargas Aignasse.In 2005, the supreme court repealed sweeping amnesties that had shielded former officers from prosecution.Associated Press
