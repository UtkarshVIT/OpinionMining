A suicide blast ripped through a mosque in a mountain village close to Pakistan's Swat Valley today, killing at least 30 people and wounding dozens more. Separately, a roadside bomb killed four soldiers in the tribal belt.The violence was a potent reminder of the militant threat despite claims by the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, that the battle for Swat had "decisively turned" in the military's favour.It coincided with a visit by US envoy Richard Holbrooke, who met relief officials to discuss the plight of 3 million war refugees in North-West Frontier province.Rescuers pulled rubble from the destroyed mosque in Haya Gai, a remote mountain village in Upper Dir district.The local police chief said the confirmed death toll was 30 but scattered body parts "may make another four to six bodies".Atif ur Rehman, the top government official in the area, said rain and rugged terrain were hampering rescue efforts. "I cannot say how many more are dead, but there are scores of wounded," he told the Associated Press.The attack targeted a hardy mountain community known to have resisted Taliban encroachment. "The elders in Haya Gai were threatened at least three or four times because they were opponents of the Taliban," said a local journalist, Zahid Jan, speaking by phone from Dir town, about 22 miles (35km) from the blast site.Upper Dir has largely escaped the conflict that has consumed the neighbouring Swat valley over the past month. But three weeks ago the Pakistani army launched air strikes on a Taliban base in Dogra village, a militant stronghold in the area, killing three people, Jan said.The army claims to have pacified large parts of Swat and assured residents it will soon be safe enough for them to return home. However soldiers todayprevented hundreds of people from returning to the valley, saying it was too dangerous.In Islamabad Holbrooke warned that Pakistan could be directly affected by a surge in fighting in Afghanistan, where an extra 17,000 troops are deploying as part of the Obama administration's "mini-surge"."We are concerned there may be some spillover effect, as there was in the past," he said, referring to the movement of al-Qaida and Taliban fugitives across the porous 1,500-mile border after 2001.Holbrooke said he would lobby US treasury officials in Washington to help write off Pakistan's debt because the country faced an "extraordinarily difficult economic situation".
