Don't miss the view of Albuquerque's legendary sunsets from the rooftop lounge of the Hotel Parq Central, in the up-and-coming East Downtown (EDo) neighbourhood. The 1926 building was originally a hospital and the vintage druggist theme of its bar is reinforced by a selection of jazz-age cocktails including a Sazerac, Pink Lady and a version of the Aviation that still includes crème de violette. The view inspires romance – and the double-sized lounge chairs encourage it – but note if you go with a group: this is one of the few places in Albuquerque where you can order a pitcher of margaritas or mojitos to share.• 806 Central Avenue SE, +1 505 242 0040, hotelparqcentral.com. Open Mon-Thurs, and Sun 3pm-10.30pm, Fri-Sat 3pm-1.30amWith billiards, snooker, pinball, a killer jukebox and more than 120 different kinds of beer, this downtown institution attracts professionals and creative types for a quiet happy hour, then a combination of serious pool players and young hipsters later. The staff is well-educated on the beer selection and can capably guide you. (Don't bother asking for a Bud Light, but do try some of the popular local brews.) The bourbon selection is also quite good, and the bar staff's iPods play a killer cool soundtrack.• 409 Central Avenue NW, +1 505 244 1820, theanodyne.com. Open Mon-Fri 4pm-1.30am, Sat 7pm-1.30am, Sun 7pm-11.30pmA huge, open warehouse space in the former downtown headquarters of the local power company, Effex also has one of the city's few rooftop dance spaces. Given the high-energy atmosphere, cocktails are safely served in plastic cups. Downstairs the music is pumping, lights are flashing and go-go dancers gyrate atop elevated boxes. When you get hot, you can slip upstairs to the breezy roof where there's a different DJ and a more intimate dancefloor. Inside, there's a more sophisticated seating area where you can see and be seen.• 420 Central SW, +1 505 842 8870, effexabq.com. Open Tues, and Thurs-Sat 8pm-2am, In the early 1940s, Conrad Hilton brought his bride, Zsa Zsa Gabor, to honeymoon here at the first hotel he'd built in his home state. Today, under different owners, Hotel Andaluz, still has the historic murals preserved on the lobby walls – but the rooftop bar would appeal more to Paris Hilton than her great-grandfather. Drinks such as cucumber-jalapeño margaritas are served with Spanish-themed small plates. In the early evening, the atmosphere is serene, but call to find out if there are DJs scheduled for later. If the weather's not perfect (it usually is), or if you're with a group, reserve one of the six cosy nooks just off the lobby, called "casbahs".• 125 Second Street NW, +1 505 923 9080, hotelandaluz.com.Don't be put off by the heavily tattooed crowd; the staff and patrons are friendlier than they look. Order a "tall boy" of Pabst Blue Ribbon and a shot of Jack Daniel's and you'll fit right in. Launchpad is regularly voted the city's best venue for live music. Punk rock, heavy metal, rockabilly, hip-hop and electronica. Local bands and touring acts you'd see in much bigger venues in other cities love to show off in this smaller club with outstanding sound and light systems. (Beck once played an unadvertised, hour-long aftershow set here.)• 618 Central Avenue SW, +1 505 764 8887, launchpadrocks.com Check website for event detailsA dozen craft beers are brewed at this hip and relaxed downtown pub, which draws an eclectic and loyal following to its lively beer garden. Bands – bluegrass, reggae, classic rock – play several nights a week on the small outdoor stage (there's never a cover charge), and there's a different food truck parked outside every night, serving tacos, burgers and burritos, etc. The flagship beer is a strong, lively India Pale Ale; the Wild Flower Wheat is made with New Mexico honey. Marble sells only its own beer, no wine or spirits.• 111 Marble Avenue NW, +1 505 243 2739, marblebrewery.com.

Follow the address to a dimly lit shopping centre and find your way to the nondescript liquor store. There you'll see an unusually reinforced door with a red light above. Knock and deliver the password (call ahead or go to the website to get it). You'll be admitted by a host dressed like a gangster. The food is exorbitantly expensive, but the bar menu is reasonable and the signature cocktails fun. Try a Black Diamond Martini, the Violet Lemon Drop or the Sterling Margarita.• 6855 4th St NW, +1 505 341 0831, yougottapassword.com. Open daily 4.30pm-midnightOrder a flight of tequilas (and a taxi) to share at this taco and tequila bar on a stretch of neon-streaked Central Avenue in the funky, cool Nob Hill neighbourhood. Choose from more than three dozen different tequilas and mescals and sip them straight or build your own margarita with a choice of liqueurs from limoncello to Cointreau to St Germain. Sooner or later you'll want to order tacos filled with chicharrón (crispy pork belly) or cochinita pibil (pork braised in banana leaves). The giant open windows that line the sidewalk allow for exceptional people-watching.• 3423 Central Avenue NE, +1 505 255 8226, zacatecastacos.com.
