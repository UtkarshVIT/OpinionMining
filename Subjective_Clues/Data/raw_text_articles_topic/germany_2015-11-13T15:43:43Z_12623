Malcolm Turnbull says he has no intention of giving Germany gratuitous advice about how to handle the flow of asylum seekers from the Syrian conflict.The Australian prime minister used the opportunity of a joint press conference with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin on Friday to publicly rebuke recent commentary from his predecessor Tony Abbott.Abbott advised Europe to take on Australia’s tough border security policies or risk “catastrophic error”.

I think this is a matter for the German government as it is for the Australian government to manage in their own way.”Turnbull’s response came in answer to a question to both himself and Merkel about whether Europe had anything to learn from Australian border control policies, and whether the chancellor accepted Abbott’s advice about the risks of “misguided altruism”, which was delivered at the second Margaret Thatcher Lecture at London’s Guildhall in October.Merkel avoided any direct response to the Abbott remarks, but in general commentary about the current flow of refugees, she said right now, the narrow sea lane between Turkey and Greece was under the control of smugglers and traffickers, and this was “unacceptable”.“Solutions have to be found to allow the European Union to protect its borders, there’s no denying the fact,” Merkel said.Merkel has displayed moral leadership on accepting Syrian refugees but is facing dissent within her ruling coalition about how to deal with the large influx from Syria.Germany expects between 800,000 and one million asylum seekers to arrive over the course of this year.Turnbull and Merkel met ahead of the G20 summit in Turkey over the weekend.The two leaders discussed the Syrian conflict and what Merkel characterised as “the chances of securing a peaceful solution”.They also discussed “peaceful coexistence with Muslims fighting Islamic State”, Merkel said, noting there had been an important exchange of views between herself and Turnbull on the subject.Turnbull said of the Syrian conflict, the only option for peace was a political solution. “The solution will ultimately be a political one. There needs to be a political solution to this absolutely catastrophic situation in Syria.”There are reports the US president, Barack Obama, may meet the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, over the coming days at the G20 summit, with Syria expected to be a major focus of the talks in Antalya.The two leaders also released a report of the Australia-Germany Advisory Group.The document contains a number of recommendations for strengthening business and strategic ties between the two countries.Turnbull said some of the key recommendations on research commercialisation would feed into the government’s innovation statement, due next month.Key recommendations include a commitment of German support for negotiations towards an EU-Australia free trade agreement and annual “2+2” strategic dialogue between Australia and Germany, and the conclusion of a double taxation treaty.The report also commits the two countries to a establishing a bilateral working group on energy and resources to discuss climate change “including lessons and opportunities from Germany’s energy transition”.Turnbull and Merkel also discussed defence issues.The German company ThyssenKrupp is bidding to build Australia’s next fleet of submarines.Asked about the bid, Merkel said her government was fully supportive of the ThyssenKrupp bid, and the high quality of the bid should “speak for itself”.Turnbull noted the potential for innovation would be critical to the ultimate outcome of the tender. “Technology is key,” he said.
