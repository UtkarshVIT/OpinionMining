Snow up to 25cm (9.8in) deep in places hit Scotland today as cold weather returned to Britain after a brief spell of spring-like conditions.Motorists have been warned of icy stretches on roads, and some routes are closed altogether. Snow settled in towns and cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh just in time for the morning rush hour. Upland areas in northern England are likely to experience snow this morning, but this is expected to clear later in the day.Around 5cm of snow was recorded in Dalmally, Argyll and Bute, with an estimated 10-12cm thought to have fallen in higher areas.Traffic Scotland issued warnings on routes in Strathclyde, Grampian, the Highlands and Tayside.Northern Constabulary said the A82 was closed at Glencoe and the A9 was badly affected by slush.A high wind warning was issued for the Kessock Bridge.Overnight, a woman had to be rescued from her car after it crashed into a tree on the M8 near junction 26. She was taken to Glasgow's Southern General Hospital aftert the accident, at 4.15am.A driver escaped from his van when it crashed on the M74 at around 4.30am, Strathclyde Fire and Rescue said.Forecasters predicted the weather would remain cold and wet, with wintry showers and snow in the north today and milder weather returning only at the weekend.There was heavy overnight rain further south, with more expected in other parts of the country as wintry showers spread eastwards from Wales and the west of England.Tonight will see more rain, sleet and/or snow in Northern Ireland and western Scotland and the possibility of wintry showers in the south-west and along the south coast. The rest of the country will experience dry and frosty conditions.Matt Dobson, of Meteogroup, said: "Tonight will be interesting – clear but bitterly cold. Temperatures will fall quite quickly."Today western areas will see rain and sleet but the snow will ease."With around 10-12cm having fallen in higher areas, the ski resorts will have had a bit of a boost."Tomorrow will see more wintry showers in the west, though the rest of the country will remain dry and bright.Into the weekend, showers and cloudy grey skies will give way to drier conditions.The cold winter has proved particularly trying for one bird species, ornithologists say. They believe numbers of the tiny Dartford warbler – which is smaller than a sparrow – may have been reduced by three-quarters in the past few weeks because of last month's snow.The bird nests in gorse shrubland in the south of England and has made a slow comeback after being nearly wiped out in the freezing winter of 1963, when numbers were apparently down to 11 pairs.It is still a rare sight. In 2006, after a decade of mild winters, its numbers had returned to 3,212 pairs, according to a count in Hampshire.
