In a sure sign that Italy has entered a more buttoned-up era following the fall of Silvio Berlusconi, organisers of this year's Miss Italy have banned bikinis in favour of the one-piece costumes favoured in the 1950s.The switch follows comments from Anna Maria Tarantola, the recently appointed boss of Italian state TV under Mario Monti's austerity government, who said it was time to clamp down on nudity after years of filling shows with scantily clad dancing girls.A big ratings winner for state TV, Miss Italy remains an institution with viewers. Winners regularly secure modelling contracts and acting roles. But this year viewers will see less of contestants after organiser Patrizia Mirigliani said she would follow Tarantola's lead by dressing contestants in old-fashioned costumes that cover the crotch and upper thigh.Before the show, contestants will meet Mahatma Gandhi's granddaughter, which will help them learn about the "concept of interior, as well as exterior" beauty, according to Mirigliani.The bikini ban draws a line under the years in which Prime Minister Berlusconi allegedly rang state TV bosses to convince them to cast his young female friends in shows and populated his "bunga bunga" parties with TV dancing girls and buxom reality stars.One Berlusconi guest who says she fled his mansion disgusted by what she saw is competing in the new-look Miss Italy. Chiara Danese has claimed the former prime minister encouraged his party guests to strip and dance for him. When she tried to leave she was allegedly warned she would never become Miss Italy.Il Giornale, a newspaper owned by Berlusconi's brother, was scathing about the impact of "Monti-style sobriety" on Miss Italy, asking on Tuesday: "If we cover the bottom, the object of male fantasy, with centimetres of cloth, what sense does the competition have?"
