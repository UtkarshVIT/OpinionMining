Will Hutton (An awesome warning, 21 May) raises several important questions about the Japanese economy. First, what was the nature of the two lost decades? For the whole of the 1990s Japan experienced what most western observers described as a deep recession, which neither zero interest rates or repeated government initiatives seemed capable of ending. However, this was a recession characterised by near stagnation of GDP and industrial output - but not by falling living standards. It also saw the continuation of high levels of surplus on the trade and current accounts, capital outflows and accumulation of central bank reserves. While not denying that there were problems, it can be argued that Japan, as perhaps the world's most mature economy, had reached a position of saturated markets and low but stable growth.This leads to the second question, the extent to which Japan should be regarded as export dependent. Again it can be argued that this continues to be greatly exaggerated. Japan's long-term trade surplus should be regarded as structural, reflecting a low propensity to import, a diversified production base substituting for imports, and a low level of reliance on foreign capital, as well as highly competitive exports. Third, despite high levels of trade and capital outflows, the Japanese economy remains relatively isolated from the global system with a highly internalised economy. Its large public outlays are absorbed by a high level of private sector savings and the economy is characterised by state-market relations and corporate structures that differ strikingly from anything in the west. Given this, we see little in the Japanese experience of the last 20 years that can be seen as a warning to the west.Viara Bojkova, David Bruce and Chris DixonGlobal Policy Institute
