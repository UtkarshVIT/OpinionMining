With its severed spire and crumbling facades, it has long stood as a reminder of the German downfall in 1945, a reminder to Berliners of how low the city was brought during the second world war. But now the famous Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church - nicknamed the "Hollow Tooth" - is facing twin adversaries that could prove more formidable than allied bombers: the Berlin weather and a credit crunch.The clock is ticking for the Gedächtniskirche, as it is otherwise known. Officials warn that, unless a fundraising campaign, which has so far proved underwhelming, can be accelerated, the structure could be forced to close early next year.The church is under attack on all fronts. Vibrations from heavy traffic along the Kurfürstendamm are shaking its foundations. More seriously, water is seeping into the tower, meaning it will freeze in winter and crack the stone. Fragments may crash down to the street or into the foyer."If we have a very strong winter with very intense changes of temperature, there's certain risk," said Wolfgang Kuhla, head of the memorial church board. "We would have to start the renovations to avoid real danger." Fundraising started almost a year ago with a £500 donation from Charles Jeffrey Gray, who flew on British bombing raids over Berlin. In recognition of the building's importance, Berlin's mayor, Klaus Wowereit, recently pledged an additional €1m from the state-run lottery. But as the credit crunch hits, the money raised has fallen well short of the €4.1m (£3.3m) the church needs, meaning building work has been postponed until the spring. Built in 1895, the shell of the church attracts more than a million visitors a year. Most of the structure was destroyed in a bombing raid on November 3 1943.
