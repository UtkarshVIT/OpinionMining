The UK is in the middle of a tall building boom. And while it is the office towers in London's centre that are making all the headlines, the city is also building high-rise residential properties far and wide, with reports that there are more than 140 residential towers of 20 or more storeys either recently completed or in the pipeline.(Recently on this network, Hannah Fearn argued that high-rise was the only solution to avoid building on the green belt.)Despite this apparent popularity, high-rise living is still unappealing to many, and in particular to families with children who see the lack of social-communal spaces and the distance between the flat and the street as a physical and psychological barrier.This is hardly surprising given that low-rise suburban living can offer the street, the protective front garden and the generously-sized back garden, whereas all high-rise can seemingly offer is the corridor and lift-lobby, both squeezed down to the minimum that regulations allow, and more often than not, without access to natural light and view. The upshot is that, without spaces and facilities for play, interaction and recreation, the high-rise seems only to appeal to three demographic groups: young singles, couples, and empty nesters (those who are older and whose children have left home). For families it is the dream of the two-storey house and garden that prevails, and fuels the exodus of couples from apartment living to the suburbs when children arrive on the scene. Some have suggested a solution is a shift in our aspirations, but surely we also need to change the design of these monotonous residential towers if they are to appeal to a broader cross-section.Perhaps inspiration can be found by looking east, and in particular, to Singapore. In this city-state of more than 5 million people, an astonishing 85% of the population live in high-rise social housing, leading to innovative design solutions and regulations to improve the quality of life at height. Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in the Pinnacle@Duxton â€“ a development of seven towers linked together with skybridges at the 26th and 50th floors which include a host of social spaces such as an outdoor gym for the elderly, children's play area, mini parks and seating areas, and perhaps most radically, an 800-metre running track linking together the seven towers, all with access to view, light and air in a safe environment above the city.The economics stack up too. Singaporean regulations allow developers who include community spaces at height to build taller, and to exclude such spaces from the taxable area of their developments. This has led to towers with skygardens springing up all over the island, with lush, planted social spaces appearing at height across the city.To many, these concepts are nothing new, being just an extension of the modernist ideas of streets-in-the-sky, such as the post-war developments at Pruitt-Igoe in the US and Robin Hood Gardens in Poplar, London, both of which failed spectacularly. But these failures were not just architectural, with a lack of mixed-use programs, poor maintenance and a lack of broader occupant social support also carrying the blame.However, these ideas are now being reinvented and reinvigorated in Asia, transforming streets-in-the-sky from the glorified concrete corridors of the 1960s to lush green spaces, with dedicated functions and activities, which are well maintained and looked after.While future UK housing will likely be multi-typological, with terraced, low-rise and strategically located high-rise all necessary, tall buildings can never fulfil their potential until we make living at height appealing to families with children. And this means designing gardens, terraces and streets in the sky.Dr Philip Oldfield is course director for the masters in sustainable tall buildings at the University of Nottingham
