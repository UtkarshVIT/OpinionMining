The president of Mexico has officially denied meeting Justin Bieber. Enrique Peña Nieto rejected Bieber's claim that he attended Bieber's recent concert in Mexico City, forcing the singer to issue a hasty correction.Bieber's diplomatic gaffe was part of a proud tweet on Monday night, posted before a gig at the Foro Sol. "Just met some amazing mexican beliebers and the presidente of mexico and his familia," the pop star wrote. "Now it is showtime. 60,000 [people] tonight ... te amo."Within three hours, Mexico's highest office issued its own statement, making clear that Peña Nieto never went anywhere near Canadian pop star. The next day, Bieber posted a follow-up: "*correction. I met the presidente's family and all their friends in the private meet and greet with all their security. They were very nice." Paulina Peña Nieto, the president's daughter, is reportedly a huge pop fan. Last year, Enrique apparently bought five rows of One Direction tickets so the teenager could attend with all her friends.Bieber's presidential blunder is only the latest incident that's arisen from his South American tour. Earlier this month, the singer had to apologise for kicking an Argentine flag that had been thrown onto the stage in Buenos Aires. Desecrating the country's flag is punishable by up to four years in jail. "Im being told by my team it was a shirt but even if it was a flag I would never do anything to disrespect Argentina," Bieber tweeted. "Im so sorry for anyone who took my actions the wrong way and I hope you can forgive this mistake."Bieber was also widely criticised for abandoning one of his Buenos Aires concerts after less than an hour on stage. Scooter Braun, Bieber's manager, claimed the 19-year-old was diagnosed with food poisoning and had opted to perform against doctors' advice.
