North Korea has stopped work on disabling its nuclear reactor and threatened to restore it to operation because the US has failed to remove Pyongyang from a list of state sponsors of terrorism."We have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities," North Korea's KCNA news agency quoted a foreign ministry official as saying today. He said work was suspended on August 14.Pyongyang has been disabling the facilities under a disarmament-for-aid deal reached last year, but the six-party agreement between North Korea and the US, South Korea, China, Russia and Japan has run into trouble over verification of the work.North Korea produced a long-delayed inventory of its nuclear programmes in June and the US responded by starting the process of removing the country from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. The Bush administration has said it will not actually remove North Korea from the list until an adequate verification arrangement is in place.North Korea's announcement comes after comments yesterday by the US envoy for nuclear talks with the country that he had had "substantive" talks with his North Korean counterpart. A US state department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said he had no comment on today's KCNA report.Pyongyang's move follows a joint statement by the leaders of South Korea and China urging cooperation over decommissioning deal.North Korea says the process of making its Yongbyon reactor impossible to use, which began late last year, is nearly completed."I do not believe that North Korea wholeheartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of the denuclearisation process," said Koh Yu-hwan, professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk university. "I see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the US to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible."
