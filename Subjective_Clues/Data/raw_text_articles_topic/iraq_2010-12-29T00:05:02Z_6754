As the US and UK accuse Russia of a "politically motivated sentence" and the pope accuses China of lack of freedom for Christians, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister Tariq Aziz sits in Iraq awaiting execution (Report, 30 November). A Christian and victim of a politically motivated trial, he knows the truth of western duplicity over Iraq.The silence of the pope, archbishops, the Foreign Office (despite William Hague claiming to put human rights firmly at the centre of his policies) has been woeful. All have been approached by anti-death-penalty campaigners, including many eminent people, such as bishops. None has even replied to correspondence. Tariq Aziz is a symbol of the "democracy" brought to the new Iraq. His trial was condemned by Human Rights Watch – which had called for it consistently – as "fundamentally flawed" and they said that the "court should overturn the verdict".Tariq Aziz at least had a show trial – he is a symbol of the hundreds awaiting death in Iraq who have not even had that. He was also a nationalist who begged the former pope not to allow Iraq to be destroyed by an invasion – and refused to leave the country which, for all his failings, he had devoted his life to. Under Saddam Hussein, those over 70 could not be executed. Tariq Aziz is a 74-year-old stroke victim. It looks to many as if what the US and UK have wrought in Iraq continues the excesses of the former regime. One can only hang one's head in shame. Saddam was executed – some say lynched – on 31 December. Let us hope history does not repeat this shame – in our name.Felicity ArbuthnotLondon
