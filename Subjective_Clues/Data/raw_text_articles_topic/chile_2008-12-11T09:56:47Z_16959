Madonna "provokes a crazy enthusiasm," a prominent Chilean priest said yesterday â€“ and not in a good way.Jorge Medina Estevez, a retired cardinal and apparent amateur pop critic, began his homily in lofty praise of General Augusto Pinochet, the late dictator responsible for more than 3,000 politically motivated killings and disappearances. He then shifted into a diatribe against sinful Madonna, who sings songs about boys, girls and sweets."This woman comes here," Medina said, "and in an incredibly shameless manner she provokes a crazy enthusiasm, an enthusiasm of lust, lustful thoughts, impure thoughts." Medina is one of Chile's most prominent clergymen, and as cardinal protodeacon was the man who announced to the world the selection of Benedict XVI as pontiff. He is known for his conservative views, but less so for his album reviews.As per official doctrine, Medina stepped down as a cardinal following his 80th birthday.Madonna is in Santiago for two concerts at the Estadio Nacional. Devotees camped out for more than three days in order to secure good spots at the gig, which is expected to attract more than 60,000 crazy, lusty, impure and enthusiastic fans. There is no word whether anyone camped out to hear Jorge Medina Estevez at mass, nor whether any fellow Pinochet nuts were batting eyelashes at the cleric.
