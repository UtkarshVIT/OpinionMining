The German government is set to extend the €2,500 (£2,330) scrappage premium for consumers who trade in their 10-year-old cars for new, fuel-efficient models, it emerged last night.The news puts added pressure on the UK government to adopt a similar scheme to boost demand in Britain where car production fell 59% last month and sales are collapsing.The UK industry body, the SMMT, has for weeks been urging Lord Mandelson, business secretary, and cabinet colleagues to offer £2,000 per new car in a British version of a programme now adopted in a dozen EU countries.Chancellor Angela Merkel and her deputy and foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, reached a deal that the scheme could be extended until the end of this year. But they are yet to fix the size of the bonus in a second stage.German consumer demand has been so strong that dealers are reporting that the programme, costing €1.5bn, may run out over Easter. It has attracted 570,000 new buyers – close to Berlin's ceiling of 600,000, they say.Official figures suggest that around 350,000 orders have been placed under the scheme but these are said to have under-estimated the scale of the rush to car showrooms – mainly for smaller cars rather than BMWs, Mercedes or Porsches.Some industry executives are angry that non-German makes such as Romania's Dacia, France's Renault and Peugeot Citroen and Japan's Toyota have benefited at their expense.Berlin's grand coalition government is said to be ready to consider the extension because sales have boosted demand and growth in an economy that could shrink between 5% and 7% this year and see unemployment rise to 4 million.Ministers have also accepted industry executives' arguments that the scrappage bonus is virtually self-financing, with current sales levels likely to boost VAT yields by €1.3bn – only €200,000 short of the exchequer's gross cost.The agreed extension is also expected to go down well with voters in a general election year dominated, inter alia, by the depth of the recession – and the undecided €3.3bn rescue of Opel, the German arm of General Motors which employs 25,000 directly and 300,000 indirectly.A less generous scheme in France, worth €1,000 for each car, has also boosted sales, prompting Renault to move production of a Clio model back to France and create 400 jobs. This has provoked widespread criticism of French protectionism.Yesterday MEPs urged the EU to adopt a united European response to help the industry and avoid protectionist measures. They want the European Investment Bank and other bodies to speed up loans and guarantees for the industryGlenis Willmott, leader of the Labour MEPs, said: "It is vital we act now to protect our car manufacturing industry and those connected to the industry as we cannot afford to let it go to the wall." She called for EU guidelines for scrappage schemes.Welcoming the move, Ivan Hodac, secretary general of the European carmakers' body ACEA, said: "The auto industry is essential to the EU economy. It is the engine of manufacturing, one of the biggest employers in Europe, the largest investor in innovation and R&D, and a formidable export force."
