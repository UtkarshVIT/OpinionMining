In my Glasgow garden, in sheltered, moist semi-shade, I have three Crinodendron hookerianum. This summer all the leaves on the bush in the sunniest position have lost colour, shrivelled and died, and there are yellowing and brown, dry tips on the other two plants.You can keep your rhododendrons and camellias; the Chile lantern tree is the plant that makes me long for an acidic soil. You have the rare combination of moist, mild weather and low pH required to grow this beauty. I'm jealous. You may need to tinker to get the conditions right. Try regular, deep waterings and a mulch. It is the bush in the sunniest spot that has suffered most, so provide more shade for the roots with some underplanting. Consider larger plantings to guard against strong winds and excess sun. It seems a lot of fuss, but this diva is worth it.For the last few years trees have been dying around our tall acacia tree – first a magnolia, then two hedges, an apple and this year a pear. I am worried that our amazing Victoria plum is next.I hope you are sitting down. Acacia has some resistance to honey fungus, but pears, apples, magnolias and – I'm sorry – plums are particularly susceptible to it. So we have the sudden death of lots of trees, with a honey fungus-resistant one still thriving. Reaching any conclusions yet? This is a diagnosis I hate to give because it's devastating, and you need to investigate the roots of the dead trees to be absolutely sure. Peel back the bark just below ground level – if you find a sheet of white fungus (smelling of mushrooms) below the bark, then honey fungus is the confirmed cause. You will need to remove and burn all of the stumps and as much of the roots as possible. Don't despair, though: the RHS website has a list of resistant plants.space@theguardian.com
