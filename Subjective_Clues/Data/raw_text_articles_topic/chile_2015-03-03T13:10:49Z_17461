A volcano in southern Chile has erupted in a series of massive explosions, sending fountains of orange flames thousands of feet into the night sky.An estimated 3,400 people were evacuated from the area around Villarica, including parts of the towns Pucón and Conaripe. Chilean authorities issued a red alert and sealed off roads surrounding the volcano, located in a tourist enclave outside the city of Temuco. The president, Michelle Bachelet, announced an emergency visit to the zone. Government planes flew over the crater in an attempt to gather data following the 20-minute pre-dawn eruption. The eruption followed weeks of increased activity in and around the volcano, including small earthquakes.The snow-covered peak has a crater 180 metres across and a pool of lava estimated at 120 metres (400ft) deep. Considered one of Latin America’s most active volcanoes, Villarica has erupted on average once every 10 years. A major eruption in 1971 created a cloud of poisonous gases that killed approximately a dozen people.Authorities are concerned that lava and heat from the latest eruption could melt glaciers and snow on the flanks of the volcano and cause mudslides. The Rio Turbio river was reported to have risen 15ft. Schools were shut in the four districts closest to the volcano. Police patrols to the area were increased to prevent looting. In 2010 Bachelet was widely criticised for her response to an earthquake. The emergency services agency known as the Onemi was reorganised and is now coordinated by a former army general, Ricardo Toro, who for years managed international humanitarian operations in Haiti. If the volcano shows signs of increased activity, Onemi will next organise the evacuation of an estimated 20,000 more people from Pucón and the surrounding area.
