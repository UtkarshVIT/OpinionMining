Next week the Guardian's industrial editor, Dan Milmo, will be blogging each morning from Japan where he will be gauging the health of the country's manufacturing sector in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami. He will be visiting Nissan, Toyota, Hitachi and Komatsu (which makes big diggers among other things) as well as providing comment on how Japan can help address the global trade imbalances that have troubled the likes of Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King recently. Vince Cable, the business secretary, has chipped in with some comments that chime with Raghuram Rajan's award-winning Fault Lines - that the likes of Japan, Germany and China perhaps need to export a bit less and consume a bit more. So Dan will be looking at how Japan is recovering and the case for tilting its economy in a new direction.Dan is travelling to Japan under the Foreign Press Centre Japan fellowship programme.
