Turkey has frozen financial assets and cut strategic links with Damascus to ratchet up pressure on the regime of Bashar al-Assad to end its violence against protesters, following the Arab League's decision to impose sanctions on Sunday.Ahmet Davutoglu, the foreign minister, said Turkey would also block the delivery of weapons and military equipment and suspend a co-operation agreement with Syria until a new government is in place.Turkey had drawn closer to Syria in recent years– and is one of its biggest trading partners – but lost patience after encouraging reform rather than repression in response to this year's Arab spring uprising, which has seen at least 3,500 killed in Syria, according to the UN."We will always support the Syrian people and until recently we opposed the attempts to isolate the regime," Davutoglu said at a press conference in Ankara. "But regrettably Syria has now become a problem for the region and there is no exit from this crisis." It was the "end of the road" for Assad's government."Every bullet fired, every bombed mosque, has eliminated the legitimacy of the Syrian leadership and has widened the gap between us," Davutoglu said.Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, last week became the second regional leader to publicly urge Assad to step down, after Jordan's King Abdullah, reminding him of the fate of Hitler and Muammar Gaddafi.Other sanctions include a ban on transactions with Syria's government and central bank and measures against prominent businessmen who support the regime. But Turkey would not do anything to harm ordinary Syrians, said Davutoglu.Like most western countries, Turkey has been wary of getting ahead of Arab diplomatic action, but Davutoglu attended Sunday's meeting of the Arab League, which approved its sanctions against Syria and he pledged to follow suit.Turkey has hinted at the creation of a buffer zone on its border with Syria in the event of a refugee crisis, but does not appear to be considering any military action.Last week, there was embarassment when a leader of the exiled Syrian Muslim Brotherhood said his movement would accept Turkish military intervention. Ankara already appears to be giving at least tacit support to the Free Syrian Army, made up of defectors from the regime's security forces. It allows other Syrian opposition groups to operate freely.Syria also faced pressure at a meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, which called on the Assad regime "to stop the violence against civilians" and implement reform "in order to spare the country the risk of internationalisation of the crisis".Participants included Walid al-Moallem, Syria's foreign minister, who is now banned from Arab League meetings following his country's suspension.
