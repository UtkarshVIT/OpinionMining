Gunmen wounded Pakistan's religious affairs minister in an attack in broad daylight today in Islamabad.Local media said Saeed Kazmi was shot in his car and his driver killed.According to Geo News, two gunmen on a motorbike fired at the vehicle before escaping. The minister is said to have been shot in the knee and was undergoing an operation."Gunmen sprayed bullets on the minister's car," said a police officer who identified himself as Qasim. He said Kazmi was in a stable condition.The minister has been critical of Islamist militants blamed for scores of attacks in Pakistan over the last two and a half years. Last month, Kazmi defended the government offensive in the Swat valley that displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians from what was once a popular tourist area.He said the government had tried its best to restore order through peaceful means, and blamed extremists for attacking civilians and disregarding a truce. A military operation, he said, had become imperative in view of the frequent suicide attacks against security forces.The army launched a campaign in April to clear the Taliban from Swat and Buner, two valleys a few hours' drive from Islamabad. Pakistan has been on high alert for retaliatory attacks by Taliban insurgents and groups linked to al-Qaida since a US missile strike killed the Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud early last month.
