Hopes have risen for progress in dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, after South Korea said it would propose high-level talks with its neighbour.Last week the two Koreas agreed to hold broad defence talks next month, amid an easing of tensions on the peninsula – and the South has now said it intends to press for separate talks on nuclear weapons.Officials in Seoul said they would propose nuclear negotiations in the coming days, with a view to holding working-level discussions in the middle of next month."As soon as [internal] discussions conclude, we will be making a proposal to the north on high-level military talks and also official meetings on denuclearisation," said Lee Jong-ju, a spokeswoman for the unification ministry.If successful, the nuclear talks could pave the way for the resumption of six-party negotiations aimed at persuading Pyongyang to abandon its atomic programme in return for aid.Talks involving the two Koreas, China, the US, Russia and Japan have not been held since Pyongyang walked out of the process in April 2009.The following month it conducted a second nuclear test, and there are reports that it is planning a third this year.The reopening of channels of communication between North and South Korea could help ease the worst crisis on the peninsula since the end of the Korean war in 1953.In March last year the North sank a South Korean navy vessel, killing 46 sailors, and in November it shelled Yeonpyeong island – just south of the countries' disputed maritime border – killing four people and destroying dozens of homes.The prospect of a détente comes after reports last week that Barack Obama had warned his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, that the US would redeploy forces in the region unless Beijing attempted to rein in North Korea, a major recipient of Chinese aid.Experts on North Korea say the country is desperate for aid after sanctions dented its exports of arms and weapons technology, a key source of foreign currency.The US and China have both said that dialogue between the two Koreas must begin before six-party negotiations can resume.Doubts persist, however, over Pyongyang's willingness to abandon its nuclear programme."North Korea should decide on its own whether it will choose a dead-ended road of confrontation and enmity or a road of peace and prosperity," the Yonhap news agency quoted South Korea's foreign minister, Kim Sung-hwan, as saying.In November, it emerged that North Korea had built a new uranium enrichment plant that could give it the ability to drastically strengthen its nuclear capability.It is known to have enough fissile material from its plutonium-based programme to make between six and 12 nuclear bombs, but has not proved it has a working nuclear weapon.Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford University professor who was shown around the plant at the North's nuclear facility at Yongbyon, said it contained about 2,000 uranium-enrichment centrifuges.
