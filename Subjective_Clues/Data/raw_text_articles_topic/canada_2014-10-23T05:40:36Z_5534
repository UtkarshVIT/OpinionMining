Australian political leaders have said they stand “shoulder to shoulder with our Canadian comrades in defiance and resolution” after a gunman’s attack on a soldier and on the parliament in Ottawa.The prime minister, Tony Abbott, described the infiltration of the Canadian legislature as “an affront to this parliament, too” and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, reaffirmed his intention to give bipartisan support to the Australian government’s counter-terrorism laws.Australian authorities are reviewing security measures at public buildings, including Parliament House, and military sites after the dramatic events in the Canadian capital on Wednesday. A soldier guarding the Canadian war memorial in Ottawa was shot dead and a gunman then stormed the nearby parliament before being killed by a parliamentary official.Abbott and Shorten expressed solidarity with Canada at the beginning of question time on Thursday, with the Canadian high commissioner to Australia in attendance.Australians, the prime minister said, felt Canada’s “shock, pain and anger”.“I have been in their parliament, I have been at their war memorial. So many of us have,” Abbott said.“I regard Stephen Harper, their prime minister, as a friend and almost a brother. So an attack on their parliament is an affront to this parliament, too.“Today, we stand shoulder to shoulder with our Canadian comrades in defiance and resolution. We stand for freedom and for the right of all people in all places to choose their way of life and their way of worship. We always have, and we always will.”Abbott said the events were a reminder that “the terrorist threat to our people, our institutions and to our way of life” was real.He noted that Canada and Australia both had to confront the problem of some of their citizens travelling to Iraq and Syria to join groups such as Islamic State (Isis). Shorten said his thoughts were with the family of Corporal Nathan Cirillo, the Canadian army reservist killed while standing watch at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and for the parliamentary guard recovering in hospital.“The footage that has rolled across our television screens today captures something of the fear and confusion that gripped all of the innocent people in the Canadian parliament and those paying their respects at the Canadian war memorial,” Shorten said.Shorten said Australians would feel affected by the events “but today should not be cause for fear”. He said Australia’s parliament, war memorial and public buildings must remain open to the public because they belonged to the people.The justice minister, Michael Keenan, said authorities had increased security, including the decision six weeks ago to deploy armed police officers inside and outside Parliament House and improve tactical response capabilities.The foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, said when she contacted the Canadian foreign affairs minister, John Baird, early on Thursday, he said he had been just metres from the gunman, and was still barricaded within the parliament building.Bishop said Canada, like Australia, was part of the international coalition fighting against Isis in Iraq. “The chilling video of a young 17-year-old Australian threatening his country as he takes up arms with [Isis] shows that we must take immediate steps, a strong response to counter this threat.”Bishop said she had cancelled about 70 Australian passports on the grounds that the holder posed a security risk. She said forthcoming legislation would allow her to suspend passports.The government’s second stage of national security changes, known as the foreign fighters bill, is scheduled for parliamentary debate and a vote next week.Labor appears likely to support the bill, having voted last month in favour of the government’s previous bill expanding security agency powers and criminalising disclosure of special intelligence operations.Shorten said on Thursday: “When it comes to fighting terrorism, we are in this together. It is important that we have a bipartisan approach – we have and we do.”
