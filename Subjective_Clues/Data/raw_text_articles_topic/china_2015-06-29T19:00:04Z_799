An ancient marine worm discovered in China has been identified as the earliest known animal to have used body armour to defend itself against predators.The creature is known as the Hairy Collins’ Monster or Collinsium ciliosum, after paleontololgist Desmond Collins, who first discovered a similar fossil in the 1980s. The Chinese specimen lived around 500 million years ago and developed “super-armour” - an array of 72 spikes along its back and sides - to protect itself from other life forms that existed at the time.Collinsium was around 85mm long, and as well as its spiky armour had six pairs of brush-like front legs and nine pairs of clawed rear ones. Scientists believe that the creature’s defence mechanism may have evolved due to the its unusual eating strategy, which involved using its front legs as a feeding basket to sieve plankton from the water, while clinging onto rocks with its rear legs.Dr Javier Ortega-Hernández, a paleobiologist at the University of Cambridge who co-led the research, said: “The armour comes in because during this behaviour it would be visually attractive and an easy target. Instead of hiding under a rock it defended itself by developing armour.” The fossils, discovered in Southern China’s Yunnan Province, date to the Cambrian period, when a diverse and sometimes bizarre array of life forms were rapidly emerging in the Earth’s oceans.These included the largest predator of the period, Anomalocaris, a giant shrimp-like creature that used two front prongs to rake up soft-bodied animals into a disc-like mouth of overlapping plates that crushed prey. Collinsium’s sharp spikes would have provided effective protection against such a grisly end, Ortega-Hernández said.“There were plenty of predators around which could snatch it, and with it being a soft-bodied animal it would be a tasty snack.”The authors describe Collinsium as one of the many “evolutionary experiments” of the Cambrian period; one which ultimately failed, as it has no direct ancestors living today. Its closest living relative is thought to be the velvet worm, which inhabits modern-day tropical forests.“Maybe they went extinct because of competition, or because they were so peculiar,” said Ortega-Hernández. “It’s a really rare animal, and very hard to preserve, but we don’t know basically – it’s really a big mystery.”The findings are published in the journal PNAS.
