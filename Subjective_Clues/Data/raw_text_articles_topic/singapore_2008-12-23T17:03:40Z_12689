Today's news from Singapore surely has all the ingredients of the classic disaster movie (apart from the fact that everyone thankfully escaped unharmed). One hundred and seventy-three pre-Christmas thrill-seekers were suspended in mid-air after the ferris wheel they were riding in broke down. After six hours enduring everything from vertigo to malfunctioning air conditioning, not to mention nowhere to go to the toilet, the passengers were eventually rescued. The trauma didn't end there - pictures of the event show the trapped revellers having to abseil down from the cabins.In the Air Tonight: Terror on the Singapore Flyer - or whatever you'd like to call it - would surely be a big hit on ITV come Boxing Day. With excitement like that, who needs Orson Welles and his cuckoo clock? All we need is a cast. Who would you pick to play the loveable old lady with a weak heart stuck in the highest cabin? Or the wimp who only took a ride in an attempt to try and overcome his vertigo? How about the stressed manufacturer everyone blames, or the heroic grease monkey who averts death at 541 feet? Names please!
