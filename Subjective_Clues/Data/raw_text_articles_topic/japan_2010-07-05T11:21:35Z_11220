Toyota has today started the recall of almost 92,000 luxury cars in its home country.The world's largest carmaker eventually expects to recall 270,000 Lexus and Crown vehicles worldwide in order to fix an engine problem that can cause them to stall.Only about 3,200 of the cars are on the roads in the UK, Toyota reckons, with 138,000 in the US, 15,000 in Europe, 10,000 in the Middle East, 6,000 in China, 4,000 in Canada, and 8,000 elsewhere. The recall will begin in other markets shortly.Seven models of Toyota's luxury Lexus range are involved in the recall, along with its Crown model. The car manufacturer has stressed that it is not aware of any crashes having been caused by the fault, although it has received 220 complaints.But the recall, costing an estimated ¥20bn (£150m), follows a series of safety problems that have dogged the Japanese car giant for the last 18 months.The firm has recalled millions of cars for reasons from the relatively minor – involving faulty window switches – to the potentially very dangerous – such as faulty accelerator pedals. Just last week it recalled 17,000 Lexus hybrid motors after testing showed fuel can spill during a rear-end crash.In September last year the firm announced the biggest recall in its history over fears, involving almost 4m vehicles in the US, that accelerator pedals could become trapped in floormats and "may result in very high vehicle speeds and make it difficult to stop the vehicle, which could cause a crash, serious injury or death". Five months later it recalled around 2.3m vehicles in the US to fix potentially faulty accelerator pedals.In April, Toyota was fined a record $16.4m (£11m) by the US transport department for its tardiness in responding to the crisis. Announcing the settlement, US transport secretary Ray LaHood said that "by failing to report known safety problems as it is required to do under the law, Toyota put consumers at risk".The Lexus models involved in the current recall are the LS460, LS600h, LS600hL, GS350, GS450h, GS460 and IS350.
