Police in Japan have launched a search for a British businessman who disappeared on his way to a meeting in Tokyo more than a week ago.Garin Dart, 40, chief executive of the event management firm Bluesilver, has not been heard from since the early afternoon of Wednesday 22 May.Dart, a former chef who moved to Japan 10 years ago, sent several texts to colleagues on his way to a work event at the Hilton hotel in the Tokyo district of Shinjuku. His last text arrived at about 1pm, apparently just before his battery ran out."He didn't show up, and there was nothing in his text messages to suggest that it was anything other than business as usual," said Bruno Dammizio, a part-owner of Bluesilver."This is the busiest time in the company's history, he was working extremely hard and under immense pressure, but there was nothing at all unusual about his behaviour or communications with his colleagues before he disappeared."Dart, who is married and has a four-year-old son, has not been arrested or admitted to hospital, police said. His credit cards and bank accounts have not been used in the past eight days.Dart's wife, Yukako, is expecting the couple's second child soon.Japanese police have launched an investigation, and police in Britain and Interpol have been alerted.A British embassy spokeswoman said: "We are aware of the case and are in touch with the father and the local authorities here."Dart, a Londoner, is well known among the expatriate community in Tokyo. Aside from running a successful events company, he is a co-founder of Foreign Volunteers Japan, which sent supplies and volunteers to the region devastated by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.Dart had been "working crazy hours" recently, Dammizio said, and was due to appear at about 30 business events in the coming month.Friends and colleagues are appealing for information on Facebook and Twitter."It's been eight days since he vanished from his professional and family life … we are shocked and very concerned," Dammizio said. "He is professional and family-oriented. This is totally out of character."
