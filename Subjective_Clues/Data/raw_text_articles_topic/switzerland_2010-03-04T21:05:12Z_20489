Ineos, the debt-laden chemical group that has just unveiled plans to move its headquarters from the UK to Switzerland to save tax, has itself been handed tens of millions of pounds in tax relief on the huge £6bn debt burden it used to fund its acquisition spree.Britain's biggest private company used borrowed money to aggressively grow a company that includes half of ICI, BP's former refining business and other unwanted businesses from the world's leading chemical groups.The revelation that Ineos, a sprawling company with more than 80 separate firms registered at Companies House, has made huge savings on its tax bill and is now on the point of leaving the UK has provoked fury from unions.The TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, said: "No UK company with a major domestic presence should be able to cut its tax bill simply by moving a tiny part of its operations overseas and pretending to no longer be a UK company."If HM Revenue & Customs does not already have enough powers to prevent this, then the government should change the law so that companies who rely on UK workers, knowhow and infrastructure to generate profits are contributing their fair share to the public finances."A spokesman for Ineos conceded that it had received tax relief on its debt provisions but denied it was "tax promiscuous" by taking advantage of generous arrangements to fund its growth and then decamping to a cheaper location.Ineos estimates that moving to Switzerland could save the company €450m (£406m) over the next five years. It is seeking permission from its lenders to make the move and is now conducting an internal review. No final decision has yet been made, the company stresses.Tom Crotty, chief executive of Ineos, said: "Many leading chemical companies have European or global operations resident in Switzerland and we need to compete effectively with them."We remain committed to the UK and our facilities will continue to play an essential part in the long-term growth of Ineos … The change of tax residence would allow us to increase investment to the benefit of all stakeholders in our business."In recent weeks, two big corporations, Diageo and Unilever, have threatened to leave the UK, citing high taxes. Already gone into tax exile are the advertising group WPP and the publisher Informa.A recent report by the EEF, the manufacturing organisation, hit out at the treatment of capital expenditure, which it argued failed to take into account advances in technology and the investment manufacturers need to remain competitive.The EEF also believes that the rising administrative and compliance burdens placed on business, the attitude of the tax authorities and uncertainty over the direction of tax policy all add a premium to doing business in the UK.Steve Radley, the EEF chief economist, said: "The government must ensure that the taxation of investment reflects the true costs of high-value manufacturing investment."Ineos was founded by Jim Ratcliffe in 1997. It has since snapped up chemicals plants around the world, including assets of Amoco, Bayer, Dow, Unilever and Union Carbide, and bought BP's refining business for $9bn (then £5bn). If quoted on the stock market, it would rank among the UK's top companies.The company has been under pressure over its high debt levels and last year renegotiated its bank covenants in a complicated arrangement involving 230 banks in a lending syndicate.Ineos has promised to repay a large chunk of borrowings by early next year. Interest on its refinanced debt is said to be 9%, according to reports.
