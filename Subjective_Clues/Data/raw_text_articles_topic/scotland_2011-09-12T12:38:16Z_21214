Scotland's NHS will switch its focus from new technology projects, to the benefits and outcomes they deliver to healthcare professionals in helping them redesign and improve services, the Scottish government has said.The government's new eHealth strategy for 2011-2017 outlines a number of key priorities to help patients get more engaged with the health service. These include:• The development of a national multi-channel strategy on 'citizen eHealth' to improve the range of contact that people can have with the NHS.• Use of electronic information portals by all health boards to provide essential information to front line staff, saving time and improving patient safety.• A new health and social care IT strategy in partnership with local authorities, which will help pave the way for improvements in information sharing between health and social care workers and see greater integration of health and social care services.• The establishment of programmes to replace paper with digital equivalents, along with digital dictation, voice recognition, scanning and videoconferencing by 2014.The document says that the Scottish government wants to continue to deliver successful eHealth technology to patients over the next six years, adding that there are a number of successful projects that patients have already benefited from. They include the Renal PatientView system, which allows renal patients to see their latest test results online and engage in tele-consultations with clinicians.The strategy stresses that the government wants to "exploit" the value of the new IT capabilities that were acquired as part of its previous eHealth strategy for 2008-11."The programme will be a revenue-based improvement programme leveraging the IT assets to support the quality improvements that NHS Scotland has committed itself to. From 2011-12, the majority of eHealth funding will be distributed to boards, rather than allocated on a project-by-project basis or spent centrally by the Scottish government," explains the document.It goes on to say that the recent review of public sector IT by John McClelland set out a challenging agenda of change for the public sector. The document says the government will strive to meet the objectives outlined in McClelland's report, which urged the health service to work with other parts of the public sector and to further embed national eHealth governance within the NHS to cover all ICT projects and services.|"The eHealth strategy board will engage with the wider national initiatives as they are developed and will report within six months on further development of the successful eHealth governance approaches," it adds.The document outlines five new strategic aims to be the focus of its activity over the next six years. They are: supporting people to communicate with NHS Scotland; contributing to care integration; improving medicines safety; enhancing the availability of information for staff; and maximising efficient work practices.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's health secretary, said: "Our new eHealth strategy will see boards put new technology in place that will give patients online access to their medical records, improve patient safety, allow NHS staff to share information appropriately and move us ever closer to a paper free NHS."Citizens are at the heart of this new strategy and I want to see the latest eHealth technology used right across the frontline services so they can see the full benefit."Scotland's new eHealth strategy follows significant investment in its health services over the last six months, particularly in areas such as telehealth and patient records.This article is published by Guardian Professional.
