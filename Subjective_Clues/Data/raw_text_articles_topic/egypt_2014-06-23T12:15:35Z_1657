The three Al-Jazeera journalists who have been jailed on trumped-up charges have been taken hostage by the Egyptian regime.They have been detained in order to intimidate both domestic and international journalists from doing their job. They did not spread false news. They did not support the Muslim Brotherhood.Their unjust arrests and sentences mean that no reporter is now safe in Egypt. Press freedom does not exist. Indeed, freedom of speech - freedom of any kind - is under threat too.Peter Greste, Mohammed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were simply carrying out their job when they were arrested on 29 December 2013. No evidence to the contrary was given to the court saying otherwise.The government of a newly elected president (and former army general), Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, proclaims it is a democracy or, at least, a democracy-in-the-making.But the court's decision illustrates that there is no separation of powers between the judiciary and the state. The judges have clearly acted politically.It is, as the National Union of Journalists' general secretary, Michelle Stanistreet, said today "an outrageous decision and travesty of justice made by a kangaroo court."And John Lyons, Middle East correspondent with The Australian, was right a week ago when he called the guilty verdict against Greste a scandal. He wrote: "I attended some of the 12 hearings in Cairo â€“ the trial was a complete farce. Even the judge at times seemed bemused." Across the net, journalists in Australia, the United States, Canada and Britain have expressed their outrage at the jailings of three innocent colleagues.Several contend that it makes a mockery of justice. But, of course, there is no justice in a country where thinly disguised military rule has replaced undisguised Islamic fundamentalism. There lies the extremely uncomfortable truth behind this sad situation.
