And I thought I had it bad. The fact that Barack Obama wants to actually keep his BlackBerry, and he thinks it will help him stay in touch with the outside world ... this is the worst case of crackberry addiction yet. No mistake, the president-elect may be the brightest man on earth – and the most popular too right now – but he is already showing signs of delusion if he figures the Blackberry will help keep him sane when he finally takes up residence in the White House.Does Michelle Obama share his enthusiasm for the little winking friend? When he's not saving America from economic meltdown, or hobnobbing with world leaders, or trying to bring peace to all men and women wherever they are, I suspect Michelle would rather he didn't spend his time fiddling with the BlackBerry. If anyone had a good reason to get rid of it, Barack has. The secret service says he should dump it. So do his lawyers. Every hacker in the world will be trying to break into it. But no – Barack is digging in his heels. Imagine the scene – it's the state banquet at Buck House, the Obamas are guest of honour at the top table, and her Maj is delivering the address to a room of assembled dignitaries and diplomats. Barack, meanwhile, is twiddling surreptitiously under the tablecloth, clicking his way to a top score on Brickbreaker.The inauguration is 10 days away, so there is still time. Help is at hand. Mr President-elect, put your BlackBerry in a drawer. Lock it, throw away the key. Drive somewhere a long way away and wait for the cold turkey to kick in. You'll be a better man – and president – if you do.
