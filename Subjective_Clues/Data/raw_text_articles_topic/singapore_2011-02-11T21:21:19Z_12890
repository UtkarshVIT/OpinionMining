Image: Marie Louise Ng, 26 January 2011 [velociraptorize].Nikon D3s, 500/F4 Question: This Singaporean mystery bird is so gorgeous it'll make your eyes bleed. Can you identify the species? If you can't, can you make a guess as to its taxonomic order? Response: This is an adult male orange-bellied flowerpecker, Dicaeum trigonostigma, also known as the orange-breasted Flowerpecker. This species is a songbird (passeriformes) -- probably a safe guess since half of all bird species are placed into this taxonomic order.
