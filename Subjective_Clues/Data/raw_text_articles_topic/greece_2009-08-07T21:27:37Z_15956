As seats of power go, it is pretty spectacular. It emerged today that Peter Mandelson has chosen to run the country from Nathaniel Rothschild's opulent villa overlooking the sparkling Ionian Sea in a secluded corner of Corfu.The business secretary is standing in for Gordon Brown for the next week but he is currently enjoying the hospitality of his banking heir friend in the exclusive parish of Kassiopi, which has become known as Kensington-on-Sea because of its attractiveness to Russian oligarchs, bankers and politicians.Last year, Mandelson's stay in the Rothschild's cream-turreted Greek holiday home descended into controversy when he was entertained on a yacht by Oleg Deripaska, the Russian aluminium billionaire, and dined on stuffed sardines with the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, at the nearby Agni taverna.This year, he is keeping a lower profile, even arriving on an easyJet flight."It looks like he's just going to stay on the Rothschild estate this time," said Nathan Pascoe, who owns Agni taverna. "There's about eight photographers and reporters camped out here waiting for him to come to dinner, but they're not going to get much more than a good suntan."Mandelson's temporary government-in-Greece emerged after Harriet Harman, who was in charge this week, left for a holiday in Italy and Downing Street was asked who was stepping in.Initially officials said Mandelson was taking over, even though he is not due back at his desk until Monday. Later they said that no minister was standing in for Brown over the weekend.The 72-hour gap between Harman's departure and Mandelson's return is particularly embarrassing because earlier this year No 10 circulated a memo around Whitehall saying every department had to have a minister on duty throughout the holiday period."The prime minister wants business to be fronted by ministers and expects duty ministers to be on duty in London or on departmental visits at all time," it said.Being the duty minister in Downing Street rarely involves calling the shots. They chair meetings, deal with routine business and are on hand in case there is an emergency, but Brown is at the other end of a telephone and nothing important is likely to be decided without him.An aide to Mandelson claimed that it had always been agreed that the business secretary would take over on Monday.Mandelson will be in charge for a week. Alistair Darling, the chancellor, and Jack Straw, the justice secretary, will both take the helm for a week each afterwards.
