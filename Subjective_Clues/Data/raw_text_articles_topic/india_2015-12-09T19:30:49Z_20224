Relations between Pakistan and India improved dramatically on Wednesday when the two sparring nuclear-armed neighbours agreed to unrestricted talks after years of disagreeing terms of any discussions of their numerous disputes.The diplomatic breakthrough by two countries that regularly exchange fire across their contested borders was announced at the end of a regional summit in Islamabad where officials also hinted at a possible revival of talks between the Afghan government and “Taliban groups”.The restarting of a “comprehensive bilateral dialogue” was announced by India’s top diplomat Sushma Swaraj, the first Indian foreign minister to visit Pakistan since 2012.High-ranking officials from the nuclear-armed neighbours have held precious few meetings since the election of Narendra Modi as prime minister of India in May 2014 given his government’s insistence that talks focus on battling terrorism and not the contested region of Kashmir, a key Pakistan concern.On Wednesday Swaraj not only met with Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, and his top foreign affairs adviser, but also agreed to start a dialogue process that would include Kashmir and other border disputes.Pakistan said it was taking steps to bring about the “early conclusion” of the stalled trial of those involved in the 2008 terror attacks on Mumbai, India’s financial capital, which was masterminded by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani militant group.Earlier in the day Swaraj told representatives of 31 countries gathered for the Heart of Asia conference on the future of Afghanistan that it was time for India and Pakistan to display “the maturity and self-confidence to do business with each other and strengthen regional trade and cooperation”.She added: “The entire world is waiting and rooting for a change. Let us not disappoint them.”The change in tack had been presaged by a closed-door meeting in Bangkok on Sunday between the two countries’ national security advisers, which itself followed an informal conversation between Modi and Sharif on the sidelines of the Paris climate change conference the week before.Analysts said India softened its position after a string of state elections when it was in the interest of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party to strike a hawkish, populist line against Pakistan.
