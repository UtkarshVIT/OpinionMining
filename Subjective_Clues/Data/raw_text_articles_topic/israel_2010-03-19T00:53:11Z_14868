After a week of unusually strained relations between the closest of allies, it is Binyamin Netanyahu who appears to have blinked first.Having embarrassed the US by revealing plans to build 1,600 houses in East Jerusalem during a visit by vice president Joe Biden, Israel has offered to soften its housing policy for the hotly contested area of the city.The housing plan provoked violence from Palestinians this week, who claim East Jerusalem as their own, and was seen as a snub to the Obama administration, which is determined to sponsor a new round of Israel-Palestine talks after a year of impasse.Israel claims Jerusalem as its capital, a situation not recognised by the international community.To the dismay of rightwingers in his party Netanyahu apologised for the timing of the announcement. But on Wednesday President Obama was forced to play down suggestions of a crisis between the two countries.However both he and his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, have deployed unusually strong language towards Israel, raising questions about the traditionally rock-strong alliance.The situation was not helped by Netanyahu's brother-in-law who said Obama was "anti-Semitic".Last night Netanyahu revised his construction policy for East Jerusalem, proposing "trust-building measures" with the Palestinians. The US is Israel's main donor of financial and military aid.
