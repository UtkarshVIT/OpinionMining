Spanish authorities have warned the country's youth against a homemade drug that has killed two people and put another two in hospital.Two 18-year-olds died and a 20-year-old fell seriously ill after they were given a drug brewed from the leaf of the thorn apple plant at a rave in the Madrid commuter town of Getafe on 21 August.Seeds and leaves from the thorn apple, which is also known as devil's trumpet or devil's weed, are hallucinogenic and dangerous – though scientists warn that the whole plant, including its flowers, can seriously damage health.Side-effects include an increased pulse, muscular twitches, diarrhoea, convulsions, coma and death.The thorn apple comes from the same family of plants as belladonna, otherwise known as deadly nightshade.A man was released on bail on Monday to await trial on homicide charges. Spanish newspapers said he had been trying to "create a market" for the drug by giving it away.A fourth victim was admitted to hospital in Badajoz, western Spain, in a coma over the weekend after taking the drug. He came out of his coma on Monday. Dr Elena Gálvez of Badajoz's Infanta Cristina hospital said: "Even though the patient is progressing, he is still fighting for his life."The mayor of Getafe has ordered municipal staff to destroy the plant, which grows wild, wherever they find it. Town halls elsewhere in Spain have issued similar orders.
