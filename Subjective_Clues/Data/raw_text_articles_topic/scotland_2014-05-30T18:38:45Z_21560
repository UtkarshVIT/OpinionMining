John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, said new evidence about the impact of a high level of foreign ownership on Scotland's wealth had made the case for independence even stronger.Swinney said a Guardian special report on the high level of foreign and UK control over significant parts of the Scottish economy had established that Scotland needed new tax, economic and borrowing powers to keep its wealth within the country and to boost domestic industry."Anyone looking at these figures, who recognises that the people of Scotland are not receiving the full benefit of our wealth, must surely accept that this has come about at a time when decisions about Scotland are not made by the people of Scotland," Swinney wrote for the Guardian's Comment is Free. "I have no doubt that with the powers to make those decisions in Scotland we could do a better job."A study by Glasgow University academics, commissioned by the Guardian, found that Scotland's actual wealth – the money kept within the country – was up to $5,000 (£2,990) per head lower than the GDP figures repeatedly cited by Alex Salmond, the first minister, and the Yes Scotland campaign in its drive for independence.It also emerged, in a separate Guardian investigation, that almost none of the North Sea oil from Scottish waters is owned by Scottish companies, while more than 80% of whisky and salmon production is foreign-owned, and only a third of the Scottish-based finance sector is Scottish-owned.Scottish government statisticians have disputed the findings by two academics at the University of Glasgow, John McLaren and Jo Armstrong, that the actual wealth is as low as $5,000 by looking at the gross national income (GNI), which assesses the money kept inside a country rather than GDP. They said their own methodology, in which the wealth falls by $2,000 when using GNI rather than GDP, is more robust.Swinney said any of those figures established that Scotland was in the top 20 of world economies, but it could do better. "The reality is that while we are a wealthy country, for too many people in Scotland it does not feel that way," he said. "Our economy is strong, but we need the powers to create more opportunities and build greater security. That is one of the key drivers behind our argument for independence. The very fact that we have high levels of ownership in Scotland from the rest of the UK and overseas, that Scotland has a lower rate of business start-ups, research and development and corporate HQs – particularly when compared to other similar sized countries - is to my mind an indictment of the status quo."Alistair Carmichael, the Scottish secretary, said the new assessment of Scotland's national income raised profound questions about the Scottish government's case for independence, in a week where its oil forecasts had been downgraded and it refused to publish any costings for setting up a new independent state."The past couple of days have shown the economics of independence in a stark and unforgiving light," he said.The dispute came as the referendum campaigns entered the official and legally controlled, 16-week referendum campaign period, with a weekend of intensive doorstep canvassing and leafletting, and street stalls. The lead pro-independence campaign, Yes Scotland, which is trailing in the polls by between five and 20 points, has plans for 150 events this weekend.Better Together says donations since then have soared, buoyed in large part by a reaction against the substantial gifts by the Weirs to the Yes campaign and Scottish National party, which have now totalled £5.5m since 2011.Further funding details are not expected from either campaign until formally published by the Electoral Commission this summer, but their current declarations show they have spent a minimum of £4.66m already on campaigning, office costs and staffing.A large number of smaller campaigns, a majority of which are expected to be backing independence, will be registered with the Electoral Commission, pushing the potential spending up by several million pounds more. Each of those will be allowed to spend up to £150,000 each.Ten of these other campaigns are now formally registered by the Electoral Commission, including the pro-independence National Collective group of young artists, the pro-yes Scottish Socialist party and the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which wants independence to help close the Trident nuclear base on the Clyde.One pro-UK campaign, Vote No Borders, has already spent more than £250,000 on a series of cinema, newspaper and billboard adverts and filming anti-independence voters, and is planning to spend its full legal limit of £150,000 during the regulated period by raising further funds.Stuart Campbell, a pro-independence blogger at Wings over Scotland, who has applied to be registered as a Yes campaigner, has already raised £155,000 for his website, campaigning and opinion polling. He has calculated that smaller and fringe pro-independence groups have raised at least £345,000 from public appeals since February 2013.
