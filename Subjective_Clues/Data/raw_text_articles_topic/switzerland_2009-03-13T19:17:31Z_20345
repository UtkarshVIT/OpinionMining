Switerland's decision today to play by international tax rules is the result of a great deal of political arm-twisting, aided by the sting of scandal.The long struggle to persuade the Swiss to abandon their banking secrecy is not yet over. There is still plenty of room for foot-dragging and hair-splitting and it is likely to be several years before any information is actually exchanged. But today was important.In accepting the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) principles for the exchange of information on tax, the Swiss finally abandoned their insistence on a single, all-important legal point: that tax evasion is not a crime unless it involves active fraud, such as the forgery of paperwork.They will continue to treat evasion by their own citizens as a civil matter but finally, for foreigners, they have agreed in principle to provide on request the details of wealthy individuals and corporations who have income originating in Switzerland.The Swiss moved primarily because they were faced with the deeply undesirable prospect of finding themselves on a blacklist of unco-operative tax havens, due to be announced at the G20 meeting in London in April.This was not simply a threat of being named and shamed but, as the Guardian revealed this month, of being subjected to serious economic sanctions designed to drive away billions of dollars of their banking business. Since Switzerland earns 15% of its GDP from the finance sector, this threat made an impression.In the background, Switzerland's political authority has been severely weakened by the US investigation into one of its oldest and most prestigious banks, UBS, which has been caught brazenly helping thousands of wealthy Americans evade taxes.UBS staff have also been breaking the US law that forbids foreign bankers to tout for business, writing lies on their visa forms about the purpose of their visits to the US, carrying business cards that concealed their true profession and deploying counter-surveillance techniques.Even so, Switzerland continued to resist, arguing it simply could not afford to change its ways because it would lose so much business to other havens. But in a cleverly worked piece of diplomacy the OECD has persuaded all its main competitors – Liechtenstein, Singapore, Hong Kong, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg – to announce over the past 48 hours that they too would agree to provide information on tax evaders.But this remains only one battle in a long war against tax dodgers. No information will be disclosed until the Swiss have negotiated detailed double-taxation agreements with other nations.That process could take several years. The Swiss are indicating they will hand over information only if a detailed request is submitted and if that request complies with their own procedures. They are also calling for a "grandfather clause" that would allow them to continue to conceal all information about accounts or investments made with them in the past. Since Swiss banks are believed to hold something like a third of the estimated $11.5tn of personal wealth hidden offshore, this would knock a very big hole in yesterday's announcement.One source suggested this was simply a PR gesture to persuade existing account holders to stay. Bruno Gurtner, the Swiss economist who chairs the global board of the Tax Justice Network, welcomed today's announcement but warned nothing would change until the new treaties were negotiated."In the meantime, people with accounts in Switzerland have the chance to move their money away to other havens that still do not accept the principles," he said.
