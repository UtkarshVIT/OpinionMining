The family of a boy killed when his father jumped with him from a hotel balcony reacted angrily today after a Greek court ruled he will be freed.John Hogan, who killed his six-year-old son Liam after jumping from a Crete hotel balcony with him in his arms, has been receiving treatment at a psychiatric unit since he was cleared of murder on the island last year.The Bristolian will soon become a free man after a Greek court "granted a request for his release" this morning, a Foreign Office source said.Liam's family said the prospect of Hogan's return to the UK was "simply horrendous".Brian Chandler, the stepfather of Liam's mother Natasha Visser, said he was concerned for the recovery of Visser and her young daughter, Mia, who was also badly injured after plunging with the pair.In a statement, he said: "The prospect of John Hogan returning after just 16 months of a recommended minimum (by a very lenient Greek Court) of three years detention in a psychiatric unit is simply horrendous."He will, if current press is correct, return, having pushed two children off a fourth floor balcony, as a completely free man."As he has no conviction of any kind against him, he will therefore be free to travel the world, if he chooses, in search of Mia, the daughter he tried to kill. This is a 'child protection' issue which we intend to continue to pursue."He said the family were still dissatisfied with the original verdict to find him not guilty of murder on psychiatric grounds in January last year.He added: "We are totally dissatisfied with the Greek court who reached a 'not guilty' verdict in a murder trial in just one and a half days, without calling a single eye witness, and without establishing the basic fact that John Hogan had pushed both children off the balcony."The family went on to attack the Crown Prosecution Service for not retrying Hogan in the UK.The statement went on: "Although they (the CPS) have the power to retry John Hogan in the UK, have so far chosen not to."
