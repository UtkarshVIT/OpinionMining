Three decades after the Red Army Faction terrorised Germany with a campaign of murders, hijackings and bomb attacks, the last major trial involving one its members opens today, when prosecutors will seek to end the mystery of one the group's most prominent killings.Verena Becker, one of the leading members of the RAF – also known as the Baader-Meinhof gang – is due to answer charges that she was involved in the murder of the country's leading public prosecutor, Siegfried Buback, 33 years ago.Becker, 58, had already spent years in prison for other RAF-related crimes including murder, but the case against her was reopened in 2008 after forensic evidence not available to investigators in the late 1970s revealed traces of her DNA on a letter in which the RAF claimed responsibility for Buback's death.She was rearrested last summer, and charged earlier this year with involvement in Buback's murder as well as that of two of his companions who died when the car he was travelling in was sprayed with bullets in the south-western city of Karlsruhe in April 1977.The case has reawakened memories of the bloody RAF campaign that traumatised the country throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Prosecutors hope that the trial will finally uncover the truth about the Buback murder, most notably who pulled the trigger of the gun that killed him, and lay to rest decades of tangled rumour and elaborate conspiracy theories. The RAF disbanded in 1998.The trial, which is taking place in Stuttgart and is expected to last until December, is likely to be an emotional one due to the involvement of Buback's son, Michael, who has extensively researched the murder himself and is convinced that Becker was the "petite woman" witnesses saw on the back of the motorbike from which the fatal shots were fired.He also believes that Becker was given special protection by influential figures in the security authorities in return for her co-operation.Becker was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1977 for involvement in other RAF activities, but was pardoned and freed after 12 years.The judge will be called on to take into account intriguing new evidence that is likely to complicate the trial: the defence will present documents suggesting that Becker may not have been in Germany at the time of the murder, but rather in Baghdad.Becker, who after leaving prison trained as an alternative practitioner and now lives in a lakeside district in the most expensive quarter of Berlin and is dependent on state support, is expected to use her right to remain silent throughout the trial. She is understood to have made a pact with other former RAF members at a meeting in 2007 that none of them would reveal details of their alleged crimes.At the time of her arrest she said she had given up her fight, which she referred to as her "former path"."I gave it up a long time ago, because it only caused a lot more suffering," she told investigators.
