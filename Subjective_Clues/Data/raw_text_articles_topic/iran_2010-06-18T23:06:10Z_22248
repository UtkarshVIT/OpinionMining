I read the article by Timothy Garton Ash (Iran's tortured Green movement is down but not out, 10 June) with great interest, a lot of respect and little empathy. What I did agree with wholeheartedly was the sentiment in the final paragraph which suggests that whatever we do, we should do no harm. This highly honourable ideal seems at a variance with almost every other sentiment expressed.I was visiting Iran about a year ago, at the time of the run-up to the contentious elections. I drove thousands of miles around Iran, not specifically visiting large cities like Tehran and Tabriz but staying within my comfort zone and talking to my type of person. (I have passable if basic Farsi.) The opinions of these people were almost universally in support of the establishment. I had been warned to stay clear of politics and religion, but it was these subjects that people wanted to talk about and those of my type that I talked to held these established views. My type of people are my type of socialists. Mucky-handed, hard-grafting socialists who are as far removed from the intellectual ideal as the Guardian is from the Daily Worker. If we feel the need to bang the drum of democracy and universal suffrage then we must be prepared for the occasional disappointment.The highly vocal and media-savvy opinion of the academic and intellectual is worth exactly the same as the opinion of a farmer or truck driver who does not have the opportunity or the inclination to seek out an audience for his opinion. Iran, outside Tehran, is a safe country with high morals and a code of civil conduct that we must admire and respect and may in fact be envious of. I don't know what the legitimate government of Iran should consist of, but in the light of our own recent experiences I really doubt that we should be listening only to the loudest voices.Richard HardistyAppleton-le-Moors, North Yorkshire
