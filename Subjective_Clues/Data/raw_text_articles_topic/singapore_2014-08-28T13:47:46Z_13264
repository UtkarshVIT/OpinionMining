The city-state of Singapore may be very small in absolute terms, but commercially there’s no question it punches above its weight. Often referred to as one of the four Asian Tigers, a recent PwC report said that it is set to replace Switzerland as the wealth management capital of the world by 2015. Significantly, it is the Asian regional hub for a huge range of multinationals, and a reason why Brand Learning selected it as its third international office.Singapore sets out to attract companies with a safe business environment, significant tax breaks and its perception as a relatively safe and stable country in a region that can still be volatile in places – recent events in Thailand being a case in point.It offers a professional, well-educated, well-travelled population. A meeting there is usually no different to one in London or New York, without any of the cultural differences of places like Japan, and English is the first language when doing business.Singapore has been very active in promoting a multiracial society and most people are very supportive of this. There are naturally some tensions under the surface, due to the large population of immigrant workers and a government that has high standards (you can get arrested for littering), but they don’t greatly affect business.However, it’s not just about attracting global firms. Major local businesses abound – including Singapore Airlines, Tiger Beer and Singtel, all of which have expanded without bringing in lots of expats in to manage them. And as might be expected, its banking sector is enormously strong with both global players and local institutions like DBS and the Overseas Development Bank of China.Marketing in Singapore is twofold: marketing within Singapore itself and its use by brands as an Asian regional hub. The former crosses wide-ranging sectors, as Singapore is a major market for financial services and tourism. It’s also seen as a reliable medical destination, as demand for health and medicines is growing and Singapore has positioned itself as a centre for care.Local marketing is reasonably advanced, reflecting the well-educated and travelled population. There is high internet and smartphone penetration and a lot of expatriates – both western and Asian – are based there.While the big global firms traditionally brought in a lot of western expats, this has become much less prevalent – they’re now looking more to Asian nations like India and China to recruit.Looking at Singapore as a regional marketing hub, digital technologies are making a huge difference to how brands work across Asia. It’s the primary channel in China; more than 78% of South Koreans use smartphones (a staggering 97% of 18- to 24-year-olds); and the Philippines is the world champion for SMS users.That said, pan-Asian marketers have to wrestle with the fact that there is also a large and unsophisticated rural market as opposed to purely urban city audiences: in other words, there are bottom-of-pyramid consumers as well as more sophisticated ones.This leads to different types of communication, such as a heavy use of TV for rural audiences and a much higher use of mobile overall. It’s not about changing brand strategy but leveraging different channels appropriately to the target consumers.Singapore is a marketing capability case study in its own right in how it positions itself in the region. In consumer marketing, it has created a brand reputation for tourism, building two major casinos in the last few years, a world-class indoor garden (Gardens by the Bay), upgrading its zoo, acquiring an aquarium and even constructing a “Universal Studios”.It has cleverly marketed itself as a unique destination for Asian tourists, targeting the new rising middle class looking for world-class experiences. It is positioned as the place to come for facilities, entertainment and shopping in particular – with a retail environment that consists of huge malls designed to excite and entice shoppers.And when it comes to Singapore’s own global brands, some of these have developed world-class campaigns that have secured international acclaim, while being built around very Singaporean themes.As an example, Singaporeans feel a strong affinity for their hawker food (outdoor cooked food courts), which is culturally very important. Singtel even set up a challenge to vote for the best local hawker food store, getting 2.5 million votes out of a population of 5 million.The competition narrowed it down to three stalls and challenged Gordon Ramsay to cook a favourite Singaporean dish as an “us against them” – and the local chefs won!And clearly when it comes to B2B marketing, the capabilities cultivated by the government in attracting businesses to the region are world-beating.As noted above, given Singapore’s primary function as a regional hub – Monday to Thursday many professionals spend a great deal of time travelling around Asia. It’s thus quite hard to view Singapore in isolation culturally. However, some trends have become evident:• It is a small city with a huge population – everyone knows each other and networking is hugely valuable. It’s worth spending time face to face and investing in relationships; it’s one of the few global locations where it is actually possible to squeeze in six external meetings in one day, such is the geography and efficiency of the infrastructure.• People are very keen to meet and learn from colleagues. Even really senior people tend to welcome you warmly, whether they’re expats or local.• However there is a much longer purchase cycle than in the West, so people have to be patient and invest in relationships – business does not happen overnight – respect must be earned.• There is always a war for talent and therefore a need for creating common ways of working and investing in people development as a lever for retention, but it’s not as extreme as in China or Indonesia.Harriet de Swiet is a partner at Brand Learning.To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, sign up free for Media Network membership.All Guardian Media Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled ‘Advertisement feature’.
