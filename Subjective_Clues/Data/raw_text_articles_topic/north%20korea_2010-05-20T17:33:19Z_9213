North and South Korea are still technically at war. No peace treaty was signed after their three-year conflict which ended in an armistice in 1953. The border dividing the peninsula is one of the most heavily militarised in the world.North Korea has a million-strong army and enough plutonium for six to eight nuclear weapons, according to US experts. It says it is now enriching uranium, an alternative ingredient for nuclear bombs.However, it has yet to develop the technology to place a nuclear weapon on a missile and, so far, its nuclear programme and missile tests are motivated by a policy of intimidation and defiance, analysts believe. North Korea last year test-fired a series of at least four surface-to-ship cruise missiles and Scud-type ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan.They were also seen as a response to the international community, including a UN resolution that any nation can inspect a North Korean vessel that the investigating nation believes is carrying weapons.On a more conventional level, in addition to its army of some million personnel, North Korea has nearly 190,000 "security troops", including border guards, and 3.5m "worker/peasant red guard reservists", according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) annual Military Balance.The army and air force has 620 combat aircraft, many of them old and of Soviet design. More significantly perhaps, in light of the sinking of the South Korean corvette, the Cheonan, North Korea is listed as having 43 submarines which are armed with torpedoes. It has only eight principal main naval surface boats.South Korea has an army of some 690,000 but 4.5m reservists, according to the IISS. It has 13 submarines, 10 destroyers and 490 combat aircraft, mainly of US design and more capable than North Korea's aircraft. South Korea is also investing in a US Aegis destroyer-based anti-missile system and new early warning radars.South Korea was put on high alert a year ago amid fears that the North was about to provoke a clash in the contested waters of the Yellow Sea.
