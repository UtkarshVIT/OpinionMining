I have just been landed with an outrageous amount for a three-minute reverse-charge call made by my son from Brazil in an emergency. They have charged me £117.77 on top of my usual bill, and I am desperate since I am unemployed at the moment. Is this a normal tariff for a three-minute call? SM, LondonReverse-charge international calls are notoriously expensive and this was no exception. BT explained that "collect calls" (reverse-charge calls) are charged in one minute blocks with a five-minute minimum. It says your son made two calls one of three minutes and another one of four minutes, which, because of this formula, were charged at the same five-minute price. The fees for collect calls at the time of the calls was £8.76 per minute, plus a facility fee of £15 per call.BT has agreed, as a gesture of goodwill, to recalculate the calls using the cost of a direct-dial call to Brazil. This totals £35.91 so, taking that off the £117.77, it has credited your account with £81.86.Next time your son is abroad you might want to tell him not to make a reverse-charge call and instead, if he has a mobile, to text you and ask you to call him back on a landline number.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
