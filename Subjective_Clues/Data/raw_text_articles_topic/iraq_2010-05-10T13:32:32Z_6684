Bombings and shootings by Iraqi insurgents killed up to 55 people today in a co-ordinated series of 20 attacks on civilians, police and security forces in Baghdad and beyond.Armed men used silenced and automatic weapons, roadside bombs and cars packed with explosives to hit six checkpoints manned by local and federal police and the Iraqi national army in the capital.The worst single incident was a car bombing outside a textiles factory in the central city of Hilla, 60 miles south of Baghdad, which left 20 dead. A double bomb attack near a mosque in Suwayra, south-east of the capital, killed 11 people and wounded 70. Attacks were also reported from Falluja and Mosul.No immediate claims of responsibility were made, but violence has been on the rise in recent months, especially in the capital, after attacks dropped significantly since 2006 and 2007 when the post-invasion sectarian conflict was at its height.The latest attacks were seen as a show of force from weakened Sunni insurgents after Iraqi government forces, backed by US troops, dealt a series of blows to al-Qaida's Iraqi network in recent weeks.The bloodshed was seen as underlining the danger of a power vacuum after parliamentary elections on 7 March left no clear winner, with wrangling by rival political blocs to form a coalition leaving an atmosphere of uncertainty. Analysts warn of the dangers of a backlash by Shia militia which have so far resisted counter-attacks.Iraqiyya, the cross-sectarian alliance led by the former prime minister Ayad Allawi, a secular Shia, benefited from strong support from Sunnis to take a two-seat lead in the vote. But the main Shia-led coalitions, supported by Iran, have agreed to form an alliance that could block Allawi's hopes of forming the next government, alarming Sunnis who have felt disenfranchised since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003.The election was seen as a potential turning point for Iraq as it seeks to attract urgently needed foreign investment and develop its vast oilfields while US forces prepare to withdraw.Today's incidents come after the number of Iraqis killed in April fell slightly month-on-month but was almost unchanged from a year ago. Figures compiled by the health, interior and defence ministries showed that 328 people – 274 civilians, 39 police and 15 soldiers – died as a result of attacks in April, only slightly fewer than the 355 killed 12 months ago. April's death toll, however, was down slightly on March, when 367 people were killed in unrest.
