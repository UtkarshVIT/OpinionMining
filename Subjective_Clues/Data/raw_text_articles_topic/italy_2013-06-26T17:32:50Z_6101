The Italian government has approved a package of measures it hopes will help bring down high levels of youth unemployment as the eurozone's third-largest economy continues to limp through a two-year recession.Faced with 42% of 15- to 24-year-olds out of work, the prime minister, Enrico Letta, identified the "plague" of youth joblessness as one of his coalition government's priorities. At a press conference on Wednesday he said he hoped measures including tax breaks for employers who hire certain under-30s on permanent contracts would boost young people's prospects.At the same time the package was aimed at easing the employment of people on temporary contracts, and stimulating training, apprentice and internship schemes. Letta said the majority of the €1.5bn effort – a mixture of national and European structural funds – would be particularly focused on the south of Italy, where general unemployment is higher than the national average and joblessness among the young is particularly severe, at over 35%, according to Istat, the national statistics agency.He said the government estimated that around 200,000 young people would be helped into work over the next 18 months as a result of the measures, adding that they allowed him to go to a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Friday with "solid arguments to fight a great battle, a European battle".
