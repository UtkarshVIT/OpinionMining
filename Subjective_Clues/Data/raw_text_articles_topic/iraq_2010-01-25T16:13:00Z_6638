Ali Hassan al-Majid, better known as Chemical Ali, was executed today for crimes against humanity in Iraq's highest profile execution since Saddam Hussein was hanged three years ago."The death sentence against Ali Hassan al-Majid has been carried out," said Ali al-Dabbagh, an Iraqi government spokesman.Dabbagh said Majid was not subjected to any abuse during the execution – unlike Saddam, who was taunted on the gallows in December 2006."Everyone abided by the government's instructions and the convicted was not subjected to any breach, chanting, abuse words or insults," Dabbagh said.The 68-year-old former spy chief and first cousin of Saddam had been sentenced to death on 17 January for ordering the gassing of more than 5,000 Kurds in the northern Iraqi town of Halabja near the Iranian border in 1988. Other officials in Saddam's regime have received jail terms for their roles in the attack.Majid, one of Saddam's most notorious henchmen during the brutal three-decade reign of the Ba'athists, had received three previous death sentences for atrocities committed during Saddam's rule, particularly in government campaigns against the Kurds in the 1980s and the Shias in the 1990s.Majid first ordered the use of chemical weapons – mustard gas, sarin and VX – in 1987, culminating in the attack on Halabja. By the end of the Kurdish campaign in 1988 about 4,000 villages had been destroyed, an estimated 180,000 Kurds killed and about 1.5 million deported.He was nicknamed Chemical Ali by Iraqi Kurds, who also called him the Butcher of KurdistanMajid was captured after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Convicted in June 2007, he was sentenced to death for crimes committed in the al-Anfal campaign against the Kurds. His appeal was rejected on 4 September 2007 and he was sentenced to death for the fourth time, by hanging, on 17 January 2010.Majid, who owed his rise to family ties with Saddam, played a key role in the purge of the Ba'ath party in 1979, when Saddam, formally installed as head of state, sat on the stage of an auditorium and watched "traitors" being led away to their deaths after their names were called out.In August 1990, after the invasion of Kuwait, Majid was appointed him military governor of what Saddam considered to be Iraq's "19th province". But Saddam replaced him three months later for fear his brutal reputation was strengthening the hand of Kuwait's allies. When Iraqi forces were pushed out of Kuwait by a US-led coalition, Majid was appointed interior minister to help stamp out the Shia rebellion in southern Iraq.• This article was amended on Wednesday 27 January 2010. Saddam Hussein was executed three, not five years ago. This has been corrected.
