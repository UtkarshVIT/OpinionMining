Prosecutions began yesterday against six people accused of deliberately contaminating milk supplies with a toxic chemical believed to have made as many as 300,000 infants sick and killed at least six. The suspects include Zhang Yujun, described by state press as the "Mr Big of Poison", who is said to have manufactured and sold nitrogen-rich melamine to milk traders in the northern Hebei province for over a year, thereby allowing them to foil mandatory protein content tests. Zhang is accused of selling around 600 tons of a homemade melamine mixture between July 2007 and August 2008, earning 6.8m yuan (Â£678,000) from a product he knew to be poisonous, Xinhua news agency said. Tian Wenhua, the sacked chairwoman of the Sanlu Group, the bankrupt dairy firm at the centre of the scandal, will be tried with other members of staff in Shijiazhuang, in Hebei Province, over the next week, accused of "selling fake and low-quality products". Legal experts have said that she could face the death penalty. Melamine, used in the manufacture of industrial products including plastics, fertilisers, glues and flame retardants, boosts protein readings in poor-quality milk. Insiders have said that the problems in the dairy industry remain systemic. At present, there are no incentives for collectors - who drive trucks to "milk stations" before selling supplies on to the dairies - to ensure that their loads have not been contaminated by "rogue" operators. Although the Sanlu Group is the only firm directly implicated in the scandal, the products of several other big Chinese dairy firms have also been contaminated. China's Food Safety Law, originally scheduled to come into effect earlier this year, is expected to be submitted to the country's legislature in February 2009.
