North Korea has confirmed it fired artillery near its disputed sea border with South Korea this morning and said it would continue with its military exercises.It had earlier designated no-sail zones in the zone, off its western coast. The statement from the general staff of the Korean People's Army said that such drills "will go on in the same waters in the future, too".Earlier, Seoul's joint chiefs of staff said the north had fired approximately 30 rounds of land-based artillery, prompting the south to fire around 100 warning shots from a base on an island nearby. An officer said the north's shots landed on its own side of the border, while the south fired into the air. No casualties or damage were reported.A brief skirmish along the line in November is believed to have left one North Korean sailor dead and three others wounded. The border also saw fatal naval clashes in 1999 and 2002.The incident comes amid recent friction between the two sides but also signs of a potential rapprochement.Pyongyang accused the south of declaring war after South Korean defence minister Kim Tae-young said last week that his military should launch a pre-emptive strike if there was a clear indication that the north was preparing a nuclear attack.But earlier this month Pyongyang offered talks on restarting joint tour programmes and on developing their joint industrial complex. It has also signalled it could return to the six-party aid-for-disarmament talks.It is thought that tightened sanctions in the wake of the country's missile and nuclear tests last year have hit the already struggling economy."North Korea may want to return to the six-party talks, but only to ease pressure on itself and gain more economic assistance, which it really needs now," Zhang Liangui, an expert on North Korea at Beijing's Central Party School, told Reuters."So North Korea wants to control the pace of contacts with South Korea and the United States. Incidents such as this are a way for it to show that it can control how and when there is any progress."Pyongyang has said a precondition for returning to the talks would be discussions on a peace deal with the United States to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war, which concluded with an armistice, but not a treaty. It also wants sanctions to be lifted.
