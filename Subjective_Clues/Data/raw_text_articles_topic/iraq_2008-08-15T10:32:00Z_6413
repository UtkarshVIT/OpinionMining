Should George Bush feel vindicated in his decision to invade Iraq five years ago, now that the situation in Iraq - particularly Basra - is improving?No doubt as he leaves the White House, Bush will argue that a more stable Iraq justifies his decision to topple Saddam Hussein. The US president is bound to repeat the mantra that the world is better off without Saddam. The dramatisation House of Saddam is a useful reminder of what a nasty piece of work he was, not to mention his pathological elder son, Uday.The debate is more than academic, as Iraq represents a clear division between the two US presidential hopefuls. Barack Obama opposed the war from the start, as well as the surge, while his Republican rival, John McCain, backed the surge and is more inclined to give Bush the benefit of the doubt on invading in the first place.But one leading US commentator is adamant the costs of invading Iraq have outweighed any benefits. Francis Fukuyama of End of History fame wrote in the Wall Street Journal yesterday:"By invading Iraq in the manner it did, the US exacerbated all of the threats it faced prior to 2003. Recruitment into terrorist cells shot up all over the world. North Korea and Iran accelerated their development of nuclear weapons. Iran has emerged as the dominant regional power in the Persian Gulf once the US removed its major rival from the scene and put its Shi'ite clients into power in Baghdad. While everyone is better off without Saddam Hussein around, the cost was hugely disproportionate. If you don't believe this, ask yourself whether Congress would ever have voted to authorise the war in 2002 if it knew there was no WMD, or that there would be trillion-dollar budget outlays, or that there would be 30,000 dead and wounded after five years of bitter struggle."Fukuyama then goes on to make the point that after having invaded Iraq, the US does not have much of a leg to stand on in "trying to rally opposition to Russia on the basis of international law and norms constraining the strong from using force against the weak".Interestingly, this neo-conservative goes on to throw his vote behind Obama rather than McCain because the Democrat does not share "McCain's instinctive reliance on hard power as the primary instrument for dealing with messy questions of terrorism and proliferation in the broader Middle East".This is an edited extract from The Wrap, guardian.co.uk's digest of the day's papers
