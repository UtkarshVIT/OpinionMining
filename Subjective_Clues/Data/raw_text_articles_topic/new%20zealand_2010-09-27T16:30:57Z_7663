New Zealand plans to tighten controls on foreign land purchases amid fears that the Chinese acquisition of local farms may not be in the country's strategic interests.The new rules were announced today after a fierce public backlash against a Hong Kong-listed firm that attempted to buy New Zealand's biggest private dairy farm.Natural Dairy – previously known as the China Jin Hui Mining Corporation – offered to pay NZ$1.5bn for farmland, cattle and milk powder production plants, according to the domestic media.This bid for the Crafer family's farms – now under review – has stirred up considerable concern in a country that depends on the dairy industry for almost a quarter of its export earnings.New Zealand's farmers warn that state-backed Chinese investors are taking advantage of the economic downturn to buy land cheaply, so that they are in a strong position for a sharp rise in global population and demand for food. China already feeds a fifth of the world's population on less than a tenth of the planet's arable land.The Federated Farmers of New Zealand say planned Chinese purchases of arable land are unfair because foreign firms are forbidden from acquiring similarly large swathes of farmland in China.Under the new rules, the government will introduce extra tests on overseas investment applications for "sensitive land". The buy-ups will have to be judged in relation to the nation's economic interests before approval.Finance minister Bill English said the measures aimed to strike a balance. "It's important that we welcome beneficial foreign investment and recognise the positive contribution it makes to New Zealand through increased jobs, capital and access to export markets," English said. "At the same time, the government recognises there are genuine public concerns about aspects of certain types of overseas investment."The measure, which comes into effect at the end of the year, highlights growing anxiety about cross-border land acquisitions. China is not the only country looking to increase its holdings of arable land overseas. Saudi Arabia, Japan and South Korea are among the other nations bidding for farm property in New Zealand, Australia, Ethiopia and elsewhere.Earlier this year, the Observer reported that the total area being bought up by rich nations was more than double the size of the UK. A recent forecast rise in food prices prompted crisis talks at the United Nations and increased speculation in the commodity and land markets.Those involved in the deals accuse critics of racism and hypocrisy – not least because much of the land, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, was taken from the original inhabitants by white settlers.Bill Ralston, a spokesman for Natural Dairy, said that his firm's bid was being unfairly treated because it was Chinese. "In the last three years, 13 different applications to acquire land have been approved in New Zealand mainly from Europe, Australia, the US and Russia – something like $380m of acquisitions, and not a dickey bird!" he told the local media. "The sudden prominence of Chinese investments and the paranoia has set in."To order Jonathan Watts' eco-travelogue, When A Billion Chinese Jump, for £9.99 (RRP £14.99) call 0330 333 6846 in the UK or visit guardianbooks.co.uk
