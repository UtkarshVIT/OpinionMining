Garry O'Connor's hopes of a fresh start in international football have been temporarily ended, after the striker withdrew from Scotland's squad for Saturday's game in Macedonia and the match in Iceland a week today.O'Connor, who was briefly frozen out of the Scotland scene after failing to report for a match in Ukraine two years ago, lost his place last season after failing to command a regular starting place at Birmingham City. The Scotland manager, George Burley, recalled him for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers but a groin injury means he will miss out.The veteran David Weir also withdrew from Burley's party yesterday and Norwich City's goalkeeper David Marshall did likewise on Sunday. The Aberdeen goalkeeper Jamie Langfield and the Rangers defender Kirk Broadfoot have been added and more alterations may follow, with serious injury doubts hanging over James Morrison and Callum Davidson.
