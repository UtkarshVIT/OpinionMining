The proposed legislation is aimed at correcting two shortcomings in the country's current FoI laws. One relates to the length of time before a document is designated an "historical record", and the other to the offence of altering records with the intent to preventing disclosure.The Scottish Government also said it intends to consult about how it can improve the FoI Act in other ways as part of bringing forward its legislative change.In 2010 ministers consulted on whether existing FoI legislation should be widened to cover a greater range of public service delivery bodies. According to Bruce Crawford, the minister for parliamentary business, an extension of FoI legislation is not favoured by most the organisations proposed for coverage."It was also apparent from the replies to the consultation that many of these organisations are already acting within the spirit of the act by making relevant information available, through both voluntary and statutory means," he said."Ministers believe it would be premature to extend coverage before the deficiencies in the act can be put right and the opportunity is taken to strengthen and update the current legislation."Crawford added that FoI has brought a welcome culture of greater openness and transparency to the work of the Scottish Government.
