So, the "Rio Tinto four" are guilty and the company accepts the verdict of the Shanghai number one people's intermediate court. Rio said the evidence presented in court showed "beyond doubt" that the four had accepted bribes. Chief executive Tom Albanese condemned "the deplorable behaviour" of his employees and hoped that their "unacceptable conduct" would not damage Rio's efforts "to build its important relationship with China".Fair enough. But it would have been better if Rio had also summoned the courage to echo a point made by Stephen Smith, the Australian foreign minister, who said the closure to the outside world of the commercial secrets part of the trial (as opposed to the part-dealing with the bribery allegations) left "serious unanswered questions".Smith is right and the failure of Rio, in its rush to rebuild bridges, to make that additional point is regrettable.The reality for western workers in China – not just at Rio – is that they work in the dark. Nobody can be sure what, legally, constitutes a commercial secret. Is it all right to hold information on a computer about past iron ore pricing agreements, even if such information is the public domain? Or is that stealing?This high-profile trial was a missed opportunity to exert some pressure on the Chinese authorities to shed light on this vital area. Employees in China know what to expect if they accept bribes – but they have always known that. The Chinese definition of a "commercial secret" remains as mysterious as ever.
