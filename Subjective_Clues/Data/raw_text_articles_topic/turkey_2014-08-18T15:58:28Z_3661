Turkey has summoned the German ambassador to demand a "formal and satisfactory explanation" following reports that the country was spied on by Germany's intelligence agency (BND).German media reported at the weekend that the BND had not only "accidentally" listened in on phone calls made by the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and his predecessor Hillary Clinton in 2012 and 2013, but that it also – less accidentally – monitored the activities of Turkish politicians. According to news magazine Der Spiegel, the Nato member has been listed as a target for BND surveillance since 2009.The revelations come less than a year since Germany summoned the US ambassador following spying allegations and Angela Merkel admonished Barack Obama that "spying on friends is not acceptable". Now, it appears, the tables have turned. Kerry is understood to have already raised the issue with his German counterpart, Frank-Walter Steinmeier.For members of the German parliament's inquiry committee into surveillance by the NSA, the latest revelations have confirmed suspicions about the BND's role. "We have for some time assumed that there is some kind of circular information exchange in place," Green MP Konstantin von Notz told the Guardian."Make no mistake: this is a disaster for the government. Either they knew what the BND was up to and acted in the most hypocritical way possible, or they didn't know, which is just as problematic." By refusing to answer questions about the intelligence agencies, he added, German politicians were acting much in the same way as their US colleagues.The BND denies having actively targeted US politicians. It insisted the recording of Kerry's phone call was deleted as soon as agents had realised what they had captured.A call in 2012 between Clinton and the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, however, was transcribed by BND agents and found its way into the hands of Markus R, the agency staffer who was arrested in July for supplying secret information to the US.Wolfgang Bosbach of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) described the spying reports as "a present from the heavens for the Americans".The revelations could prove much more damaging for relations with Turkey, a country for which Germany has often worked as a channel to the EU. German politicians over the last two days have tried to justify spying on Turkey in spite of its Nato membership, pointing to the terrorist risk posed by the tensions on the country's borders with Syria and Iraq, as well as the activities of the Kurdish Workers party (PKK), which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the EU and US."When you've got three million Turks living in Germany and there are Turkish organisations in this country that are classified as terrorist associations, then I think it is only common sense to do everything to find out how they are being supported from Turkey," Andreas Schockenhoff, a foreign policy expert for CDU, told Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.But because of that population, diplomacy between Berlin and Ankara requires careful handling.Safter Çınar, the chairman of the Turkish Community in Germany, strongly criticised the political reaction to the BND revelations, telling the Guardian: "It brings to mind the treatment of the Japanese community in the USA during the second world war."Lumping together all Turkish organisations as a potential terrorist threat was "an incredible defamation", he said, adding that his association had written to Merkel to complain.The PKK has been listed as a terrorist organisation in Germany since 1993, but many criticise the ban as a diplomatic gift to the Turkish government on behalf of the former chancellor Helmut Kohl that has outlived its relevance. PKK fighters are now playing a key role in the Kurdish counter-offensive against the jihadi group Isis in northern Iraq. Germany is providing non-lethal aid to Iraq's Kurds and a number of politicians are calling for arming ethnic minorities in the region against ISIS. Any aid supplies delivered to the region will have to pass through Turkey.SPD politician Rolf Mützenich said the spying allegations had set back Turkish-German relations at a difficult time. "I generally consider Nato members as partners", he told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. "Why can't we find out what we need to know about the PKK by talking to representatives of the Turkish government?"
