Mo Kolours (real name Joseph Deenmamode) has made a big impression since his debut album launched in February this year – a soulful cut-and-paste project drawing on funk, dub, reggae and drifting vocal hooks. The producer, singer and percussionist, who has an English/Mauritian heritage, has chosen to focus his summer session – a real party mix – on Brazil’s prolific jazz drummer Airto Moreira , a long-time musical inspiration of his.“Airto’s music is still fresh, his music is joyful, fruity, rich with life, and bursting with optimism,” says Deenmamode. “That’s a great summer recipe that will work well as a salad for your hazy evening barbecue!”The songs in the mix all feature Airto in some way, either as a musican, writer or producer. “I think Airto brings heartfelt, raw self expression, that shows a kind of freedom that we all understand,” says Deenmamode. “Because it’s so real, people love what he does. A true creative force!”For Deenmamode, a summer party simply would not be complete without Airto’s music: “A party isn’t a party, for me, unless the music is poppin’,” he says. “And if Airto is on the turntable, then you just know it’s going to be poppin.”• Mo Kolours is playing at the Resident Advisor party during the launch weekend of The Hydra series on Friday 22 August at Studio Spaces, Londonasdsa
