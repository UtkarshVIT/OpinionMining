The US has asked Switzerland to extradite the director Roman Polanski, who was arrested last month as he arrived in Zurich to attend a film festival."The US extradition request is based on a warrant issued by the superior court of the state of California for the county of Los Angeles on 1 February 1978, on which date Polanski had failed to appear before the judge as was required by his bail conditions," the Swiss justice department said in a statement.Polanski is expected to appeal if the Swiss government agrees to the extradition request. This week, Switzerland's top criminal court rejected his appeal to be freed from prison, citing a "high" risk that he would try to flee.The 76-year-old Oscar-winning director, who holds dual French and Polish citizenship, was arrested at the request of the US when he flew to Switzerland to receive a lifetime achievement prize. The arrest followed a tip-off by Swiss officials to the US authorities, who have been pursuing the director since his admission to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old in 1977.Polanski was accused of plying a teenager with champagne and drugs during a modelling shoot, before raping her. He was initially indicted on six counts, including rape by use of drugs, child molesting and sodomy. Polanski pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of unlawful sexual intercourse and fled in 1978 amid a legal dispute over his sentence.Emails from the Swiss justice office show that it alerted the US office of international affairs (OIA) as to Polanski's presence in Switzerland. The Swiss sent an urgent fax stating that Polanski was expected in Zurich to receive a film award â€“ as the website of the city's film festival had already announced.The emails, released to the Associated Press, show that on 22 September Swiss officials asked the US if it wanted him arrested. The officials also alerted the Los Angeles district attorney's office, which immediately began drafting an arrest warrant. Polanski was arrested four days later.
