I returned to the UK in April after working for nearly four months overseas. Before I left, last December, I set up two balance transfers with MBNA. I did this online and was asked to call a number at the end of the process. When I called, I was told the transfers would be fine but I would have to "consolidate" my cards. I gave details of my balance transfers, which were at 0% interest, and set up direct debits to pay the minimum each month.Towards the end of my secondment in Singapore I began to receive emails from MBNA telling me that my accounts were in arrears. When I returned, I had letters from bailiffs and countless bills for interest and arrears. This is MBNA's mistake . KL, LondonMBNA instantly put its hands up to this one. It explained that, during the consolidation of your three accounts into two, the direct debits were not established correctly and, on one, the promotional rates were not transferred. That was its mistake. It has arranged to refund all of the charges and reinstate your promotional rates as quickly as possible. It is also making sure this has no impact on your credit record. It has apologised and credited your account with Â£200 "goodwill".We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
