Health officials in India are playing down fears that the country's removal from the list of polio-endemic countries has been threatened by a scare over a case of paralysis in the east of the country.India last month celebrated a year without a recorded new case of polio, a major step towards the eradication of the disease worldwide.But reports earlier this week of a case of paralysis in a 19-month-old child in a poverty-stricken area of West Bengal raised fears that the celebrations may have been premature.Local health workers told reporters they suspected the child had been suffering from polio.However, officials in Delhi and in Kolkata, the nearest major city to the location of the suspected case, have said this is unlikely.In 2011 in India, more than 60,000 suspected cases were investigated, only one of which was found to be polio, the officials said. It will take around three weeks to get results from tests, but it was "extremely unlikely" these would prove positive.With no new cases since the single case in 2011, India was taken off the list of polio-endemic countries three weeks ago by the World Health Organisation.Another two years will need to pass without a case of the disease before the country, with 1.2 billion people, can formally be declared free of the disease.India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, hailed the achievement as giving "hope that we can finally eradicate polio not only from India but from the face of the entire mother earth".Campaigners have repeatedly said much still needs to be done to eradicate the disease.Last year, Sir Liam Donaldson, the UK's former chief medical officer who chairs the independent monitoring board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, said the success of the eradication effort, which has seen cases reduced by 99% in 20 years, was "on a knife-edge". In some places, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, polio has made a comeback and the disease is still endemic in Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan.In India, a mass vaccination campaign involving more than 1 million volunteers reduced cases nationally by 94% between 2009 and 2010, from 741 to 42, and down to the single case last year.The success was attributed to a combination of highly motivated local workers, philanthropy, the involvement of international health bodies, and the support of local government.
