Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker, has decided to stop selling phones in Japan, except for its luxury Vertu brand, reports Reuters. "In the current global economic climate, we have concluded that the continuation of our investment in Japan-specific localized products is no longer sustainable," Nokia executive vice president Timo Ihamuotila said in a statement.The story says the problem is that "Most of the mobile phones used in Japan are part of third-generation networks and boast features such as TV broadcasting and electronic payment functions." The need to develop special handsets means non-Japanese suppliers have only a small share of the Japanese market -- about 5%, according to IDC Japan. But it also means Japanese phones don't sell outside Japan.Sales of Vertu phones are probably not going to be large. Reuters says: "Vertu, founded in 1998, sells gem-encrusted, hand-built mobile phones with prices ranging from 3,500 euros to over 100,000 euros."That sounds like a strange business to me. If your €24,000 phone is obsolete after two years, that's €1,000 a month in handset depreciation. (The original Vertu Signature cost €24,000 -- as hand-made in Hampshire and sold in London.) Can you get the diamonds re-used on a different handset, or do Vertu buyers have so much money they just don't care?
