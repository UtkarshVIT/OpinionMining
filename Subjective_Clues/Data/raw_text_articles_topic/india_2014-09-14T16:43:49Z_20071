Name: India SellarsBusiness: Maids to MeasureJob title: Creative directorWebsite: www.maidstomeasure.comI set up Maids to Measure three years ago and I brought my sister India on board to become the creative director of the company. India created the first collection to launch the company in 2012 and has since collaborated with well known brands to build Maids to Measure to become the only specialist British bridesmaid brand. She has led Maids to Measure to win best newcomer at the Wedding Industry Awards in 2012 and this yearâ€™s best Bridesmaid retailer, competing against big high street names. With no fashion or retail experience, just a creative flair, India has taken Maids to Measure from strength to strength and we are now the go to place for British bridesmaids.
