Israel dealt a blow to Hamas on Thursday by killing three of its most senior military commanders as uncertainty continued over the fate of the organisation's top military chief, Mohammed Deif, whose wife and children died in an air strike on Tuesday.Hamas announced the deaths of Mohammed Abu Shamlah, Raed Attar and Mohammed Barhoum after a house in Rafah, in the south of Gaza, was demolished by a series of missiles. Five civilians were also killed, and at least 40 injured.A joint statement from the Israel Defence Forces and the internal security agency Shin Bet said that Abu Shamlah and Attar had been killed, but made no mention of Barhoum. Defence minister Moshe Ya'alon said the assassinations were a "great operational and intelligence achievement".It was unclear how Hamas's military command structure would be affected by the losses, but rockets continued to be launched from Gaza throughout Thursday.Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader in Gaza, said in a statement that "despite the pain" of losing the military commanders, "the history of the Hamas movement has proven more than once that it is stronger after every targeted killing of one of its senior members. After a senior operative is killed, we immediately continue on our path without hesitating or stepping back."Israeli forces continued to attack sites in Gaza on Friday following the breakdown of the latest in a series of temporary ceasefires and the abandonment of negotiations in Cairo to reach a durable agreement to bring the six-week war to a halt. A Israeli Defence Force (IDF) statement said it had launched 20 airstrikes on Friday morning and Gaza militants had fired two rockets at Israel. Gaza health officials said two Palestinians were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a farm.The UK, France and Germany have drafted a UN security council resolution, calling for an end to the conflict and proposing measures including lifting Israel's blockade, guaranteeing Israel's security through international monitoring, and restoring Palestinian Authority rule. The US has backed the diplomatic effort, which is still at an early stage.But in an indication that Israel did not anticipate a swift end to the renewed conflict Ya'alon on Thursday authorised the call-up of 10,000 reservists.There was no definitive word on whether Deif, who tops Israel's most wanted list, had survived or was killed when Israel dropped five one-ton bombs on a house in Gaza City on Tuesday evening. His wife, Widad, 27, and seven-month-old baby Ali were killed; the body of his three-year-old daughter, Sara, was pulled out of the rubble on Thursday.A document purporting to be Deif's death certificate circulated on the internet on Thursday, but Hamas officials dismissed it as a forgery.The targeting of Deif and the three commanders in Rafah came after weeks in which Hamas's senior political and military leaders were out of reach in a network of underground bunkers and tunnels. Israel relies on a combination of hi-tech surveillance and human intelligence, in the form of informers on the ground, to track the movements of its targets."After 35 days in the bunkers and tunnels, they wanted to go out and this gave an opportunity to go after them," Amos Yadlin, a former head of IDF intelligence, told reporters in a telephone briefing. He said Israeli intelligence would now be seeking confirmation of Deif's death. "They [Hamas] are trying to hide it … When Israel is 100% sure, it will say."The impact of killing military commanders would only be known in the future, but Yadlin added: "As time passes, there is no doubt they are damaged more and more."Al-Majd, a Hamas-affiliated website, said that Hamas had executed three alleged collaborators and arrested seven others.Deif has been the commander of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing, since 2002. He has survived five previous attempts by Israel to assassinate him; the last, in July 2006, left him with severe injuries and possibly permanently disabled.He is believed to be the mastermind behind Hamas's network of tunnels, the focus of Israel's military offensive on the ground in recent weeks. A rare audio recording of his voice emerged on 29 July, in which he declared Hamas would keep fighting until "our people live in freedom and dignity".The IDF listed the alleged activities of Attar and Abu Shamlah. Attar was responsible for attacks including rockets, explosive devices and infiltrations into Israel which led the death of Israeli civilians, it said, alleging that he was directly involved in the capture of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit and weapons smuggling.Abu Shamlah orchestrated the infiltration into Israel by 13 Hamas fighters last month, according to the IDF, and was "directly involved in multiple murderous attacks against Israel".Lt Col Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the IDF, said: "This morning's strike sends a clear message to those responsible for planning attacks: we will strike those that have terrorised our communities, towns and cities, we will pursue the perpetrators of abduction of our soldiers and teenagers, and we will succeed in restoring security to the State of Israel."Hamas's leader-in-exile, Khaled Meshaal, accused Israel of perpetrating a Holocaust in Gaza. "What Israel has done in the Gaza Strip over the last 45 days is a genuine Holocaust … They are killing children, destroying residential areas, mosques, hospitals and UNRWA-run schools," he said in an interview with Turkey's Anadolu agency.Israel was "replicating what Hitler did years ago," he added: "We will not give up until Palestinian demands – at the top of which is lifting the Gaza siege – are fulfilled."According to the Gaza ministry of health, the total death toll up to midnight on Wednesday was 2,065, with more than 10,300 injured. Three civilians have been killed in Israel since the start of the conflict, and 64 soldiers have died.
