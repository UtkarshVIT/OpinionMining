The message from the White House is upbeat: the US is a Pacific nation determined to strengthen its ties with Asia. But Barack Obama will face tough challenges over the economy, trade and Japan's alliance with Washington from the moment he arrives in Tokyo tomorrow at the start of his first presidential visit to the region.Until recently, the US could depend on Japan – its closest Asian ally for 50 years – to smooth its path into trickier diplomatic territory nearby. But the recent election of a centre-left government in Tokyo intent on ending Japan's subservience to Washington is threatening to weaken what a former US ambassador to the country described as the most important bilateral partnership in the world.South Korea, another old ally, will push hard for progress on a stalled trade agreement, though administration officials have played down hope of a breakthrough.Relations between Washington and Beijing are at their most amicable for years. But some observers question whether closer ties will bring measurable results, and the friendship is not without its problems: today it emerged that Obama may ditch his sole meeting with the Chinese public unless Washington and Beijing can resolve disagreements over its format.In an interview with Reuters this week, Obama described China as a "vital partner", but warned of "enormous strains" if economic imbalances between the country and the US were not corrected.Trade tensions have already been felt, with China attacking US tariffs on its tyres and steel pipes. But Beijing hinted today that it might allow appreciation of the yuan. American manufacturers complain the Chinese currency is kept artificially low.Obama's nine-day, four-country tour will also see him putting the case for the release of Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to Burma's prime minister, Thein Sein, and other south-east Asian leaders in Singapore.But Obama's priority will be addressing the rift with Tokyo – caused by a 2006 agreement to reduce the American presence on the southern island of Okinawa, home to more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan.The US is keen to push ahead with the deal – 12 years in the making – which would see the Futenma military base relocated from the crowded city of Ginowan to a remote site off the east coast. The move would also presage the transfer of 8,000 marines to the US Pacific territory of Guam.Japan's new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, took office promising to review the agreement. His apparent preference is for the base to be moved out of Okinawa altogether, possibly to a location overseas. "There are many issues that President Obama is concerned about and issues that Japan is concerned about, so we would like to discuss each theme," he told the Japanese parliament. "I am convinced it will be a meaningful trip."Obama says he expects Japan to abide by the $10bn (£6bn) agreement to relocate Futenma to a new offshore location. "It is perfectly appropriate for the new government to want to re-examine how to move forward," he said in an interview with Japanese broadcaster NHK."I am confident that once that review is completed that they will conclude that the alliance we have, the basing arrangements that have been discussed, all those things serve the interests of Japan and they will continue."Hatoyama's unenviable task will be to reconcile Washington's demands with opposition to the US presence on Okinawa. At the weekend more than 20,000 people protested against the US presence, a show of force that coincided with the arrest of an American soldier accused of killing a Japanese man in a hit-and-run incident.Attempts have begun to get the leaders' meeting off to an auspicious start, with Japan's pledge on Tuesday of 5bn yen in aid for Afghanistan over five years.The announcement was designed to assuage US concerns that Japan's commitment to the "war on terror" is wavering following its decision not to renew its refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of the US and allied forces in Afghanistan.The global economy and North Korea's nuclear programme will be a priority throughout Obama's tour, as will climate change, with the Copenhagen summit just weeks away.His hosts will also want to explore China's growing influence in the region. With the country forecast to overtake Japan as Asia's biggest economy next year, concerns persist in Tokyo about the prospect of closer ties between Washington and Beijing."That idea sends shivers down Japanese spines," said Richard Samuels, a Japan security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Obama's overarching message will be that "the US is here to stay in Asia", Jeffrey Bader, the president's top Asia adviser, said last week, vowing that "the US will be a player and participant on the ground floor, not a distant spectator".In China, North Korea's nuclear programme, and that of Iran, will be high on the agenda, as will Afghanistan and Pakistan. But no major announcements are expected and the White House effectively dismissed the prospect of a climate change agreement between the world's two largest carbon emitters. US officials have said Obama will also raise human rights.In his meeting this Sunday with the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations, Obama will press for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and more than 2,000 other political prisoners in Burma.His new policy of engagement with the Burmese junta is already paying dividends. Kurt Campbell, the US assistant secretary of state for east Asia, recently met Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon, while this week a senior Burmese diplomat suggested she could soon be released to play a role in elections planned for next year.
