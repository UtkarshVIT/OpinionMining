BG Group's Brazilian ventures in the Santos Basin will deliver almost 3bn more barrels of oil than expected, the company said today.BG upgraded its estimates for the Tupi, Iracema, and Guará fields, which it is developing with partners including Brazilian oil group Petrobras, from just over 8bn barrels of oil equivalent, to 10.8bn. The upgrade came after an independent analysis of new data gathered from the fields.Shares in the company were up 3.4%, or 41.5p, to £12.52 on the news, making it one of the top performers in the FTSE 100.The size of the Tupi oil field makes it one of the largest finds of recent decades, and the upgrade alone is equivalent to four Buzzard fields, one of the largest in the North Sea. Analysts said there was potential for more good news from Brazil too."I think as you get production history and more details the reserves are going to rise," said Peter Hitchens of Panmure Gordon.Oswald Clint at Bernstein Research added that "discoveries of this magnitude are relatively few in this day and age".The upgrade alone could be worth as much as £4bn to BG.BG chief executive Frank Chapman said: "This is a material upgrade to what was already a world-class resources position. Only four years have elapsed from first discovery to first production in a play that is at the centre of BG Group's growth plans over the decade ahead."The group also announced third-quarter results boosted by a 43% increase in liquefied natural gas (LNG) earnings. Revenues were $978m (£610m), up 27% on the previous year.Evolution Securities said that once a $106m tax credit was taken into account, the numbers were in line with consensus.Clint added that BG was "one of the best positioned" in terms of the LNG market, adding that the "upstream [division] wasn't as strong as the market expected".BG announced at the weekend that it had got the go-ahead for its $15bn project to liquify and ship gas produced from coal deposits. The Queensland Curtis project in Eastern Australia will give the group better access to Asian markets.
