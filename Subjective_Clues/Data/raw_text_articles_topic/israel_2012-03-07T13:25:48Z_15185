Just hours after the Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu had unstuck the forced smile he had worn throughout his televised meeting with President Obama, he gave a rather more unguarded speech to the pro-Israel group, American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Talking of the Iranian threat, he said: "Ladies and gentleman, if it looks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, then what is it? â€¦ That's right, it's a duck! But this duck is a nuclear duck. It's time the world started calling a duck a duck."The speech got a rousing ovation. Though not from ducks. Talking after the event, a spokesduck for the lobby group Duck Off, said: "We are sick and tired of being sitting ducks for every lame political gag. There are dozens of birds that try to masquerade as ducks these days, and lazy stereotyping of all ducks as insane megalomaniacs itching to start a nuclear war is both irresponsible and unhelpful."A PR for Daffy Duck said: "It is a matter of record that Walt Disney was a known antisemite and that the Israelis have had it in for ducks for decades," before being taken out by the Mossad.
