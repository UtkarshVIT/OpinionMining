Hundreds of self-styled anarchists fought police in central Athens yesterday following a march to demand the release of people arrested during last month's riots. The clashes occurred outside the main University of Athens building, the rioters using stones, the police pepper spray. Anarchists were at the forefront of riots in Athens and other cities after the shooting last month of a teenager by a police officer.
