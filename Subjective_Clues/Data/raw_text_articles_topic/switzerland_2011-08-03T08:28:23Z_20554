Swiss authorities have moved to counteract what the national bank called the "massive overvaluation" of the Swiss franc.The measures – a huge increase in the supply of Swiss francs and a pledge that interest rates will be pegged at or near 0% – came as investors flocked to buy francs as a safe haven from the turmoil affecting the eurozone and the world economy."The Swiss National Bank (SNB) considers the Swiss franc to be massively overvalued at present. This current strength of the Swiss franc is threatening the development of the economy and increasing the downside risks to price stability in Switzerland. The SNB will not tolerate a continual tightening of monetary conditions and is therefore taking measures against the strong Swiss franc," the SNB said in a statement.City analysts welcomed the move, which came as world stock markets fell sharply again. They questioned, though, whether the SNB could successfully repel the rush for safety."Today's actions will weaken the fundamental attractiveness of the Swiss franc," said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabonank. "The SNB will be well aware that it is swimming against the tide and that without a solution to the eurozone sovereign debt crisis it will be difficult to convince investors to dump the Swiss franc."The SNB has lowered its target range for the London interbank offered rate – the official Swiss interest rate – to 0%-0.25% from 0%-0.75%.It will also increase the Swiss money supply, increasing banks' "sight deposits", cash which they can instantly draw on, at the SNB from SFr30bn (£24bn) to SFr80bn.The intervention pushed the Swiss currency lower on the foreign exchange markets, losing about 2% against the euro to SFr1.105. It had previously hit a new high of SFr1.0793 on Wednesday, and appeared to be on track to hit parity with the euro.The high currency has made life difficult for Swiss exporters, as their goods become relatively more expensive.Janwillem Acket of Julius Baer told Reuters: "[The move] makes a lot of sense but [it] remains to be seen how successful it will be as long as the market sees Switzerland as so much better off than the rest of the world."
