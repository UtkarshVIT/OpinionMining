In recent, soon to be published work, we show that the coral reefs of the Egyptian Sinai are the most valuable in the world, generating fine sand beaches, calm water and fabulous opportunities for world-class snorkelling and diving, all within a short flight from Europe.The tragedy of recent events (Report, 11 November) is complex and manifold. Of course there is the loss of innocent life. And there is also the loss of critical foreign exchange to Egypt, and of employment and income locally.But there is also a loss of access to a beautiful, special place, enjoyed by millions. Tourism can be pretty damaging to coral reefs, but being ignored and unmanaged, can sometimes bring a host of other threats. And we have no idea how to quantify the loss of experience.How many of the Sinai’s visitors became ambassadors, caring at once for nature and the many benefits it brings? How important are the views held in the rich west important in shifting concerns about climate change, the extinction crisis, and the livelihoods of coral reef-dependent populations worldwide?Dr Mark SpaldingSenior marine scientist, Global Ocean Team, The Nature Conservancy, University of Siena• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com
