Guardian Australia has won a Walkley award for multimedia storytelling for Firestorm, an interactive project centred around the January bushfire in Dunalley, Tasmania.The judges said Firestorm “brought to life” the story of the Holmes family – whose photos of them fleeing the Dunalley fire and sheltering under a jetty were seen all over the world – through text, photographs, video, audio and graphics.“Combining text with vivid imagery and high-quality video, they have woven their narrative into a compelling and immersive multimedia reconstruction,” read the judgment.Guardian Australia launched just six months ago.“We are delighted to be recognised by the Walkleys for our digital journalism so soon after launching the Guardian in Australia,” said the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.“We're trying to find innovative ways to tell Australian stories and Firestorm has had a global impact.
