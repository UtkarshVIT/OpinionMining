China indicated that it planned to buy Spanish bonds at a crucial auction tomorrow, after purchasing Portuguese debt today, bringing much-needed investors' confidence to the two troubled countries."These are delicate times and we take a positive role," Yi Gang, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, told the Guardian today. "We have been and are a consistent buyer and we have a long-term view of our investments in Europe."In a closely watched sale of €599m (£497m) of sovereign bonds, Portugal's 10-year borrowing costs dipped to 6.7%, down from 6.8% at a previous auction – an about-turn on recent increases in debt-funding costs.Spain is planning to raise funds tomorrow, hoping to cut its practically unsustainable borrowing costs as well. The two Iberian countries are battling investors, who are betting they will follow Greece and Ireland into being bailed out by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund – and giving up a measure of fiscal independence.China, which already controls 13% of Spanish sovereign debt, said it was in its own interests to support the EU in times of trouble as the economic bloc is China's top trading partner. "We will do our best to be a stabiliser in this process and support further integration of the EU," Yi said at a press conference in London, where a Chinese delegation has ended a European tour, following visits to Spain and Germany.The Chinese support, together with stronger defence of the euro from Brussels, sent stock markets rallying across Europe. It also lowered the cost of protecting €10m of Portuguese debt against default to €513,000, from €540,000 today, according to data from Markit. Spain's debt insurance costs also fell to €336,000, from €349,000.Some investors remained sceptical about prospects for economic growth in ailing southern Europe. André de Klerk, head of risk management at Moneycorp, said: "The euro still remains weak against sterling and, with Germany quick to remind the EU of the ongoing nature of the European debt crisis, investors will remain nervous about the situation in Portugal over the coming months."
