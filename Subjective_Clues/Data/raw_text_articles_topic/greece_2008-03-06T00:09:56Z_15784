Having worked on the island of Crete for more than 45 years as an archaeologist and with a strong interest in Cretan botany, I consider the proposed tourist complex at Cavo Sidero on the north-eastern promontory of the island to be a complete environmental disgrace (UK firms plan vast resort on fragile coast; Harsh course of nature, March 5).The complex will impact severely on an unspoilt landscape of wild natural beauty, high botanical interest and full of ancient sites. There will also be a huge demand for non-existent water, met only by major desalination, which itself has energy costs. It is a sparsely populated area, so the proposal will have minimal local employment gain (and would all employees actually be local people?). And what is all this large environmental cost and irrecoverable damage for? Straight financial gain. Anyone with a love of Crete and its environment should strongly oppose this scheme.Professor Peter WarrenUniversity of BristolIt is difficult to conceive of a less sustainable development than that proposed at Cavo Sidero. Yet Forum for the Future, an organisation dedicated to promoting sustainable development, is supporting the plan. Does it really believe that burning fossil fuels to desalinate the water needed by 7,000 holidaymakers, the staff who serve them and the golf courses on which they play is compatible with the principles of sustainable development? Is it in any way sustainable to build so large a development on an arid, narrow and beautiful peninsula? Future generations will be deprived of its beauty. David SawersLittlehampton, West Sussex
