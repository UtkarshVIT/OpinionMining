As countries with strong national identities, it can safely be said that Australia and New Zealand are worlds apart. However, a strong earthquake in the region has brought the fierce rivals closer â€“ 30cm to be precise.The 7.8-magnitude quake appears to have jolted the South Island and moved it towards Australia, the New Zealand Herald reported.Global positioning systems showed that Te Anau, a town in the remote Fiordland region, was now 10cm closer to Australia, it said, while the South Island's south-western tip, Puysegur Point, was 30cm (11.8ins) closer.Ken Gledhill, director of the research organisation GNS Science GeoNet, told TVNZ that the changes showed the immensity of the forces involved."New Zealand has been very fortunate. This earthquake anywhere else would have caused huge damage," he said."It's taken us closer to Australia. The country is deforming all the time because of being on the plate boundary, but this has done it in a few seconds, rather than waiting hundreds of years."Although the earthquake was New Zealand's biggest in 78 years, it caused only slight damage to buildings and property when it struck Fiordland, west of Invercargill, New Zealand's southernmost and westernmost city, last Thursday.The mayor of Invercargill, Tim Shadbolt, told Radio New Zealand News that he welcomed the fact that parts of the country were now closer to Australia."I'm absolutely delighted. I built an international airport in Invercargill because we're the closest city in New Zealand to Australia and it will become more and more realistic the closer we get," he said.
