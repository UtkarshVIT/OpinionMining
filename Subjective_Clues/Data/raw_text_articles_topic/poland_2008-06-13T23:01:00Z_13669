Polish shipyards that gave birth to the free trade union and pro-democracy movement led by Lech Walesa in the 1980s could soon face bankruptcy or closure because of EU state aid rules. EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes warned that the yards in Gdansk, Gdynia and Szczecin could be forced to repay government aid worth up to Â£1bn. The three yards employ 10,000.Poland's treasury minister, Aleksander Grad, presented Kroes with a proposal yesterday that would see the Gdynia shipyard sold to ISD Polska, the company controlling Gdansk, along with substantial cuts in capacity. But Kroes expressed "serious doubts" that the plan would meet EU conditions for approving state aid.
