Listen on SoundcloudHome to Dick Diver and the Twerps, independent record label Chapter Music are the masterminds behind a low-key slacker pop revolution in Melbourne, and their most recent signing The Stevens fits snugly into this expanding stable.Led by Travis MacDonald and Twerps drummer Alex Macfarlane on guitars, the band was snapped up by Chapter following the release of their 2012 self-titled debut EP. New single Hindsight is their first official release since the signing. Clocking in at just over two minutes, it's a perfect slice of anxious Aussie pop. MacDonald's nasal vocals are mixed low and lazy alongside jittery guitar and sweet backing melodies, recalling The Church's earlier work as well as Orange Juice and The Wedding Present.The band came together thanks to a chance meeting between Macfarlane and MacDonald who bonded over a mutual love of bedroom recordings, Guided By Voices and (unsurprisingly) most Flying Nun recordings. Their debut album A History of Hygiene is due out on November 1 and features an impressive 24 songs over 44 minutes.Also on Faster Louder: The best things in music 2013More new musicMilwaukee Banks – Pluto Bounce: New music from AustraliaSeungri – Love Box: New music from South KoreaNischay Parekh – Panda: New music from India
