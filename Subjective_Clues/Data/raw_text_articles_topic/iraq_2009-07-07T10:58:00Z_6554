Sir John Chilcot, the chairman of the Iraq inquiry, has already said that he wants to hold as many hearings in public as possible, and now he has given a further indication of his desire for maximum openness. The Cabinet Office issued a news release last night saying that Chilcot and his team would hold a press conference soon to explain how they will carry out their work. It's expected to take place towards the end of this month.Chilcot has also named the secretary to the inquiry – ie the official who actually runs it. She's Margaret Aldred, a career civil servant who spent 25 years at the Ministry of Defence and who is currently director general and deputy head of the foreign and defence policy secretariat in the Cabinet Office. She was appointed CBE in the 1991 Gulf honours list. She also worked as principal private secretary to two Tory defence secretaries, first Sir Malcolm Rifkind and then Michael Portillo.So what's she like? I rang Portillo and this is what he said:She's meticulous, loyal, fierce – definitely fierce. I would think she would do a good job. Obviously, she has a background in defence. She knows the subject. She will be very mindful of national security. But beyond that it's difficult to predict how she will tackle it really.Chilcot himself is a former civil servant – he ended his career as permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office – and there have been complaints that the inquiry will have an establishment bias. But Portillo says that appointing someone like Aldred as secretary to the inquiry does not necessarily mean you can predict its conclusions.You are more or less bound to appoint such an establishment figure because, first, establishment figures know how to get things done and, second, they understand what they are looking for. But if the committee chairman wishes to make this a penetrating and transparent inquiry, in the way that I think he has said he does, then [Aldred] will do it and she will do it very well.
