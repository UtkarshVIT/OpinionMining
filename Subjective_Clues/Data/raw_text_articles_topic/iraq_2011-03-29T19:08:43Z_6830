The west should be prepared for an Islamist government taking over in Libya, Nick Clegg believes, as he delivers a speech in Mexico setting out new "humble" principles for liberal intervention and calling for an end to the "liberal vigilantism" of the Blair era.Senior British officials believe Muammar Gaddafi was a "lunatic" who "committed the worst atrocity on British soil", a reference to the Lockerbie bombing, so the rest of the world should be prepared to take a gamble on the possibility of an Islamist government coming to power in his place, said Clegg.The deputy prime minister set out his brand of moral realism in a speech at Chapultepec castle, where he detailed five ways in which today's intervention in Libya differed from the "trigger-happy policies" of Tony Blair that led to the invasion of Iraq.The deputy prime minister believes in the importance of sticking to the letter of the UN resolution, which gave the international community a mandate to prevent lethal military force being deployed by a dictator against civilians.Despite the international conference in London turning to the possibility of the international community arming the rebels, Clegg told reporters in Mexico he would countenance that only if it was clear it would aid the terms of UN resolution 1973, dealing with the Libyan no-fly zone.On the eve of his trip, Clegg gave an interview to the Financial Times in which he said the UK must be prepared to stand back and say "we can't do any more".He suggested that could mean pulling out of operations in Libya with Gaddafi still in charge. This again appeared to be at odds with the suggestion the international community would allow Gaddafi to leave Libya through a safe haven, implying Gaddafi's departure is now the strategic imperative.His determinedly non-interventionist comments about the complexion of a future Libyan government may dismay some of his coalition colleagues, including the education secretary, Michael Gove, who argued inside cabinet for the west to help insurgents in the Middle East in order to prevent Islamist politics taking over.But it chimes with the opinions of some of the prime minister's closest advisers, including Foreign Office officials and Steve Hilton, David Cameron's director of strategy, who argue for the west to stand back.In Mexico, Clegg said: "It is not for us to choose the government of Libya, or indeed the system of government for Libya. That is for the people of Libya."A senior source said people were "kidding themselves" if they thought Libya was "going to end up like Switzerland – it hasn't got any traditions of democracy".Clegg is aware the British public are concerned about another war in the Middle East. He said: "Like most of you I was a strong opponent of the war in Iraq. It was wrong. But the action being taken today in Libya is right. It would be terrible tragedy if the mistakes of Iraq led to a retreat from the principle of liberal interventionism, from a principle that we have a collective responsibility to support freedom and protect human rights around the world."The lesson of Iraq is not that intervention in support of liberal aims is always wrong. The lesson of Iraq is that any such action must only – and must always – be unilaterally sanctioned and driven by humanitarian concerns. Liberal vigilantism is dead. Law-abiding liberal interventionism is not."He set out five ways in which intervention in Libya was different from intervention in Iraq: • The Libyan action was legal• There is a humanitarian case for intervention whereas in Iraq "the case rested solely on the danger posed by weapons of mass destruction"• Intervention in Libya has the support of Arabs• There is an emphasis on post-conflict reconstruction• Today's action has "strict aims"Despite criticising Blair's doctrine, Clegg used the same distinction favoured by the former prime minister – that of open versus closed societies which turn to economic protectionism, with aides dismissing the fact that the US too has been prone to bouts of protectionism in recent years.Seeking to foster stronger ties with Mexico, Clegg said the UK and Mexico were now both in an "axis of openness"."For me, the most important divide has always been the one between open societies and closed societies. Open societies are those which choose democracy and freedom at home, and engagement and responsibility abroad. Closed societies turn inwards, favouring protectionism in economic policy and detachment from foreign affairs."Following 9/11 there were those who looked at the world and saw an 'axis of evil'. George Bush himself said faced with this axis 'indifference would be catastrophic.' Ten years on, I look at the world and see an axis of openness."He said he believed there were grounds for optimism after a "dark decade" in which it appeared that multilateralism was "broken".Clegg cited "real progress" made on climate change in Mexico last December."The two main post-Iraq assumptions have been confounded. First, that the multilateral system was broken and second that the forces for insularity, for closed societies, were in the ascendancy."Just as 1989 and 2001 marked sharp breaks with the past, so 2011 could prove a turning point in international affairs: the third critical moment in recent history."While obtaining the UN resolution for intervention in Libya had been a positive development for multilateralism, Mexico and the UK had to work together to reform those multilateral institutions, he said.
