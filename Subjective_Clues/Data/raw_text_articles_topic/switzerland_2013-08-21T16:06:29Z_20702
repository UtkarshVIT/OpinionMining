A row between Italy and Switzerland over Italian bears that roam across Alpine borders is focusing on how the two nations define "badly behaved".The bust up over bear etiquette started with a curt statement issued this month by the Swiss canton of Graubünden about bears wandering in from the Italian region of Trentino – where a bear repopulation scheme is under way – to forage for food, eat livestock and generally be a nuisance."These bears constitute an obstacle to the acceptance of this large predator by the local population," said the Swiss statement. "The culling of problem bears needs to happen when they are young, in their own territory."Over in Italy, experts pointed out that weeding out "problem" bears in their youth would be difficult as would be agreeing with the Swiss on what constitutes misbehaviour."What horror!" said Rosa Marino, an official with the Italian League for the Abolition of Hunting. "Is this what is wrong with the world? A bear who wakes up hungry from hibernating, who tries to avoid meeting humans who have built on every centimetre of his territory and who eats what he can find for breakfast?"The Swiss, who often look down their noses at what they consider the less than well-organised behaviour of Italian humans, have shown even less tolerance of unruly Italian bears, killing one specimen, known as M13, this year after it wandered into the town of Poschiavo.One Italian expert said it was time to seek a cross-border compromise on bear behaviour before more blood was spilt."To confront the issue of border crossings, it is indispensible that an accord is reached under which we can establish when a bear can be considered problematic," Luigi Boitani, a professor of zoology at the Sapienza in Rome, told La Repubblica.
