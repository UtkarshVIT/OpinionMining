 Russia will follow through with plans to deliver attack helicopters to Syria because it considers the country its friend, a senior official has said."Syria is our friend, and we fulfil all our obligations to our friends," Alexander Fomin, head of the federal service for military-technical co-operation, told RIA-Novosti. "According to a 2008 contract, we repaired three Mi-25s and are ready to deliver them on time."Russia has come under fire for refusing to halt its co-operation with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, one of its last remaining allies in the Middle East.A Russian ship sailing under the Cura√ßao flag attempted to deliver the three attack helicopters as well as air defence systems last month, but turned back as it rounded the coast of Scotland after its British insurers withdrew their coverage amid international criticism.The ship returned to port in Russia and was re-outfitted with a Russian flag. It would sail with a non-military escort, the ship's owner, Femco, said earlier this week.An unnamed "military-diplomatic source" told the Interfax news agency on Wednesday that Russia could deliver the helicopters by air. "In any case, Russia must fulfil its obligations," the source said. "However, everything will depend on whether we can withstand the pressure from the west."Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has insisted that the weapons are defensive in nature and are not feeding the violence in Syria. He has said Russia is simply fulfilling its contracts, taking pains to assure the west that Russia's opposition to foreign intervention in Syria does not equate to support for Assad.Lavrov is due to meet Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, later on Thursday during her brief visit to St Petersburg. The two are due to attend a meeting in Geneva on the Syria crisis this weekend.
