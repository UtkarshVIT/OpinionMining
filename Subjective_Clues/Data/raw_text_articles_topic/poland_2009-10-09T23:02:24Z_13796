Stephen Fry has been criticised by the Polish embassy after remarks in a television interview in which he seemed to suggest Poland may have had some responsibility for the Holocaust.The actor and writer made the comments on Channel 4 News while talking about the Conservative party's links with Poland's Law and Justice party.The Law and Justice party has members that have faced claims of antisemitism and homophobia â€“ Fry appeared to hint that Poland could hold some responsibility for the mass murder of European Jews."Let's face it, there has been a history in Poland of rightwing Catholicism, which has been deeply disturbing for those of us who know a little history, and remember which side of the border Auschwitz was on," he said.The remark provoked a furious response from the embassy: "To suggest, even indirectly, that the Polish people, and Poland as a country, are in some way collectively responsible for the [Auschwitz] death camp, which became the symbol of the horrors of the Holocaust, is completely wrong and, frankly, defamatory."Comment pages on internet news sites in Poland also reflected anger, with posters accusing Fry of indifference to the deaths of the thousands of non-Jewish Poles who also perished at the death camp.Writing on Twitter, Fry said he feared he might have to wait a while before the people of Poland forgave him for "inadvertently offending them".
