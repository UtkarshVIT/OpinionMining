Middle East peace talks resume this week under the guidance of Hillary Clinton, amid growing tensions between all the parties over Jewish settlements on the West Bank.Clinton says this round of talks may be the last chance for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The secretary of state and George Mitchell, the US special envoy to the region, will visit Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for talks tomorrow with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas.They are scheduled to move to Jerusalem for a second day of talks on Wednesday, and it is likely that Barack Obama will resume negotiations with Abbas and Netanyahu in New York next week at the UN general assembly.The Palestinians have warned that a renewal of Israeli construction would spell the end of the talks, which resumed recently after a 20-month hiatus. But Netanyahu said yesterday that the current building restrictions, which are due to expire in two weeks, would not remain in place, although there will still be some limits on construction.Netanyahu told the Tony Blair, the Middle East envoy for the quartet of the US, UN, EU and Russia, that a total freeze in construction "will not happen". Israel will not build "tens of thousands of housing units that are in the pipeline, but we will not freeze the lives of the residents", he said.Israeli leaders have refused to meet five senior European foreign ministers, including the British foreign secretary, William Hague, in Jerusalem this week, reportedly over fears they would add to pressure to extend the freeze.Obama said on Friday that he had urged Netanyahu to extend the partial moratorium as long as talks were making progress. He also said he had told Abbas that if he showed he was serious about negotiating, it would give Netanyahu room for manoeuvre on the settlement issue. Abbas knew "the window for creating a Palestinian state is closing", Obama said.Clinton's task, Obama said, was to get the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to "start thinking about how can they help the other succeed, as opposed to how do they figure out a way for the other to fail."Clinton said there was a "certain momentum" for talks after an initial round in Washington on 2 September, which marked the first direct Israeli-Palestinian talks for nearly two years.At the Council on Foreign Relations, Clinton was asked why those who saw little chance of reaching a settlement within Obama's one-year deadline were wrong. "I think they're wrong because I think that both sides and both leaders recognise that there may not ever be another chance," she replied.The "last chance" notion is partly based on the knowledge that Abbas is on borrowed time politically. His electoral mandate expired in 2009 and he fears a Hamas takeover of the West Bank, which is supposed to make up the bulk of an independent Palestinian state.Time is a motivating factor for the Israelis, too. Some Israelis believe the longer that Israel occupies the West Bank and its growing Arab population, the more Israel's future as a Jewish state is imperiled.
