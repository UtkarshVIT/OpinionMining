MILS MULIAINA FULL-BACK – 7Showed astonishingly silky footwork and some delightfully deft handling of the kind too rarely seen on modern rugby fields. ZAC GUILDFORD WING – 5Saw a lot less of the ball than Sivivatu as he was keener to stick to his touchline. On the odd occasion he did stray in field he cut his way through England with ease.CONRAD SMITH CENTRE – 4A sloppy display. He spilled simple passes to cut short attacking moves, and fumbled high balls.MA'A NONU CENTRE – 8Majestic, in stark contrast to his partner in the centre. Used his sneaky sleights of hand to spark attacks and his brute power to boss the midfield.SITIVENI SIVIVATU WING – 7Outstanding, especially on the frequent occasions when he came infield. His footwork made him all but impossible to bring down cleanly.DAN CARTER FLY-HALF – 7Missed two simple kicks that would have put his side out of reach before half-time, but made up for it with his all-round game.JIMMY COWAN SCRUM-HALF – 6Looked like an utter liability when his temper got him into trouble time and again. Proved his worth by starting, and finishing, New Zealand's try.TONY WOODCOCK PROP – 8Rock solid. His absence had explained New Zealand's troubles against Italy. The best loosehead in the game.ANDREW HORE HOOKER – 6Not the safest thrower at the line-out, but was in the thick of the action at the breakdown. Seemed to get right up Dylan Hartley's nose.OWEN FRANKS PROP – 7Out-classed England in the scrum. Faded when Johnson brought on Thompson and Wilson and was quickly hauled off. Still, a real find for his side.BRAD THORN LOCK – 6Out-classed by Borthwick in the line-out, but not to the extent where it made enough difference to the result. A solid contribution elsewhere.TOM DONNELLY LOCK – 6Conspicuous in the loose, where he was never far away from the action. Effective as a ball carrier, but not nearly so self-assured in the line-out.ADAM THOMSON FLANKER – 7Must have been taking lessons in the art of back-row play from McCaw. Excellent at the breakdown, where he made an utter nuisance of himself.RICHIE McCAW FLANKER, capt – 9Every bit as excellent as his reputation. Popped up in running play with the odd crucial pass, not least in the build-up to Cowan's try, and successfully sweet-talked the referee.KIERAN READ No8 – 6Neither as dashing or dominant as his two colleagues in the back-row, but worked cunningly as a blocker and fought for the hard yards too.REPLACEMENTSJohn Afoa (Franks 62) 7; Anthony Boric (Donnelly 61) 6; Jerome Kaino (Adam Thomson 61) 6; Andy Ellis (Jimmy Cowan 71) 6
