North Korea said today it was making "thorough preparations" to restart its nuclear reactor, accusing the US of failing to fulfil its obligations under an international disarmament-for-aid agreement.It is the first time the communist nation has confirmed that it is reversing earlier steps to disable its nuclear programme, although it had previously threatened to do so because of Washington's refusal to quickly remove it from a US terrorism blacklist."We are making thorough preparations for restoration" of the Yongbyon nuclear complex, the deputy director-general of North Korea's ministry of foreign affairs, Hyun Hak Bong, said. He did not say when Yongbyon might begin operating again. Hyun spoke to reporters in Panmunjom ahead of talks today with South Korean officials on sending energy aid to the North as part of the six-nation disarmament deal.Under the 2007 pact, which involves the two Koreas, the US, China, Russia and Japan, North Korea pledged to disable its nuclear programme in a step toward its eventual dismantlement in exchange for diplomatic concessions and energy aid equivalent to one million tonnes of oil.North Korea began disabling the Yongbyon complex last year, and the process was 90% complete, with eight of 11 key steps carried out "perfectly and flawlessly", Hyun said.Major progress was made in the agreement in late June when North Korea submitted a long-delayed declaration of its nuclear activities and destroyed the cooling tower at Yongbyon in a show of its commitment to denuclearisation.But the accord ran aground in mid-August when Washington refused to take North Korea off its list of states that sponsor terrorism until the state accepted a plan to verify its nuclear declaration.North Korea responded by halting the disabling process and is now "proceeding with work to restore (Yongbyon) to its original status", Hyun said.South Korean and US officials have said it would take at least a year for North Korea to restart the reactor if it was completely disabled.Hyun warned Washington not to press the verification issue, saying it had never been part of the disarmament deal."The US is insisting that we accept unilateral demands that had not been agreed upon. They want to go anywhere at any time to collect samples and carry out examinations with measuring equipment," he said. "That means they intend to force an inspection."He said forcing North Korea to comply with such an inspection would exacerbate tensions.The six-nation talks last convened in July, and a new round has not been scheduled because of the current standoff between the US and North Korea.However, today's talks between the two Koreas, which were proposed by the North, indicated the North did not want to completely scuttle the six-party negotiations, analysts said."The North is sending a message that it wants to maintain the six-party talks," said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University. "The North also wants to get the remaining energy aid with winter drawing closer."Seoul's delegate at the talks, Hwang Joon-kook, assured North Korea that it would receive the remaining energy aid it was promised.The South Korean foreign minister, Yu Myung-hwan, said North Korea's intentions remained unclear."It's still uncertain whether the North's measures are aimed at reversing the whole situation to the pre-disablement level" or are a negotiating tactic, he said.The tensions come amid reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has suffered a stroke. Kim, 66, has not been seen in public for more than a month and has missed two major public events: a military parade marking North Korea's 60th birthday and the Korean Thanksgiving holiday.
