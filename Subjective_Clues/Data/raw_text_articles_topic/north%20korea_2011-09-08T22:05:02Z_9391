The little beach is always strewn with small pebbles that are amazing in the range of their colour and texture, irresistible pebbles that beg to be picked up and examined before being returned to the sand or slipped into a pocket. I amble along towards the far end of the beach, where they are at their most dense. The incoming tide is smoothing away the footprints of those who have walked here earlier, and now, in the late afternoon, I have the beach to myself.Until, that is, right in front of me the cattle make their way over the crest of the dunes. This is no genteel procession of stately bovine matrons but a rowdy gang of 25 or so bullocks barging and shoving like long-confined schoolchildren escaping joyfully on a Friday afternoon. They stop at the sea's edge, the hooves of the foremost just touching the wavelets. A couple dip pink muzzles into the water, lapping at it once or twice with no apparent surprise at its saltiness. And then, unnervingly – for I have a lingering mistrust of bullocks after an encounter with an unruly mob some years ago – one by one they turn and face in my direction, and I realise that their path out to the grassy headland is blocked off by a strand of electric fencing. From just a few yards apart we stare at each other like gunfighters in a spaghetti western.Then, just as I begin to back away in order not to crowd them and set them bolting past, one of the nearest spots a green plastic bottle on the sand and noses it in investigation. The bottle rolls away, and the bullock follows, nosing at it a second time; again the bottle rolls. Another animal pushes in for a turn, and then a third, and suddenly I find myself charmed by their playful curiosity. I watch until they lose interest and then I turn and stroll back along the beach, the bullocks following sedately, a respectful distance behind.
