Following a brief, cryptic marketing campaign, the Scottish duo revealed that the LP will be released on 10 June.Just over a week ago fans got their first hint that Daft Punk are not the only secretive electronic act to be making a comeback in 2013. At Other Music, a record shop in New York, a shopper uncovered a mysterious 12-inch record containing 12 seconds of ambient music. The sleeve was marked Boards of Canada and bore the the numeric code 936557. Another copy was later discovered at London's Rough Trade East. Over the coming days, five more codes were released to BBC Radio 1, NPR, and Adult Swim, and via YouTube videos and the fan site Twoism. When Boards of Canada launched a new website yesterday, Cosecha Transmisiones, the numbers were found to be a password unlocking a video and a link to purchase the album.Given the gap between Tomorrow's Harvest and Boards of Canada's last LP, 2005's The Campfire Headphase, this has been a remarkably short promo campaign. Its brevity has been offset, however, by the music's languorous, abstract videos. Boards of Canada's sound has always evoked field recordings and the vintage educational productions of Canada's National Film Board, from which the duo take their name, and the new videos have a similar, nostalgic feeling.Tomorrow's Harvest contains 17 songs and includes the tracks Palace Posy, Jacquard Causeway and Semena Mertvykh. It is available for pre-order on CD and double-gatefold vinyl.But, for those who prefer limited-edition artefacts, the lucky buyer of that Other Music 12-inch has apparently put the record back up for sale for $5,000 (Â£3,226). "Near mint," the listing says, "One corner got a little bent."
