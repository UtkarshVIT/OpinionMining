A dynamite explosion has killed two workers at an illegal mine near the site of Chile's famous rescue, underlining continued safety problems in the industry and prompting the mine owner to reportedly flee the country.Monday's accident killed Homero Aguirre, 40, and Daniel Lazcano, 26, on their first day at the mine in the Atacama desert, near another mine from which 33 men were rescued last month.Old detonators apparently reacted to the heat and humidity and exploded prematurely, killing the pair and causing a third man to lose an eye from a flying rock.Hours later the Mexican owner flew to Argentina, according to the newsagency Efe, citing sources close to the investigation.The incident in an area of the desert known as Los Reyes – The Kings – was a melancholy sequel to the euphoria which greeted the escape of "los 33" and highlighted the lax enforcement of safety regulations of the gold and copper mines which dot the Atacama.The National Geology and Mining Service said the mine was new, illegal and unregistered. "We did not know it existed," an agency official, Mariano Garrido, told reporters.President Sebastian Piñera vowed to improve mining safety after the drama of saving men trapped underground for 69 days. He said the mine would shut for ever and gave pieces of rock from the site – considered to have divine properties by some of the rescued men's families – to the Queen and other European dignitaries.The 33 men have accepted an Israeli invitation for a week-long, all expenses paid visit to the Holy Land for Christmas, Israel's foreign ministry said yesterday.As they tour the world, however, other miners continue to take risks in the Atacama desert.With copper prices at near record highs illicit operators stand to make lucrative profits by continuing to operate in the area. Some offer bonus salaries to compensate miners for the lack of safety measures.Low inventories and booming demand from China have pushed prices up to $8,882 (£5,561) a tonne, just shy of the $8,940 record set in 2008. A strike at Chile's Collahuasi mine, one of the world's biggest, has also nudged up prices this week.
