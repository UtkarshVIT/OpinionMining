David Miliband has congratulated Pakistan on its return to democracy and advocates its re-entry into the Commonwealth (Pakistan's brief honeymoon, April 23). We also welcome the restoration of elections, but wish to urge the authorities to go further and join other civilised countries around the world in abolishing the death penalty. This week MPs, trade unions, students, Amnesty International and many community organisations are mounting a vigil outside the Pakistan high commission to halt the planned execution of Manjit Singh on May 1. Mr Singh is threatened with the death penalty for alleged terrorist activities. However, many believe he is innocent and that this is a case of mistaken identity. We are appealing to the Pakistani government to commute this death sentence and to abolish the death penalty altogether.
