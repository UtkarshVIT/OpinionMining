After a strange turn of events, Zanna and her best friend Deeba follow the trail of a broken umbrella to a wheel. Once the wheel is turned, the two girls find themselves in a strange place called Un Lun Dun – the place where all of the lost and broken things of London end up. Its here they find flying buses, a bridge that leads to anywhere and a group of people who live on the roofs that aren’t all they seem. Not to mention the evil Smog, a giant cloud of pollution that threatens to overtake the entire abcity. (That’s what Un Lun Dun is. There are others, like Helsunki, Romeless, Lost Angeles, Sans Francisco and No York, to name a few.)This book was a genius piece of fiction. The illustrations (drawn also by Mieville) showed just how strange and brilliant this world was (it must be good – it has a library so big that you need explorers to go in and find the book you want). I loved every single tiny detail of the descriptions and the drawings and the crazy characters that make up a motley bunch of main characters. I have to say, my personal favourite is the milk carton named Curdle!With Un Lun Dun, Mieville created an adventurous, exciting book without the romance and gory details that line so many teen bookshelves today. It was relaxing and enjoyable without rambling on or becoming tedious. I was hanging on to every play-on words.Definitely one of the best books I have read in a long while.
