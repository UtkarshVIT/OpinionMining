Le Colombier is a lovely family-run restaurant away from the city's tourist area. An unassuming front opens on to a rustic, friendly restaurant. They specialise in cassoulet and classics such as magret de canard. After a heavy main course try a refreshing sorbet 'drowning' in champagne. • 14 rue Bayard, +33 5 6162 4005, restaurant-lecolombier.com, three-course menu €22 alexandrafChez Toinette, MontmartreWe found this warm friendly bistro by accident when walking away from the crowds through the back streets of Montmartre. It has a great atmosphere and reasonably priced, tasty classic dishes (around €15 for a main course). There's a good, unpretentious selection of wine too. We went around 9pm, when it was quite buzzy, the clientele pretty much all French.• 20 rue Germain Pilon, +33 1 4254 4436, cheztoinette.commissmarple0512Chez Germaine, Palais-BourbonIt's not often you find an excellent bistro in Paris at reasonable prices, but Chez Germaine ticks all the boxes. In the heart of Paris (7th arrondissement), it exudes class with its simple, yet elegant interior, daily set menus and friendly (English-speaking!) waiters. I would recommend a homemade terrine as a starter, followed by pork with lentils. Glorious!• 30 rue Pierre Leroux, +33 1 4273 2834, three-course dinner €25Mason1Le Basilic, MontmartreTypically we stumble on the best restaurants on the last night of our trips, and invariably they are right under our noses. Such was the case with Le Basilic. It is intimate, atmospheric, inviting and affordable with a three-course set menu for €23 or the Parisian staples of escargot and duck from the à la carte menu. We'd felt ripped off in the majority of Parisian eateries, but Le Basilic restored our faith in French bistros, especially considering its location within a mile of Moulin Rouge and Sacré-Coeur. • 33 rue Lepic, +33 1 4606 7843, mains from €15TonyhardmanChez Janou, MaraisJust behind the place des Vosges on the corner of a street, you come upon a small bistro bursting with colour, ambience and delicious food. You can wait for a table at the bar, which has a fabulous range of Provençal wines. Then enjoy a meal starting with tasty olives and moving on to classics such as mussels, steak and duck; somebody at your table has to have the chocolate mousse. This place is quintessentially French, and humming with local chat.• 2 rue Roger Verlomme, +33 1 4272 2841, chezjanou.com, three-course lunch €14JoDonaldsonLe Bistro au Vieux ChêneThis is a small, welcoming French bistro in a side street in the 11th arrondissement, a bit off the tourist track.

La Cigale dates back to the 1890s andhas breathtaking ornate tiling between wooden panels and gorgeous mosaics. The cigale (grasshopper) can be seen in various poses in the tiles and mosaics. Apparently the cigale plays and eats all summer, a creature of the moment. The ambience of La Cigale coupled with the delicious food – sea food is a speciality – encourages you to live in moment.4 place Graslin, +33 2 5184 9494 lacigale.comGoforth12Auberge Des Peintres, Saint-Céneri-Le-GéreiThis building dates back 300 years, and the panelled walls are hung with local paintings. All the old favourites are on the menu. Pink magret de canard (duck breast), andouillette sausages, boudin noir (black pudding), and côte de boeuf. The joys of chocolate fondant and tarte tatin followed. Prices were reasonable for the excellent cooking. A pre-dinner stroll could take in the frescoed, Romanesque church wildflower gardens and Les Jardins de la Mansonière. • +33 2 3326 4918, Le Bourg, mains €15-€30MadeleineMorrowHameau Duboeuf, La Gare, Romanèche-Thorins This makes a fantastic stop-off on your way down France.
