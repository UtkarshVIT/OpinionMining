Hillary Clinton has said the US is ready to help Argentina and Britain resolve tensions over the ownership of the Falkland Islands.The US secretary of state is in Buenos Aires as part of a five-day South American tour which will also see her visit earthquake-hit Chile.Tensions between Argentina and the UK have flared in recent weeks over British oil exploration in the islands' waters.Clinton met Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in Montevideo, Uruguay, yesterday, before flying to Buenos Aires for further talks today.Clinton said: "We are not interested in, and have no real role in, determining what [Britain and Argentina] decide between the two of them. What we want to do is facilitate them talking to each other."She and Kirchner were in Uruguay to attend the inauguration of President José Mujica. Clinton had reportedly only intended to spend 10 minutes talking with Kirchner in Montevideo, before a late change in travel plans saw her depart for Buenos Aires.Kirchner has been pushing Britain to engage in talks over the Falklands, which Argentina calls Las Malvinas, since the arrival of the Ocean Guardian oil rig in the islands' waters."What we have requested is mediation as a friendly country of both Argentina and the United Kingdom," Kirchner said.She added that Argentina wants those the talks to take place within a framework established by the United Nations following the 1982 conflict. "That's it. The only thing we have asked for is just to have them sit down at the table. I don't think that's too much."Desire Petroleum, a small British company, started drilling about 60 miles north of the islands on 22 February. Geologists say there could be up to 60bn barrels of oil in the area, although sceptics doubt its commercial viability.Talking to reporters en route to Buenos Aires last night, Clinton agreed on the need for talks between the countries, but did not spell out what role the US would play in any discourse."We would like to see Argentina and the UK sit down and resolve the issues between them in a peaceful and productive way," she said.Argentina has been stepping up its diplomatic offensive in the last few days. Last week a summit of 32 countries in Mexico endorsed an Argentinian document accusing Britain of flouting international law by permitting drilling to begin. On Thursday Argentina appealed to the United Nations to put pressure on Britain over the islands' sovereignty.The UN has called for talks between the two countries, but would be unable to intervene without the backing of the security council, where the UK would be able to veto substantive resolutions.
