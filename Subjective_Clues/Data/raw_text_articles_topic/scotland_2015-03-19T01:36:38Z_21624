A collection of gruesomely banal objects, including three gallstones which failed to dissolve in a murderer’s acid bath, a collection of ropes used in almost a century of executions, and a tin of Andrews Liver Salts belonging to one of the Great Train Robbers, will go on public display for the first time with other artefacts from one of the world’s most famous and least visited museums: the Black Museum of Scotland Yard.The museum itself, crammed into two rooms and some storage space at the headquarters of the Metropolitan police in London, will remain strictly off limits, as it has been since it was founded in 1875 – but the Museum of London will bring scores of its contents into the light for the first time in a major exhibition, The Crime Museum Uncovered, opening in the autumn.“The term silent witness is often bandied about, but these objects really are the witnesses to generations of crimes, and each has a story to tell,” curator Jackie Keily said. “We want to use them not for voyeuristic thrills but to tell the very human stories, not just of the crimes, but of the detectives who investigated them, the victims and their families.”Many of the objects she has selected are startling, such as a row of death masks of hanged men, which normally look down on visitors from a high shelf in the museum. They include Robert Marley, who was executed in 1856 for beating a jeweller to death in a shop 100 yards from the Palace of Westminster – and from the police headquarters.John Haigh, the Acid Bath Murderer, a serial killer convicted of six murders in the 1940s - though he claimed to have killed at least nine - is represented by a pair of long thick gloves, the gallstones and a smart red handbag once owned by a wealthy widow, Olive Durand-Deacon, who became his last victim. Haigh believed he had perfected a technique which put him beyond prosecution by dissolving his victims’ bodies in a bath of sulphuric acid - but the sludge from the bath proved his undoing. Objects which survived to help hang him included the gallstones and the remains of a set of dentures.However some of the more notorious objects in the collection were rejected, including the stove and large cooking pots in which Dennis Nilsen boiled down body parts of young men at his London flat in the 1970s and 80s: he was eventually caught when a plumber was called to deal with blocked drains - it turned out the blockage was human flesh. Keily explained that the exhibition itself, and the objects chosen for display, were agreed following discussions with the Met curators, victims’ representatives and London Policing Ethics Panel, an independent body which advises mayor Boris Johnson.Not only is Nilsen still alive, serving a life sentence, but it was never established how many men he actually killed. “There are still families with missing loved ones from around that period who must wonder if they fell victim to Nilsen,” Keily said. “We felt it would be wholly inappropriate to display this material.”Although the collection relating to murder is the most famous, the Museum of London will also cover terrorism, including bomb fragments from the attacks by Irish Fenians which appalled 19th-century London, drug smuggling, forgery, and a talcum powder tin adapted to conceal microfilm by a Russian spy ring. Cases famous in the history of detection include Alfred and Albert Ernest Stratton, brothers who became the first men convicted of murder by fingerprint evidence, from a bloody thumbprint in the unfortunate shopkeeper’s cash box: the homemade masks they dropped at the scene will be in the exhibition.The museum, which was founded as a teaching tool in the early days of specialist training for detectives, has moved twice with the police force – and will have to move again when the Met moves out of the present New Scotland Yard block in Victoria.Properly known as the Crime Museum, it quickly became famous, and according to the Met was named the Black Museum by a disgruntled 19th-century Observer reporter who was refused admission. Police from all over the country have visited, but it has only been open to outsiders by invitation. The exhibition will include the visitors’ book, where the signatures show the extraordinary assortment of people who did get in, including the creator of Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, comic opera creators WS Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, the escapologist Harry Houdini, comedians Laurel and Hardy, King George V and many other members of the royal family.Some of the objects are dramatic, including a smart leather briefcase containing a syringe of poison with which the Kray twins intended to kill a witness before he could give evidence at the Old Bailey: it was never used. However, Keily finds some of the most everyday objects the most evocative. The personal possessions of Ronnie Biggs and other members of the Great Train Robbery gang were recovered by police from their hideout at Leatherslade Farm in Buckinghamshire, after they held up the Glasgow to London mail train in August 1963 and stole more than £2.5m. They include a bottle of Old Spice aftershave and a tin of Andrews Liver Salts. “There was always a tin of liver salts in my family’s bathroom and I suspect most others,” Keily said. “That and the aftershave instantly bring back the atmosphere of the 1960s more vividly than any newspaper account of the period.”
