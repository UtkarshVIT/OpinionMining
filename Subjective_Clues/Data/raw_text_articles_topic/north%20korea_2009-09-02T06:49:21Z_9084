Two American journalists who were detained in North Korea from March to August have said they "deeply regret" entering the country, as they described how guards dragged them back across the border and into captivity.In their first full account of events leading up to their captivity, which ended when the former US president Bill Clinton mounted a surprise visit to Pyongyang, Laura Ling and Euna Lee said they crossed the border for less than a minute.The reporters, who have been criticised for endangering refugees they interviewed, admit they knew they were entering North Korea.The two women, who work for Current TV – co-founded by the former US vice-president Al Gore – were covering a story on human trafficking. They had already interviewed North Korean defectors living in China illicitly and said they wanted to document the smuggling route across the Tumen River which divides China and North Korea.In a 2,000 word statement posted on the Current TV website, the journalists said they followed their guide because he seemed "cautious and responsible", but added: "We still don't know if we were lured into a trap."They said he had tried to arrange an interview with North Korean associates by telephone the previous night."When we set out, we had no intention of leaving China, but when our guide beckoned for us to follow him beyond the middle of the river, we did, eventually arriving … on the North Korean side. He pointed out a small village in the distance where he told us that North Koreans waited in safehouses to be smuggled into China," they wrote.They turned back, but midway across the frozen river they heard yelling."We looked back and saw two North Korean soldiers with rifles running towards us. Instinctively, we ran."We were firmly back inside China when the soldiers apprehended us … We tried with all our might to cling to bushes, ground, anything that would keep us on Chinese soil, but … they violently dragged us back across the ice to North Korea and marched us to a nearby army base … Over the next 140 days we were moved to Pyongyang, isolated from one another, repeatedly interrogated and eventually put on trial and sentenced to 12 years of hard labour."Their producer, Mitch Koss, and their guide outran the border guards, they said, adding that they believed it had been their journalistic responsibility to cover the harsh lives of North Korean refugees.However, they acknowledge aid groups are now finding it harder to operate along the border and that defectors are going deeper underground. "We regret if any of our actions, including the high-profile nature of our confinement, has led to increased scrutiny of activists and North Koreans living along the border. The activists' work is inspiring, courageous and crucial."Describing their shock at their release – one moment thinking they would be sent to a labour camp, the next ushered into a room to meet Clinton – the pair said they were experiencing "tremendous mental and emotional anguish" but felt incredibly fortunate to be free.They said that they would not say more about their time in captivity, adding: "We do not want our story to overshadow the critical plight of these desperate defectors."The journalists say they exercised "extreme caution" to protect sources and that once captured they tried to shield interviewees by "swallowing notes and damaging videotapes".There is a large North Korean refugee population in China but they remain underground for fear of being repatriated and sent to labour camps.A South Korean pastor who assisted the reporters' interviews in China told the New York Times last week that he was deported and his five secret homes for refugees shut down after their capture.The Rev Lee Chan-woo said police raided his home in China on 19 March, two days after the journalists were seized."The Chinese cited scenes from films confiscated from the journalists when they interrogated me," he said.He claimed that children at one home told him the crew asked them to face the cameras and speak to their mothers.The journalists refer to the visit in their account but do not address Lee's claims. They say they did not film anyone's face, except for a woman who allowed them to shoot her profile.They said they were "surprised" that the Rev Chun Ki-won – who leads the mission for which Lee works and has helped hundreds of North Koreans to reach countries such as the US – spoke to the media after their arrest. They said they had carefully followed his instructions in contacting his associates in China.Chun, the reporters' main contact, told the New York Times that two of their interviewees fled China after learning of the arrests.A PR representative for the reporters' families did not respond to the newspaper's queries, but a Current TV spokesman told it that "many of the details" in the pastors' accounts were "not correct".Separately, a senior North Korean official has arrived in China for talks, increasing hopes that progress can be made towards the resumption of talks on the country's nuclear programme.Kim Yong-il, the north's vice foreign minister, met officials in Beijing to discuss bilateral relations, the regional situation and issues of mutual concern, said the Chinese foreign ministry's spokeswoman Jiang Yu. Kim's trip comes a fortnight after the Chinese nuclear envoy Wu Dawei visited Pyongyang, although Jiang said the trip was to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties.A senior South Korean official said conciliatory gestures from the north in recent weeks did not reflect fundamental changes in its approach because it had shown no signs of ending its nuclear weapons programme.The south's unification minister Hyun In-taek said Pyongyang's olive branches were "just tactical changes because the north has neither declared its return to the six-nation talks nor changed its position" on disarmament.
