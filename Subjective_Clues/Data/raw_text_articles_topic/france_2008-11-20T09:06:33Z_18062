Air France-KLM, Europe's biggest airline, today accentuated the precarious state of the European economy by reporting a 96% plunge in second quarter net earnings to just €28m (£23.6m).It delivered an effective profits warning by admitting that its target of €1bn in operating earnings this year would be "very difficult" to achieve - though it would clearly be in profit.The airline saw first-half sales rise 4.4% to €13bn, with operating earnings at €639m despite a 35% rise in fuel prices during the period. Jean-Cyril Spinetta, chief executive, indicated the group would take out a further €260m of costs.Its relative woes come as chemicals group BASF has said it will slash production and car-makers are temporarily shutting down plants and preparing for a 30-hour week for production workers.EU governments are being urged to adopt stimulus packages worth 1% of GDP or a collective €130bn to help pull their economies out of prolonged recession but analysts say this is too little.
