Europe's key project in the contest for central Asian and Middle Eastern gas is to receive a big boost tomorrow when Turkey and EU governments sign a pipeline pact.Government leaders from a dozen countries are to meet in Ankara to sign an intergovernmental transit agreement on the €9bn (£7.75bn) Nabucco pipeline, the ambitious but ill-fated gas supply project aimed at weakening the Kremlin's stranglehold on Europe's gas supplies.The 3,300km pipeline, unbuilt and struggling in the recession and banking crisis to secure the necessary funding, is to run from eastern Turkey to eastern Austria, via Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary and is scheduled to be operational by 2014.But the project has been mired in disputes and difficulties for two years, raising doubts about its viability, not least because it remains unclear where the annual capacity of 31bn cubic metres of gas is to come from.Turkey and the EU have been at odds over the terms for the pipeline pact for the past year, with Ankara demanding 15% of the gas at discounted prices, either for domestic consumption or for re-export. The Turkish demand could have killed off Nabucco as a viable business proposition.As the pivotal transit country – more than half of the pipeline would be on Turkish territory – Turkey has also been locked in dispute with Azerbaijan, a key potential Nabucco supplier, complicating Europe's campaign to secure Azerbaijani gas-delivery pledges.But following talks in Prague in May, Ankara and EU governments have struck a deal on gas transit, clearing one of the biggest hurdles to the pipeline's realisation.The European commission described the pact as a breakthrough. The Americans, also keen to weaken Russian control of the gas supply lines to Europe, have been pressing all parties over the agreement and senior US officials will attend tomorrow's Ankara ceremonies.The EU imports about one-third, or 140bn cubic metres, of its gas from Russia, with Germany the biggest client. But Europe's vulnerability to Russian energy blackmail became depressingly clear in January when the Russian monopoly, Gazprom, closed down the pipelines through Ukraine to Europe because of a pricing dispute with Kiev and left several east European countries without gas in the middle of winter.Moscow and Kiev are currently embroiled in a renewed row over gas payments, raising the probability of further cut-offs.The Nabucco project is the central element in the EU "southern corridor", three pipelines in all that are supposed to pump 60bn cubic metres of gas or about 10% of requirements by 2020, bypassing Gazprom's control of the delivery systems.The Russians, the Europeans, the Americans, and the Turks are all engaged in a complex diplomatic and business contest for Azerbaijani and Turkmen gas.Nabucco could also pump gas from Iraq and even Iran, if there was a seismic political shift, but Turkmenistan is seen as the key to the pipeline's longer-term viability.
