The financial turmoil engulfing Greece intensified today as thousands of workers backed by militant trade unions went on strike, and international confidence in the economy plummeted following a second downgrading of its creditworthiness in as many weeks.In a sign of the mass resistance the socialist government can expect, Greeks took to the streets to protest at austerity measures that the EU deems crucial if the country is to avoid financial collapse.Prime minister George Papandreou announced the spending cuts on Monday in an attempt to calm markets after ratings agency Fitch downgraded the country's debt. Greece, he said, risked "sinking" if it failed to rein in its public sector deficit, projected to swell to 12.7% of GDP this year, and €300bn (£266bn) debt.Communist organisations, capable of mobilising thousands of people, denounced the measures. Marching on the Greek parliament, protesters shouted "Don't forget your promises George," referring to the pledges made by his party before being voted into office in October. "The rich should pay for the crisis."Unemployment figures also soared today and Greece's debt and bank stocks were pounded further.The prospect of social unrest wrecking long-overdue structural reforms prompted another ratings agency, Standard & Poor's, to cut Greece's creditworthiness to BBB+ from A minus late on Wednesday.Echoing other critics who remain unconvinced by the deficit-cutting measures announced by Papandreou, the agency said they were unlikely to achieve a sustainable reduction in the country's debt burden.With Greece set to become the eurozone's most indebted member next year, the effect of the downgrade was immediate: today, the risk premium on 10-year government bonds over benchmark German bunds hit its highest level since April.Although the socialists have vowed to reduce the deficit to below 3% by 2013, the level permitted under eurozone rules, Brussels has made clear that it wants to see more concrete measures. Fellow EU members and credit ratings agencies have urged Greece to follow the example of Ireland, which is also struggling with a huge public sector deficit, by cutting public sector pay and welfare benefits.Papandreou insists extra revenues can be raked in by cracking down on "core problems" starting with corruption, tax evasion and public sector waste.
