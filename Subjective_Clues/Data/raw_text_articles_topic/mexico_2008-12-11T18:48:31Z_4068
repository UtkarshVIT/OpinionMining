Mexico has become one of the first developing countries to set a specific carbon reduction target, with a pledge to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Juan Rafael Elvira, Mexico's environment secretary, told UN climate talks in Poznan, Poland that the target was intended to challenge other countries to take action.The pledge is on 2002 levels. Mexico produced more than 430m tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2006, making it the 13th largest emitter in the world.Elvira said the target would be met with clean and efficient technologies, such as wind and solar power. Mexico also plans a domestic cap-and-trade system by 2012 to cut emissions from certain sectors, such as cement and oil refining.Fernando Tudela, the country's deputy environment secretary, said: "This is a very aggressive goal for our country, but we are confident we can achieve it with international assistance." He hoped it would spark "similar action by other developing countries."Costa Rica has pledged to go carbon neutral by 2021 under a UN scheme.Environmentalists at the talks have strongly criticised some of the world's richest countries, saying they have done too little to battle global warming.But many developing countries have been praised for specific plans to fight climate change.Keith Allott, the World Wildlife Fund's head of climate change, said: "This move by Mexico confirms a trend we have been seeing all through these talks, with the developing world coming up with the innovative ideas on how to move to a low carbon pathway. Unfortunately, the developed world has its fingers in its ears and is sitting on its hands."
