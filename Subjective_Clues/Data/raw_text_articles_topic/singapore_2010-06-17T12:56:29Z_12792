A 23-storey tower in Leeds has been recognised as the 'best tall building' in Europe.The Independent reports that Broadcasting Place in Woodhouse Lane - which stands less than 70m tall and is made of deliberately rusted steel - has just been bracketed with three megastructures as one of the four best towers erected in 2010.The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) decided that the building, designed by Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios, was more than equal to some of the largest and most impressive structures built by man.The other buildings garlanded by the CTBUH are a trio of the usual suspects: the Burj Khalifa in Dubai which, at 828m, is more than 11 times higher than Broadcasting Place; the 163m Pinnacle@Duxton in Singapore and the 366m Bank of America tower in New York.The award has already caused a lively debate in this office - personally I'm not a great fan of Broadcasting Place, but others think it's a great achievement and puts Leeds on the map.
