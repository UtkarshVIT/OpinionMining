Scotland's economy faces a "slow grind" as it recovers from the banking crisis, and it will be 2017 before employment returns to pre-recession levels, according to a new study.In its summer update, the Ernst and Young Scottish Item Club predicts that the economy will contract by 3.1% this year, and stagnate in 2010, before finally nudging back to growth in 2011."The patient is still a long way from recovery and there is more pain to come in the form of significant job losses," said Dougie Adams, the report's author.A vibrant financial services sector, led by Royal Bank of Scotland, has been at the heart of Scotland's economic success story over the past decade; but after its collapse - and with HBOS, too, swallowed up by Lloyds - Scotland will be forced to look for alternative engines of prosperity.Adams said although the decline of sterling against the euro should bring more continental visitors, boosting the crucial tourist industry, belt-tightening by domestic consumers was likely to offset the rise in foreign spending. "The impact [increase in tourists] is negated by the generalised weakness in consumers' expenditure," he said.
