At least nine people were killed in Egypt today when a bus carrying tourists, including British holidaymakers, overturned and caught fire, security and emergency officials said.The Foreign Office said a number of Britons were travelling on the bus. It could not confirm how many, but said none had been killed and it was still investigating whether any were injured. The bus was carrying around 40 tourists from Canada and Europe, 28 of whom were injured in the crash, said Dr Said Issa, the director of emergency services in Sinai. It was travelling from the Sinai resort of Sharm el-Sheik to the Egyptian capital, Cairo.The bus overturned on a sharp bend in the road at Abu Zenima, about 40 miles (70km) south-east of the Suez Canal, then caught fire, Issa said.The cause of the accident was not immediately known, security officials said. Ali Haridi, an Egyptian who was sitting near the driver when the accident happened, said the bus flipped over and he was so disorientated "I couldn't tell where the driver was".Haridi, who suffered cuts and burns, spoke by mobile phone from an ambulance that he said was carrying several injured tourists, including a woman whose hand had been severed and another who was severely burned.Accidents are common in Egypt because of speeding, careless driving and poor road conditions.At least 8,000 people were killed in accidents in 2006, the most recent statistics available.
