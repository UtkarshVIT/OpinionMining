David Cameron has told Binyamin Netanyahu that the UK continues to believe that a two-state solution is the best way to “achieve a lasting peace and to secure Israel’s long-term security and prosperity”, after Netanyahu appeared to rule out recognising a Palestinian state.A spokesperson for the prime minister said he had spoken to Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, by phone on Monday night and had “congratulated him on winning the recent Israeli elections, and looked forward to working with the new government when it was formed”.Speaking in the Commons earlier on Monday, the prime minister said he would use the telephone call to put pressure on the newly re-elected Netanyahu to commit to talks on a two-state solution.

He didn’t run around giving interviews saying he’s now against the Palestinian state,” he said.Former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw asked the prime minister on Monday if he would use the call to “emphasise to Mr Netanyahu that what his party and government have been involved in is trying to change the reality on the ground through settlement building, so that if it goes on, it will be impossible for there to be a separate state of Palestine and if he carries on like this the patience of this House and Europe will run out”. Cameron said he agreed with Straw’s point: “If there isn’t a two-state solution you end up moving towards a one-state solution which I think will be disastrous for the Jewish people in Israel.“So I really do believe in the two-state solution and we’re very much opposed to the settlement building that there has been and been very clear about that and will continue to be clear about that. It makes a two-state solution more difficult and that in turn will make Israel less stable rather than more stable.” Cameron’s comments come after the deputy prime minister criticised his weak reaction to Netanyahu’s remarks ahead of the Israeli election. “I actually share President Obama’s views much more than David Cameron’s,” Clegg said during his weekly radio phone-in show on LBC. “It is extremely worrying – it cannot be more alarming – to have seen Binyamin Netanyahu do something which no leading Israeli politician has ever done – to rule out the prospect of a two-state solution.”Clegg said he hoped Netanyahu’s comments had been “breathless rhetoric which he is now going to row back from”, but that if the Israeli prime minister continued to rule out a two-state solution and expand illegal settlements “the world, including the British parliament, would have no option, inevitably, but to recognise a Palestinian state”.He said a formal move to recognise a Palestinian state would be in response to “extreme provocation from Netanyahu”. In October 2014, parliament voted 274 to 12 in favour of a non-binding backbench motion to recognise the state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel. Twenty-eight of the Liberal Democrats’ 56 MPs voted in favour and one (Sir Alan Beith) voted against.Clegg said: “It cannot be right, given that this is a crucible of so much violence and division across so many communities, that one man – in what I assume was a desperate attempt to curry some votes – should basically tear up the basic tram lines on which a peace deal is likely to occur.”
