COLD TURKEY HAS GOT ROBINHO ON THE RUNIf, like The Fiver, you've spent the last week in a state of intensive Kaka-guff-ingestion - cocooned within your Kaka-guff-den, intermittently bringing your face down with a huge whump into a mound of pure Kaka-guff - you might just be feeling a little shivery and cold turkey this morning. Thankfully, though, we still have Kaka fall-out, Kaka-debrief and Kaka-shakedown to get us through these difficult times. Even better, we've also got Manchester City executive chairman - and Thaksin's golfing partner - Gary Cook. "If you want my personal opinion they [Milan] bottled it," Cook raged this morning, a turn of phrase that could equally describe the way in which all five members of Girls Aloud have repeatedly "bottled" an open invitation to an evening in at The Fiver's bijou urban rafter space eating corned beef out of the can and playing Star Wars: The Clone Wars Top Trumps."There were questions that were asked that they then couldn't answer," Cook explained. These questions presumably included (a) what do you mean, what are we doing here?; (b) can you call upstairs again, they're definitely expecting us?; and (c) well, is it OK if we just wait in reception then? Cook also revealed that City never actually met Kaka, which made it "very difficult for him to turn down Manchester City" (although not impossible). This despite assorted shark-faced City suits flying to Milan four times, apparently just to rap with Kaka's dad about dolphins. "We talked a lot about a humanitarian approach and also environmental issues and the statements his son would like to make around the world," Cook explained. "It's a shame he won't be able to join us on our journey." Which, right now, looks like involving away trips to Blackpool and Doncaster next season.Also on an exciting journey today, it's Robinho, who has given City's mid-season trip to Tenerife the swerve - although if the Fiver's own experiences are anything to go by, this might be because he doesn't like being attacked by radioactive cockroaches while 17 bright-red Englishmen all called Vince violently initiate a pool-side conga. Not to worry though. Mid-air on his way back to Brazil, Robinho has already texted his excuses ("a family matter") and explained that he's still "committed to helping Manchester City become the farce the owners assured me they will become." What's that? Oh, right. Force.*********************QUOTE OF THE DAY"It is totally out of the question. He won't go to the Championship" - Aston Villa substitute and Homer Simpson lookalike Marlon Harewood's Mr 15%, Phil Sproson, rules out any chance of his client moving to Sheffield United. Or Tottenham. Or Newcastle United. Or Manchester City. Etc, and so on, and so forth.*********************YOUNG MAN, YOUNG MAN...Last year, a bronze statue of Brian Clough was unveiled in Nottingham. Fastidiously lifelike, it depicts Clough with his arms clasped above his head in triumph, and will be toppled off its pedestal in about 15 years time so it can roll away down the street on its own into the nearest gutter. No such tribute has yet been erected in Derby, the scene of Clough's other great triumph, however. Which may go some way to explaining why, a couple of weeks ago, Derby County decided to install a special living, breathing, moving reminder of their greatest manager in the interim.The Rams' new monument-manager is already doing sterling work in ensuring nobody forgets what a gloriously chippy sod Clough was. Cloughie's Young Lad Nigel (to give him his full official name) had already told most of his players, Leeds '74-style, that they are effing hopeless, and useless t'boot. "Some of the basic things on Saturday, any player in the lower leagues wouldn't have made those mistakes," he ranted after Derby's 2-0 defeat to QPR last weekend, suggesting that few of his Championship squad could hold a candle to his former Conference charges at Burton.And now, ahead of Derby's League Cup visit to Old Trafford this evening, he's dishing out backhanded compliments to figures of authority. "There are certain similarities," he sighed when being asked to compare his dad, who won two European Cups on a budget of 23p, with Sir Alex Ferguson, who hasn't. "I don't think there are too many Labour supporters among football managers these days, which they both were," sniffed CYNL, one casual use of the past tense laying to waste the lapsed socialist of the realm and defender of the Glazers, much like his dad totally owned Don Revie.An impressive start in his role as walking museum, but on-pitch success is another thing entirely and Ferguson is likely to have the last laugh tonight. For while his Manchester United side will contain kids like Darron Gibson and Danny Welbeck, and may also feature John O'Shea if Ferguson is really chancing his arm, Derby could be forced to rely on Robbie Savage, 83. "Let's not beat about the bush - everyone is fearing my legs have probably gone," was Savage's rallying cry. Oh dear: when you consider Clough's Burton side only lost 5-0 when they went to Old Trafford a couple of years ago, this doesn't exactly augur well, does it?Follow Derby's shock 3-0 win, a prediction which totally contradicts the story you've just read, from 7.30pm with Scott Murray here.*********************THE RUMOUR MILLSaudi Arabian side Al Nasr are ready to put an end to Egyptian midfielder Hossam Ghaly's White Hart Lane pain.Paul Ince is going to Norwich.

Rather than lie down for a couple of hours worth of Zs in one of New Office's relaxation pods, he cranked out 502 words on Craig Bellamy's transfer to Manchester City instead.Rob Smyth's blog entitled The Forgotten Story ...
