You write “So far, Switzerland has concentrated on bringing Hervé Falciani, the bank IT worker who leaked the data, to justice” (Report, 10 February). This wording is too favourable to the Swiss. You should either use neutral terminology, such as “Switzerland concentrates on prosecuting Falciani”, or state the truth: “Switzerland continues to engage in witness intimidation”.Dr David CooperNewbury, Berkshire• How fortunate that none of the wealthy and criminal clients of HSBC (HMRC knew of wrongdoing, but did not prosecute bank, 10 February) stole a bottle of water. As we know from the government’s comments after the jailing of someone for just such a minor theft during the 2011 riots, criminal behaviour of that nature fully deserves a custodial sentence.Dr Chris MorrisKidderminster, Worcestershire• I read with increasing alarm the growing list of unethical if not illegal activities of the HSBC group. It seems wealthy customers can put pressure on the bank. I suggest that their large numbers of less wealthy clients, including those of First Direct, write to the bank and ask them why they should not withdraw their accounts.Mick FarrantLondon• On the road to Damascus, Ian Birrell learns that the super-rich “seek to capture western governments, ensuring they can increase their wealth while protecting their interests” (Opinion, 10 February). How many New Labour grandees did he pass travelling in the opposite direction?Paul MartinLondon• My son was fined £1,200 for late return of his self-assessment tax form. He worked six months of the year at the minimum wage to earn money to go travelling. Tax owed: zero. Value of assets held by HSBC’s “wealthy and criminal clients”: £78bn. Fined: zero.Lin McCullochLondon• Out of curiosity, how many plasterers, nurses or lecturers were there/are there on the board of HSBC?John CumminsCallander, Stirling
