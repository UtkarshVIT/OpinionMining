Egypt ordered its police on alert to foil a nationwide strike planned by pro-democracy activists today.Yesterday's order from the interior ministry came a day after police arrested 28 activists of the April 6 Movement, which called for the protest against government restrictions on political groups.The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition group, said it would also take part in the strike.Plainclothes security men were deployed in Cairo's main squares and around several government offices where the activists said they would stage their protests, interior ministry officials said. The April 6 Movement gets its name from the date last year of a strike by workers at a textile factory who were demanding higher wages. That protest prompted a brutal police crackdown. The movement's activists then attempted to channel popular discontent over lack of democracy, corruption and human rights abuses through protests organised by mobile phone messages and the social networking site Facebook.However, their call last year for a nationwide strike on 4 May, President Hosni Mubarak's birthday, went largely unheeded. The group says it has the support of 75,000 members.On Saturday, a court in the Nile Delta ordered two students to be detained for distributing flyers calling for people to join Monday's strike.
