Metro France, under its new ownership by the commercial TV channel TF1, is planning to expand distribution next year from 30 to 60 cities.According to director Edouard Boccon-Gibod, this means that coverage in France will rise from 68 to 90% of the country. But circulation will stay the same because distribution in existing markets will be lowered.Metro France is now distributed in nine different daily editions with a total circulation of 770,000 copies.After 20 Minutes and DirectPlus it is France's third free daily.Sources: Newspaper Innovation In French: Ozap
