The Pakistan opposition leader Imran Khan has warned the country's government that thousands of his supporters will storm Pakistan's parliament and other sensitive buildings if his demand for its immediate resignation was not met.The threat, issued during a late night rally in Islamabad on Saturday, raises the stakes of his so-called "freedom march" against alleged electoral fraud that has been marred by a disappointing turnout and monsoon rainfall.The government has vowed to protect buildings inside the city's "red zone" and says 30,000 security force members are on hand to keep protesters out from the area, already barricaded with shipping containers.Late on Sunday, thousands of supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party began moving towards a large stack of containers on a major avenue leading to the red zone. Television pictures showed riot police gathering on the other side.Analysts say a violent confrontation with authorities could be the only way to save his much-heralded protest, which some have already written off as a flop.Khan set off from the city of Lahore on Thursday for a slow drive to the capital, where it was hoped a massive sit-in would force the resignation of prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, and force fresh elections. But he has failed to attract anything like the million supporters he claimed would attend and other leading political parties have so far refused to offer their support.Serious unrest in the capital may force an intervention by Pakistan's powerful military â€“ the only conceivable way many commentators believe Sharif could be ousted given the prime minister's huge parliamentary majority."I'm controlling the anger of my workers," Khan warned, citing the example of the 2011 protests in Tahrir Square that toppled the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. "But I will not able to control it for long."A parallel protest has been ongoing a few blocks away led by Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri, a cleric who despite being based in Canada commands a devoted following among Barelvi Muslims who watch his regular television broadcasts and his support his charitable foundation.Qadri has dismissed Khan's calls for fresh elections, arguing Pakistan's democracy is so compromised by corrupt politicians that the country should be ruled by a "national government" of technocrats.Despite the presence of the two charismatic leaders the crowds have been far smaller than expected. Most estimates suggest the number of people peaked at about 50,000, with Qadri attracting considerably more.Hostile quarters of the media have highlighted the fact that Khan slipped off to rest at his nearby hilltop mansion on Friday, despite promises he would remain on the streets among his supporters. He did manage a few hours under the stars the following night however.Also sparking media outrage was footage of the PTI's most powerful elected official, Pervaiz Khattak, the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, dancing at the rally on Saturday night. Critics said he should have been at work overseeing relief efforts in his province, which has been hit by monsoon floods that have killed at least 18 people.
