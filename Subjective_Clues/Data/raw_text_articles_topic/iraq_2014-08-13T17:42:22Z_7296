It appeared over the last days as if there was a competition of who could shout most, and then offer most, as the humanitarian crisis in northern Iraq unfolded.After Barack Obama ordered air strikes, Britain could not be far behind. That, at least, seemed to be the gut reaction of some Tory MPs, egged on by former generals, and sections of the media."What we have got", former General Sir Richard Shirreff told the Times on Monday, "is this commitment-phobic government that is terrified...of any form of intervention involving boots on the ground before an election next year".Former armed forces minister, David Robathan, told the BBC: "There are many ways one could use military strikes - air strikes or the use of drones can be done fairly surgically without putting troops on the ground...There is no appetite to have proper troops on the ground".Demands that parliament should be recalled increased. Humanitarian aid was not good enough, came the cry.Stung by suggestions that Britain must do more, after a meeting of the Cobra "emergency" committee (named after a Cabinet Office briefing room) chaired by the new foreign secretary (and former defence secretary) Philip Hammond, 10 Downing Street on Monday announced that Britain would send Tornado jets, strictly for surveillance operations only, the government insisted.The US had not asked for any help. "Ministers want to be seen to be doing something for political and presentational reasons", observed an experienced, well-placed, Whitehall source who asked to remain anonymous.On Wednesday the government decided to send Chinook helicopters to northern Iraq - to supply Jordanian trucks to the region. Shortly afterwards, the French government announced it had gone further, deciding to supply arms to the Kurds.David Cameron rushed home early from his holiday in Portugal. Not to be outdone, he announced that Britain would now supply the Kurds with ammunition. Furthermore, RAF Chinooks would help to airlift Yazid refugees from Mount Sinjar.One may be forgiven, and not be accused of cynicism, to observe that it seemed as though the government was concerned as much about criticism at home as the need to consider practical, sustainable, and lasting, initiatives in northern Iraq.Cameron was the first to urge air strikes against the forces of Britain's former enemy number one, turned oil-rich close friend, Muammar Gaddafi, in Libya in 2011. There was little attempt to help stabilise the country afterwards.Cameron insisted Bashar al-Assad, Syria's president, must go before any settlement in that country could be reached. The bloody civil war, feeding the Islamic State jihadists over the border in Iraq, continues.The situation in northern Iraq could be the trigger for Britain, and other European countries, to work out a coherent policy towards humanitarian crises, and vicious internal conflicts. This will not be the last, where countries in the Middle East, north Africa, and elsewhere, need the right kind of support.It would be in the interests of European countries to provide it, and might even make US military action unnecessary. Intervention from outside need not always be fuel added to the fire.It is time calmly to develop a coherent doctrine, a guide for when to intervene, and how, and when not to, with early warning provided by effective intelligence - as British, and other western troops, prepare to leave Afghanistan.
