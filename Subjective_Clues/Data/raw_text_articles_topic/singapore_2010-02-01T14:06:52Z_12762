The company launched a production business in Asia in August last year, and has an option to acquire Karay's 40% stake in 2013."These Asian titles offer an opportunity in their own right, particularly online, plus the opportunity for Ten Alps to expand the commercial reach of its complementary UK specialist portfolio into Asia on the back of the acquired sales and distribution organisation," the company said in a statement.In addition Ten Alps has also acquired Interface, a business specialising in media sales, digital and online search engine optimisation services in the Asian business-to-business sector."The business has made two strong initial moves in the market, with potential to develop the acquired assets using publishing techniques deployed successfully in our UK operations," said Adrian Dunleavy, chief executive of Ten Alps' communications division.In the UK Ten Alps has teamed up with the Press Association and Daily Mirror publisher Trinity Mirror to bid to run the pilot for the ITV regional news service in the north-east of England.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
