What is the biggest change you have seen in China? And in your own life?In the past people did not care about hygiene and would spit and throw rubbish on the streets, but now they've become more polite. The biggest change in my life was moving out of the countryside when I was six. I had to help my grandparents farm; it was very tiring. There were snakes which were frightening and I could always smell shit. We ate vegetables more than meat and sometimes I saw worms in our meals. Now we live in the city, I feel happy. I even feel the bitter melon we eat tastes sweet. I work in a wedding photo shop at weekends; I never knew such a thing existed. What's your greatest hope for China and for yourself?I hope our country can save more trees and forests. When I was in the countryside, there were trees everywhere and I used to talk to them when I felt unhappy – they were like friends. But now I see fewer and fewer, and birds have lost their homes. Personally, I hope to start ­working when I finish school; my family's not rich so I want to earn money to help my ­parents. When I was a kid I wanted to be a teacher, but now I think being a model or an actor or singer would be better; life would be more interesting and I could earn more.What's your biggest fear?Losing everything I have now. Last year's earthquake in Sichuan still casts its shadow on me. I've heard there is a serious economic crisis all over the world and some boys in our school said the end of the world is coming. I feel terrified sometimes when I think about it. I'm happy with my life and it's just started, so I'm afraid of losing it.
