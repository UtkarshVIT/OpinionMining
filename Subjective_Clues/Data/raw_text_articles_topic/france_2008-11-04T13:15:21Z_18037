Another footnote of the imperial spread of BBC Worldwide today as some major BBC dramas are added to iTunes France. Pride and Prejudice, Torchwood, Extras and The Lost World are now all available en France either as a complete series or in individual episodes. Most shows are available in French and in English and start at â‚¬1.99 for one episode.This makes the BBC - or rather BBC Worldwide - the first UK broadcaster to make programmes available on the iTunes Store in France, just as it was in the UK.Photograph: _sarchi/Flickr/Some rights reserved
