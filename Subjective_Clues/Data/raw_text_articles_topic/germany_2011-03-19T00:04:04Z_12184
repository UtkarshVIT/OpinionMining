I am always being asked which German town I like best – and this, on the face of it, completely fair question always freezes me up. Dizzy with pubs, turrets, marketplaces, graveyards and shops selling odd things made from marzipan, I can no longer really tell which was which. Mystic rosebushes, miniature prisons, pulpits shaped like a tulip have all blended into a single demented townscape as the years spent wandering happily from place to place now take their mental revenge on me.Taking a grip of myself, however, I will tend to blurt out one word: "Bamberg". Now I know that I liked Weikersheim more and felt more peaceful sitting outside a hermit's rock-chapel in Schwäbisch Gmünd, but Bamberg, in Bavaria, was the place that so battered my senses that it made me want to uproot my family and live in Germany.Bamberg is built around seven hills and features the most extraordinary architecture – the cathedral, for example, crowded with the most vivid and peculiar medieval stone carvings, a monastery enclosing a garden filled with all the flowers and fruit mentioned in the Bible and with a side-chapel which includes the most enjoyable of all German representations of "dances of death", with a gleeful, preening, derisive skeleton capering around his victims.Many of the streets are so perfectly gnarled and gabled that you expect the population to all sing from their balconies or do Student Prince-style dances over the town's bridges, rather than merely queue at ATMs or buy sausages. The pubs fuel astonishing levels of drinking – apparently the highest per capita consumption of beer in Europe and with a real sense that in these roaring, terrible-smelling interiors the entire population is working hard to maintain this pointless eminence.Much of the action is focused on the unique Rauchbier, a local beer created by doing something to malt not viewed as rational in other places. It tastes terrible, but nonetheless gives the drinker such a feeling of localism, camaraderie and warrior strength as to be almost irresistible.The wonderful ETA Hoffmann lived for a while in Bamberg and in so much of the town you feel fully engaged with his macabre spirit – strange towers, moss-covered walls and inexplicably designed carvings, shop signs and door knockers proliferate. Even secondhand bookshops help out with needlessly necromancy-focused window displays.But at the town's sinister – but pleasurable – heart lies the spectacular bird hall at the city's Natural History Museum (naturkundemuseum-bamberg.de), which reopened last year after heavy restoration work. This great room preserves miraculously the spirit of the late 18th century, when Bamberg was a semi-independent state and the Enlightenment in full swing.A mass of white and gold paint, the hall has somehow kept all its original fittings, which display stuffed birds, a whale jaw, glass pyramids filled with robin eggs and wax models of every fruit to be found in Bamberg, with everything somehow almost glowing with that era's atmosphere of genial inquiry.I never did get to live in Bamberg, my children skipping over the bridges strewing flower petals, my wife waving and laughing from the balcony of our pub (or, in another scenario, waving and laughing from the balcony of the bird hall curator's no-doubt charming house). But it was the inspiration of Bamberg, as well as my family's sullen refusal to uproot from south-west London, that made me fall back on the second best thing and start writing a book.
