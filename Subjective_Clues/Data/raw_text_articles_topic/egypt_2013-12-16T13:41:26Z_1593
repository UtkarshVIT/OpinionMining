Bikya burst onto the scene in 2005 with a unique blend of drum 'n' bass rhythms, the contrasting clinks and clanks of Detroit techno, funky basslines, and an ornamental use of noise. Recent releases have demonstrated the band's evolution from their electronic-acoustic beginnings into something bigger, more progressive and more sophisticated.Last week saw Mahmoud Refat, who plays drums and synthesizer in Bikya, perform a live musical score to Walther Ruttmann's 1927 silent film Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, at Falaki Theater in downtown Cairo. Ranging from ambient and white noise to abbreviated segments of glitch-hop and snippets of industrialized drum 'n' bass, Refat's score made for a unique film experience.Refat's forthcoming solo album Adventurous Republic, scheduled for release early next year, is an eclectic postmodern cacophony of compositions featuring a range of musicians, from Egyptian singer Aya Metwali to American MC Khadafi Dub.“The album is meant to be very diverse,” says Refat. “It features electronic musicians, traditional musicians, female singers – the concept is just a combination of the music I’ve been listening to and working with for the past few years. It’s also promoting the idea that there is no longer a standard genre or standard style in the music I do, as I feel that music should not be put in a box.”With a new sound that cannot be instantly identified or labeled, Refat is successfully seeking out progressive collaborations that deconstruct traditional music genres.• More from Mada Masr• Midimode: New music from Russia• Geek Sleep Sheep – Hitsuji: New music from Japan
