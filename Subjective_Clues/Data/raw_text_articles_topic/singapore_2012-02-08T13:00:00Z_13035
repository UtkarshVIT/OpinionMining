On 23 May 2012, Accenture focused the attention on business sustainability, by advancing global debate and discussion with clients, business leaders, local government leaders and other stakeholders. A twelve hour interactive online global broadcast connected three live events, taking place in Rio, Singapore and London, as well as other individual keynote speakers and panel discussions, with live chats, webinars, industry-focused debates and question and answer sessions with guest speakers from across the globe.To view video replays of any of the sessions, please click here.
