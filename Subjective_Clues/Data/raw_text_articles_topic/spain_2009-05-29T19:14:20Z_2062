A Spanish political party previously aligned with some of the most extreme rightwing parties in Europe and backed by Blas Piñar, a leading apologist for former dictator Francisco Franco, has allied itself with the British Conservative party.Alternativa Española says it is the new Spanish partner of choice for the Tories as they turn their backs on pro-European centre-right parties in the European parliament and try to forge new alliances.Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan, a prominent Eurosceptic and Spanish speaker, has been in Spain this week calling for Britons living in the country to vote for Alternativa Española.The party defines itself as conservative but, according to its website, backed the so-called Vienna Declaration that brought together extreme rightwing parties from across Europe in 2005. Its allies then were Austria's Freedom party, the French National Front of Jean Marie Le Pen, the Flemish party Vlaams Belang, Alessandra Mussolini's Azione Sociale and extreme rightists from Romania and Bulgaria. Though some of the parties are openly xenophobic or Nazi apologists, Alternativa Española says it is not racist.Hannan said last night he had not heard of Alternativa Española having been associated with the radical parties that backed the Vienna Declaration. "It is not only new information to me but it is at odds with what they said to me. I will take it up with them," he said. "If that is true, it is deeply alarming and of course we shouldn't have anything to do with them."A Conservative party source said it was a "fair bet" that Alternativa Española would not join its new group.
