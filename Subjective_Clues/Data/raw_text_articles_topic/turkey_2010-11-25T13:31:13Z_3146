British novelist Hari Kunzru has attacked Turkey's record on free speech at the Istanbul literary event the European Writers' Parliament, describing VS Naipaul's absence from the event "regrettable", and calling for the repeal of the notorious article 301 of the Turkish penal code.Kunzru stepped into the breach to deliver the opening speech this morning in place of Naipaul, who withdrew from the EWP earlier this week "by mutual agreement" with the organisers following a row over his criticisms of Islam.Kunzru referred to the Nobel laureate's absence and said: "I feel we would be stronger and more credible if we were to deal with divergent views within this meeting rather than a priori excluding someone because of fear that offence might be given."The writer also attacked Turkey's record on free speech, citing the cases brought against novelist Orhan Pamuk and editor Hrant Dink under article 301 of the country's penal code, which makes it illegal to insult Turkey, Turkish ethnicity or Turkish government institutions.Kunzru told the assembled authors: "Pamuk faced trial for giving the following statement to a Swiss magazine: 'Thirty thousand Kurds have been killed here and a million Armenians. And almost nobody dares mention that. So I do.'" He added: "Dink, one of Turkey's most prominent Armenian voices was convicted under article 301 then murdered by a young nationalist, who was subsequently photographed in a police station surrounded by smiling officers, against the backdrop of the national flag. There are many other examples in Turkey of the weapons of offence and insult being used to silence dissent. Turkey is obviously not alone in this, but since we are here, it is important that we acknowledge it."Kunzru said he believed one of the most tangible and immediate results of the European Writers' Parliament would be to call for the repeal of section 301 "and a declaration that no European writer should have to operate under the threat of similar laws".The novelist acknowledged that his criticisms risked causing offence, but said: "Our kind Turkish hosts have invited us here, as an international group, to air our views, and so it is my belief that we must not shy away from recognising the situation here, where we are speaking." He added: "It would be absurd to assert freedom of speech in the abstract without exercising it in concrete terms."Kunzru has been outspoken in the past in defence of his beliefs. In 2003 he refused the award of the Â£5,000 John Llewellyn Rhys prize for his debut novel, The Impressionist, because it was then sponsored by the Daily Mail. Kunzru rejected the prize because of what he called the paper's consistent "hostility towards black and Asian British people", telling the organisers to give the cash to the Refugee Council.
