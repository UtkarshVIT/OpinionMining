The BBC's World News has been taken off the air in Pakistan after broadcasting a documentary that was deemed to be critical of the country. Secret Pakistan, which was screenedÂ last Wednesday, explored accusations by CIA officials and western diplomats that Pakistan was failing to meet its commitments in the "war on terror". Khalid Arain, president of the country's cable TV association, said operators had blocked the BBC service as a result.The BBC condemned the decision, which is understood to have been applied to other foreign news broadcasters airing "anti-Pakistan" content as well."We are deeply concerned that BBC World News has been taken off air by the Cable Association of Pakistan," said a BBC spokesman."We condemn any action that threatens our editorial independence and prevents audiences from accessing our impartial international news service. We would urge that BBC World News and other international news services are reinstated as soon as possible."The service was suspended in parts of Pakistan today, with the broadcaster expected to be off-air across the whole country by tomorrow.The blocking of the BBC comes amid high tensions following Nato air strikes that accidentally killed 24 Pakistani soldiers on Saturday.
