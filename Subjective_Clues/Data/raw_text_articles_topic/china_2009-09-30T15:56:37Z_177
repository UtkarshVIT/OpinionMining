Monkey opened the Daily Telegraph today to see that its regular rota of advertisers – Sainsbury's, Selfridges, Specsavers – had been joined by new and unlikely company: the People's Republic of China. The reds took out a 16-page supplement in the Telegraph today, titled China in Focus, with a number of big-name bylines, including Gordon Brown, Peter Mandelson and China's premier, Wen Jiabao. The supplement was sponsored by the Chinese Embassy, in association with the Daily Telegraph. But it's business as usual on the Telegraph website, with the supplement sitting next to a news story that the public has been barred from the Beijing's celebratory parade. But we were rather taken by the top story on the Telegraph's China site yesterday afternoon: Dwarves found 'theme park' commune to escape bullying. Happy 60th birthday, PRC!
