"Very, very worrying" was the instant verdict of tax accountants on Tuesday, a sure sign that the court of appeal had struck a blow for common good. The judges ruled that multimillionaire Robert Gaines-Cooper could not be excused from a £30m UK tax bill on the basis that he spends rather a lot of time in the Seychelles. The British home of his second wife and the British schooling of his son clearly showed where both his heart and his home lies. By respecting this reality the court will send a cold shiver around the ordinarily warm yacht marinas of Monte Carlo, where "Monaco millionaires" find a safe harbour from their obligations to Blighty. Encouragingly, the Gaines-Cooper ruling is only one of the signs that a cash-strapped revenue is, as it were, getting closer to havens. The taxman's probes into wealthy individuals were this week revealed to have netted £373m in the last year, an astonishing 360% increase since 2004. Meanwhile the tax rises and cuts unveiled in the Isle of Man follow the UK's move to claw back £140m from Manx coffers. No one wishes the islanders ill, of course, but with no levy at all on turnover, gifts or capital gains they have for too long been bankrolled by tax competition, not a zero-sum but a negative-sum game, which starves the world's welfare states and leaves people of moderate means to pick up bills which should be paid by the rich. Whether you're a wealthy non-dom or a non-res in a des res, the times are a changin', and the hour is right for bringing it all back home.
