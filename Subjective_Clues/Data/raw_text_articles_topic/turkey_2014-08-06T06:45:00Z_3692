A Greek-language daily newspaper published in Istanbul since 1925 is to close because of financial problems and the gradual erosion of its audience base.The paper, Apoyevmatini, has helped to keep the Greek language alive among Greeks living in Turkey while informing the community of important news.At one period in its 89-year history, it sold as many as 30,000 copies a day. Recently, sales have been numbered in hundreds.The owner, Mihail Vasiliadis, said: "There are only 605 Greek families in Istanbul. I sell 600 copies daily and reach almost 99% of them. However, that is not enough."Apoyevmatini survived with a financial contribution from the Greek government and contributions from Istanbul's declining Greek community, which is now thought to be no more than 1,700. The paper also suffered badly from Greece's economic crisis Source: Daily Sabah via Chania Post
