Organisers have called off plans for a massive "supergig", which was to benefit the relief effort in Japan. Live Nation was reportedly "unable to secure artists" for the Wembley Arena concert in London, which was to be broadcast worldwide.Promoters had been working with major labels Sony and Universal to organise a gigantic fundraiser on 14 April, with plans to involve world-class artists. It was to be "a huge global spectacle" and "the biggest concert in years", according to sources. "No names have been confirmed yet but the organisers are expecting a massive response from acts of all eras."Unfortunately, those names failed to materialise. "[With just] days to go to the proposed Concert for Japan, sadly we are in a position where we have been unable to secure the artists required to produce the worldwide TV broadcast that we had hoped for and have therefore very reluctantly decided to proceed no further," a spokesperson for Live Nation told Music Week.Despite the cancellation of this mega-benefit, a smaller event was held at London's Brixton Academy on Sunday night, raising funds for the British Red Cross Japan Tsunami appeal. Headlined by Beady Eye, the gig also featured Graham Coxon, Paul Weller, Richard Ashcroft, and Primal Scream performing with guest bassist Glenn Matlock, from the Sex Pistols.
