The security van driver who became an internet hero after vanishing with €11.6m (£10.3m) from outside a bank in Lyon today gave himself up at a police station in Monaco.Tony Musulin, the 39-year-old whose disappearance on 5 November prompted a Europe-wide manhunt, was reportedly unshaven and acting strangely when he handed himself in to investigators.Police said they did not know why Musulin, a driver for security firm Loomis, had surrendered after 11 days at the top of France's most wanted list.He was handed over to French authorities at the Jardin Exotique, a park marking the border between Monaco and France. He was expected to be returned to Lyon late tonight.The non-violent heist, which turned its alleged mastermind into a hero, began when Musulin's colleagues left a branch of Banque de France to discover that their coworker had gone, apparently taking 49 sacks of banknotes with him.Police, staggered by the audacity of the heist, at first assumed the driver had been coerced into driving off. But they soon found indications that the disgruntled employee, who often spoke of his anger at the difference in earnings between him and his colleagues and their bosses, had planned the robbery carefully.His armoured vehicle was soon found parked in Lyon, but he was nowhere to be found. Two days later, when police recovered €9.11m of the stash in a lock-up garage under Musulin's name, the suspect's whereabouts were still unknown. When he turned himself in, police said, he did not have the remainder of the money on him.Over the past week Musulin has been feted as an underdog hero driven to carry out "the perfect crime" by the injustices of society. One company even started selling T-shirts emblazoned with his face.Last night Facebook pages set up in support of Musulin, including "The world is yours: Tony best driver 2009", were reeling from the apparent anticlimax. But most admirers remained loyal. "He's a great man," said one, Caroline Rimakan. "No need to worry, he'll get rich with all the books he'll bring out."
