Spain's attempts to reduce its national debt has suffered a blow after it was revealed that the multibillion-euro plan to sell off the state lottery company has been shelved because of adverse market conditions.The decision means that the €7bn (£6.07bn) windfall that Spain had hoped to reap from the sell-off of Loterías – the country's biggest privatisation – will now not appear. On the other hand, the €3bn a year that the company brings in with the famous Christmas lottery known as El Gordo, or The Fatty, and other draws or pools competitions will continue to go entirely to the Spanish exchequer.The float of 30% of the company was due to be led by UBS, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan Cazenove and Goldman Sachs after fierce jostling by banks in the City of London.But Elena Salgado, the finance minister, said that, for the moment, Spain would be better off holding on to what is a generous cash earner. "The lead managers said they were not sure that we could get the price that they and the government believe it is worth," she said.Major Spanish banks such as Santander and BBVA were also rumoured to have opposed the float, saying it would draw deposits away from them.Loterías reported a profit of just under €3bn in 2009 on sales of €9.8bn and controls 77% of Spain's lottery market.Spaniards bet some €2.15bn on El Gordo – the world's biggest lottery draw – with almost a third retained by the lottery administrator. El Gordo has been played every year since 1812.The decision came less than a week after the government gave final authorisation for the partial listing. Salgado said Loterías would be put on the market when conditions improved but she declined to give a date.The socialist government had been under pressure from the opposition conservative People's Party (PP) not to float the company.Esteban González Pons, a PP spokesman, saidthat his party, which is expected to win the 20 November elections, would not privatise the lottery company.
