Doctors treating a Palestinian lawyer who has been on hunger strike for 65 days in an Israeli prison say he suffered brain damage, prompting Israel’s supreme court to rule it was temporarily suspending his detention.  An MRI scan was ordered for Mohammed Allan after a lawyer for the Israeli state told a supreme court hearing that Allan would be released immediately if he had irreversible brain damage.Instead, the Israeli supreme court – after considering the new medical evidence – issued a stop-gap ruling on Wednesday night, temporarily suspending his detention without charge, and ruling he could apply again for release if and when his condition improves.

Justices Neal Hendel, Elyakim Rubinstein and Hanan Melcer ruled that if Allan’s brain damage proves to be irreversible, the administrative order for his detention will be completely revoked.In his judgment, Rubinstein wrote: “[Allan] does not pose a danger because of his medical condition, and so the administrative order is not active now.”The suspension means that Allan’s friends and family will be able to visit him in hospital as his status changes from prisoner to patient.The suspension comes at the end of a period of high drama surrounding the case. After Allan emerged from a medically induced coma on Tuesday, the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which has been championing his case, said he had warned he would step up his hunger strike by not drinking water if Israel did not resolve his case within 24 hours.On Wednesday morning, as his condition worsened again, the supreme court began meeting behind closed doors after an attempt to negotiate an end to a hunger strike Israeli authorities feared could lead to violence if Allan died.The Israeli government had earlier said it would consider releasing Allan if he was found to have irreversible brain damage. Speaking for the government, Yochi Gnessin announced: “If it turns out that the detainee is in an irreversible and permanent medical cognitive situation that will not enable him to resume his activities, the state will announce that the arrest warrant will become void immediately.”According to Israeli media sources, the release offer if he was found to be suffering cognitive damage is based on the logic that lasting brain damage would make the issue of any alleged threat posed by Allan in the past a moot point.Allan,33, went on hunger strike in an attempt to persuade Israel to either release or charge him. He is being held in administrative detention, a measure that allows Israeli authorities to hold suspects for months without charge.The MRI scan was conducted at Barzilai hospital in Ashkelon, where Allan is being treated after his lawyer reported that the hunger striker was unable to reply to questions during a meeting.“Allan’s condition is dangerous and there could be a rapid deterioration,” said Dr Hezi Levy, one of the physicians treating him, earlier on Tuesday.  The case of Allan – who Israel accuses of being a member of militant group Islamic Jihad – has become a cause célèbre, prompting clashes outside the hospital between Palestinian supporters of Allan and rightwing Israeli opponents . Allan has denied the claim of affiliation with the group.He was placed on administrative detention for six months in November 2014, a period that has since been extended. His health deteriorated sharply last week, triggering negotiations between Israeli state lawyers and his legal team about possible conditions for his release including exile to Gaza for four years, a condition he has rejected in the past, and the suggestion that his detention would not be renewed in November if he was found to be suffering serious health problems.
