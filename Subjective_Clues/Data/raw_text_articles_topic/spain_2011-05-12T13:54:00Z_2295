The death toll in Spain's worst earthquake for 50 years has risen to nine after another victim died of injuries sustained when twin shocks hit the town of Lorca.Dozens more are still being treated in hospital in the aftermath of the two quakes, which happened on Wednesday evening.Residents of the town, which has a population of 92,000, began clearing rubble, with the regional government of Murcia estimating that 80% of buildings had been damaged.Thousands of people spent Wednesday night in squares, parks and nearby countryside in fear of further tremors, and questions are being asked about how such apparently minor shocks could cause such havoc.Residents slept in tents and cardboard boxes, while hundreds more bedded down on the ground with nothing more than their clothes and blankets.Authorities put the number of injured at 120 and said two people were still in a serious condition. Two pregnant women and a child were among those who died in the quakes, which had magnitudes of 4.4 and 5.2."They won't let us get our car out of the car park or go back into our house," Joaquín Román, who spent the night in a park with his family, told El Pais newspaper."It was awful. I was walking down the street when suddenly masonry started falling off the buildings and people fell on to the ground like puppets."They were the longest and most terrifying 10 seconds of my life," supermarket worker Ana Espadas said, explaining that she and her companions fled their workplace after the second, larger quake hit.One witness, who gave his name as Cecilio, came across a boy who had been killed by masonry while walking the family dog. "The mother was calling out 'help me, help me', but there was nothing we could do for him," he said.The town's mayor, Francisco Jódar, who vowed to get people under cover for Thursday night and declared three days of mourning.He warned: "Today will be even longer than yesterday. Lorca looks like Beirut, with everything on the ground and huge cracks in the walls."Rescue teams, military personnel and bulldozers moved into the town on Thursday morning to clear away rubble, which included one three-storey building that had collapsed across a street.At least two of the dead were killed by falling masonry which crashed to the ground from an apartment building in one of the Lorca's poorer neighbourhoods.Some of those who began returning to their homes on Thursday morning reported serious damage, raising concerns about the quality of building work in an area known for normally low-level earthquakes.Engineers, architects and surveyors have begun the task of checking buildings for structural damage.Roger Musson, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey, said the town had been unlucky because the quake had happened two miles underground."It's only really caused such damage because it was so shallow and the epicentre was so close to the town of Lorca," he said. "A magnitude 5.2 is not that big – it's not considered a large quake."Earthquakes normally strike at a depth of between six and 12 miles, meaning the shocks are more dispersed."On average there are probably about 1,000 magnitude 5 earthquakes every year, which is around three per day," he said."They mostly happen in the sea, or in remote places. It's only when you get one in a place like this where you get significant damage. It's certainly unlucky for the people of Lorca to get one so close and shallow."This was the deadliest quake in Spain since 1956, when 12 people died and 70 were injured in the southern Granada region.
