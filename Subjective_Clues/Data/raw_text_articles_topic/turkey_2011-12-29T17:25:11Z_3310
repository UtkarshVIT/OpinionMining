A Turkish court has ruled that a man accused of murdering two Northern Ireland women must take a bone marrow test to determine his age.Recep Cetin is suspected of killing Marion Graham and Kathy Dinsmore in Turkey during the summer. Cetin claims he is 17 and should be tried in a youth court.But the families of the victims and their MPs for South Down and Newry and Armagh insist the suspect is older and should be tried in an adult court.If it is established that Cetin is over 18 he would face a much tougher sentence if convicted.Cetin was the boyfriend of Shannon Graham, Marion Graham's 15-year-old daughter. Shannon Graham gave evidence during the hearing in the Turkish city of Izmir.The victims' families allege Cetin stabbed Marion Graham and her friend after becoming enraged over their attempts to stop him seeing Shannon. The two women were stabbed to death in a forest near Izmir in August.
