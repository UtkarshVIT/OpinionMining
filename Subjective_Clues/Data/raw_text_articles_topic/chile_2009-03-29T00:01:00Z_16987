Why did you choose Saturday Night Fever as the subject of Peralta's obsession?Saturday Night Fever was a huge success in Santiago, so it was a cultural reference point. Tony Manero achieves the American dream through dancing, and Raúl Peralta thinks that is a possibility for him. The problems begin when he tries to transport that dream into his own reality. Is the film intended to be a comment on the Americanisation of Chile?The film is a portrait of a particular character in a unique situation, but, yes, Peralta's behaviour is also intended to be a metaphor for Chile under Pinochet: Peralta wants to be as similar as possible to some foreign icon just as Chile under Pinochet was trying to be like America. Peralta's impunity also replicates the impunity of the government back then. How have audiences responded to the film?In Chile audiences were very polarised: people loved it or hated it. But in Japan they thought it was a comedy and laughed the entire time. What does John Travolta think about the film?He wrote a letter to us saying he was very glad that we'd been having so much success with it. He was supposed to come and see it at a screening in LA but then this tragedy with his son happened so he didn't attend. • Tony Manero (18) opens on 10 April
