Standard Chartered has lost more than 2% - making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 - following reports a key 18% stake could be up for grabs.Singapore investor Temasek is, according to the Financial Times, considering selling its shareholding which is worth around £6bn. Temasek reportedly wishes to cut its exposure to financial services given the economic uncertainty, and at the same time has given up the idea of merging the bank with another of its investments, Singapore's DBK bank, given the current attitude to bid banking mergers.Apparently there are no discussions currently underway, so any sale process could take a while. Even so, the thought of an 18% stake overhanging the market was enough to send Standard Chartered 34.5p lower to £14.46.Of course, any sale of such a major shareholding is also likely to ignite bid speculation. Simon Willis at Daniel Stewart said:The bank has achieved record profits in recent years, but was hit by US regulators over dealings with Iran. On Friday it said it had finalised a settlement including a payment of $340m.Overall leading shares are edging higher after recent eurozone inspired falls, with the FTSE 100 6.46 points better at 5845.30.
