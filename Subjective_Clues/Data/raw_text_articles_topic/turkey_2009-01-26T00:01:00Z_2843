Avalanches killed 15 people at the weekend, including 10 mountaineers in an isolated region of north-east Turkey and five in the Alps.Two other climbers were found alive on the 2,200m (7,200ft) Zigana mountain range in Gümüçhane province, near the Black Sea, after being dug out of the snow by search and rescue teams.TV footage showed one man being pulled from the snow in pain while rescuers carried stretchers and what appeared to be bodybags down the mountainside.The climbers were among a 17-strong party from neighbouring Trabzon province who were visiting the area for a winter festival. Some claimed to have heard gunshots moments before the avalanche."We were walking and before we realised what was going on, the avalanche came on us," a survivor, Ural Ayar, told Turkish television station, NTV."The snow dragged our friends along and unfortunately they were buried."A series of avalanches in the Alps earlier in the weekend killed five people, including three youths who were skiing outside authorised slopes. It was a weekend of severe storms across Spain and France which saw gusts of up to 100mph in some places causing at least 16 deaths, officials said. More than 1m homes were still without electricity in south-west France yesterday as Nicolas Sarkozy, the president, visited emergency response teams near Bordeaux.Those killed in the storms that swept south-west France included motorists hit by falling trees and a 73-year-old woman who died when a power cut stopped her ventilator machine. Twelve people died in storms in Spain including four children.
