Early returns in a referendum on constitutional amendments suggest strong support for changes that the government says are a key step in Turkey's path to full democracy.Turkish broadcaster NTV television reports that with 75% of today's vote counted, results indicate 60% of those ballots cast favour the amendments.So far about 40% of voters have rejected the proposals, heeding opposition claims that the reforms would shackle the independence of the courts.If the trend holds it will be a huge boost for Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ahead of a general election in 2011.Earlier opinion polls had suggested up to 56% of Turks could approve the changes, or that it might be too close to call.
