This Friday, 30 November, is St Andrew's Day, feast day of the patron saint of Scotland – and the perfect excuse to dedicate this week's RR to all things Scottish.Post your suggestions for the best songs about Scotland below and we'll assemble the ones we like best in a playlist next week.If you want your nominations to be considered for the playlist, then post them before midday on Monday.Each week, the playlist will be compiled by a different volunteer from the Readers Recommend community. To increase the likelihood of your nomination being considered:– Provide reasons why it's a worthy contender.– Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song's words.– Provide a link to the song. We prefer YouTube, but Spotify, SoundCloud and Grooveshark are fine too.• Listen to others' suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist.Reading this on mobile?

If you can think of a good theme for Readers Recommend, or if you'd like to volunteer to compile a playlist, please email adam.boult@guardian.co.uk.• There's a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are "zedded", at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of "zedded", "donds" and other strange words used by RR regulars.• Many RR regulars also congregate at the 'Spill blog.
