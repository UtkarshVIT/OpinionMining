Schools across Poland observed a minute's silence this morning, two days after the air crash that claimed the life of the country's president and a swath of the political and military elite.In Warsaw, work was interrupted to allow groups to be taken to the presidential palace to lay candles and flowers and to sign condolence books.President Lech Kaczynski's coffin was brought to the palace yesterday after a slow, six-mile procession witnessed by hundreds of thousands of people. Preparations are under way for his lying in state, and the public is expected to be able to pay their respects from tomorrow.Parliament is set to gather to discuss proposals for a new head of the national bank, after the death in Saturday's crash of 47-year old Slawomir Skrzypek, who had been in the post for three years. Activity on Warsaw's stock exchange was said to be normal, and the national currency was solid despite fears the catastrophe might destabilise the country's economy.In addition to putting the pieces of government together, representatives of the president and prime minister were due to meet to discuss details of funerals for the 96 people who died.Kaczynski's body was returned to Warsaw yesterday, but those of his wife and other victims remain in Moscow, many still awaiting identification. A mass funeral is planned for Saturday in Warsaw's Pilsudski square, as Russian authorities have indicated that all of the bodies can be returned to Warsaw by Thursday.Poland's ambassador to Paris, Tomasz Orlowski, has been recalled to the capital to head the funeral arrangements after the death in Smolensk of Mariusz Kazana, chief of protocol at the ministry of foreign affairs, who would have been responsible for the plans.Fourteen of the bodies were identifiable on sight in Russia, but the rest were said by Russian experts to have been too badly charred in the accident. Families of the victims flew to Moscow last night accompanied by psychologists to help in the identification process, much of which will be carried out through DNA testing.Accident investigators continue to investigate the cause of the crash. Pavel Plusnin, a Russian air traffic controller who was the last person to talk to the crew of the president's Tupolew 154 before it crashed in dense fog into a grove of trees, told a Moscow news portal that he had had difficulties understanding the crew, who he claimed had spoken poor Russian. "Numbers were hard for them, so I could not determine their altitude," he said.Polish newspapers yesterday were replete with full-page black and white death notices, with lists of names and titles. As details of the victims came to light, it emerged today that the ill-fated plane's crew, headed by the pilot Arkadiusz Protasiuk, a 36-year old father-of-two, as well as the co-pilot, navigator and technician, had recently been on a humanitarian mission to Haiti, for which they had received distinctions from their air force commander.The accident claimed the lives of many of the president's entourage, his personal chaplain, the top brass of the military, the deputy foreign minister, a former president, the head of the Olympic committee, historians and conservationists. Newspaper headlines summed up the national mood, with the tabloid Fakt asking: "What now for Poland?"
