The Greenpeace protest ship Arctic Sunrise has been taken into custody by the Spanish government in waters off the Canary Islands, just months after it was released by the Russian government. Spain’s Ministry of public works and transportation detained the vessel on Tuesday night pending an investigation against the captain for an “infringement against marine traffic rules”. The maximum fine for the offence is €300,000 (£240,000).On Saturday, Greenpeace protesters from the ship approached the Repsol oil ship Rowan Renaissance – ignoring warnings from the Spanish navy to leave an exclusion zone. Activists were injured after their rhibs – an inflatable boat with a rigid hull – were repeatedly rammed by the Spanish navy. Footage of the clashes showed the moment when one activist had her leg broken and was thrown into the water.Spain’s defence minister Pedro Morenés told Spanish media that the navy was fulfilling its duty under international maritime conventions to “put a stop” to the committing of “allegedly criminal facts” through a “proportionate use of force”.Greenpeace said the Spanish detention of the ship was “an unnecessary and disproportionate response”.Mario Rodriguez, director of Greenpeace Spain, said: “The detention of the Arctic Sunrise violates the rights of all people who strive to defend the environment. It’s telling that the Spanish government would so quickly support the interests of an oil company, Repsol, against a peaceful environmental organisation which stands alongside millions of people who oppose reckless oil exploration.”Just over a week ago, 200,000 Canarians protested against oil company Repsol’s plans to drill for oil off the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. Environmentalists and a community reliant on tourism fear an oil spill that could destroy the marine ecosystem.It is just six months since the Arctic Sunrise was released by Russian authorities following a nine month detention for attempting to board a Gazprom oil rig in the actions against oil drilling in the Arctic. Unlike Russia, the Spanish authorities have not arrested the captain or crew. Spain has set a bond of €50,000 before it will release the vessel.
