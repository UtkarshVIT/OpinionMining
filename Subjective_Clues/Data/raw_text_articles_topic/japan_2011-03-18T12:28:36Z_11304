Just a few hours ago, I ran across this video from my friends at the University of Nottingham (I wish I'd run across it a week ago so I could've shared it with you then!). In this video, our favorite chemistry professor delivers a beautiful and coherent description of what happens in nuclear reactors; where the energy comes from, how the initial reaction rate is modulated/controlled with boron rods, how fresh water is used to cool the core and to generate electricity, why sea water permanently damages a reactor, and why taking iodine pills can help circumvent radiation sickness in people who are exposed to some -- but not all -- forms of radiation [read more about this].
