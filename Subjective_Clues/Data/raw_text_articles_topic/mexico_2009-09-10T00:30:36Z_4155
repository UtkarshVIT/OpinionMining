The man who hijacked a passenger plane in Mexico yesterday claimed to be on a divine mission, officials said, after the plane's crew and 104 passengers were freed unhurt. The Aeromexico flight was seized when it landed after a flight from the resort city of Cancún. The hijacker, José Mar Flores, 44, reportedly told police that yesterday's date, 9/9/09, is the number 666 turned upside down. Flores used a fake bomb to hijack the plane, then ordered the pilot to circle Mexico City seven times. He said he wanted to warn Mexico's president, Felipe Calderòn, of an impending earthquake.
