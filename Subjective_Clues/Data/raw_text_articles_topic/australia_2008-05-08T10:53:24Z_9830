Tourism Australia has parted company with M&C Saatchi, the ad agency that created the controversial "Where the bloody hell are you?" campaign.The Australian tourism body has instead shortlisted rival agencies Saatchi & Saatchi - the agency founded by the Saatchi brothers before they quit to set up M&C Saatchi, but now owned by Publicis - and DDB Worldwide to pitch for its A$65m (£30.1m)-a-year global advertising account.M&C Saatchi, which gave up the New Zealand tourist board account three years ago to handle Tourism Australia, was one of five agencies to be dropped from the pitch process.WPP-owned Ogilvy and Mather, Publicis Mojo and Whybin TBWA were also cut, while Clemenger BBDO had already pulled out of the pitch process."We thank all the agencies that have been working with us through this process for their commitment, time and interest in working with Tourism Australia," said the body's managing director, Geoff Buckley. "We recognise the significant investment they have made in tendering for our business and we are very grateful for it."Tourism Australia infamously ruffled British sensibilities in 2006 with M&C Saatchi's controversial "Where the bloody hell are you?" TV ad campaign.The UK advertising regulator received a string of complaints about the ad, which led Australian tourism minister Fran Bailey to accuse the British of lacking a sense of humour. The row resulted in acres of free media coverage."We thank in particular M&C Saatchi, Tourism Australia's current creative agency, which has provided three years of excellent service to us," Buckley added. "We recognise their contribution, both creatively and as strategic partners, in taking the international marketing of Australia into a new and exciting era."Buckley said the long list of agencies - with the exception of Clemenger BBDO which withdrew from the process - had met last week with Tourism Australia's selection panel, including a sub-committee of its governing board. He added that the decision of the panel and sub-committee was unanimous. Following the final pitches and presentations the board of Tourism Australia will make a recommendation about its preferred agency to the Australian minister for tourism, Martin Ferguson.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
