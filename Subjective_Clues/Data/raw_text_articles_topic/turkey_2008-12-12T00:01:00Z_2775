Eid feast is devoured in a flash, so Hounslow Man moves on to bigger things. "Are we celebrating Christmas?" he asks. I tell him I'm not sure. "I didn't celebrate it as a child," I say. "I thought Allah would let loose all hell and damnation upon me if I so much as said the word Christmas. But I wanted it — carols, trees, presents. I so wanted to be Christian."Hounslow Man says that there are varying degrees of celebration in his family, which is first-generation British Pakistani. "My sister doesn't do Christmas because she likes to remain true to her Islamic roots, but she does cook a mean chicken kofta Christmas dinner. My brother's family celebrates it all; Diwali, Eid and Christmas. He sees it as a way of communing with his neighbours in this multicultural metropolis. As for me, I'm up for it."I think back to my first Christmas in London six years ago. A month in advance, friends started asking where I would be for the occasion. With family? No, they were in South Africa. Friends? I didn't want to impose. Did I have somewhere else to go? Naively, I didn't.The week before Christmas, London's migrant population flew off to their home countries and everyone else headed to their family hearths. The city was deserted. It was my loneliest December ever. Lesson learned — I made sure I had a home for Christmas after that."I think your maverick brother is on to something," I say to Hounslow Man, warming to the idea of celebrating everything. "Over the past few years, I've come to associate Christmas with a Britain that's given me a place to call sweet home. And as I'm applying for British nationality this year, it seems right."Hounslow Man looks as if Christmas has come early. "Are we talking a tree? Presents? A turkey with gravy?""If I'm doing Britain , I'm doing it all," I reply . "So that's yes to a tree with decorations. And yes to small presents. As for that turkey we'll just have to find a halal bird."
