North Korea today dismissed reports about the ill health of Kim Jong-il as a "conspiracy plot" amid fresh claims from South Korea that the supreme leader is recovering from surgery.Kim's absence yesterday from celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of North Korea fuelled speculation about his health.Senior officials took the rare step of granting interviews to a foreign news outlet in an attempt to end weeks of rumours.North Korea's second-in-command, Kim Yong-nam, said there was "no problem" with the leader, while Song Il-ho, a senior North Korean diplomat, told Japan's Kyodo news agency that rumours of ill-health were "not true". "We see such reports as not only worthless, but rather as a conspiracy plot," he said.South Korea's intelligence agency today reported to a parliamentary committee that it had obtained reports showing Kim had recently undergone surgery for a circulatory problem and that his condition had greatly improved.South Korea's Yonhap news agency, citing committee members briefed by the agency, reported that the 66-year-old Kim suffered a cerebral haemorrhage but remained conscious and "is able to control the situation".The committee was told that Kim was in a "recoverable and manageable condition" and that the north was not in a "power vacuum," Yonhap said.Analysts have said Kim - who has not been seen in public since mid-August - can drop out of sight for months, but it is unusual for him to miss major events such as yesterday's anniversary.His condition is of particular concern internationally given that there is no clear line of succession and Pyongyang recently resumed its nuclear programme, blaming the United States for leaving it on a terrorism blacklist despite an agreement of better relations in exchange for disarmament.The deal was hammered out with the US, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, but Washington said North Korea would have to agree to an inspection system before it could be removed from the list.Analysts fear that the military, known to be hostile to denuclearisation, might gain the upper hand in the event of Kim's death.There are concerns about the stability of the desperately impoverished state, which faces a food crisis.The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, convened an emergency meeting in Seoul today to discuss the situation with senior aides, an official said.Kim inherited his position from his father, Kim Il-sung, the country's founder, making it the world's first communist dynasty. He was groomed for the leadership long before his father's death in 1994.He does not appear to have anointed any of his three sons as successor. The oldest is believed to have fallen from favour after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport in 2001. He said he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.
