Cardiff council's leader Rodney Berman will today attend a conference in Japan to find inspiration on how to tackle health deprivation in Cardiff.Berman was invited to join the global forum on urbanisation and health, being held in Kobe, by the World Health Organisation (WHO) – who have funded the trip.With the authority achieving healthy city status in 2009, Cardiff council said the aim was to find new ways to tackle health deprivation in Cardiff as well as other 'urban health challenges'. Cardiff council said the city has an estimated 60,000 people living in deprivation, with a 11.6 year gap in life expectancy between different geographical areas of Cardiff.Joining Berman on the two-day conference is the council's new chief executive Jon House – his trip is being funded by Cardiff council. Berman said:"This conference will be enable us to gain ideas from across the world on how health and life chances can be improved. Like all cities, Cardiff has problems which the council is keen to address. The forum is going to be an excellent opportunity for myself and the chief executive to hear different views, share information and most importantly bring back to Cardiff real life experiences on how issues of deprivation and inequality can be tackled."We will also use the opportunity of attending this forum to raise the profile of Cardiff across the international stage of the World Health Organization."House said: "I have made it clear that, working with the Leader, my aim is to make Cardiff the best European city council by 2015. Reducing health inequities in the city is a massive challenge and it should not be the case that good health and opportunity is enhanced by where somebody lives."This forum will give myself and the Leader the opportunity to hear how other cities are setting policies to try and improve health equity in urban settings and I want to learn how cities can be modified, enhanced and transformed to create healthier environments."
