At least one Briton was injured in the Israeli assault on the Gaza flotilla and has been hospitalised, according to the British embassy in Tel Aviv.The man is not in a serious condition but is understood to have bruising and injuries requiring suturing. The embassy, which has been allowed access to the activist, said it could not release any further identifying information.Embassy spokeswoman Karen Kaufman said she believed the Briton had been on board the Mavi Marmara, the Turkish passenger ship on which at least 10 activists were killed in a offshore battle with Israeli commandos yesterday.The embassy had no confirmation of the total number of Britons aboard the flotilla, although the number has been reported as 28.A consular official was en route to Be'er Sheva, a city in the Negev desert, where the embassy believed a number of Britons were being held."We're not sure where all of them are, although we believe several are in Be'er Sheva," Kaufman told the Guardian. "As soon as they identify themselves as British nationals, the Israeli foreign ministry is informing the embassy."She suggested that some detained activists may not be co-operating with the Israeli authorities, thus not revealing their nationality.The embassy had no information about whether any Britons had been summarily deported."We are impressing on the Israelis that we need urgent and immediate access to our nationals," said Kaufman. "Our first duty is to ensure that they are being treated and held in proper conditions."It is thought that almost 500 activists are being held in Ela rison in Be'er Sheva and up to 50 have already been deported. The former US diplomat, Edward Peck, who was aboard one of the flotilla's ships, was last night put on a plane back to the US, according to the Free Gaza Movement.The Foreign Office in London was receiving numerous inquiries from anxious relatives in the UK, she added.
