Ferran Adrià, the Catalan chef celebrated for creating such dishes as turtle dove with blackberry caviar and duck foie gras candies, has decided to permanently close his famously experimental El Bulli restaurant in Spain.Adrià will replace the restaurant, which in its deconstruction of traditional dishes creates as much bewilderment among diners as pleasure, with an academy for advanced culinary study, according to the New York Times.He decided to permanently shut El Bulli, which has won three Michelin stars and was last year named the world's best restaurant for the fourth year by Restaurant magazine in Britain, because he and his partner, Juli Soler, had been losing €500,000 (£433,728) a year on the restaurant and his cooking workshop in Barcelona, the paper's food blog reported.He said he would use his earnings from consultancies and other businesses to establish his new culinary academy and to fund scholarships.The restaurant will reopen for six months in June and close for good in December 2011.Adrià told an international culinary conference last month that the restaurant would temporarily shut its doors in 2012 and 2013. He said then that the closure was due to the difficulties of working 15 hours a day.Tables for the six-month season at El Bulli sell out in a day and two million people – including the world's great and good – have competed for a mere 8,000 settings in the past few years.
