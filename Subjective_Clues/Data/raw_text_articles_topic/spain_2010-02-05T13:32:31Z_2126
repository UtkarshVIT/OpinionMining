Spain, which holds the European Union presidency, does not plan to follow Barack Obama's lead on pushing for a radical overhaul of banking guidelines.Proposals to limit proprietary trading – where banks invest their own funds, instead of on behalf of clients – or limit banks' activities in hedge or private equity funds cannot be put on the EU agenda "just because there was some news last week," Spain's economy secretary, José Manuel Campa, told theguardian.com.The country, which does not have a big hedge fund community and whose banks have not made forays into proprietary trading, plans to follow European guidelines focusing on supervision as the main way to restore balance in the financial system, Campa said."We need to reassure that the main goal of the financial system has to be to channel credit towards the productive economy," he added.Although an agreement could be reached on financial supervision, each EU country sets its own fiscal policy, making it difficult for member countries to agree an overall tax policy on banks or bankers. Britain has already implemented plans to tax bonuses and increase taxes for high earners, a policy that France is also considering.Spanish banks, however, are more focused on commercial than investment banking, and the Bank of Spain already imposes stringent controls on their activities.
