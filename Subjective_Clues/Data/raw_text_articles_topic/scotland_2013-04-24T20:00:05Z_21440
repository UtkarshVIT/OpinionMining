Even if Scotland votes for independence and manages to keep the pound (No currency union with independent Scotland, says Osborne, 24 April), there's another problem facing its choice of currency. There is a risk that the rest of the UK will decide to leave the EU, leaving Scotland using a currency controlled by a non-EU state. It's hard to believe that this will be a practical proposition, and harder still to believe that the EU will stand for it. English and Scottish politicians haven't mentioned this issue so far. They may be trying to consider the Scottish and EU referendums as separate matters. But don't worry, I'm sure the European Central Bank is considering it.John DallmanCambridge• Scotland is a bumpy country and thrives on bumpy rides. The currency issues are not a doddle. But there is substantial evidence pointing to the resilience of Scotland's economy. The real issue is democracy and the traction which the Scottish people have with what happens in their everyday lives. So far, even with the restricted powers available, Alex Salmond and his ministers have secured better services all round. Greater autonomy will enable fresh creativity even within outmoded international currency systems.Ann JamiesonCaldecote, Cambridgeshire• Philip Inman (Analysis, 24 April) suggests calling an independent Scottish currency a Scotdollar. If the Irish had the punt, we should have the poond!John and Karen StoneleyFoulden, Scottish Borders• If the Scots cannot use sterling as their currency, they could presumably base their gold standard on the McNugget.Peter RussellTunbridge Wells, Kent• Can someone remind me how many mickles make a muckle?Alan CleaverWhitehaven, Cumbria
