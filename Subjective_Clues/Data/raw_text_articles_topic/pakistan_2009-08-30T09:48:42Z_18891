At least 14 police recruits were killed by a suicide bomber in Pakistan's Swat valley today – the deadliest attack since the army regained control of the area from the Taliban.The blast, which happened in the yard of the main police station in Mingora, the major town in the north-west valley, came a day after the army said it had destroyed a nearby training camp for suicide bombers.Members of a new community police force set up to patrol the region were being trained when the attacker detonated his explosives, the provincial information minister, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, told the Geo TV channel.Footage showed officers removing bodies from outside the police station, which has been bombed twice in recent months.The bodies of at least 14 police volunteers were brought to a local hospital.Eight recruits injured in the explosion were receiving treatment, Ikram Khan, a hospital official, told the Associated Press.Idrees Khan, the local police chief, said at least 20 people had been wounded.He denied reports that the attacker was in uniform and could have been one of the police volunteers."No, we don't have any such report – but yes, a suicide bomber sneaked into the training for recruits," he said.He blamed the attack on the decision to relax a daily curfew in the area for the holy month of Ramadan, saying security would be stepped up.The Pakistani prime minister, Yusuf Raza Gilani, said: "We will not allow the enemies of the country to succeed in their evil designs."Police blocked roads around the area soon after the blast, ordering nearby residents to stay inside.Pakistani army officials said forces were restoring security in Swat and the surrounding areas after a three-month military offensive took the valley back from Taliban control, but suicide attacks and fighting have continued.Five soldiers were killed in a suicide attack at a security checkpoint in the Swat valley on 15 August.Last month, the military declared Mingora and the surrounding areas to have been cleared of militants, except for small pockets of resistance.
