Police have raided Sony Music's offices in Mexico City, seizing albums, master recordings and cover art for one of Latin music's biggest stars.Mexico's public ministry and federal police were acting on a court order concerning ranchera singer Alejandro Fernández. A two-time Latin Grammy winner, Fernández was signed to Sony Music from 1998 to 2008 but left last year for Universal. Sony has gone ahead with plans to release an album of unreleased material, called Diferente, which Fernández alleges they have no right to do."Sony assumed that they could take tracks that weren't part of previous albums and release them as an eighth album, as if it were new material, over which they had rights," Jose Luis Caballero, Fernández's attorney, told Billboard. "It's perfectly clear that the company's contract is limited to seven albums."Caballero said that they had issued a cease and desist letter two weeks ago and after this was ignored, sought a search and seizure order. Police reportedly seized 6,397 Fernández CDs, masters of unreleased music, and art for Diferente.Sony Music issued a statement saying it was "surprised and disappointed" by the raid, calling the recordings "totally authorised". "We trust that the Mexican courts will confirm our rights as soon as possible," a spokesperson said.Fernández has sold more than 15m records worldwide.
