At least 17 people have been killed after a suicide bomber blew himself up in a car in north-west Pakistan.Officials said the attack in the market of Darra Adam Khel, in the tribal Khyber region, appeared to target at pro-government militia.Regional government administrator Fakhruddin Khan said 17 people had been killed and at least 40 wounded. . Several of the wounded were in a critical condition.The bomb was detonated outside the offices of tribal elders. No group immediately claimed responsibility, but Pakistani Taliban militants have staged previous attacks against local elders, who have formed peace committees to evict militants and helped authorities in operations against insurgents.It was unclear how many people were in the offices. Police official Naeem Khan said passers-by as well as local elders were among the victims. At least 35 shops and eight vehicles were destroyed.Some of the wounded were reportedly being taken to hospitals in other towns, including Peshawar, a 30-minute drive away, because local facilities could not cope.With the backing of the US, the Pakistani government has fought to bring the tribal region under control, but has so far failed to break the network of militants. One of the strategies against the militia was the revival of traditional militias of tribesmen, who are now the focus of attack.
