Aleph Fourth way (Official) from Gero Doll on Vimeo.Aleph is a Siberian producer who first came to our attention following his work for the British Columbian net label King Deluxe. His real name is Ivan Erofeev. Raised in a small, snowbound Russian village, he has since moved to the city of Omsk and then St. Petersburg. From the outset, his Canadian colleagues have voiced Erofeev's enduring conviction that Omsk, despite its bright lights and better jobs, is always an excessively "cold, gray" place to live. As a result, he entertains fantasies of escaping back to the snow and trees. Erofeev, put simply, wants to get out of the city "and dreams of living [once more] in the Siberian wilderness."Aleph has announced a fresh EP this month, called Fourth Way. The title is a reference to Petr Uspenskii's study of various faiths, conducted between 1921 and 1946 in search of an alternative belief system, something akin to a global synthesis of all existing models. That elusive object of desire would remain both far and the focus of much attention. Life in Omsk inspires a related social yearning â€“ almost 1,400 miles from the Russian capital.The video for Fourth Way was produced by Gero Doll. There's more to read about the EP here.
