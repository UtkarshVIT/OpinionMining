Britain faces a severe brain drain as young scientists leave for positions in countries where research is better funded, one of the most senior scientists in the US warns.Swingeing cuts in university and research budgets will force the most talented British scientists to find jobs in the US, Singapore and other countries that are continuing to invest in science throughout the global recession, said Ralph Cicerone, president of the US National Academy of Sciences at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Diego yesterday.In December the UK government announced cuts worth £600m in university and research budgets, but whichever party wins the general election in May, deeper cuts are expected to follow.News of the cuts announced last year was met with dismay from scientists, particularly in the face of repeated reassurances from Gordon Brown that the science budget was "ring-fenced" and of critical importance to the UK as it emerges from the global downturn."You might not see anything immediately, but you will begin to see a movement of scientists over time. They will go to where the opportunities are, to the US and to places like Singapore that have invested heavily in science, and are hiring from all over the world," said Cicerone.Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, revealed in his pre-Budget report in December that there will be a substantial reduction in the higher education, science and research budgets between 2011 and 2013.The Conservative science spokesman, Adam Afriyie, has said major science budget cuts are "inevitable" regardless of which party wins the forthcoming election.The cuts have raised concerns among the Russel Group of large research-intensive universities that they will no longer be able to compete with other top-ranking universities around the world. They also come as leading academic centres in the US are being supported by stimulus funds, some of which are being used specifically to attract foreign students and qualified scientists.Professor Cicerone's comments were backed by Peter Agre, winner of the 2003 Nobel prize for chemistry and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science."The politicians that are going to be cutting funding and discouraging young scientists can thank themselves for damaging a generation of science, not just science next year. And that isn't a political statement, that's the reality," Professor Agre said."When we have booms in scientific funding, young people devote their careers to this, and then we have busts and they can't afford to pay the rent and they are forced to quit. And when they quit, they're extinct – they quit forever," he added."The nations that fund science are investing in the future, but those that cut funding are hoping for the best."Professor Agre said Singapore, which has no natural resources , is thriving as a science-based economy and is likely to pull further ahead in economic hard times.
