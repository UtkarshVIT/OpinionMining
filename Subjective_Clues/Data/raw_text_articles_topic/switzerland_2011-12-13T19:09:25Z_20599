Switzerland has charged three members of the same family for their role in the Abdul Qadeer Khan nuclear smuggling network after a plea deal which will mean that their claims of collaboration with the CIA will not be examined in court.The guilty plea by Friedrich Tinner and his two sons, Urs and Marco, brings to an end a seven-year investigation clouded by intrigue, which in 2007 involved the Swiss defence ministry – allegedly under heavy US pressure – destroying vital evidence in the case, and blocking the prosecution of the Tinners and the CIA for espionage.On Tuesday, the Swiss attorney general announced that the Tinners had been charged under the country's war material act with "aiding the illegal nuclear weapons programme of an unknown state".A statement from the attorney general's office said: "From the outset, the ... enquiries indicated that the accused had links with the network of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the 'father of the Pakistani atom bomb', who supplied Libya with nuclear weapons technology."Khan confessed in 2004 to running a network selling nuclear equipment and know how, after one of his shipments was intercepted on the way to Libya. Khan and his associates are also believed to have supplied Iran and North Korea with uranium centrifuges, as well as the blueprint for a nuclear warhead which the Tehran government said it received unsolicited from the network.President Pervez Musharraf pardoned Khan but kept him under house arrest, refusing to allow the US or the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to question him. He was freed by court order in 2009, and has since recanted his confession, saying the Pakistani state had been fully aware of his activities.Questions remain over how much more weapons information the network sold, and to how many customers. Experts said that those questions will remain unanswered as a result of the Tinners' plea deal.The attorney-general's statement said: "As a result of the admissions made by the suspects, no evidence will be heard in the main proceedings." It added: "In addition, the court will be requested to accept a plea bargain between the parties covering sentences, the allocation of costs, the forfeiture of assets and other matters."Observers predicted that the Tinners would escape jail time as they had already served several years in pre-trial detention. Their repeated appeals to be freed were turned down on the grounds that their suspected association with the CIA meant they were a flight risk.In their official statement, the prosecutors said they had been unable to "clarify satisfactorily whether the accused after a certain point in time assisted foreign services in uncovering the Libyan nuclear weapons programme", pointing out that this was because the Swiss government had refused to authorise espionage charges "which are of a political nature".The claim that the Tinners' relationship with the CIA was unclear was met by scepticism by proliferation experts who pointed out that Urs Tinner himself had claimed to have tipped off the US on the delivery of centrifuge parts to Libya.David Albright, the author of a book on the AQ Khan network, titled Peddling Peril, said there were also surviving copies of emails between Urs Tinner and the CIA which the Swiss government had failed to destroy, and records of shipments of centrifuge parts by the Tinners to a non existent front company in Chicago. "This deal has been done to keep the CIA link out of court," Albright said.On the question of the missing evidence, the prosecutors' statement noted: "On 14 November 2007, the Swiss government decided that material seized in the course of the criminal proceedings should be destroyed. The federal examining magistrate was able to obtain copies of some of the files destroyed, but others were permanently lost."The decision four years ago to destroy computer evidence related to the Tinners case caused outrage in Switzerland and beyond. Dick Marty, a Swiss senator questioned the claim by the defence and justice ministries at the time it had been done in the national interest."It's easy to say you are acting in the nation's best interests when nobody can check," Senator Marty said.Albright said: "It was a huge mistake by the CIA and senior members of the Bush administration to interfere in the Swiss justice system like that, and try to use their co-operation with the Tinners as a get out of jail free card.""This is a very good result," Albright continued. "The Swiss justice system needed to do something to set a good precedent for the future. After 20 years of crime, you can't just buddy up with a foreign intelligence service and get off."
