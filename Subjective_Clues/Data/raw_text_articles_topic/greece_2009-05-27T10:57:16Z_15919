Two women accused of attempting to open the door of a holiday jet at 30,000 feet have been interviewed by detectives nine months after the alleged incident, police said today.Leanne Connor, 26, and Lynette York, 27, were detained in Germany last August after their flight from the Greek island of Kos to Manchester was diverted.German police accused them of being drunk and disorderly and alleged they were abusive to airline staff as they tried to open a cabin door.Both women, from Salford, Greater Manchester, vehemently denied they endangered any lives or that they were drunk.Connor and York were arrested this month after an investigation by officers at Manchester airport and bailed pending further police inquiries.The Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether a case can be brought against them.XL Airways, a charter airline, had threatened to sue the pair to recoup the cost of an emergency landing, but collapsed through financial difficulties. The case continued when XL made an official complaint to Greater Manchester police.A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: "Two women, aged 26 and 27, were arrested by appointment on suspicion of being drunk on board an aircraft and have been bailed until 16 June and 18 June respectively, pending further police inquiries."
