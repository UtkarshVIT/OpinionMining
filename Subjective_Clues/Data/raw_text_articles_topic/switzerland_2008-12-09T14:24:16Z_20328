No charges are to be brought against the family of a paralysed rugby player for helping him travel to Switzerland to end his life, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ruled today. Daniel James, 23, died at a clinic run by the Dignitas organisation on September 12, more than a year after a rugby accident left him paralysed from the chest down. The CPS considered bringing charges under the Suicide Act against his parents, Mark and Julie James, from Sinton Green, Worcester. But the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, said today such a prosecution would not be in the public interest and no further action would be taken against the couple.Mr Starmer said that while public interest factors to support a prosecution did exist, among them the seriousness of the case, these were outweighed by arguments against. "This is a tragic case, involving as it does the death of a young man in difficult and unique circumstances," he said. "In reaching my decision I have given careful consideration to the code for crown prosecutors. "In particular, but not exclusively, I would point to the fact that Daniel, as a fiercely independent young man, was not influenced by his parents to take his own life, and the evidence indicates he did so despite their imploring him not to." A training ground injury in March 2007 left James paralysed from the chest down, with no independent hand or finger movement. Eight months later, his consultant said it was unlikely he would ever enjoy a significant recovery.
