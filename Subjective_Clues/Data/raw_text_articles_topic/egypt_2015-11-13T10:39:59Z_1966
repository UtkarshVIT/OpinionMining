Related: Research shows diversity in film has not improved in almost a decade The film, which stars Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as warring Egyptian gods, has been called out for questionable casting choices by users and celebrities, including Bette Midler.Movie, #GodsOfEgypt in which everyone is white? Egyptians, in history and today, have NEVER been white. BRING BACK GEOGRAPHY!! It's Africa!Why does the Egyptian extras from #GodsOfEgypt look like they're from a Seth Rogen movie? pic.twitter.com/y4Rm4eyjYADear Hollywood, White people did not rule ancient Egypt. Ancient Egypt did not worship white people. Hope this helps, -Everyone #GodsOfEgyptDear Hollywood, Egypt is in Africa. Northern to be exact. Why is that so hard to grasp? Stop gentrifying African countries. #GodsOfEgypt“If you need sunscreen while filming for #GodsOfEgypt it’s probably not a historically accurate casting,” said Vimto Mami, while AKA Dan Entwistle tweeted: “In all seriousness, no wonder POC complain about diversity in Hollywood when movies like #GodsOfEgypt get made. Egypt isn’t in Europe, guys.”Although the cast is mainly white, including Geoffrey Rush playing Egyptian sun god Ra, Get on Up star Chadwick Boseman also stars as Thoth. But his casting has caused equal ire, with some suggesting it plays into the “magical negro” stereotype.I cannot understand how they seriously cast Chadwick Boseman as a LITERAL all-knowing magical negro. #GodsOfEgypt pic.twitter.com/r9SmNPVGwIChadwick Boseman went from Iconic Black Guy to Magical Negro #GodsOfEgyptJust because Chadwick Boseman is "African American" doesn't mean he was appropriately cast either (ya'll gotta hear that too) #GodsOfEgypt Related: Does Exodus: Gods and Kings deserve to be banned for historical inaccuracy? The casting censure follows in the footsteps of last year’s controversial biblical epic Exodus: Gods and Kings, which was criticised for having a white cast, including Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton and Sigourney Weaver.Director Ridley Scott defended his decision, claiming it was for commercial reasons. “I can’t mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain, and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such,” he said. “I’m just not going to get it financed. So the question doesn’t even come up.”Gods of Egypt is a $140m (£92m) budget film, directed by I, Robot’s Alex Proyas, which studio Lionsgate is hoping could be a big franchise for them now that The Hunger Games is coming to an end.
