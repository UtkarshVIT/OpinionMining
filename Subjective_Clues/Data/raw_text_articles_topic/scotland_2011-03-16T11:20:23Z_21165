The Scottish government has announced that it will spend Â£10m on a four year scheme designed to help get telehealth systems, which aid treatment of health conditions within patients' homes, used more widely. The Scottish Assisted Living Demonstrator programme will involve about 10,000 people, both the elderly and those with disabilities. The government said that the main aim of the demonstrator is to help new healthcare technology's use in the public sector including NHS Scotland, the private sector, such as housing and third sector organisations, including charities and social enterprises.NHS 24, Highlands & Island Enterprise, Scottish Enterprise, the Technology Strategy Board and the Scottish government are involved in developing the programme, with the last two providing most of the funding.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's health secretary, said: "Supporting people to live independently at home is a key priority for the Scottish government. It is what older people have consistently said they want and we know it is generally better for people's health to remain at home wherever that's possible."Over the last four years, Scotland has made significant progress on developing and expanding new technologies to help people do just that - providing effective care and reassurance to many older people."Telehealth systems may help people stay in their own homes for longer, significant as by 2025 almost 1.5m people will be living with an age-related disability. The Department of Health in England is carrying out research into telehealth under its Whole Systems Demonstrator project.This article is published by Guardian Professional.
