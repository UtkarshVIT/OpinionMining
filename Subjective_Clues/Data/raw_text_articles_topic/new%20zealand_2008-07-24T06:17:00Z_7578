The New Zealand provincial newspaper, the Daily Chronicle, which serves the Horowhenua-Kapiti area north of Wellington, will soon be unable to live up to its title. It is to publish only two days a week, and will be given away free. Its owners, APN - a division of Tony O'Reilly's company, Independent News & Media - said a loss of advertising revenue had contributed to the decision to downsize. (Via New Zealand Herald/NZPA)
