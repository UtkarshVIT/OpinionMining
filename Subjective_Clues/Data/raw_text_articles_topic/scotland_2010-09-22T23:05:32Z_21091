BurgheadThere are many moving and sometimes dramatic scenes in the Highlands. For me, this includes the glens, straths, high tops, moorland, ancient forests and rivers. One vista always draws me back, and that is the coastline and the sea. Last week, in this area, east of Inverness, I had the most unexpected and strangely compelling experience I have had this year.A strong gale out in the North Sea was blowing endlessly towards the coast, and the resulting sea was dramatic and awesome. The noise was almost unreal, as if out of control, as the mosaic of white tops and shades of grey had a backcloth of a dark blue sea that seemed almost ominous. In such a turmoil, I expected few birds, and there were none on the sea itself.Then, as if they had just appeared, the gannets were there, the adults white with dark-tipped wings, and with a majestic six-foot wingspan, and still the flush of summer yellow of their head feathers. Their diving reminded me of lines by the poet Norman MacCaig: "Gannets fall like the heads of tridents / Bombarding the green silk water."They were conspicuous, but binoculars revealed that the birds of the year were with them in some numbers. These juveniles are supposed to be grey-brown with white flecks, but there in the strange light they looked simply black as they dived from only a few feet to catch their fish. Then, in one small part of the angry sea, there was panic as a great skua appeared and harried one young gannet until it dropped to the sea and dived.I suddenly realised there were more gannets in my view that I had seen since my last visit to St Kilda a few years ago. It was so exciting to see, and deeply moving, and it seemed that something was just right with theÂ world.
