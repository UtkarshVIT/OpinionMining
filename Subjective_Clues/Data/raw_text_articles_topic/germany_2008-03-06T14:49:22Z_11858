Germany risks becoming ungovernable, condemned to a new era of unstable minority rule, fragile coalitions, and lame duck chancellors, a former German head of state warned today.With the "grand coalition" of Christian and social democrats (CDU and SPD) under Chancellor Angela Merkel increasingly gridlocked, and unprecedented coalitions being mooted in key German states, Roman Herzog, a former German president and ex-head of the constitutional court, called for changes to the constitution and the electoral system to counter the drift towards government paralysis."We are dealing with a fundamental shift in our system of government," said Herzog in a lengthy analysis in Munich's Süddeutsche Zeitung. "It will be increasingly difficult to form and maintain stable absolute majorities. Put plainly, the danger of minority governments will grow."Life will be hard for a minority chancellor. Abroad and particularly in Brussels, he will be seen as a 'lame duck' whose days are numbered, with whom there's no point in running longer-term political projects. If you look realistically at modern international politics, you will realise how detrimental that might be for Germany."Calling for an overhaul of the rules fixing how Germany forms its governments, Herzog raised the spectre of the Weimar Republic, the ramshackle democracy between the wars which collapsed in chaos and runaway inflation, paving the way for Adolf Hitler.The anxiety over the state of German politics has been triggered by the rise of the Left, a new party of former east German communists and hard-left defectors from the social democrats in western Germany, led by Oskar Lafontaine, the maverick former SPD leader and finance minister.As a result of recent successes at the ballot box, it is now represented in 10 of Germany's 16 federal states or Länder, as well as in the national parliament in Berlin, turning the country's politics into a five-party system in which it is increasingly impossible to form majority coalitions between natural partners.In the state of Hessen around Frankfurt, the social democrats are currently breaking the mould by negotiating a minority government with the Greens, which will be maintained by the tacit support of the Left party, despite previous SPD pledges never to work with the Left.And after recent elections in Hamburg, the Christian democrats are exploring the first coalition in the country between the CDU and the Greens, because it is the only viable governing option.The core of the problem is the long-term trend of erosion of support for the two big national parties, the CDU and the SPD, in Germany's proportional representation system. They now struggle to muster 70% support between them, while the fringe parties - the free market liberals of the FDP, the Greens and the Left - each take up to 10%. Neither of the two big parties can rely on a single junior partner to form a majority.For the entire post-war period, German democracy has been a three-party system, morphing into a four-party arrangement with the rise of the Greens in the 1980s. That has now changed.Herzog warned that the entrenchment of the hard left in German politics is likely to be mirrored by the emergence of a stronger extreme right, turning Germany into a six-party system."The possibility of a sixth party, which would not need to be neo-fascist, cannot be quite excluded."Herzog's intervention, which is certain to trigger a bout of soul-searching and anxiety over the direction of German politics, comes as the Merkel government drifts into immobility amid a wave of strikes and industrial action.The chancellor accuses her SPD coalition partner of wanting to be both government and opposition, since the SPD leader, Kurt Beck, is not in the cabinet, and has shifted the party to the left to try to win back votes from its hard-left rival.Moderate SPD politicians are stunned by the party's move to collaborate with the hard-left renegades in Hessen following repeated election campaign pledges never to do so.Herzog called for a national debate over how to change the constitution and electoral laws to streamline the system. A British-style system of first-past-the-post winners guaranteeing majority governments would "never" be tolerated by the Germans, he said, because a majority of parliamentary seats could be secured from a minority of the popular vote.He preferred the French system of run-offs for parliamentary seats because it favoured the big parties while leaving more scope for the small parties to strike bargains.He also called for constitutional changes on how Germany's upper house or federal council (representing the 16 states) operates, since the passing of most financial legislation by the central government could otherwise be stymied.
