A semi-sequel to last year's Reel Afghanistan event, this 11-film season aims to give a more rounded view of Iraq and its people than you'd get from news reportage alone. Even films that aren't, on the surface, about the war still bear its scars - such as the pastoral Zaman: Man From The Reeds, which had much of its footage confiscated by Saddam's regime. There's also a good range of styles and approaches: Nick Broomfield's verité-style Battle For Haditha; James Longley's ground-level doc Iraq In Fragments; plus work from more local film-makers, such as the Kurdish-Iranian Turtles Can Fly (pictured) and Life After The Fall. • Filmhouse, Fri to 21 May, filmhousecinema.com/seasons/reel-iraq
