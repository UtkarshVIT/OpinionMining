As we contemplate whether George W Bush has been the worst US president in history, he makes it easier for us to decide by serving up another turkey.One of his final presidential offerings is a Christmas video, featuring Barney the Scottish terrier doing his annual decorating of the White House. It is excruciating. But watch it anyway and let us know how you think it compares with previous efforts. It opens with stilted efforts from Laura and the twins, Jenna and Barbara, before we find ourselves in the strange territory of animated dog Olympics.Barney has apparently starred in nine of these videos, but one highlight from previous years was the 2007 message with the theme, Barney becomes a park ranger. There is even a bizarre cameo from Tony Blair encouraging the efforts and appearing in Barney's dreams. Or there is this nine-minute opus which is noteworthy for the amount of White House staff, Karl Rove et al, conned into appearing and, um, that's before Dolly Parton turns up.
