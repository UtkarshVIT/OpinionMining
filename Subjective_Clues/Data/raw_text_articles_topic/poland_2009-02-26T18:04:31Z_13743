Poland's foreign minister says he received assurances from Barack Obama's administration that it will follow through on plans to place a Patriot missile battery in Poland.The plan was originally intended as a reward for Poland's acceptance of a US missile defence base, but Obama has not yet decided the fate of the proposed missile defence system.Foreign minister Radek Sikorski said secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton assured him that, either way, the United States will put the Patriot missiles in Poland. He spoke after meeting with Clinton in Washington yesterday, and his remarks were broadcast on Polish TV."The secretary of state said that we are going to carry out that which really matters to Poland," Sikorski said. He said the US and Poland would go ahead with a deal for "first the temporary and then permanent stationing of a battery of Patriot missiles in Poland".The Patriot air defence system would go far in calming Polish fears about the risks of agreeing to host a missile defence base, which include Russia's opposition to the plan.The Bush administration signed a deal with Poland last year to place 10 missile defence interceptors at a base in the northern part of the country. The system would also include a radar base in the Czech Republic, which borders Poland.But US officials have said the entire project must be reviewed. Obama's top officials have said the new administration supports missile defence in principle, but the system must be cost-effective and technologically proven, and must not drain resources from more pressing concerns.Since Obama took office in January the US has sought to improve relations with Russia, which vehemently objects to US military installations being built so close to its own territory. In response, Moscow had threatened to station Iskander missiles in its exclave of Kaliningrad, near the Polish border.Poland agreed to host the missile defence base and strongly lobbied to get the Patriot missiles hoping that closer military ties with the US would bolster its security in the face of a resurgent Russia.Poland's anxieties deepened last summer when Russia fought a brief war with Georgia. Poland and the United States signed the missile defence agreement shortly after that conflict erupted in August.
