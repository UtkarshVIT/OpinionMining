Facebook's German-language version launches today, thanks, in no small part, to 2,000 German speakers who translated the entire site in less than two weeks.Anyone accessing the site from a German-speaking country (there are more than you think...) will see the new version from today, and anyone else can change the language preference settings in their profiles.Facebook has around 1 million German-speaking users who collectively decided things like 'anklopfen' would be the best translation of 'poke'. The site represents Facebook's third language version after English and Spanish, and a French version is planned soon.Turkey actually has the fourth biggest userbase after the US, UK and Canada, with Australia, France and Sweden further down the list.If Facebook is hitting the bad side of the hype cycle, expanding into new territories might help to bolster user numbers. Users might get a warm feeling from seeing their own translations on the site, but there isn't quite the same level of ownership as Wikipedia which is, after all, a not-for-profit.
