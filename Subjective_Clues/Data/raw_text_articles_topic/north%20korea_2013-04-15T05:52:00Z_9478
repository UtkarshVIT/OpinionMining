John Kerry, the US secretary of state, pressed his message of potential dialogue with North Korea as he wrapped up his diplomatic tour in Japan, saying the US was "prepared to reach out" and consider direct talks under the right circumstances.After weeks of tension on the Korean peninsula – with the North issuing angry threats, pulling its workers out of a joint industrial complex and possibly preparing for a missile test – Kerry has repeatedly focused on the US desire for a peaceful resolution during the Asian leg of his 10-day trip.But speaking in Tokyo he warned that Pyongyang would need to show good faith "so we're not going around and around in the same-old, same-old".The North rebuffed Seoul's proposal of talks as a "crafty trick" on Sunday. The South's unification ministry described the response as regrettable but said the offer would remain on the table.Analysts have suggested the North may test a mid-range missile close to its major political holiday – Monday's Day of the Sun, which marks the birth of the country's first leader, Kim Il-sung. It has previously held launches near important anniversaries.The South's defence ministry discounted speculation of such a move on a Monday, pointing out the North had not previously carried out a test on that day. But spokesman Kim Min-seok added: "The military is not easing up on its vigilance on the activities of the North's military with the view that they can conduct a provocation at any time."South Korea's defence minister, Kim Kwan-jin, said it was believed the North was ready for a launch, the Yonhap news agency reported.Experts say increased activity at missile sites in recent weeks might be intended to send a message that the North is willing to hold a test, whether or not it actually does so.Kerry told reporters that a launch would "raise people's temperatures" and reiterated the US determination to defend its allies. But he added: "Our choice is to negotiate, our choice is to move to the table and find a way for the region to have peace."I'm not going to be so stuck in the mud that an opportunity to actually get something done is flagrantly wasted because of a kind of predetermined stubbornness."He said how far the North would need to go would have to be the subject of discussion, but added: "If the Chinese came to us and said, 'Look, here's what we have cooking,' I'm not going to tell you I'm shutting the door today to something that's logical and might have a chance of success."Kerry indicated he might be willing to use back channels rather than an official US government envoy to handle contact with the North. In the US, the Republican senator John McCain voiced scepticism about possible talks with the North, warning: "If we give them food, if we give them oil, if we give them money, they will come around and they take our money and run."In Pyongyang, leader Kim Jong-un visited the mausoleum where the bodies of his grandfather Kim Il-sung and father Kim Jong-il lie in state to pay "high tribute in humblest reverence" on Monday, the official Korean Central News Agency said.On Sunday, athletes from 16 countries competed in a marathon in Pyongyang as part of the celebrations, while performers gathered for a gala concert in the capital in the afternoon.
