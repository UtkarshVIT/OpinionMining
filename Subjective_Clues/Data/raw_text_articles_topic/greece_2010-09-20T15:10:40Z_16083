Stress tests on banks in debt-stricken Greece have been put off by a month to give Athens time to gauge the success of its latest effort to woo investors in Europe's capital markets.The reprieve, on the eve of a much-anticipated auction of three-month bills, was announced by officials at the country's central bank. Tomorrow's sale is seen as a crucial marker of global appetite for Greek debt."The stress tests will not be done in September," a Bank of Greece official said. "It has been agreed instead that they will take place at the end of October, which allows us to take into account the performance of banks over the nine-month period."Regular supervision of the ailing sector was a key component of the agreement reached between Athens and the so-called troika – euro area nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB) – when, in an unprecedented move, all three extended €110bn (£90bn) of emergency loans to Greece in May.This month's tests were to be the first in a series of quarterly reviews.With the Greek economy set to contract by 4% and its downward economic spiral exacerbated by draconian austerity measures, the liquidity of local lenders is of serious concern.Shut out from the interbank market because of fears of sovereign risk, Greek banks have turned, increasingly, to the ECB for funding. Approximately 19%, or €95.9bn, of the banking system's assets are currently derived from the Frankfurt-based institution.As he tried to lure investors during a European roadshow last week, Athens' finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, admitted the dependency on ECB funds would continue "until confidence returns, and for confidence to return the deficit has got to go down".In July, Greek banks participated in a pan-European stress test held, partly, to restore investor confidence after the country's debt crisis exposed the flaws of EU monetary union and spooked markets earlier in the year.Only one Greek lender, the state-controlled ATEbank, failed the health check.But as the austerity-driven recession deepens, Greece's international lenders are eager to ensure that the banking system is adequately cushioned against non-performing loans."At such a critical time, making sure there is liquidity in the system is vital," a senior aide to the Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, said. "We all realise that the market needs to be heated up."The postponement will also allow officials to factor in the results of a €1.7bn capital-raising venture by the National Bank of Greece. The surprise move by the country's biggest lender wraps up next month.If successful, the capital-strengthening programme would not only boost investor confidence but would potentially spur mergers and acquisitions within the Greek banking sector, which the EU and IMF are keen to see.
