24 years in 140 characters: Usually roll over to let New Zealand tickle their tummies, then put the frighteners on someone else – Scotland in 07. Never made last eight.World Cup record:1987: Pool Stages1991: Pool Stages1995: Pool Stages1999: Pool Stages2003: Pool Stages2007: Pool StagesRecord in 2011: P7 W2 L5Coach: Nick MallettCaptain: Sergio ParisseHow are they likely to get on? Who knows? Will Mallett be sent off in style or have his bosses shot Italy in the foot by not building on the Six Nations victory over France and giving the South African an extension to his contract?Key player: Whoever is given the job of kicking, the penalties the big forwards will undoubtedly earn – either Luciano Orquera or Mirco Bergamasco – will have a vital role to play. If he misses more than he kicks, they'll want to kick him.Commentator's kit: Italy kicked the first penalty in World Cup play, Oscar Collodo taking the three against New Zealand in the 1987 tournament's opening match. Unfortunately, the All Blacks went on to win 70-6.Martin Castrogiovanni, prop, age 29, caps 78Lorenzo Cittadini, prop, age 28, caps 6Andrea Lo Cicero, prop, age 35, caps 88Salvatore Perugini, prop, age 33, caps 80Tommaso D'Apice, hooker, age 23, caps 2Leonardo Ghiraldini, hooker, age 26, caps 38Fabio Ongaro, hooker, age 33, caps 77Marco Bortolami, second-row, age 31, caps 85Carlo Del Fava, second row, age 30, caps 53Quintin Geldenhuys, second-row, age 30, caps 22Cornelius Van Zyl, second-row, age 32, caps 2Robert Barbieri, flanker, age 27, caps 15Mauro Bergamasco, flanker, age 32, caps 85Paul Derbyshire, flanker, age 24, caps 12Alessandro Zanni, flanker, age 27, caps 54Sergio Parisse (c), No8, age 27, caps 79Pablo Canavosio, scrum-half, age 29, caps 37Edoardo Gori, scrum-half, age 21, caps 5Fabio Semenzato, scrum-half, age 25, caps 5Riccardo Bocchino, fly-half, age 23, caps 8Luciano Orquera, fly-half, age 29, caps 24Gonzalo Canale, centre, age 28, caps 68Gonzalo Garcia, centre, age 27, caps 22Matteo Pratichetti, centre, age 26, caps 23Alberto Sgarbi, centre, age 24, caps 13Tommaso Benvenuti, wing, age 20, caps 8Mirco Bergamasco, wing, age 28, caps 82Giulio Toniolatti, wing, age 27, caps 6Andrea Masi, full-back, age 30, caps 61Luke McLean, full-back, age 24, caps 28.Average age 27.6Average caps 38.8
