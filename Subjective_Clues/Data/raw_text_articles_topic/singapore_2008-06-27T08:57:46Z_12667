Hundreds of police and soldiers are today searching dense jungle near the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, after an air force plane carrying 18 people, including one Briton, went missing.A military spokesman said the 1984 Casa-212 aircraft had taken off from an airstrip just east of Jakarta yesterday and disappeared during an aerial surveillance mission shortly afterwards. On board were five crew members and 13 passengers, including a Briton, an Indian and a Singaporean all working for the Singapore-based Credent Technology, an air force spokesman said. The employees were testing new camera equipment on the flight.Search teams are scouring jungle at the base of Salak mountain, about 60 miles south of Jakarta."The aircraft has not been found yet. The area is too large," a police spokesman said.Indonesia has seen a spate of airline accidents in recent years, including an Adam Air crash that killed 102 people and a Garuda, the national carrier, accident that killed 21. Those crashes led the EU to ban all Indonesian airlines from its air space.The latest incident is the second involving a Casa-212 plane this year in Indonesia after a flight operated by the private Dirgantara air service crashed in January with three people aboard.
