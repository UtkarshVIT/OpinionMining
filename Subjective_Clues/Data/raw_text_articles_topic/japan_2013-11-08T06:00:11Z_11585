Originally formed in London in 2012, the group have since moved back to Japan, and have recently become active in Tokyo.The pair’s music has just as much duality as their stage presence: Fukuda hardly moves as she sings simple, but catchy melodies, while Niiyan wears a gas mask and goes all out, climbing on top of equipment and letting his guitar wail. Their music ranges from catchy, shoegaze-influenced pop to disgusting, chaotic, walls of noise. Many times they have both elements present in their songs.Rainbow is featured on their compilation, International Pop Underground Sounds (Sickness of a Fourteen Year Old Girl) Vol. 1, which was released in September. The compilation is released from Fukuda’s label, 14 Years Records, and features artists from around the world, such as Brutes from the UK, and a solo track from Taigen Kawabe of Bo Ningen. Rainbow is a fine example of the duality found of Umez, with its lo-fi beats and Niyan’s soaring guitars, fronted by Fukuda’s calm vocals, a breakdown in the middle featuring a playful keyboard part, the whole bookended by the main guitar riff and vocal melody. Not all their tracks sound like this of course, but it’s a good taste of the band condensed into a three-minute pop song.• Angèle David-Guillou – Our Garden: New music from France• Akiine – Frid: New music from Sweden
