Donald Trump on Thursday pressed ahead with a visit to Laredo, close to the US-Mexico border, despite his invitation to the city being withdrawn by the US border patrol council.

Everybody wants me,” Trump told reporters at the airport.Signs carried by the crowd included: “Lulac [the League of United Latin American Citizens civil rights group] likes veterans, not bigots” and “Trump’s hair is illegal”.“John McCain is a hero, Trump is a chump,” read another, referencing Trump’s recent characterisation of McCain, who spent five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, as “not a war hero”.Demonstrators in Laredo, which has a 95.6% Hispanic and Latino population, were chiefly angry at Trump’s visit given his series of comments criticising immigrants and Mexico. The former Apprentice host has claimed that Mexico sends “rapists” and “drug dealers” to the US and has promised to make Mexico pay for the construction of a wall along the entirety of the border.Trump held a short question and answer session with reporters in the city, where he said there was a “tremendous danger with illegals coming in”. Asked if he had seen any evidence to support his claims regarding Mexico sending its criminals across the border, Trump replied in the affirmative.“Yes I have. And I’ve heard it. I’ve heard it from a lot of different people,” Trump said, speaking approximately one hour after he had arrived in Laredo.Asked for specifics, Trump said: “We’ll be showing you the evidence.”Trump repeated previous claims that he “will win the Hispanic vote”, citing a 16 July poll in Nevada which had Trump at 31.4% among Hispanic voters regarding Republican presidential hopefuls. He did not reference a Univision poll, published the same day, which showed that 79% of Hispanic voters found Trump’s comments on illegal immigration offensive, while 71% had an unfavourable view of him.The US border patrol council had invited Trump to the city and had planned a series of events. The council withdrew the invitation on Thursday morning.“After careful consideration of all the factors involved in this event and communicating with members of the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) at the national level, it has been decided by Local 2455 to pull out of all events involving Donald Trump,” said Hector Garza, the president of the border patrol chapter that had been due to host the businessman.Trump said the chapter had “received pressure at national level” to drop the planned events.Laredo’s city manager, Jesus Olivares, joined Trump on stage, but there was a moment of awkwardness when Olivares said he was opposed to building a wall on the border – a central tenet of Trump’s campaign.“We don’t think that’s necessary at this time,” Olivares said, as Trump stood behind him. “I think there’s other ways that we can work together with the federal government.”Trump has vowed to make Mexico pay for the construction of the wall, although he appeared to backtrack from the idea of a west-to-east wall following Olivares’s comments.“Oh yes in certain sections you have to have a wall, absolutely,” Trump said.

The press conference was almost entirely restricted to questions on immigration, a theme to which Trump has returned after he faced severe criticism for his comments regarding McCain. On Thursday morning his campaign announced the formation of a “Veterans for Trump coalition” in New Hampshire, in an apparent attempt at contrition following the row.While few commentators believe Trump has a real chance of winning the Republican nomination, let alone the presidency, Trump said he was convinced he would be the next commander-in-chief.“I think I’ll get the nomination – we’ll see soon enough but I think I’ll get the nomination – the best way to win is for me to get the nomination and run, probably against Hillary,” he said.“She is going to be beaten, and I’m the one to beat her.”
