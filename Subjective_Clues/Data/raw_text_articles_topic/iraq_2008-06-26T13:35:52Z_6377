Iraq needs a job surge to deprive the insurgency of recruits and less debate on whether US forces should stay or leave, a thinktank said today.The creation of well-paid jobs in a country where 45% of the population is aged between 15-30, and the unemployment rate as high as 40% according to the UN, is fundamental to a successful future for Iraq, the Senlis Council said in a new report."Just as we have seen the use of a military surge in Iraq, we need also to see a job surge and a democracy surge to meet the legitimate grievances of the population," Paul Burton, the council's director of policy analysis, said."Current attempts at bringing democracy to Iraq have taken too much of a 'top down' approach."The council argued that the international community needed to move beyond the current debate of whether US troops should stay or go, as it led to an over-reliance on traditional military responses."The international community must be seen to contribute to improving everyday life, most urgently through the provision of humanitarian aid and the repatriation of millions of refugees," the report said. "International involvement must cease to be associated with aggressive military tactics or oil exploitation, but instead with positive action as defined by Iraqis themselves."Some Iraqis interviewed by the Senlis Council acknowledged that security had improved since George Bush ordered a military "surge" last year, but not enough. Some said things were better under Saddam Hussein as there was security, but all agreed that the lack of jobs was a big problem as it created widespread anger among many young men."This makes them vulnerable to recruitment by extremist elements, sectarian militias and local and international criminal gangs," Norine MacDonald, president of the Senlis Council, said. This problem also applied to Afghanistan and Somalia, where the organisation has also done extensive research, she added.The council made the broader point that the west needed a new "global security architecture" that put as much emphasis on non-military issues, such as creating jobs, promoting the UN's millennium development goals of reducing poverty, emphasising human rights and developing an independent media."There is too much emphasis on the military approach in conflicts," MacDonald said. "Political and financial investment will bring as much return as security."The council said foreign investment should be viewed as a security tool that could lead to the creation of well-paid jobs, ideally backed by "micro-credit" disbursed by local small and medium companies. While the report did not specifically talk of a public works programme along the lines of Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930s, MacDonald said Iraq would benefit from such a job creation scheme.The Iraq findings on the political and security repercussions of high unemployment echoed research carried out in Afghanistan and Somalia, the report said."This crescent of anger that runs through all three of the main theatres of the war on terror conflict is not being effectively responded to," MacDonald said. "We need to win over these young mens' hearts and minds in order to starve the insurgents of recruits and support."
