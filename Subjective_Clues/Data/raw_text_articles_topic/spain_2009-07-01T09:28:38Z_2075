A British man on a skydiving beginners' course in Spain fell 13,000ft to his death yesterday after apparently going into a state of shock in the air.Police said Richard Taylor, 34, fell "like a lead weight" after he did not open his parachute and his automatic emergency chute failed. The accident at at the Airelibre school in Ocana, central Spain, happened on Taylor's fifth jump."We are devastated by this tragic accident," said a school spokesman, David Coleman. "He was on his fifth jump and had previously done absolutely everything right, showing great control and altitude awareness. He had been in freefall for about a minute when he curled up into a ball, probably as a result of going into shock."Coleman said the instructor tried to catch up with Taylor, who was on a beginners' course with four British friends, but he was falling too fast because he was curled up."The instructor gave hand signals telling him to open his chute, but he did not respond," Coleman said. "Eventually the instructor had to open his own parachute."An emergency parachute should have activated but because Taylor was curled up in a ball a line got caught on his arm and it could not open properly.The mayor of Ocana, Jos√© Carlos Martinez Osteso, said police had established that neither of Taylor's parachutes opened.Houdi de la Fuente, the commercial director of Airelibre, said: "This is incredibly sad, he was a young man who was full of life and dreams and excitement. For him to have his life cut short like this is absolutely tragic."Taylor is the second Briton to die at the school. Andrew Bearne, 39, from Guildford, Surrey, crash-landed after apparently blacking out on his first solo skydive last August.Three years ago a mother of four, Anna Endicott, 31, from Thornby, Gloucestershire, died when she collided with her instructor in the same part of Spain.
