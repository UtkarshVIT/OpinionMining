An American missionary arrested after entering North Korea is set to be released, according to the state-controlled media.Robert Park, 28, was arrested after entering the country on Christmas Day carrying a letter to its leader, Kim Jong-il. He is believed to have been attempting to draw attention to the tens of thousands of political prisoners said to be held in the communist state.KCNA reported this morning that an investigation into Park, a Korean-American human rights activist, had found he trespassed into North Korea "due to his wrong understanding of the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea]"."The relevant organ of the DPRK decided to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrongdoings into consideration," KCNA said.In a separate article, the news agency carried an interview with Park, who works for Pax Koreana, a conservative Seoul-based group that calls for North Korea to improve its human rights record. In the interview he said his understanding of North Korea had been tarnished by "false propaganda made by the west"."The west is massively feeding Children of Secret State, Seoul Train and other documentary videos with stories about non-existent 'human rights abuses' and 'mass killings' in the DPRK and 'unbearable sufferings' of its Christians and the like," Park reportedly said."This false propaganda prompted me, a Christian, to entertain a biased view on the DPRK."Park, from Tucson, Arizona, was filmed by colleagues as he walked from China across the frozen Tumen river into North Korea – which allows few foreign citizens beyond its borders – on 25 December. He was carrying a letter addressed to Kim, asking him to release political prisoners and shut down the "concentration camps" where they were held.The South Korean government estimates North Korea holds 154,000 political prisoners in six camps across the country. It is regarded as having one of the world's worst human rights records, but denies the existence of prison camps.North Korea strictly regulates visits by foreigners, although if Park is freed he will be the third US citizen to be released in recent months.US journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling, who entered the country illegally, were pardoned by Kim in August, after the intervention of Bill Clinton.Some may suspect the sincerity of Park's confession however, with the activist thanking his captors "for their love"."Upon trespassing on the border, I thought I would be either shot to death by soldiers or thrown behind bars, prompted by Americans' false propaganda about the DPRK," he said."However, the moment I trespassed on the border, the attitude of soldiers toward the trespasser made me change my mind."Not only service personnel but all those I met in the DPRK treated me in a kind and gentlemanly manner and protected my rights. I have never seen such kind and generous people."
