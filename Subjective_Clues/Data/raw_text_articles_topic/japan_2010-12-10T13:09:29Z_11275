Any film director who adapts an acclaimed novel runs the risk of upsetting the author's hypersensitive fans. The risks magnify when the writer is the famously ruminative Haruki Murakami.The Japanese author's surreal treatment of the ills of modern society has won him millions of fans worldwide and a reputation for introspection that will now extend to the big screen.The film adaptation of his bestseller Norwegian Wood opens in cinemas in Japan tomorrow, 23 years after the book first enraptured readers with its themes of love, loss and mental illness.Aware that Murakami's devotees will be looking to pounce on every perceived deviation from the novel, the movie's director, Tran Anh Hung, says every effort has been made to capture the essence of the writer's work."Murakami protected his work," Tran said of his first meeting with the "quiet, very serious and very careful" author in 2004. "He gave us two conditions. One is that he would like to see the script. The other is that he would like to know what the budget would be for the movie."The French-Vietnamese director, and the film's producer, Shinji Ogawa, corresponded with Murakami for four years before winning his approval to make the film in 2008.Set in 1960s Tokyo, the Japanese-language film centres on the troubled, at times tortuous, life of a 19-year-old university student, Toru Watanabe, played by Kenichi Matsuyama, and his relationships with Naoko and Midori. Rinko Kikuchi, who was nominated for an Oscar for her supporting role in the 2006 movie Babel, plays the vulnerable Naoko, while the model Kiko Mizuhara makes her film debut as Midori.Tran said he had wanted to turn Murakami's best-known novel into a film since reading it in French translation in 1994 and was convinced the book's universal themes would work as well on screen as they had in print."I've read some other love stories, but this one is very special," he said during a recent visit to Tokyo. "The book reveals some shadows that are hidden inside you."It was just a story of first love, but the first love that you lose almost immediately once you have it."I think this is a universal experience. This is probably why the book was such a success worldwide."That said, the 47-year-old director admitted there were moments when he wondered if he had done justice to a book that turned Murakami into an internationally acclaimed author."When I read the book, I really had this intuition that it was possible to make a film out of it," Tran said. "And then, when you start working on it, everything that's left is fear â€“ fear of not being able to do it."Norwegian Wood has sold more than 10m copies in Japan and 2.6m overseas since it was published in 1987. His other books, notably Kafka on the Shore and The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, have been translated into dozens of languages.Norwegian Wood represents another shift in emphasis for Tran, whose first movie, the moody The Scent of Green Papaya (1993), won the Camera d'Or at Cannes and was nominated for an Academy award. He won the Golden Lion award at the Venice film festival for Cyclo, his gritty 1995 film about a young rickshaw driver.Reviews in Japan have been mostly positive, although the film, nominated for the Golden Lion in Venice in September, did not win the prize.In the Japan Times, the veteran critic Mark Schilling praised the Taiwanese cinematographer Pin Bing Lee's "dramatically stylish visuals" but said that "the drama of the characters' intertwined and tangled lives feels curiously inert".
