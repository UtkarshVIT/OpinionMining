On the second day of Prince William's first official visit overseas, to New Zealand, he finally met a local who didn't want to meet him.In his case it was a drowsy Little Spotted Kiwi, rooted out of its undergrowth habitat and nocturnal routine the previous evening and kept in a box to be introduced to the prince on his visit to the astonishingly beautiful Kapiti Island reserve.The 2,000-acre (800-hectare) island, off the coast of North Island, near Wellington, is fiercely protected, with restricted public access, as the last home of several bird species unique to the country, among them 1,200 Little Spotteds, the flightless blue and green Takahe parrot and the fiercely acquisitive Wekas, small brown birds not averse, like many at tourist destinations, to relieving visitors of anything shiny.The prince's kiwi, about the size of a small chicken, is the smallest of the six sub-­species of the bird and it deployed its defences against the unwelcome intrusion of visitors by unleashing a small shower of feathers, a move designed to distract attention.It is a tactic royals could perhaps consider deploying for themselves. As it was, the prince, gingerly holding the kiwi upside down, merely turned to the accompanying flock of press photographers and beamed knowingly: "At last – me with a kiwi bird." They knew what he meant. Having received its few minutes of fame, the bird was allowed to scuttle back into the bush.Earlier in the day there had been no shortage of human inhabitants eager to meet the prince after he had officially opened the new supreme court building in Wellington – the ostensible purpose of the whole five-day trip.The 27-year-old prince was standing in for his grandmother for the first time in inaugurating the building, part of the palace's plan that he should take on more public engagements in future, in tandem with his training to be an air sea rescue helicopter pilot.Beadily watching him make his first, assured and competent speech, from the second row in the public seats, was none other than Christopher Geidt, the Queen's private secretary. "I am just here on holiday and it was suggested I might like to look in," Geidt said, somewhat unconvincingly."I am not in shorts or anything," he added, unnecessarily as he was dressed in a business suit. "Not even keeping an eye," he added, in response to the obvious question.Outside the court a crowd of several thousand had gathered by the time William left the building, with enthusiasts outnumbering protesters against the monarchy many times over. Indeed the few republicans present were also heavily outnumbered by a rival, noisy demonstration by court workers protesting about their working conditions.The prince embarked on a prolonged walkabout, insisting he did not wish to disappoint any of those waiting, and cheerily shook hands, received bouquets of flowers, posed for pictures and engaged small, star-struck infants in conversation as if he had been doing it all his life. There was even a touch of his grandfather: "What are you doing here, you slackers?" he called to a group of officer workers, but, lacking Prince Philip's strange ethereal charm, he did it without causing offence.The prince only blanched once, when a mother thrust a spectacularly grubby infant in his direction with the injunction to "kiss my baby". "I'm not allowed – it's protocol," he replied hastily.The crowd all thought the prince was lovely, gorgeous but worried about the lack of sun block on his balding head in the fierce morning sun.William will fly on to Sydney and Melbourne tomorrow for an unofficial visit, albeit one where he will meet the Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, in a late-scheduled meeting.
