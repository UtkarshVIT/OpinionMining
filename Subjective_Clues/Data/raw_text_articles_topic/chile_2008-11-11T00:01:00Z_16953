Champagne sales have fizzled out at Majestic Wine, leading to a 25% drop in its half-year profits. Sales of bubbly, which makes up nearly a fifth of the company's UK business, were down 6.4% in the first half compared with the same period last year, mainly owing to business customers cutting back.Steve Lewis, Majestic's chief executive, said businesses had cut back after the price of champagne went up 15% due to April's increase in duty and the strong euro. "Champagne sales have fallen as prices have gone up - and people have nothing much to celebrate," he said. In response, Majestic has expanded its top range of sparkling wine, costing between £10 and £12, and is running champagne promotions ahead of Christmas.Like-for-like sales in the UK fell 2.1% in the six months to September 29, but the firm insisted it maintained its 3% share of the UK wine market. Sales of fine wine continue to rise, with wines from Argentina, Chile and New Zealand showing strong growth. Half-year profits before tax fell to £5.6m from £7.5m, though total sales were up by 3.4% to £94.1m. The firm has reported growth in annual profits and sales every year since 1992. The average bottle of wine at Majestic now costs £6.19, up from £5.85 last year.
