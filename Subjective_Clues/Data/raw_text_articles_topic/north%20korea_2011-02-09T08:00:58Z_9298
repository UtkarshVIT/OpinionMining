Relations between North and South Korea showed further signs of improvement when the two sides agreed to hold talks on the possible revival of attempts to reunite families separated during the Korean war.Less than three months after the peninsula appeared to be on the brink of conflict after the North's attack on Yeonpyeong island, the countries' Red Cross agencies will discuss the reunions at a date yet to be agreed, reports said.Hopes were also raised that the countries would broach joint tourism and industrial projects that have been affected by recent tensions.The Korean peninsula was plunged into crisis in March after the North was blamed for a torpedo attack on the Cheonan, a South Korean warship, in which 46 sailors died.After Yeonpyeong was shelled on 23 November, the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, vowed to retaliate with air strikes to any further provocations by Pyongyang.The agreement to discuss humanitarian issues came as senior military officials met for a second day  at Panmunjom, the "truce village" located along the heavily fortified border that has divided the peninsula since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war.The North has recently pushed for talks between the Red Cross agencies on the resumption of meetings between separated families."We conveyed our agreement to hold the Red Cross talks," Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman for South Korea's unification ministry, told reporters. "The government shared the view on the urgency and importance of humanitarian issues, including the reunions of separated families."Hundreds of thousands of people were separated during the war. More than 20,000 elderly South Koreans have been briefly reunited with relatives from the North over the past 10 years, but many among the 80,000 others may die they before they are given the chance to meet relatives they last saw six decades ago.It is not clear whether Seoul has agreed to discuss the resumption of joint projects at Kaesong , an industrial complex north of the border, and Mount Kumgang, a tourism enterprise on the North's east coast.Colonels from both sides have resumed talks in the demilitarised zone after failing to agree on the logistics of future negotiations, possibly between the countries' defence ministers, who haven't met for more than three years.The North's delegation has refused to apologise for the Cheonan and Yeonpyeong incidents, saying they should be discussed at a higher level.The North insists it was not involved in the Cheonan sinking, and that it was provoked into attacking Yeonpyeong after the South fired artillery rounds into its waters during a drill."The atmosphere of yesterday's meeting was good, and we are doing out best," South Korea's chief delegate, Colonel Moon Sang-kyun, told reporters on Wednesday morning.The Koreas had faced pressure from China and the US to resume dialogue amid a rapid deterioration in ties after the Yeonpyeong shelling.Progress in bilateral talks could lead to a resumption of six-party nuclear negotiations involving the two Koreas, China, the US, Russia and Japan, which haven't been held since April 2009.
