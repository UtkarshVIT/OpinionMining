All health bodies in Scotland met their financial targets, but 10 out of 14 NHS boards have reported underlying recurring deficits, Scotland's spending watchdog has said.In an overview of the NHS in Scotland's performance for 2010-11, Audit Scotland says that the service faces pressures from an ageing population, rising public demand and expectations, increased costs and staff reduction. The NHS spent £12bn in 2010-11, with the budget for 2011-12 estimated to be £232m higher. However, this will be a reduction in real terms due to inflation.According to the report, life expectancy in Scotland has increased and the rate of deaths from coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer has also fallen. Despite this, overall life expectancy in Scotland remains lower than that in most other western European countries and there are still significant health inequalities and long-standing health related problems such as obesity and drug and alcohol misuse.Robert Black, auditor general for Scotland, said: "At a national level, we are seeing a good picture of the performance of the NHS in Scotland. In 2010-11, all NHS boards met their financial targets for the third year in a row, and there is continued progress against the 'big three' diseases of coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer. However, it is clear that there are building pressures in the system from increased costs and rising expectations and demand."Audit Scotland says that the NHS cannot tackle these problems alone and needs to work more effectively with other public bodies to make the best use of resources and increase the focus on preventative services.The watchdog also says that strategies to improve services and make the NHS more efficient and effective will need to include better use of data. The NHS continues to find it difficult to measure productivity due to weaknesses in data and difficulties in linking costs, activity and quality, the report says.Scotland has invested quite heavily on technology such as telehealth over the last year in a bid to support independent living for those with disabilities and age-related illnesses and keep people out of hospitals where possible.This article is published by Guardian Professional.
