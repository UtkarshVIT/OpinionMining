Giovanni was very kind: he approached us in the corner of the taverna, catching my questioning glance at that strange group of young people sitting at the table in front of us.Some of them were Greeks, but others clearly weren't. "We are ornithologists, from different countries," Giovanni said quietly. "If you like, you can join us tomorrow morning where we ring the birds, in the fields over there."I vaguely remembered that Antikythera is a place where migrating birds rest on their way towards the African coast, but I didn't considered it when I chose this island as my destination: a tiny spot north-west of Crete, only a couple of little hamlets, goats everywhere, a bunch of rocks facing the sea, really off the beaten track.Antikythera catches you by surprise; as the ferry slips down the narrow channel and gently touches against the wharf, I'm still wondering how it can turn itself in such a little space."I'm not sure we need to climb over there," Maria Grazia told me, holding back our dog, crazy to run after wild goats that were totally unconcerned at our intrusion. We had left our car where the dirt track abruptly ended, and we were trying to find our way to the lighthouse, as there was no path to follow, nothing in view, but the brushes that keep pricking our legs.Presently we reached the base of the hill and suddenly we were able to see to the very end of Cape Apolytares. Getting to the lighthouse and bathing in the nearby crystalline water was an unexpected but welcome gift.Roaming around Xiropotamos beach brings you back to a time when a thriving city flourished here. Nearby, a wide scar in the rocks sloping down to the sea takes your breath away: it was carved by pirates to shelter and hide their ships and it makes you scan the horizon, as if there were an ancient vessel nearing, laden with loot.But nothing has been as nice as the warm hospitality of the villagers."What's this, a family gathering?" I asked Xaris, while he was placing a long table on the road in front of his taverna. "No, simply neighbours who want to enjoy a dinner together," he replied, smiling at my surprised gaze.They asked us to join and we shared our bottle of grappa, toasting together as if we were relatives coming from abroad to visit.
