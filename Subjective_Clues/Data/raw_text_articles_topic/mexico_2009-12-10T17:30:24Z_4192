A dispute over political asylum today hindered a plan to fly the ousted Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to exile in Mexico.The leftist leader was set to leave his Brazilian embassy refuge in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, in a deal with the country's de facto rulers which would have ended an at times surreal three-month siege.The plan unravelled after Zelaya insisted that he travel to Mexico as a "guest" rather than asylum seeker, as the latter category would curb his efforts to be reinstated as president.He told Honduran radio he would leave on condition he could continue political activities. "I want to leave as a distinguished guest, not as political refugee like the interim government wants."The de facto authorities withdrew their offer of safe passage when his terms became clear. There would be no further talks with Mexico and Brazil unless Zelaya accepted asylum, said Rene Zepeda, the information minister."If these countries want to get Zelaya out of Honduras, they will have to do it according to the law: by giving him asylum in their territories, but without a title. If that happens, our government will accept that and they can take him immediately without any problem."A Mexican government jet which was on its way to fetch the president was redirected to neighbouring El Salvador.Brazil condemned the de facto government's stance as an attempt to humiliate Zelaya. "It is totally unacceptable," said the foreign minister, Celso Amorim.The fiasco is the latest twist in a crisis which has bedevilled Latin America since soldiers rousted Zelaya from his bed on 28 June and bundled him into exile. The traditional ruling elite – the army, congress and the supreme court – had become alarmed at the president's alliance with Venezuela's socialist leader, Hugo Chávez.Zelaya snuck back into Honduras in September and surfaced at the Brazilian embassy. Security forces surrounded it, blasted music and recorded pig grunts, and dispersed pro-Zelaya supporters with clubs, teargas and water cannons, leaving the president marooned in his diplomatic refuge.His options have dwindled since a 29 November election cemented the coup as a political reality and chose a new president, Porfirio Lobo, who is due to be inaugurated next month. Congress rejected a proposal to allow Zelaya's temporary return to power to hand over the presidential sash.Brazil, Venezuela and other leftist governments in the region said they would not recognise the election but the US and several Latin American governments signalled they would work with Lobo, leaving Zelaya marginalised.A way out of the impasse seemed imminent last night when soldiers began clearing barriers from around the Brazilian embassy. The de facto regime said it would overlook corruption and treason charges to allow the president to leave.Zelaya said he would take the opportunity to leave Honduras – with his wife and two children – and seek a neutral site for a meeting with Lobo to "find a peaceful solution to the situation in the country". The president-elect has proposed an amnesty for Zelaya and the coup-plotters who deposed him.Before the exile deal collapsed Zelaya was reportedly expecting to meet Mexico's president, Felipe Calderón, and to attend a summit of leftist leaders in Cuba.
