China has been criticised in the past for keeping a news lid on natural disasters as they can have significant political implications. But times have changed and the powerful earthquake that struck Sichuan province in central China today received prominent coverage on Xinhua, the official state news agency.Wenchuan, an area with more than 110,000 people in the south-east part of the Tibetan-Qiang autonomous prefecture of Aba, is likely to be badly hit. Wenchuan also happens to be home to the Wolong nature reserve, China's leading research and breeding base for endangered giant pandas.Interestingly, news of the quake came not from the news agencies but apparently from Twitter, a networking service that allows people to communicate through the exchange of quick, frequent messages. Shanghaiist has good rolling coverage that includes video.The 7.8-magnitude quake, coming just three months before the Olympic games in Beijing, is exactly what the authorities had feared. Only in January, President Hu Jintao and the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, called for an improvement in earthquake contingency measures ahead of the games, which they hope to use to showcase China's international standing.Today's quake is the second major natural disaster to strike Asia in the space of a few weeks. Burma is grappling with the devastating aftermath of cyclone Nargis, where the death toll has been put at 100,000 by the UN. China has been coming under pressure from the west to persuade Burma to allow greater access by international relief agencies to hard-hit areas. China's attention will inevitably turn to its own natural disaster, which does not bode well for Burma.
