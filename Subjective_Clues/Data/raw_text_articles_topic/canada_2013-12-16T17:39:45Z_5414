Listen on VimeoIt would appear that 27 year-old Chantal Bellavance – budding actress, model, self-described 'fashionista sans budget' – is also a decent singer-songwriter, if her recently released four-track EP J’attends is anything to go by.J’attends hits you with a blast of retro-80′s influenced synthesiser-pop – four vignettes of bitter-sweet slices of life, love, despondency and disillusionment – that are nigh on perfect.And then there is Chantal’s crystal-clear voice, which rises and soars, never more so than on Qui – the EPs standout track – on which her laser-like vocals cut like a searchlight through the gloom.• More from Filles Sourires• East Brunswick All Girls Choir – Dirty Bird: New music from Australia• Midimode: New music from Russia
