Farmers in Egypt clashed yesterday with officials who had come to destroy their pigs. They blocked the roads and some hurled stones at trucks and bulldozers sent by the health ministry. The trouble broke out after the government ordered the slaughter of all pigs in Egypt amid a wave of hysteria about "swine" flu.The Mubarak regime's record in matters of public health and safety is a dismal one: more than 1,000 dead in a ferry disaster, more than 370 dead in a train fire, 50 dead in a theatre fire, plus treacherous roads, and buildings that fall down regularly on top of their occupants. Egypt also continues to have cases of bird flu – 26 people have died there since 2006, making it the worst-affected country outside Asia, where the disease originated.This time, though, the regime has acted with uncharacteristic haste – even before there is a single suspected case of the H1N1 virus in the country, either among humans or even pigs. But its decision to kill 300,000-400,000 pigs is not just costly. It is also pointless.As the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's chief veterinary officer put it yesterday, the cull is "a real mistake". "There is no reason to do that. It's not a swine influenza, it's a human influenza," he said. Time magazine has more, explaining why we shouldn't blame pigs.Not wishing to let science stand in the way of a rousing speech, members of the Egyptian parliament (whose upper house was carelessly wrecked by fire not so long ago) have been railing against the enemy within, and calling for pigs to be exterminated or removed from centres of population.IslamOnline, the Egyptian-based website supervised for doctrinal correctness by Yusuf al-Qaradawi, also joined in. According to an article in its health and science section, "Egypt has pig breeding farms located in heavily populated areas inside the capital Cairo. This means that in case of a swine flu epidemic, the flu will be rapidly transmitted to people living near the pig farms, then to others." The website also has a discussion forum where readers air their prejudices against pigs.There may or may not be an unspoken sub-text to all this but, as everyone in Egypt knows, pig-keeping is associated with the Christian minority who probably account for about 10% of the country's population (the actual figure is a state secret). For that reason, the response to swine flu ought to have been handled with care and sensitivity.Even if it was not intentional, the over-dramatic and obviously ill-planning decision to cull all pigs is likely to be interpreted by Christians as yet another assault on their community.It is not even clear if pig-keepers are to be properly compensated. Some have reportedly been paid $180 per pig after complaining. If repeated across the country, that would cost the government tens of millions of dollars which could be far better spent on other things.There are also hints, though, that the government may try to wriggle out of paying compensation – on the grounds that the dead pigs can be sold for human consumption. If that turns out to be the official line it could seriously damage community relations.Many of Egypt's pigs are kept in shacks in cities, in close proximity with humans (see picture here). Moving them away from centres of population may be a sensible public health policy regardless of the current flu outbreak but that will also destroy the livelihoods of many urban poor who survive by collecting waste to feed the pigs. If it is to be done, though, it will need care and planning to find alternative sources of income for those affected. Otherwise, as so often in Egypt, it is likely to make matters worse rather than better.
