A Singapore-based consortium has become the fifth group to lodge a formal takeover bid for Rangers. The offer, made on Friday, will now be considered by the club's administrators alongside those from the Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy, the Blue Knights consortium, Club 9 Sports and an as yet unnamed party.Representatives of the Chicago-based Club 9 Sports are expected to make a trip to Sunday's Old Firm game at Ibrox. Despite Kennedy earlier having made sceptical noises about the likelihood of him gaining control of Rangers, he is already thought to have spent about Â£200,000 on his bid.Paul Clark, Rangers' joint administrator, said: "What we want to do is analyse the bids and I would suggest we will be moving to a shortlist that might be two or three bidders at some point next week."Clark reaffirmed his desire for Rangers to exit administration promptly. "Our preference would be for somebody else to be in control of the football club other than us by the end of the season," he said,"so they have got the whole close season, the whole transfer window, they have got proper preparation for the new season."The administrator expressed frustration with the Scottish Premier League, which is conducting an investigation into allegations that Rangers have made undisclosed payments to players."We have written to the SPL asking why it is necessary at this time to conduct an inquiry," Clark said. "They have known about the issue for some time, we still don't have the [tax] tribunal's decision and we would like to understand why they feel they need the inquiry now."We will of course continue to co-operate with all the footballing authorities but with everything else that's going on it is a bit of an unnecessary hindrance for us when we still await the tribunal's decision."It is something we share the fans' frustration on, there's other work we could be getting on with. The tribunal has not yet confirmed Rangers is responsible so therefore why do the SPL feel they need to look at it? If they wanted to look at it, why didn't they look at it at the time it was going on?"
