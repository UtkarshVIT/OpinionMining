The Taliban has claimed responsibility for a bomb attack on a US convoy in Peshawar, the first attack on Americans in Pakistan since the death of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden on 2 May.A bystander was killed and 12 people, two of them American, were wounded when a blast hit two armoured vehicles as they travelled to the US consulate, which is believed to house a largeCIA station."We had warned that we will avenge the martyrdom of Osama," a Taliban spokesman, Ahsanullah Ahsan, told Associated Press in a phone call from an undisclosed location. "We say to the Americans and Nato that we will carry out more deadly attacks and we can do it."A US embassy spokesman said the Americans were not seriously hurt. Declan Walsh IslamabadHe did not identify their function, but a police superintendent, Ijaz Khan, said two US security guards were being treated at an American medical facility.The attack took place in University Town, a wealthy neighbourhood inhabited by westerners. US officials said a Taliban suicide bomber had rammed his motorbike into one of the US vehicles. Television pictures showed a white bulletproof jeep that had crashed into an electricity pylon.It was not the first reprisal for Bin Laden's death claimed by the Taliban. A week ago, two suicide bombers killed at least 91 recruits and wounded 100 outside a military training centre in Shabqadar, 10 miles north of Peshawar. On Wednesday. more than 100 heavily armed militants stormed a checkpost on the outskirts of Peshawar, triggering a gunfight that left two police and 15 militants dead.The attack was credited to Lashkar-i-Islam, a criminal-militant group that holds sway in parts of the nearby Khyber tribal agency.Meanwhile, in Islamabad, US officials are trying to patch up their battered relationship with Pakistan's military and intelligence services while refusing to promise that the US will not carry out another unilateral raid similar to the one that killed Bin Laden.On Thursday, the US regional envoy, Marc Grossman, and the CIA deputy chief, Michael Morrell, held meetings with the Pakistan army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, and the head of Pakistani intelligence.Pakistan's military and civilian leaders have expressed outrage and described the Navy Seals' raid in Abbottabad, 35 miles north of Islamabad, as a gross violation of sovereignty. The storm of anger has also served to obscure pressing questions about how Bin Laden managed to shelter inside Pakistan for at least six years.The US is pressing Pakistan to take action against other militant leaders including the al-Qaida number two, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Sirajuddin Haqqani, a militant warlord responsible for multiple attacks on western forces in Afghanistan.Meanwhile the CIA is combing a trove of computer disks seized from Bin Laden's house for intelligence on al-Qaida militants and future plots.US officials are also checking the computers for any "smoking gun" – an indication that Bin Laden was being sheltered by Pakistani officials – but say that, so far, no such proof has emerged. Some intelligence gleaned from the disks has already been shared with Pakistan.The highly protected Peshawar consulate, believed to house a major CIA station that assists with drone strikes in the nearby tribal belt, has been hit by the Taliban before.In August 2008, the consul general survived a gun attack on her armoured vehicle as she left her house. In April 2010 militants launched a grenade and gunfire attack on the consulate, killing eight people including security guards but no Americans.
