Brazil looked to have fallen short of electing its first female president last night, with Dilma Rousseff appearing to have to go into to a second round run-off.With 90% of votes counted, Rousseff had in the region of 46%; to win outright she would have needed more than 50%. One "well-placed" source within the Rousseff camp told Reuters there was "no way" she would take the first round, although Rouseff, a former guerrilla, had the backing of the retiring president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.Her rival, the Social Democrat Jose Serra, had just over 33%, while Marina Silva, an Amazon-born Green party candidate, had 20%. Silva, a former rubber-tapper who was environment minister before she quit Lula's Workers' party in 2009, has had a surge in support, particularly in the cities.More than 135 million Brazilians went to the polls yesterday to elect senators, state governors, MPs and a president. While Rousseff, 62, Lula's former chief of staff, enjoys the support of the hugely popular leftwing leader, she lacks the charisma and recognition of her political mentor.Some voters are unsure of her name, while many refer to her simply as "Lula's woman".One Rio de Janeiro voter told the Guardian this week he planned to vote for Lula's candidate, "Telma".Early yesterday Lula appeared to admit the possibility of a second round; he first ran for the presidency in 1989 but was elected only in 2002. "I didn't win any election in the first round," he told reporters. He played down the consequences of a run-off saying it would merely give Rousseff another "30 days to fight".Commentators, however, suggest many Silva voters could shift to Serra rather than Rousseff.On the eve of the election, the Workers' party (PT) members and candidates insisted they were still confident of a first-round victory, despite the fall-out of a recent corruption scandal involving politicians close to Rousseff that appears to have dented her support.Vladimir Palmeira, one of the founders of the PT and a candidate for Brazil's Congress in Rio de Janeiro, said a Rousseff victory would give Brazil "another eight years of centre-left, if not exactly left-wing government in Brazil."
