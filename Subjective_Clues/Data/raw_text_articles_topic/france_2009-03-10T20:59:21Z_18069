EU finance ministers today gave the go-ahead for France to slash the cost of restaurant meals via a cut in VAT to 5.5% in a move to boost consumer confidence and spending as the European economy faces its worst slump for 80 years.The decision to allow reduced VAT for a range of services ended 10 years of stalemate. It came as Axel Weber, Bundesbank president and a European Central Bank hawk, called for eurozone interest rates to be cut further, to 1%, and an Italian colleague held out the prospect of zero borrowing costs.Yesterday's meeting of ministers, disrupted when Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the doors of the council of ministers' building, took place as internal documents pointed to a darkening and hugely unstable outlook, with no prospect of recovery before 2010.The breakthrough on reduced VAT came after German finance minister Peer Steinbrück lifted his long-standing resistance to suggestions raised by French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his predecessor, Jacques Chirac. Rules allowing limited VAT cuts for services ranging from hairdressing to DIY were due to run out in 2010.Steinbrück, a fierce critic of Britain's overall VAT cut to 15%, said he was "trying to be helpful … to a very, very limited extent", while aides to Alistair Darling welcomed the move. Britain levies a 5% rate on some services and goods.The chancellor also welcomed the go-ahead for the UK to extend its use of "reverse charging" on the sales tax for a further two years in the battle against VAT fraud.This mechanism, designed to stamp out "carousel" fraud by traders claiming but never paying the tax, means that it is levied only at the final stage of a transaction. The fraud costs the exchequer billions of pounds a year.Finance ministers also endorsed the option of charging lower VAT on "green" goods and services as a way of promoting a more sustainable economy and fighting climate change. But NGO campaigners on development issues assailed them for failing to alleviate the financial problems of poorer countries in trying to "decarbonise" their ailing economies.Weber, meanwhile, made plain that the ECB, which cut rates last week to 1.5%, had room for manoeuvre to cut them again to 1% but rejected the notion of zero rates. The eurozone central bank cut its forecast to a 2.7% economic contraction this year and zero growth in 2010.He said in Frankfurt: "We now expect that the banks will hand over these favourable conditions quickly and clearly to consumers and companies." But Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the ECB's board, said zero rates could be required if the economic horizon darkened even further.Steinbrück, insisting that no eurozone member faced payment difficulties or the risk of default, rejected calls from within the Obama administration for even greater stimulus programmes and further injections of capital into IMF reserves.As Romania confirmed it was seeking EU and IMF aid of about $20bn to help it out of a growing financial crisis, ministers rejected calls for increased support for eastern European members of the bloc.
