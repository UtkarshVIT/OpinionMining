Professor Tom Lodge (Letters, 3 October) disputes the statement in my letter (1 October) that “the Stasi did not ...torture its perceived enemies, even if it was often heavy-handed and unjust”. He quotes Anna Funder’s Stasiland – the one book invariably quoted, although written by an Australian, now resident in the US, and based entirely on second-hand evidence. Lodge says the “torture facilities” in the Hohenschönhausen prison were “purpose-built by the Russians”. It was certainly used as a prison and transit camp by the Russians for Nazis at the end of the war and was later taken over and extended by the GDR in the 1950s. “In this place,” Lodge says, “torture was routine and systematic.”While I don’t want to become drawn into defending the state security forces of the GDR, which were certainly very often an oppressive and ugly organisation, I do still dispute that “torture was systematic and routine”. There is a significant difference between harsh prison conditions and torture as a technique of interrogation and oppression, but by comparison with the Nazis, or even the US use of water-boarding and hooding etc, there is little evidence of the Stasi being as bad or worse.Well-known GDR dissidents, like the environmentalist Rudolf Bahro, the publisher Walter Janka, the philosopher Wolfgang Harich and artist Bärbel Bohley, were imprisoned in Hohenschönhausen in unjustifiable and harsh conditions, but none, as far as I am aware, alleged any form of horrific torture. While the Federal Republic was extremely reticent after the war in condemning the Nazis for the horrors they committed, and even gave many of the perpetrators their jobs back, it is determined to demonise the GDR, not simply to confront its failings or forms of oppression, but to vilify the whole idea of an alternative and socialist German state.John GreenLondon
