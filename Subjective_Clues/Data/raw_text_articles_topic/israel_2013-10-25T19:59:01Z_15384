The Guardian editorial (22 October) referred to low voting percentages by Palestinians in the recent municipal elections in Jerusalem, and equated the phenomenon with voting trends of Arab-Israeli citizens in national elections, in order to depict a general trend of low participation by both groups. In reality, voting among Arab-Israelis in this week's municipal elections stood at nearly 90%, reflecting this group's ongoing, active and flourishing participation in Israeli democracy. Moreover, the "fascinating thought experiment" presented by the Guardian – suggesting a one-state solution which would effectively erase the Jewish character of the state of Israel – does nothing to support the Israelis and Palestinians who are engaged in a peace process aimed at achieving a two-state solution.Yiftah CurielSpokesperson, Embassy of Israel
