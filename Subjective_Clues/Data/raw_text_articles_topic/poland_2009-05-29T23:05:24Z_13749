I have tried for five months to get a refund­ for a Nokia mobile phone ordered from www.mobilephonesuk.net which never turned up. Can you help? AS, OxfordshireThe phone cost £224, using a Polish credit card, and should have been sent to a relative's address in Warsaw before­ Christmas. But despite registered letters­ and other attempts, the recipient is still phoneless.What seems to have happened is that the Leicestershire-based firm did not understand the Polish version of Warsaw. It assumed this was in the UK. As a result, the phone went back to Leicestershire as "undeliverable". It has now cancelled the deal, so your credit card will be reimbursed.We welcome letters but regret we cannot answer individually.
