The wave of violence against journalists in Mexico appears to have no end, with three more disturbing incidents in a week.Marco Antonio López Ortiz, information chief for the newspaper Novedades Acapulco, was kidnapped by armed men on 7 June. After years as a tranquil tourist destination, Acapulco has become a battlefield for rival drug gangs. Carlos de Jesús Rodríguez, director of the news site Gobernantes.com, was arrested in Veracruz and beaten by police who falsely accused him of assaulting a woman. Freed without charge, he was admitted to hospital and reported to to be fighting for his life due to his injuries. His website said that Rodríguez had previously been threatened.In a third incident, the body of newspaper columnist Noel López Olguín, who disappeared on 8 March, was found in a secret grave.The body was found after a captured drug leader allegedly confessed to the killing and gave police the location of the grave.These attacks coincide with the publication of a report from PEN Canada and the International Human Rights Programme (IHRP) at the University of Toronto that accused the Mexican government of being complicit in crimes against the press in a country where roughly 70 journalists have been killed since 2000.See this Knight Centre map for more details about threats against journalists in Mexico.Sources: Knight Centre/CPJ/PEN Canada
