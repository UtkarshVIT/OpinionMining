Thousands of girls and women in Argentina suffer needlessly because they cannot access contraception, legal abortion and other reproductive health care services, a Human Rights Watch report said today.An obstacle course of prejudice and shoddy or absent services forced many to seek illegal and often unsafe abortions, it stated. The findings challenged the country's image as a progressive beacon in South America.The report, Illusions of Care: Lack of Accountability for Reproductive Rights in Argentina, said some 40% of pregnancies ended in abortion – one of the world's highest rates – because laws guaranteeing free and universal contraception were ignored."The laws are in place but they have been systematically flouted by hospitals and doctors across the country who refuse, either through ignorance of the law or personal decision, to provide access," said Marianne Mollmann, one of the report's authors.Given abortion is illegal it is shocking that there are an estimated 500,000 annual abortions, with many women suffering health problems because of botched procedures, said Mollmann. "That is a clear indicator of how badly the government is failing to provide universal access to contraception."There is an exception for women who state that they have been raped, but many doctors insisted on a court order before operating, said Silvia Oizerovich, a health official from Buenos Aires . "Doctors don't understand that for a legal abortion you don't need to go to a court."Barriers to reproductive care included long delays, unnecessary referrals to other clinics, demands for spousal permission contrary to law, financial costs and in some cases outright refusal of treatment."Women need dependable care throughout their reproductive lives," said José Miguel Vivanco, the director of Americas' Human Rights Watch. "But in Argentina, it's more like a lottery: you might be lucky enough to get decent care but you are more likely to be stuck with deficient or even abusive services.President Cristina Kirchner's administration won liberal plaudits last month when Argentina became Latin America's first country to legalise gay marriage but critics said pressure from the Catholic church and conservative groups continued to curb reproductive rights."The government has a double message. It's big on human rights but it hasn't managed to consolidate women's rights," said Mabel Bianco, of the Foundation for Study and Research on Women advocacy group.Contraception became legal in 1985 but some husbands beat up their wives if they discovered them using contraception, said Mollman. "The problem is that many people who still believe contraception programmes should not exist."
