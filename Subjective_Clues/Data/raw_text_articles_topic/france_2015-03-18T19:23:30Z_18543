Jessica Reed (Opinion, 14 March) offers a thoughtful view of the French-speakers’ dilemma: she argues the case for linguistic diversity, while admitting the need for the language to preserve its special genius. Speakers of Breton, Occitan, Corsican and Catalan may read this with a hollow laugh. Millions of native French people are made to feel ashamed of speaking their native language. Since the 1790s, the French government has waged a campaign of extermination against the regional languages of France, first refusing to teach them, then starving them of funds and banning them in the public sphere. Their very existence is often denied – to the point where Breton and Occitan are claimed to be merely bad French, spoken by the ignorant. That they are still spoken by up to 60% in some localities is little short of a marvel. If Ms Pellerin (and Ms Reed) are serious about diversity, they might ask the French to stop quivering every time someone says le weekend, and instead comply with the terms of the European charter for regional or minority languages (ECRML), signed in 1999, but not yet acted on.Dr Dick CollinsCrediton, Devon
