That the Israeli border police has its fair share of racist thugs in its ranks is no surprise. Nor is the fact that these wayward troops routinely abuse and harass those unfortunate Palestinians who stray into their path. However, that video footage of the crimes taking place are then willingly uploaded on to YouTube without a second thought is extraordinary, even by their low standards, displaying the utter nonchalance with which the perpetrators go about boasting of their misdeeds, and their self-assured belief that they are above the law.Israel's security forces are certainly not the most moral in the world, despite routine choruses of claims to the contrary – but nor are they the least moral either. The disgrace of the Abu Ghraib affair tarnished the image of allied troops irrevocably; likewise the behaviour of troops gone wild from Russia to Colombia to Sri Lanka amply demonstrates that all forces have a major problem keeping in line the wildest members of their flock. But for a country that consistently tries to brand its armed forces as being the bastion of decency, time and again evidence emerges telling a different story – and with each photo or film released, it becomes harder and harder for the Israeli authorities to brush the issue under the carpet.This week, B'Tselem was the deserved recipient of the One World Media award for its groundbreaking Shooting Back campaign, in which Palestinians are given video cameras to document the abuse they suffer at the hands of soldiers and settlers alike. Yet, with the likes of the rogue border police film-makers on hand to disseminate footage of their own handiwork, B'Tselem's job is being done for them – and, as usual, the official reaction has been muted, to say the least.Rather than promise to come down on the guilty parties like a tonne of bricks, the response from officials was to simply state that the inquiries into the videos were "continuing", before stressing "The border police has made it a personal mission to uphold values of maintaining respect for people and their rights, and the members of the force are taught to respect those values" – a pretty empty claim in the wake of such incriminating proof to the contrary.The video showing the humiliation of the youth forced to slap himself and curse Palestine is guaranteed to play right into the hands of the very same militant groups from whom the border police are meant to be defending Israel's citizens. As recruiting tools go, the Abu Ghraib photos were second to none in rallying anti-western Iraqi insurgents; likewise, footage such as this can only encourage more Palestinians to take up arms to defend their people's honour from the likes of the savage Israeli forces. In the internet age, it is inevitable that any linkable photo or film of such incendiary value will be circulated round the globe within hours of release, and for the forces in question not to even consider this consequence only compounds their guilt for having carried out such an atrocity in the first place.As ever, when it comes to the apologists in Israel who seek to defend Israeli forces from any criticism, their stance rings hollow as soon as the shoe is placed on the other foot. Whenever proof emerges of rank racism and abuse in the Arab world – such as the vile torture video from Abu Dhabi or, closer to home, the Ramallah lynching of Israeli soldiers – arch conservatives scramble aboard a bandwagon of condemnation, using the evidence as fuel for the fires of separatism and confrontation that they keep ever-burning. But as soon as dirty Israeli laundry is aired in public, suddenly it's a different story, and the truth is buried under a deluge of excuses and pretexts in order to maintain Israel's image as whiter than white.Similar obfuscation was displayed after the release of the shocking "Feeling the hate in Jerusalem" video documentary – a barrage of hair-splitting followed, combined with a concerted and partially successful effort to block websites from showing the offensive footage. Had the video showed diaspora Palestinians screaming racist obscenities and antisemitic slogans into a camera, Zionist groups around the world would have – rightly – been up in arms. Such is the duplicity when it comes to the Middle East conflict: sauce for the goose is never sauce for the gander, and while the hypocrisy remains, the only winners are the extremists on either side.
