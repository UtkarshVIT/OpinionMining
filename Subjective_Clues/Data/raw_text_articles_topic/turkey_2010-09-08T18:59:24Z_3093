A "union-busting" US company has been employed by a leading UK turkey processing factory where workers are due to vote on union recognition tomorrow.Staff at the company in Derby, the second-biggest turkey supplier in the UK, have been engaged in what union officials call a "bitter struggle" for recognition over the past year. Now it has emerged that the firm – Cranberry Foods – has hired the Burke Group, which calls itself a labour relations consultant offering "union-free" and "union avoidance" strategies."This group's existence and profits depend on its ability to undermine workers' right to organise," said Sharon Graham, director of organising at Unite. "Workers are being led to believe that joining the union will lead to all sorts of terrible outcomes and drive the company out of business. It is taking labour relations back a long, long way."Cranberry Foods denied "inappropriate and unethical practices", saying it was involved in a "democratic process" before the ballot and adding that it respected the right of workers to join trades unions. "Where a majority of a workplace are in favour of being represented by a trade union, we are pleased to respect that majority," the company said in a statement.Cranberry Foods did not answer questions about the involvement of the Burke Group (TBG) but a letter from the joint managing director to Unite confirmed it had "engaged" the company.It added: "Cranberry Foods and TBG share the same goals in this recognition ballot: to respect each individual's legal right to belong to any trade union if they wish: it is a personal matter. To ensure that all eligible voters have the opportunity to make an informed choice about recognition through a secret ballot."Workers in favour of union recognition, many of them migrants from eastern Europe, said the campaign for a no vote had intensified in recent months. Speaking on condition of anonymity, they said:• they had been warned by supervisors that the company could go bankrupt if the union won recognition;• they had been told that if it did survive the union would stop them doing overtime;• they had received a leaflet warning that the cost of joining the union could go up ;• staff had been called to one-to-one meetings with supervisors at which they were asked about their views on trade unions."A lot of people feel under pressure because of what the company is doing," said one Lithuanian worker.Union leaders say the campaign bears all the hallmarks of an organised anti-union campaign.Labour MP Jim Sheridan described the involvement of "union-busting" firms in the UK as a scandal. "These companies are taking labour relations back years and years," he said. "They are just interested in profits and are determined to prevent workers getting union recognition. It is one of my bitter regrets that we did not manage to pass legislation during the labour government to prevent these activities."The Burke Group declined to respond to questions about its involvement with Cranberry Foods. On its website, under the banner "Mission statement: staying union free", the company says: "One of the challenges we have faced within organisations is that frontline supervisors or leaders either don't know or can't articulate the value to the organisation and therefore employees, of staying union free."It goes on to list the arguments supervisors at successful companies have used to show what "is at risk if an employer loses its union free advantage", including: loss of flexibility to respond quickly to an increasingly changing world; changes the relationship between the supervision and employees; introduces the possibility of interruption of service or production due to work stoppage; many times after a union gets in, a significant number of the best workers are either forced or choose to leave.Cranberry Foods has a turnover of £82m and supplies some of the country's leading supermarkets. Workers who spoke to the Guardian said they were backing the union in an attempt to get more control over their working lives."We just want the right to defend our jobs and our colleagues' jobs," said one.
