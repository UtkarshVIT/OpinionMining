Securing water for our mines and the communities who live close to our operations is one of our strategic commitments around sustainability. Our aim is to maximise the value of water resources while seeking to achieve no long term net harm to the environment or communities where we operate.Nowhere is this more important than in Chile's Atacama Desert, one of the world's driest regions and home to our Mantoverde copper mine. The mine is dependent on the Copiapó aquifer for all of its water, but the Copiapó watershed region has a serious water shortage and was decreed a permanent water shortage area in 2011. That decree enables the government to take all necessary measures to overcome the emergency and make sure people receive drinking water. The government has drawn up short, medium and long-term plans in collaboration with public and private stakeholders, including Anglo American.Mantoverde is building a water desalination plant which will help to improve the critical water shortage in the region. The plant will meet Mantoverde's water needs and represents an opportunity to make a real difference in the Atacama region. By eliminating our own requirements from the watershed, we will significantly reduce the demand on this vital resource while also presenting community investment opportunities through the development of the desalination plant. Located in the Corral de los Chanchos Bay, in the Chañaral district, the $96 million plant will have a water production rate of 120 litres per second and a predicted life of 20 years. Start-up is scheduled for 2013 and the 20 month planned construction project will provide an estimated 150 jobs.Environmental protection measures are being addressed and constant dialogue with social organisations, neighbours' associations, fishermen's trade unions, public bodies and the municipality of Chañaral has ensured that community concerns have been considered at every stage of development.Last year, we signed an agreement with representatives of five unions of independent workers in the Chañaral area to address fishermen's concerns about the impact of the construction project for the desalination plant. The unions representing the fishermen form part of the Desalination Plant Work Table, an initiative set up to reach consensus between our business and the project's stakeholders concerning the construction of the plant and its impact on the community. Mantoverde will compensate local fishermen for temporary restricted access to the bay during construction of the plant by financing projects in entrepreneurship, social development and education.Nelson Guzman, a representative of the local fishermen said: "We realise that Anglo American is a trustworthy company we can work with and that it doesn't cut corners in helping us with our needs; either in terms of the days when we cannot access the bay and in aiding us with our own economic activities. We aren't just receiving money but also training."Rodrigo Aguila, the desalination project's construction manager, said: "This initiative is a fine example to follow, because there was serious work behind the agreement that today shows its benefits and demonstrates that the community and private sector can work together."In addition to the plant, Anglo American has agreed with the Ministry of Public Works to ensure the availability of drinking water for the nearby communities of Copiapó, Caldera and Chañaral. As part of the agreement, Anglo American will allow the Ministry to provide the water company ECONSSA a free five-year contract for the use of half of our groundwater rights in the Copiapó aquifer.Edgardo Riffo, general manager of the Mantoverde mine, said: "Our agreement with the Ministry of Public Works shows that we are committed to assuring the supply of fresh drinking water for the community. Together with the construction of the desalination plant, these are important contributions to addressing the water shortage in Copiapó."Content on this page is provided by Anglo American, sponsor of the social impact hub
