OK! magazine will launch a Spanish-language edition later this year, striking into the heartland of rival celebrity weekly Hello!.Parent company Northern & Shell and Spanish publisher Grupo Zeta will form joint venture company OK! Ediciones to publish the 16th international edition of OK! in four years.Rival Hello! magazine was first published as ¡Hola! in Spain."Having a Spanish edition has long been an ambition of ours. Spain is the original home of celebrity publishing, but most existing titles have an aging and dwindling readership. It's exciting for us to bring to market an approach that is proven to appeal to younger readers," said Christian Toksvig, the Northern & Shell international operations director."OK! magazine is taking on its downmarket rival Hello! in its home territory by launching an edition in Spain," is how the Daily Express, also owned by Northern & Shell, reported the development today.Grupo Zeta launched Cuore, the third best-selling magazine in Spain, in 2006. Established in 1976, Cuore publishes a dozen daily newspapers and more than 40 magazines including news weekly Tiempo.After it starts publishing in Spain later this year, OK! will appear in 18 countries.Earlier this month, OK! launched in Turkey.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
