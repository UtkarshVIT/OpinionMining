An Iraqi journalist reporting for the satellite television station al-Ittijah, whose name has not been released, was among those killed in a blast that targeted a celebration in Ramadi.The killing occurred a week after another Iraqi journalist was shot dead in Mosul by a group of unidentified men.Over the weekend, a number of reporters were detained during and after their coverage of the mass demonstrations that took place in central Baghdad's al-Tahrir Square.They said they were handcuffed, blindfolded, beaten and threatened by security forces while held in custody for nine hours. It was the latest in a series of repressive measures adopted by security forces in order to stifle media reports about the current political and social unrest.Qassim Atta, the head of Baghdad Operations Command, later issued an apology for the way journalists were treated. He said that the arrests and beatings "were not intentional" and were "errors committed by security forces." Sources: IPI/CPR
