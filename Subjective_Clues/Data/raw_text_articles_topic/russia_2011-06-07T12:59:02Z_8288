The organisers of the 2014 winter Olympics in the Russian resort city of Sochi last month appointed EF Education First, the Swiss-based language training provider, as the official supplier of language training for the event, with the task of teaching English to up to 70,000 Olympic staff, volunteers and tourist-sector workers.Work is already under way to build stadiums and transport infrastructure from scratch in the coastal city and neighbouring alpine resort. But with the games expected to attract tens of thousands of international visitors the organisers must now ensure that language is not a final barrier to success.English will be the lingua franca of the games, not only among officials and athletes but also on the streets of Sochi, a city that hopes to make its mark on the international tourist map. But with the 1,000-day countdown to the opening of the games in February 2014 now started, the challenge of turning everyone from trackside judges to city taxi drivers into confident users of English is daunting.According to Bernard Shearer, head of EF in Russia, his company has a proven track record in delivering large-scale English programmes.EF links to the Olympics date back to the 1988 games in Seoul, and more recently it was responsible for training 6,000 Olympic officials in advance of the Beijing games in 2008.It was contracted to train up to 60,000 staff in the build up to the 2010 Asian games in Guanghzou, China, and it is currently working with Brazil's ministry of tourism to deliver English and Spanish training through the Olá Turista programme to 80,000 people a year working in the hospitality sector in preparation for the 2014 football World Cup.EF kicked off its campaign for the Sochi games last month with the launch of a website offering daily English lessons and winter Olympics-themed vocabulary.From 2012 it will launch dedicated English language teaching for 7,500 Sochi 2014 organising committee staff, 25,000 volunteers, to be recruited from across Russia and up to 35,000 suppliers and contractors.EF opened its first language school in Russia in the mid-1990s and now has 33 schools in 11 cities. But Shearer says that it would be impossible to achieve its target through face-to-face teaching alone."The biggest challenge for us is geography. We are dealing with 25,000 volunteers spread across Russia's nine time zones," he said.So most of the teaching will be delivered online through EF's establish web portal Englishtown. Learners will be able to log on to the standard Englishtown lessons to develop general English communication skills and access additional specialist language depending on their roles."We are at an early stage of the project in terms of establishing the language profiles of the staff," Shearer said. But he anticipates that most users will need to focus on general communication skills."We found that Olympic judges in Beijing needed general communication skills. They needed to work on their technical language in English, but at least they had the platform of being able to understand that core language."Svetlana Ter-Minasova, dean of modern languages at Moscow State University and one of Russia's leading ELT experts, is optimistic about EF's involvement in the Sochi 2014 Olympic programme and thinks that younger learners especially will benefit from the quality of EF content."There is huge demand for English among young people but it exceeds the supply of good quality teaching," she said.Of the optional foreign languages in the state school curriculum English is by far the most popular, she says, but recent education reforms have meant that raising standards of teaching and materials has not been a priority.EF's focus on online training could be a test of stamina for Olympic learners. Shearer admits that awareness of the internet as a medium for learning remains low in Russia."People still have an outdated understanding of distance learning via the internet. But our online school has developed enormously, with live teachers available 24 hours a day and mobile technology. We now have to communicate that message to the public."In Brazil, the Olá Turista programme combines online lessons with face-to-face learning in training hubs in 11 cities. But Graeme Hodgson, a former director of ELT at the British Council in Brazil, who now works for the Cultura Inglesa language schools chain, says that the World Cup has created a new niche of students in the service sector who want rapid acquisition of basic spoken communication skills."I'm not convinced people will have either the motivation or the time to go to face-to-face sessions, nor indeed is the track record of fully online courses very good, with dropout rates often reaching 60 or 70%," Hodgson said.It also remains to be seen whether the organisers of the Sochi games, even with EF's help, will be able to generate and sustain the level of English language learning that has preceded recent major sporting events in China such as the Beijing Olympics.Bob Adamson of Hong Kong's Institute of Education says those government-led campaigns helped to boost the status of spoken English."They contributed to the perception that English is a high status language in China – a language that can provide access to economic resources and social mobility," Adamson said.But the lasting impact on skills levels of China's pre-event training is questionable, says Brendan O'Kane, a US linguist and long-term resident of Beijing."A lot of training was targeted at people in the service industry, especially cab drivers. My sense is that very little of that training stuck. Once the Olympics were over things went back to normal," O'Kane said.
