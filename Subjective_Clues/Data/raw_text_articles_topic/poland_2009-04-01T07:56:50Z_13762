People with sleep problems are more likely to try to commit suicide – or to think about it – than those who regularly get a good night's rest, according to a new study.Lack of sleep is frequently associated with depression and other mental disorders, but it has not often been studied as a possible reason for people feeling suicidal, say psychiatrists at the World Psychiatric Association's international congress today.Their research established that the more sleep problems people had, the more likely they were to contemplate suicide.They studied people who woke up in the early hours of the morning at least two hours before the alarm went off, those who said they could not get to sleep when they went to bed, and those who kept waking in the night."People with two or more sleep symptoms were 2.6 times more likely to report a suicide attempt than those without any insomnia complaints," said the study's leader, Dr Marcin Wojnar, research fellow at the department of psychiatry at the University of Michigan and associate professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of Warsaw, in Poland.According to the World Health Organisation, approximately 877,000 people kill themselves every year and 10 to 40 times as many attempt suicide. Wojnar thinks that paying attention to people with disrupted sleep patterns could help to reduce the toll."Identifying those at high risk of suicide is important for preventing it, and these findings indicate that insomnia may be a modifiable risk factor for suicide in the general population," Wojnar said."This has implications for public health, as the presence of sleep problems should alert doctors to assess such patients for a heightened risk of suicide, even if they don't have a psychiatric condition. Our findings also raise the possibility that addressing sleep problems could reduce the risk of suicidal behaviours."Scientists and doctors have known there is a link between sleep problems and suicide, but have not been sure which comes first – the mental health problem or the exhaustion that comes from sleepless nights.The study was carried out with the involvement of 5,692 American volunteers, a third of whom (35%) reported at least one of the three sleep problems during the previous year.The people most affected were those who woke up too early in the morning. They were twice as likely as those with no sleep problems to have had suicidal thoughts in the preceding 12 months, 2.1 times more likely to have planned suicide and 2.7 times more likely to have tried to kill themselves.Those who found it hard to fall asleep were more likely than those who slept well to think about killing themselves and to make plans. Those who kept waking in the night and took an hour or more to get back to sleep had a raised risk of thinking about suicide and attempting it.Scientists do not know why sleep deprivation increases suicide risk, but they think that it may cause the brain to work less well, leading to poorer judgment, less impulse control and increased feelings of hopelessness.
