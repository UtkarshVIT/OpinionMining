North Korea has announced its first satellite launch in three years, throwing into doubt a recent deal with the US that had aimed to end years of tension.The US state department said the trial was "highly provocative" and would breach North Korea's international obligations. Many see it as a test of missile technology.The bilateral deal, which involves food aid in exchange for nuclear concessions, was hammered out barely two weeks ago. Washington greeted it as a first step towards reducing regional strains.Relations deteriorated sharply after Pyongyang's last such launch in 2009, which prompted condemnation from the UN security council and a tightening of sanctions. While North Korea said it was engaged in a peaceful space programme, others said it had breached resolutions against nuclear and ballistic missile activity.The launch technology for missiles and satellites is near-identical, say experts. Pyongyang announced the satellite would be launched between 12-16 April to mark the centenary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the country's founder and grandfather of its leader, Kim Jong-un.North Korea has promoted the anniversary as the point at which it emerges as a strong and prosperous country. But strikingly it pledged "maximum transparency" and vowed not to affect neighbouring countries, in unusually emollient language."Legally, Pyongyang is within its rights to launch a satellite. But politically, this announcement is a slap in the face to the Americans," said John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University. "If Pyongyang is serious about building a new relationship with the United States, they need to take concrete steps to demonstrate this is in fact a satellite launch, and that would include inviting monitors."State news agency KCNA said the launch of the indigenously developed Kwangmyongsong-3 "earth observation satellite" followed research "in line with the government's policy for space development and peaceful use", citing a spokesman for the Korean committee for space technology.It will be launched by an Unha-3 rocket. The Unha-2 is better known outside the country as the Taepodong-2, a long-range missile. But last year the publication Jane's Strategic Weapons Systems said the Taepodong-3 might have been developed either to achieve a longer range or to launch satellites.KCNA added: "A safe flight orbit has been chosen so that carrier rocket debris to be generated during the flight would not have any impact on neighbouring countries."The DPRK will strictly abide by relevant international regulations and usage concerning the launch of scientific and technological satellites for peaceful purposes and ensure maximum transparency, thereby contributing to promoting international trust and co-operation in the field of space scientific researches and satellite launches."South Korea's foreign ministry called the move "a grave provocation".In Japan, the chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, said the country had set up a taskforce to monitor the situation and was co-operating with the US and South Korea, adding: "We believe a launch would be a move to interfere with our effort toward a dialogue, and we strongly urge North Korea not to carry out a satellite launch.""They are trying to kill two birds with one stone – keeping North Koreans proud and elated while the US has no particular reason to protest since inspectors are going to be admitted to nuclear facilities [under the recent deal]," said Leonid Petrov, lecturer in Korean studies at the University of Sydney."Of course it's a risky move, because technically they are violating the security council injunction, but it looks like they know what they are doing."He suggested they might expect a reprimand but think they would be safe from more stringent action because the US was seeking to improve relations.But Daniel Pinkston of the International Crisis Group said: "I can't see how the US is going to deliver this food aid … I think this is going to kill it."He suggested the launch would underline North Korea's military capabilities and reinforce the position of its new leader. He also thought a nuclear test could follow; one took place shortly after the last satellite launch.In the agreement struck in Beijing last month, North Korea agreed to suspend nuclear missile tests and uranium enrichment, and submit to international monitoring, in return for substantial US food aid.Hillary Clinton described the deal as a "modest first step".Park Young-ho of the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, a government-affiliated thinktank, told Reuters the satellite announcement could be interpreted as "a means of applying pressure on the Americans in negotiations and a celebration of the founder's birth as well as an opportunity for the new leadership to celebrate the beginning of a new era".Pyongyang hailed its 2009 test as a success.But both US and South Korean officials said no satellite made it into orbit, although the rocket travelled twice as far - 1,900 miles (3,000km) - as previous tests had managed.
