China has executed two men for abducting and selling 15 children, many of whom have yet to be reunited with their families, state media reported today.Thousands of children go missing each year in China, although authorities have recently stepped up efforts to tackle the problem. The cultural preference for male heirs and birth control restrictions have created a demand for baby boys, but experts say both sexes are abducted as labour or to beg for gangs, and girls are also taken as wives for unwed men.Hu Minghua, 55, was convicted of kidnapping and selling nine children between 1999 and 2005, the state news agency Xinhua reported, citing a statement from the supreme people's court.Five of the children, all boys now aged from three to six, have been returned to their families, but the parents of the remaining four have yet to be found.Su Binde, 27, was convicted of abducting six children in 2005 and 2006. But while five were rescued by police, the sixth is still missing.Su was also convicted of leading six robberies and twelve thefts and kidnapping a taxi driver who escaped but died 10 days later, according to a court statement.Both men were executed yesterday morning, Xinhua said. They were both detained in 2006.Parents have often complained that the authorities have done little to help when their children have gone missing.But earlier this year Chinese police launched a crackdown on the trafficking of women and children. They say they have rescued around 2,000 children since the campaign began and state media have reported on the ensuing rescues, arrests and in some cases, reunions.In October, the ministry of public security set up a website to reunite dozens of rescued but unidentified children with their families. It has also created a national DNA database. Xinhua said 1,714 people were punished for abducting and trafficking children in the first 10 months of the year, citing figures from the supreme court.The court's spokesman Wang Shaonan said the number of cases had risen 11.25% compared with the same period last year, to 1,107 trials.He warned that child trafficking was on the rise and that gangs were becoming more organised.
