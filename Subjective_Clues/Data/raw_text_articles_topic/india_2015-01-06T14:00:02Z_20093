Over the next five years, India faces one of the world’s biggest challenges – ending financial “untouchability” for 100 million families, bringing clean, affordable and reliable supplies of water and energy to all of its 1.3 billion inhabitants, and investing in the enterprises that will provide livelihoods for an extra 10 million jobseekers each year.The demand for extra capital to meet these pressing needs is immense. Take renewable energy, which unites the issues of access and sustainability. India’s new government has introduced a five-fold increase in the country’s solar target to 100GW of installed capacity by 2022. This will require unprecedented investment, perhaps as much as an additional $100bn (£64bn).Even though solar is increasingly competitive compared with power from conventional sources and offers attractive long-term cash flows with zero fuel risk, obstacles remain within the financial system. India’s banks, for example, face regulatory exposure limits curbing the amount that they can lend to specific sectors. This means funding for clean energy can be capped because these limits have already been met for the power sector as a whole – leading to proposals to set a separate exposure limit for renewables.Alongside this capital deployment initiative is growing awareness of the need to establish a level playing field of sustainability standards in the financial world. Naina Lal Kidwai, country head for HSBC India, says: “For too long, a view has been allowed to take root in India that sustainability and finance are at odds; that taking account of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors raises costs, reduces returns and impedes development.”Actual practice in India suggests the reverse. The Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) has found, for example, that loans to energy efficient companies have a much better loan recovery rate than the norm. At infrastructure company IDFC the business case for sustainable finance is based on reduced risk, increased market share and greater access to international finance.This mix of necessity and opportunity provides an ideal moment to identify levers to scale up sustainable finance. To do this, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and the UNEP Inquiry have formed an advisory committee of leading financiers, policymakers and civil society representatives to generate practical policy options.Harnessing the power of financial innovation is key and this includes mobilising the country’s debt and equity capital markets. Demand for green bonds among the world’s institutional investors is soaring – and India’s pipeline of investment projects in sustainable agriculture, clean energy, efficient buildings, mass transit, smart cities, clean water and waste provides the foundations for a thriving green bonds market. On India’s equity markets, the new Infrastructure Investment Trust model offers another vehicle for investors to put money into sustainable infrastructure.Incentives will also be needed to overcome residual investment risks, but subsidies are unlikely to be the basis for sustainable finance in India. Key instruments could include guarantee and credit enhancement mechanisms from national and international development banks to draw in private capital – to underpin payments to energy service companies (ESCOs), for example, unlocking the crucial efficiency market in India.Tax breaks could also be used in a focused way to encourage investment flows, already used for the country’s de facto green bond leader, the Indian Renewable Energy Development Authority (IREDA).Work is underway to develop a “Made in India” set of guidelines for the integration of ESG factors across banking. Refinements in financial regulation could also be necessary, particularly to correct for market failures (such as a lack of long-term capital for infrastructure). As well as looking at sector exposure levels, this could also involve examining how sustainability factors could impact upon core measures, such as the priority sector lending requirements in banking.Sell-side analysts and buy-side investors also need benchmarks to evaluate the quality of ESG information flowing from the new Business Responsibility reports from the top 100 companies on the country’s stock exchanges.All of this will require new skills and capabilities across the financial system to grow an army of financial intermediaries who can provide the best advice and products to their clients, rich and poor, to navigate the sustainable finance landscape.There is growing momentum behind actions to link financial policy and sustainability around the world, whether it’s Brazil’s new requirements on environmental and social risk for its banking sector, or the Bank of England’s examination of potential “stranded assets” linked to climate change.It is essential that this drive is linked to the broader expansion of financial inclusion so that India’s under-served population get the financial services they deserve to meet their aspirations for energy, food, housing and sanitation.Jayant Sinha, India’s minister of state for finance, said: “It’s clear that India has to be a leader, and do it in a global way in partnership with others.” There is no time to lose in building a sustainable financial system in India.Nick Robins is co-director of the UNEP Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable Financial SystemRead more stories like this:The finance hub is funded by EY.
