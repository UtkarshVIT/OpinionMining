Greek police briefly detained two animal rights activists who took their clothes off outside the British embassy in Athens today to protest against the use of bearskin hats by Buckingham Palace guards.The two British women were released shortly after the protest, which was organised by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.Wearing only fake bearskin hats, underwear and high heels, the activists held up a banner reading: "Bare skin, not bearskin."A third protester, who was not detained as she had dressed by the time police arrived, said 60-100 Canadian bears were killed every year to provide the 18-inch-high black ceremonial hats worn by military guards at Buckingham Palace and other royal sites."We wanted to draw attention to the problem," said Ewa Zanicka, from Poland.After talks with animal rights activists this month, the Ministry of Defence said it was open to using synthetic fur if a good enough replacement for bearskin could be found.
