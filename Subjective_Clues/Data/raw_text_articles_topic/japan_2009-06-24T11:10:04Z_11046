Japan's hopes for an early recovery from the financial crisis were dented today after it reported another plunge in exports last month, with car sales to the US down more than half from last year.Total exports slumped 40.9% in May, following a 39.1% fall in April, the finance ministry said, as the world's second biggest economy continued to pay the price for lacklustre demand for its cars and consumer electronics in the US, Europe and Asia.Although Japan's trade surplus increased to ¥299.8bn (£1.9bn) – its biggest level in a year – the rise was mainly down to a sharp drop in imports.The data reinforced the view that Japan's export-dependent economy will remain stagnant until demand begins to pick up overseas.Japan's exports to the US fell 45.4% in May – the 21st straight month of decline – with vehicle shipments plummeting by 54.8%. Exports to the EU were down 45.4% from last year, while those to Asia dropped 35.5%.The chances of China repeating its recent role as the driver of a recovery look bleak, with exports to Japan's biggest trading partner falling almost 30% from a year earlier due to a decline in shipments of steel, kerosene and electronics components.There are glimmers of hope, however. Japan's exports have recovered slightly since their record year-on-year fall of 49.5% in February.A recent rise in factory output has prompted talk of a sustained recovery in exports, but analysts said the data confirmed that the global economy remains in a deep slump."Export volume is not increasing, which seems to suggest a recovery in the US economy is being delayed," Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research, told Reuters."The reason industrial output has been rising is because companies have cut output more than the fall in demand. But a limited improvement in exports could mean output may sputter after a solid rise in April-June."Despite upgrading its assessment of the economy earlier this month, the Bank of Japan has decided not to water down any of the emergency measures it introduced to support lenders and ease corporate debt.Seiji Nakamura, a member of the central bank's policy board, warned today that Japan may have to wait "a considerable time" before it emerges from its worst recession since the second world war."In light of Japan's demographics and industry structure, it is hard to expect a recovery driven by a large expansion in domestic demand," he told business leaders. "Therefore, we will continue to rely on foreign demand."However, it will likely take considerable time to adjust various distortions in the world economy. Recovery in overseas economies is likely to be moderate, and it will take considerable time for the Japanese economy to make a fully fledged recovery."With production still about 30% down on a year ago, some analysts refuse to rule out further output cuts and job losses among Japanese exporters if global demand remains weak in the coming months.
