Models working in France will need a medical certificate proving they are healthy and not dangerously thin under a new law approved by French MPs.Failure to provide a certificate will be punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of €75,000 (around £54,500).The bill also forces magazines to flag up photographs that have been “touched up” or Photoshopped.The tough new legislation is aimed at combating the growing problem of anorexia in models and rising numbers of young people with eating disorders.

Models will have to provide employers with a doctor’s certificate confirming that “the state of health of the model, assessed with regard to her body mass index (BMI), is compatible with the exercise of her profession”.However, French MPs rejected a clause in an earlier draft of the bill imposing a minimum BMI – measured according to height and weight – on those working in the fashion and advertising industry.Parliamentarians instead agreed to let doctors make the call on whether a model is too thin, taking into account a range of criteria, including age, gender and body shape.Published photographs of models that have been modified “in order to narrow or widen the silhouette” should be labelled as “photograph touched up”. Those who failed to comply could face a fine of up to €37,500 , or 30% of the value of the advert featuring the model.An earlier version of the bill also made it an offence punishable by up to a year’s imprisonment to encourage excessive thinness, a measure aimed at “pro-ana” websites that extol or promote anorexia or bulimia.
