Iran's defence minister has threatened to target Israeli nuclear and other "unconventional" sites if it comes under attack.Ahmad Vahidi's warning came after Iran accused western-backed Saudi Arabia of handing over a missing Iranian nuclear scientist to the US and claiming that Washington is holding 10 more of its officials."Iran's armed forces are fully prepared," Vahidi told reporters on a visit to Syria yesterday. "The Zionists know they are not able to carry out any of their threats against Iran and they are aware of Iran's firm response," he was quoted as saying by the semi-official Mehr news agency. "They are worried about carrying out a pre-emptive first strike and terrified about the repercussions of their act."Iranian-Israeli exchanges are invariably hostile, but in recent weeks talks between Iran and the international community over its nuclear programme appear to have hit a dead end. The US says Iran has until the end of the year to resume negotiations or face sanctions. Iran insists its programme is peaceful. Israel is widely believed to have a large nuclear arsenal.Tensions between Tehran and Washington have also been fuelled by the allegation that Saudi Arabia sent an Iranian nuclear scientist to the US. Iran said Shahram Amiri disappeared during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in June and accused the US of acting like a "terrorist".
