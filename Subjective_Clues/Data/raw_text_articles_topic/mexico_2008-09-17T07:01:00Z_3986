Mexico's chamber of deputies is discussing a federal law to combat murderous attacks on journalists. Part of the debate centres on the definition of a journalist. The justice ministry initially favoured a restrictive definition that would exclude people such as Lydia Cacho, who is famous for her reporting on paedophile rings, or Brad Will, a cameraman murdered in October 2006. But trying to define who is and who is not a journalist is tantamount to restricting access to news and information. (Via ReportersWithoutBorders)
