Marking 120 years since the abolition of slavery in Brazil, the Barbican focuses on the country's best Afro-Brazilian film-makers, whose collaborations with leading musicians and artists give modern Brazilian cinema yet more layers in which to tell its many tales of slavery's legacy. The hardships of life in the favelas are to the fore, with opening film Mar√©, Our Love Story - a Brazilian answer to West Side Story - and outstanding recent releases Tropa De Elite and Linha De Passe. The programme also includes witty teen comedy My Uncle Killed A Guy, Xica da Silva, the true story of one slave's rise to power, Madame Sata, the story of a legendary drag queen/tough guy, and documentary Abolition, on the legacy of slavery in today's Brazil.
