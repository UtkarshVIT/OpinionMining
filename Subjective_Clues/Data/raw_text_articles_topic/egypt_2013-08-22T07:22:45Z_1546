Further to the article posted yesterday, "Journalists under threat in Egypt", there is more evidence of attacks on correspondents covering the conflict along with arbitrary arrests.The press freedom group, the International Press Institute (IPI), has called on Egyptian security forces to release Tahir Osman Hamde, the Cairo bureau chief of Turkey's İhlas news agency.He was arrested on Tuesday (20 August) after security forces raided his office in a Cairo hotel, confiscating his computer and other equipment."We are very worried about him as there isn't a trace of him," said Ahu Kirimlioglu, the news agency's London-based production manager.The Egyptian authorities have refused to release information on Hamde, who is a Dutch citizen. İhlas is working with the Netherlands embassy to seek his release.Another Turkish broadcasting correspondent, Metin Turan, has been in detention since the weekend. He works for the Turkish state broadcaster, TRT.Anthony Mills, IPI's director of communications, spoke of "a dangerous pattern" of media workers being targeted in Egypt. He said it was "in violation of international norms."At least five journalists have been killed in the week since Egyptian forces moved in to crush demonstrators loyal to the deposed president Mohamed Morsi.On Monday, Tamer Abdel-Raouf, a correspondent with the newspaper Al-Ahram, was shot dead at a police checkpoint in the northern district of Beheira.The killings began on 14 August, the first day of the government's crackdown, with the shooting of Sky News cameraman Mick Deane.
