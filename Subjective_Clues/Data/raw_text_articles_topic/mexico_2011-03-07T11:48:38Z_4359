A small restaurant chain in Mexico city is about to play a pioneering role in a UN scheme to reduce carbon emissions at grass roots level.The pilot scheme is a new variant on the UN's troubled clean development mechanism (CDM), a system established by the Kyoto process that allows rich countries to meet emissions targets by funding clean energy projects in developing countries. Until recently, the CDM was open only to large individual projects, leading to criticism that it missed a trick on smaller schemes cutting emissions, such as the use of energy efficient light bulbs and more environmentally friendly stoves.The new scheme, on a small scale initially, hopes to address some of that criticism by retrofitting a device into some of the restaurant chain's fridges. Under the scheme developed by Ramp Carbon, a firm based in Melbourne, the restaurant chain is not charged up front for the technology, but put on a payment plan where it repays the cost out of the money saved in electricity bills. "This means that if we can't demonstrate to them that the product has reduced their electricity bill, they don't have to pay us anything," said Phil Cohn, Ramp Carbon's founder said.A customer might be on a payment plan that lasts between one and two years depending on the specific set-up of their refrigeration systems. "By removing the up-front cost, and structuring repayments out of demonstrated energy savings, we are trying to remove two significant barriers preventing access to energy efficiency technology in developing countries."Critics of the CDM, which governments view as a vital part of international efforts to cut emissions, say it also deters small-scale projects with its high administration costs for UN approval – $100,000 – and the scale required to trade credits in the European Emissions Trading Scheme.To rectify the problem, the UN approved two years ago the first of a new generation of carbon offset programmes that group together large numbers of small sources of greenhouse gases – such as the restaurant chain in Mexico city. Once bundled together, they come under a single large project to combine investments and emission reductions, and new participants can be added throughout the life of the scheme. The approach could also cover other activities such as solar water heating, small hydro plants, domestic bio-gas and energy-efficient lighting.Just six such projects have been registered so far by the UN, compared with traditional CDM, where 2,756 projects have been registered and nearly 550m carbon credits issued.However, the UN believes such a approach holds enormous potential for households or small industries, especially in less developed countries, as it opens up carbon finance opportunities to a wide range of players."The potential scale across Mexico and other developing countries is significant," said Cohn. "We hope to be able to attract mainstream, commercial investors into an area [energy efficiency finance in SMEs] that has previously faced a number of barriers."The revenue gained by Ramp Carbon from trading carbon credits allows the company to reduce the price of the technology paid by the customer, further enabling broader take-up of the new technology.
