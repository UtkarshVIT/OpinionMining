The prime ministers of Britain, Greece, Spain and Norway have warned the financial community that they will prioritise growth over deficit cuts, and have asked speculators to change their short-term view for one that is more favourable to society as a whole.The message from Gordon Brown, Spain's José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, George Papandreou of Greece and Norway's Jens Stoltenberg is likely to infuriate some investors, who are pushing governments with high deficits to cut their ballooning debts on concerns about their ability to repay the money they owe."The agenda for the European Union this year should be growth and jobs," Brown said during a conference organised by the Policy Network, a centre-left thinktank, in London."We won't fall in the trap of those who provoked the credit crunch," Zapatero said. "We will cut the deficit when economic recovery is active, but not at the expense of social cohesion."Over the past few weeks, the four left-wing leaders have suffered the attacks of speculators who do not believe politicians have their economies under control: in Britain and Spain, investors' sales have pushed bond yields higher, making the countries' borrowings more expensive – as well as the long-term interest rates that citizens pay in contracts such as mortgages. Speculators have also pushed up the price of protection against potential defaults on Greek, Portuguese and Spanish state debt, exacerbating negative sentiment towards the countries.Papandreou reassured investors of his country's ability to improve its ailing public finances – including a draconian budget deficit cut to 3% of gross domestic product by 2013, from 12% now. "Greece is our problem – we're not looking for bailouts or money from other countries. We have a programme and the support for this programme and we'll do what's necessary to reach the targets. We want to borrow on the same terms as the others," Papandreou said.He was supported by European Union competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia, who defended the EU's guarded approach towards the Greek crisis, saying that "you can't promise a party everything they're asking for".In an interview during the conference, Almunia said that the EU's response to the Greek crisis, which has been much criticised by investors for its lack of detail, is "serious and responsible".However, with local strikes and popular opposition to the cuts, few investors believe the country will meet its targets. As he spoke, protection against a potential default of his country was trading at twice as much that of other European countries. "We have the power, if we have the will, to deal with some kinds of speculation," Papandreou said. Financial instruments should be "tools" to help citizens lead a better life, whereas "they are God for the conservatives," he said.Greece may find help from Spain, as during his six-month EU presidency Zapatero will try to toughen regulation of credit default swaps – the instruments traded as sovereign credit protection, the Spanish prime minister told the Guardian on the sidelines of the conference."We have to tell the markets that they should have a more medium and long-term perspective," the Spanish leader said during the summit. "They are also interested in an economic recovery that brings stability and tranquility for all."But investors claim there is still huge distance between the two sides – governments and markets – that are now battling to find the best way out of the worst recession in 60 years. While politicians "talk the talk" – instead of offering a more specific plan on how to help Greece – financial investors will keep looking only at the numbers, Evolution Securities analyst Gary Jenkins recently said."The market is now only interested in liquidity. We have to be focused on the short term: if you're concerned about funding, you have to look short-term," Jenkins said.Brown called for more action and further global change on financial regulation over the next G20 meetings this year. A renewed global approach is needed as the "internationalism spirit of the G20 summit in London last year has somehow melted away," Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, said at the conference."We can't leave things as they were – we won't withdraw from speculation beyond borders, from tax heavens," Zapatero said."It's a paradox that the markets that we saved are now demanding and putting difficulties, as those budget deficits are those that we incurred to save those who now demand budget cuts. What a paradox."
