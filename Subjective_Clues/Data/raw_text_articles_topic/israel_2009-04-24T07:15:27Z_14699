Seven journalists have been injured in recent weeks at the hands of Israeli soldiers, according to the international press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders. In a letter to Israel's defence minister Ehud Barak last week it listed the incidents in which journalists have been wounded while going about their work. They are Atta 'Awad, a photographer with the Ramattan news agency, and Mohamed Es-Said, both injured by tear gas grenades; Reuters photographer Said el Houwari and Rabhi el Koubri, a photographer with the Palestinian news network Pal-media.net, both hit by bullets; Khalil Riyash, a photographer employed by the Palestinian news agency Ma'an, and Reuters photographer Bachar Nazal, both injured by rubber bullets; and Spanish journalist Cristina Rivas, who sustained a serious leg injury.
