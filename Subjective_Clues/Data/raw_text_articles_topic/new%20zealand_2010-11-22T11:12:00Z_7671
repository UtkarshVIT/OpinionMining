Police in New Zealand have acknowledged for the first time that they were preparing for "loss of life", as a borehole into the mine where 29 men are trapped neared completion this morning.Authorities are expected to finish drilling the 15cm-wide shaft into the mine tunnel today, providing a better idea of the air quality inside the area where miners were believed trapped by Friday's blast.Two Britons, Pete Rodger, 40, from Perthshire and Malcolm Campbell, 25, from Fife, are among those trapped in the Pike river mine in Greymouth on the South Island after the explosion, which is believed to have been caused by a methane gas leak."We still remain optimistic; we're still keeping an open mind," said police superintendent Gary Knowles. "But we are planning for all outcomes, and as part of this process we're planning for the possible loss of life as a result of what's occurred underground."Two workers stumbled out of the Pike river mine within hours of the explosion on Friday, but there has been no contact with the missing 29. A phone line deep inside the mine has rung unanswered for days.The New Zealand Herald reported this morning that 135 metres (443 ft) of the 162-metre (532 ft) tunnel to the mine has been completed, however tests every 30 minutes on accessible areas continued to indicate the air was too toxic for rescuers to enter.The army are at the mine site fitting a robot usually used for bomb disposal with a camera and up to 1.5 miles of fibre optic cable, so it could be sent into the tunnel to check conditions and film the area.The battery-operated robot works only in fresh air, so cannot be sent into the mine until the air clears. Methane and other toxic gases – some believed to be coming from a smouldering fire deep underground – have been detected in the network of tunnels that threads through a mountain, and officials fear another explosion could occur if rescuers enter.Checks are also under way to make sure the robot would not cause a spark or anything else that could ignite flammable gases inside.Police have said the miners, aged between 17 and 62, are believed to be about 1.2 miles down the tunnel. Although Knowles said rescuers were preparing for all eventualities, the prime minister, John Key, said there was "every chance" the 24 New Zealanders, two Australians, two Britons and one South African were still alive."The advice I have is that there is oxygen in the mine and there is every chance that those miners have managed to get to a pocket of that oxygen flow and therefore that they are alive," he said.Key added that although these were "testing and difficult times", it was imperative the rescue team acted "in a way that doesn't endanger their [the miners'] lives".Each miner carried 30 minutes-worth of oxygen, and more fresh air was stored in the mine, along with food and water that could allow several days of survival, officials said.
