Turkey has put 44 Kurdish journalists on trial this week in what Reporters without Borders called the "criminalisation of critical and activist journalism".They are among about 100 Kurdish journalists who face lengthy jail terms on various terrorism charges, including accusations that they have supported the KCK – an illegal pan-Kurdish movement that includes the armed Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK).While the crackdown on the press has escalated in recent years under the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey has always had a chronic problem with tolerating a free press. From 1959 to 2011, out of 479 cases brought to the European court of human rights under freedom of expression, 207 originated from Turkey.The Kurdish journalists who report on the widespread oppression of their identity and the 28-year-old conflict between the Turkish army and the PKK have borne the brunt of Turkey's intolerance for decades – and the current government's approach is no exception. The imprisonment of the Kurdish journalists and more than 8,000 activists, politicians, lawyers and academics is part of a strategy by Erdogan to intimidate the media into toeing the government's line when it comes to the Kurdish question.The government sees the Kurdish journalists as no different from PKK fighters and often labels them as terrorists or supporters of terrorism so that their long-term pre-trial detention is more palatable for the general public. While the government is unable to label non-Kurdish journalists as terrorists, it often pressures their employers (often mainstream newspapers) to terminate their contracts for their critical stands on the Kurdish question, as in the cases of Ece Temelkuran and Ali Akel.Even foreign journalists are not immune. Those who file critical reports about the conduct of the Turkish army in Kurdish areas often face difficulties and at times they are put on trial, as happened with Aliza Marcus, a Reuters journalist, in 1995.For many Kurds, the imprisonment of a large number of journalists and the recent escalation of violence between the PKK and the Turkish army is reminiscent of the violence and the suffering that the Kurds endured throughout the 1990s.Twelve of the journalists on trial are current or former employees of the pro-Kurdish newspaper Ozgur Gundem ("Free Agenda") which has received an International Press Freedom award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for its reporting on "the persecution of Kurds within Turkey". In the early 1990s, a group affiliated with the Turkish army assassinated 76 employees of the paper, including 30 journalists. No meaningful steps have been taken by the government to bring the perpetrators to justice despite repeated calls by international human rights organisations.But while more prominent non-Kurdish journalists such as Nedim Sener and Ahmet Sik were released from jail this year under international pressure, lesser-known Kurdish journalists like Selahattin Aslan waste away in prison. From his cell, Aslan wrote that a vital piece of evidence against him was the fact that he used the original Kurdish name "Amed" to refer to the city of Diyarbakir in his writings. According to the prosecutor, that meant he was advocating PKK ideology because the banned organisation also uses the same name for Diyarbakir. It is worth remembering that the reason given by the state for changing the names of Kurdish places in 1960 was that they "hurt public opinion and are not suitable for our national culture, moral values, traditions and customs".Aslan spent four years in jail for his journalism from 2007 until 2011. He was freed for eight months and re-arrested again in December last year and now faces 15 years in prison for being a "member of the media committee of the PKK/KCK organisation". Vedat Kurşun, the editor-in-chief of Azadiya Welat daily was sentenced to 166 years and six months' imprisonment in May 2010 for disseminating 103 articles and photographs about the PKK war with the Turkish army.The evidence presented by the army to prosecutors in cases involving links to the PKK is often questionable. In a recent case about the murder of three Christian missionaries in 2007 by an ultra-Turkish nationalist, it was revealed in court that some units of the Turkish gendarmerie used forged documents to prove that the missionaries were working with members of the PKK, and were receiving orders from the CIA.None of these claims turned out to be true but they are stories that often go unquestioned in the rest of the Turkish media – partly because many investigative journalists are detained, and those who try to cover the Kurdish issue are at risk of being accused of supporting "terrorists".All this enables the state to shape a one-dimensional narrative of the Kurdish question – that it is a "terrorist issue". The Kurdish issue has become so divisive now that it is not only the state that helps maintain the government's line. When some prominent Turkish journalists questioned the premise of approaching the Kurdish question as a security issue rather than a political one, an Islamist-nationalist daily started a hate campaign calling them "PKK propagandists" and a "despicable enemy of the Turks".As the European court of human rights pointed out, "one of the principal characteristics of democracy is the possibility it offers of resolving a country's problems through dialogue, without recourse to violence" (the Socialist Party and Others v Turkey, 25 May 1998). The Turkish government ought to create the possibility of dialogue with its Kurdish population to end the conflict with the PKK by guaranteeing the Kurds "full equality and rights".Instead of trampling on the rights of journalists to shut down discussion on an inconvenient issue, Erdogan – himself a former political prisoner – should remember what Yasar Kemal, a leading intellectual from Turkey, wrote in Der Spiegel in January 1995: "We in Turkey should always be aware that the road to true democracy must lie in a peaceful solution to the Kurdish question."
