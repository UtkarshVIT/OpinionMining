It was the silence more than anything. No rumble of traffic. No voices in the street. No footsteps. Nothing to betray the existence of 20m people.The cacophony of noise and life that breaks with the dawn missed its cue in Mexico Citytoday. The sun rose higher but it made no difference. The avenues stayed empty.It was a day of firsts: the first of May. The first of a five day nationwide shutdown. The first time an epidemic had stilled one of the world's great cities. A first time to do lots of things: sit in the middle of Paseo de la Reforma and not get run over; stroll through the woods of Bosque de Chapultepec and not see another soul; have the No 18 bus – there was the occasional bus – all to yourself.For Adriana Mendez, 25, a tamale seller on Bajio street, it was the first time she was so bereft of customers that she curled up and slept at her stall in the middle of the day. "God, it's quiet," she said, waking up and rubbing her eyes.Further up the street there was another glimpse of life: three policeman at a junction waiting for traffic to direct. "I'm supposed to be training these two cadets but how can I do that if there are no cars?" said Reyes Alguilar, 62, a veteran of the force. He was cleaning his own car with a red cloth. "Might as well do something useful, right?"Smog had cleared, revealing an azure sky, but the city felt heavy, expectant. The authorities said the H1N1 flu epidemic seemed to be easing and that the five-day lockdown would help snuff out the threat. But what if it didn't? What if restaurants, offices, factories, schools, museums would have to remain shut? What if economic pain turned to agony?An opinion poll said that 90% of Mexicans believe the federal government has responded well or very well to the epidemic – but that could swiftly change if the crisis continues. Even before the epidemic Mexico had been hit by plunging exports and oil revenues, shrinking the economy by 7% in the first quarter.Tourism, on which many jobs depend, has disappeared. "Its logical that it would be that way and there is not much we can do about it at the moment," said the tourism minister, Rodolfo Elisondo.It may not help much that there is a t-shirt for sale which bears the image of a pig and the slogan: "I went to Mexico City and all I got was swine flu."For the few out on the streets, there was an immediate question: what if the person approaching me is infected? In a pew at the cathedral one worshipper looked in horror at the runny nose of the man beside him and fled.Billboard advertising offered mocking reminders of normality. The action film Wolverine was supposed to open last week but the premiere was cancelled. All the cinemas are shut.Mexico City resembled a film set for an apocalyptic tale. I Am Legend, perhaps, or 28 Days Later, but there were no zombies, just ordinary people making the best of a grim ­situation. On Thursday, as lockdown approached, the only queues were outside DVD shops. The most popular rentals were cartoons, said a Blockbuster employee.Today was supposed to be ­workers' day. Normally tens of ­thousands of flag-wavers would congregate in the Zocalo, a magnifient plaza. ­Fabiano Lopez, a 73-year-old Marxist in a yellow shirt, stood in the empty square holding a red flag. It was the only one. Capitalism had orchestrated the epidemic, he said. "I'm not worried. My comrades will come later. You'll see."
