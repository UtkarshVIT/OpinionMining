After following the developments between Unite and Ineos (Grangemouth oil refinery shuts as owners refuse to back down, 16 October), I am affronted to learn that Ineos appears to have paid hardly any tax in the UK since 2008 (Glasgow Herald, 21 October). Ineos has been making savings of £100m a year since moving its office from the UK to Switzerland in 2010. The multinational also now operates in five known tax havens. Why are we selling off our key industries to foreign companies who are exploiting this position to reinvest profits back home? This is the free-market ideology gone mad and once again the British taxpayer will be footing the bill.Louise BickertonGlasgow• Grangemouth is half owned by Petro China, part of the Chinese state petroleum company. Is this what George Osborne meant by Chinese investment on his recent trade tour?Chris JeffriesStockport, Cheshire
