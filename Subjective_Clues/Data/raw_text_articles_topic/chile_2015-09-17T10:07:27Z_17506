The Telegraph reports that operations were suspended at two major copper mines operated by Codelco and UK-listed Antofagasta after the earthquake struck Chile.The closure of the mines, which generate an annual capacity of more than 600,000 tonnes, drove copper prices on the London Metal Exchange to two-month highs in early Asian trading as worries about supply disruptions offset lingering concerns about demand from China amid copper’s longest rout in years.

We have another eyewitness account from Chile, this time from Sumit Kaul, who was in Santiago when the initial earthquake struck.I was in an open area on the ground, in Santiago when the initial earthquake stuck. It was so strong that I could barely stand on the ground and saw buildings around me sway. It was very long as well, and I felt as if the ground itself would break apart. Till now, at around 5:30 AM, there have been more than 30 after shocks.Sent via Guardian Witness By Sumit Kaul  17 September 2015, 8:41
