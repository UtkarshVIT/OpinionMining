An Iranian judicial committee has vetoed a law that would have allowed men to take additional wives without the consent of their first wife, state TV has reported. Ali Shahrokhi, head of the parliamentary committee, said it had restored a clause to stipulate that taking additional wives will be conditional on gaining the consent of the first wife. The bill is due to be put to the vote in the parliament next week. Outcry over the original bill forced parliament last week to postpone a vote pending further debate; justice officials said that it would undermine women's rights. AP Tehran
