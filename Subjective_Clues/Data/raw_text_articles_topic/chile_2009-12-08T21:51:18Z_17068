Six men have been arrested in Chile over the murder of the country's former president Eduardo Frei Montalva, whose death in 1982 has been one of the most enduring mysteries of the Pinochet regime.Three suspects were charged with murder and three others with being accomplices to murder.Frei Montalva died at the Santa Maria clinic in Santiago, where he was recuperating from a hernia operation. Judge Alejandro Madrid, who investigated the case for seven years, said yesterday that the former Chilean leader was poisoned to death as multiple doses of thallium and mustard gas were secretly mixed with medications and injected into the president's body."This was an action by the military intelligence of the dictator [Pinochet], with a clear and precise objective, the elimination of President Frei," said Alvaro Varela, a human rights lawyer working for the Frei family. "Those charged today are not the only ones ... there are more and we are headed in their direction."Family members had suspected Frei was poisoned after being tipped off by former aides to General Pinochet. In his 2002 book, Imperfect Crime, Chilean journalist Jorge Molina profiled Eugenio Barrios, a chemist who worked for the Chilean secret police on a series of radical experiments including the production of anthrax, botulism and the nerve gas sarin. Barrios, who was murdered in Uruguay, is suspected of administering the poison to Frei.The arrests came ahead of Sunday's presidential election, in which Senator Eduardo Frei, son of the murdered president, is one of the leading candidates. "There is a before and an after because never before has there been [in Chile] an attack taking the life of a president," the senator said yesterday."This shows that justice takes time, but it does finally arrive as it has in this case," The Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, said. "This is good for our society."Those arrested included medical personnel and members of the Pinochet secret police known as the Dina.The doctors were charged as accomplices for their role in conducting an illegal autopsy, removing all organs from the body of Frei and stuffing his corpse with gauze.Frei, who ruled Chile as a progressive president from 1964-1970, initially supported the 1973 military coup that led to the death of the president at the time, Salvador Allende. But, after human rights crimes, including thousands of murders, Frei Montalva emerged in 1980 as a key figure in the growing opposition to the military government led by Augusto Pinochet.The murder of Frei in January 1982 was followed a month later by the assassination of Tucapel Jim√©nez, a leading union organiser, as the Pinochet regime systematically eliminated leading figures in the democratic opposition.
