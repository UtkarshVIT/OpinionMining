The al-Jazeera journalist who was detained in Germany for three days on an Egyptian arrest warrant has accused the Berlin administration of allowing itself to be manipulated by its counterpart in Cairo.Ahmed Mansour, who was released on Monday without charge, told a press conference on Tuesday he still had not been told why he ended up on a German police wanted list and why he was arrested while trying to leave the country on Saturday.“German government representatives allowed themselves to be instrumentalised by Cairo,” Mansour said. He added that he regretted the fact that the Egyptian government had succeeded in “using some people in the German government for its own means”.He called on the German government to give answers about the incident, which saw him held at Berlin’s Tegel airport on Saturday, apparently at the behest of Egypt’s military regime. Mansour repeated his assertion – and that of Interpol – that despite a German government spokesman saying the arrest warrant had come via Interpol’s “red notice” system, no such notice exists against his name.

He said he feared the “dictatorial, oppressor regime” had managed to “export part of its dictatorship, its oppression and its judicial transgressions to Germany”.Mansour said it was up to German journalists to work out whether there was a connection between Egyptian president Abdel Fatah-al-Sisi’s state visit earlier this month and his arrest.During the visit, the German industrial group Siemens signed an €8bn (£5.7bn) deal with Egypt to supply gas and windpower plants.Mansour, who holds dual Egyptian and British citizenship but always travels on his British passport, said he was grateful to his German lawyers and the judiciary for preventing his extradition to Egypt, praising in particular the chief prosecutor, Harald Range, who resisted pressure to keep Mansour in detention.Last year, Mansour was convicted in absentia by an Egyptian court of torturing a lawyer in Tahrir Square in 2011 and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He has rejected the charges.His lawyers said they had a “burning interest” to find out why their client was arrested in the first place. “There is much need for answers,” Patrick Teubner said, adding that it remained puzzling how an “obviously politically motivated manhunt” by the Egyptian judiciary “could have had any validity in Germany”.Mansour, who denies any connection to the Muslim Brotherhood, which al-Jazeera has been accused of supporting, said he had had no problems on two visits to Germany earlier this year.He was travelling on Tuesday evening to Doha, where he planned to present his weekly programme Bela Hodod (Without Frontiers). He would return to Germany in the near future to discuss the incident with politicians, he added. Mansour said the Sisi government, which came into power in 2013, “hates the free press and, as I speak to you, there are currently more than 70 Egyptian journalists currently being held in prison for speaking the truth”.
