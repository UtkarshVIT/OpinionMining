Two Pakistani journalists were slightly injured when a bomb went off outside the offices of local newspapers in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan. The offices of five daily newspapers - Awam, Atemad, Intekhab, Public and Tijarat - were damaged. Once again, the president All Pakistan Newspapers Society has criticised the government for failing to giving adequate protection to journalists, who are being persistently harassed and threatened.
