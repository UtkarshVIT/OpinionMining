A Grace Kelly biopic would appear to be a no-brainer. Hers was a life of high drama: an A-list film career, a tumultuous love life, a royal wedding watched by 30 million people and an untimely death following a car crash. Even her politician father was a triple-Olympic gold medallist.But upcoming film Grace of Monaco, which has just secured its $15m (Â£9.3m) funding, will focus on six months in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle and Prince Rainier III were at odds over Monaco's standing as a tax haven. Kelly, then 33, was said to have been instrumental behind the scenes to solve the political impasse.The script is by Arash Amel, whose sole credit to date is The Expatriate, a CIA drama starring Aaron Eckhart and due out next year. Producer Pierre-Ange Le Pogam (Tell No One) is said to be looking for a director, plus an actor to take the lead role.Grace of Monaco follows in the footsteps of the forthcoming My Week With Marilyn and last year's The King's Speech in taking a snapshot of a 20th-century celebrity at a particular moment in their life. The Iron Lady, the biopic of Margaret Thatcher, due out in January 2012, reportedly takes a more conventional biopic approach.
