The policeman in charge of the investigation into the bludgeoning to death of a pregnant woman on the streets of one of Pakistan's major cities has questioned whether her death is any more serious than any other murder he deals with, in comments likely to raise further concerns over how the country deals with so-called "honour killings".Three days after Farzana Parveen was murdered by a 20-strong mob of her own relatives, the official report has exonerated officers over the failure to stop the killing, which took place close to Lahore's high court. It claims Parveen had illegally remarried."How is this murder any more serious than all the other cases we deal with?" said Zulfiqar Hameed, the senior officer in charge of the investigation. He said he was outraged by international media reports that suggested police stood by and did nothing.He said international condemnation had been overdone, and that the world failed to understand the cultural context in which the crime had taken place."These people come from a village, you can't expect them to act as if they were on Oxford Street," he said.The report, produced after global anger prompted Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, to order an urgent inquiry, contradicts numerous claims from witnesses and Parveen's husband, Muhammad Iqbal, who said police at the scene refused to help him despite his desperate pleas.It says the attack happened 300 yards from the entrance to the high court, where no police were on duty. Nonetheless, one officer who happened to be passing managed to grab a pistol that had been used to shoot at Parveen; he was apparently unable to stop her relatives from picking up bricks with which they beat her to death.Hameed referred to statements by western governments, including foreign secretary William Hague, as "cultural imperialism" and the "white man's burden".There have only been a scattering of small public demonstrations against the case and domestic media largely ignored the story until the prime minister ordered the inquiry.The hastily prepared report, seen by the Guardian, appears to attempt to give some justification for the murder, claiming Parveen was already legally married to a cousin, called Mazher Iqbal. He was among the attackers who ambushed and killed her as she walked from her lawyer's office to the entrance of the high court."Getting married for a second time was both illegal and immoral," Hameed said.Iqbal claims Parveen's father supported his marriage to Parveen, only later changing his mind when he demanded more money than had originally been agreed.The report says Iqbal got to know Parveen during a long period when he was in hiding from the police following the murder of his first wife – a crime he admitted to journalists this week.The police report, which was delivered to the chief minister of Punjab province, confirms Iqbal was later excused for his crime after members of his own family agreed to forgive him under controversial sharia law-inspired provisions in Pakistan's legal system.Pakistan's usually voluble religious clerics have also remained largely silent, with the exception of Tahir Ashrafi, a high profile mullah known for his unusual liberal stance on many issues.On Friday he circulated a "fatwa" declaring "the killing of girls in the name of honour or dignity is terrorism and viciousness – which has nothing to do with Islam"."The government and judiciary have the responsibility to punish in the harshest possible way those guilty of committing this crime," it said.It was a step welcomed by Tahira Abdullah, a prominent human rights activist. But she acknowledged that the response to the crime within Pakistan had been disappointing."We will never see any reaction from the rural areas, you can forget that," she said. "But my expectations are now so lowered that any statement or demonstration is like manna from heaven."
