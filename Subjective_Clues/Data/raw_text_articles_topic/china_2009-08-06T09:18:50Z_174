The head of China's nuclear power programme is under investigation for "grave violations of discipline", Chinese state media reported, citing the Communist party's top disciplinary body.There were no details of the allegations against Kang Rixin, the president and party secretary of the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), but the phrasing usually indicates a corruption case. It is not clear whether the 56-year-old has been suspended from his post.The case comes as billions are spent on expanding the nuclear industry as China tries to move away from its dependence on oil and gas. The country has six nuclear power plants, all located on the east coast, and plans to build five more this year.According to its website, state-owned CNNC is the main investor and biggest owner of nuclear plants and is heavily involved in research and development. The state news agency Xinhua said the corporation had more than 100 subsidiary companies and institutes and made a profit of 4.8bn yuan (£413m) last year.Nuclear plants account for about 2% of China's power generation and the government wants that to double by 2020.Kang was elected as a member of the central party committee's discipline inspection panel – the body now investigating him – in 2002. The state council, China's cabinet, appointed him head of CNNC the following year.He is among several high-ranking officials caught up recently in disciplinary inquiries. Xu Zongheng, the mayor of Shenzhen – one of China's wealthiest cities – was fired for corruption last week.Chen Tonghai, a former chairman of the Chinese oil giant Sinopec Corp, was sentenced to death in July, with a two-year reprieve, in what was believed to be China's biggest bribery case. He was convicted of illegally receiving 196m yuan between 1999 and June 2007.
