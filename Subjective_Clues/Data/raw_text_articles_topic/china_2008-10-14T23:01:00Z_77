In the 63 years since he was created, Thomas the Tank Engine has travelled a long way from a branch line on the Island of Sodor. But the "cheeky little engine" is still entering uncharted territory, after a new deal was signed to export the children's television programme to China for the first time.The rights to four series of Thomas and Friends, already broadcast in more than 185 countries around the world, have been sold to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV by licensing company HIT Entertainment.It is the first deal between HIT, which also owns the rights to a host of other popular characters including Barney the Dinosaur and Bob the Builder, and a Chinese broadcaster. The country is seen as a potentially huge growth area by intellectual property groups that hold the rights to some of the best-known children's characters. Alison Homewood, HIT's executive vice president for worldwide TV distribution, said the show was "one of the world's most popular and unique properties in the pre-school market". The company has also appointed a licensing agent in China that will sign deals to produce toys and other spin offs. Publisher Egmont will produce a series of story books to tie in with the show. More than 200m books and more than 80m Thomas DVDs have been sold to date. The character was invented by the Rev W Awdry for his son Christopher and was given a new lease of life in 1984 with the introduction of the TV series, narrated by former Beatle Ringo Starr. The deal is one of hundreds that will be signed this week between broadcasters at the Mipcom TV festival in Cannes. BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, unveiled a deal to make a Russian version of Top Gear.
