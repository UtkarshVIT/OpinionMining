 The Blair government's role in the war against Iraq "absolutely undermines the basis of our democracy" according to Lord Falconer, one of the ex-prime minister's closest allies during the build up to war in 2003.Speaking before the 10th anniversary of the September dossier, which contained the infamous claim that Saddam Hussein could mobilise long distance weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes and which formed the backbone of the case for invasion, the former lord chancellor said: "I think it [the run-up to war] has had a hugely damaging effect on politics. I supported and continue to support the use of force."But in terms of people's trust in politicians the impression is that the government misled the country in relation to the reasons for war and embarked upon war in circumstances where there wasn't a proper justification."Falconer, who shared a flat with Blair during their time as young barristers in the 1970s and is widely considered to be one of his oldest and most loyal friends, added he believes the war with Iraq is the defining memory of the Blair years.He said: "It [the war with Iraq] is unquestionably the issue that most defines Tony Blair in the British public's mind, whether that will remain the case, it's difficult to tell. It colours people's view of Tony because that's what's written about him â€¦ I don't think there's much doubt that the picture that people have throughout the world of Tony Blair is bound up with Iraq."Falconer, who was speaking in conversation with Sir Menzies Campbell, one of the most senior politicians to criticise the Blair government during the run-up to the war, also conceded the UK went into Iraq "without [the] proper support" of the British public.The comments come after an uncomfortable few weeks for Tony Blair as Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu called for him and ex-US president George Bush to be tried in the international criminal court in the Hague for war crimes.Writing in last week's Observer, Tutu, accused the two leaders of acting like "playground bullies" and lying to the world about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.The September dossier, which was based on reports from the Joint Intelligence Committee, was published on 24 September 2002. Its claims, which included allegations that Saddam Hussein was procuring uranium from Niger, were also broadly discredited after the invasion.Falconer, who was a Home Office minister at the time the dossier was published, was later accused, along with senior Blair aide Sally Morgan, of applying pressure on the then attorney general Lord Goldsmith to clear the way for invasion by declaring it legal in March 2003.Falconer denies the allegations.
