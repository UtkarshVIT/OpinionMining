Insurgents have killed at least 44 people in a wave of attacks against Iraqi security forces, gunning down soldiers at an army post and bombing police recruits waiting to apply for jobs.The violence, which struck at least 11 cities and wounded nearly 240 people, highlighted militant attempts to sow havoc in the country and undermine the government.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, but security forces are a frequent target of al-Qaida's Iraq branch, which has vowed to reassert itself and take back areas it was forced from before US troops withdrew from the country last year.In Sunday's deadliest attack, gunmen stormed a small Iraqi army outpost in the town of Dujail before dawn, killing at least 10 soldiers and wounding eight more, according to police and hospital officials in the nearby city of Balad, about 50 miles north of Baghdad.Hours later, a car bomb struck a group of police recruits waiting in line to apply for jobs with the state-run Northern Oil Company outside the northern city of Kirkuk. Police said seven recruits were killed and 17 wounded. He said all the recruits were Sunni Muslims and blamed the early morning attack on al-Qaida.The carnage stretched into the country's south, where bombs stuck to two parked cars exploded in the Shia-dominated city of Nassiriya, 200 miles south-east of Baghdad. The blasts were near the French consulate and a hotel in the city, although the consulate did not appear to be a target of the attack.Health officials said two people were killed and three were wounded at the hotel, and one Iraqi policeman was injured at the consulate. No French diplomats were among the casualties.France's foreign ministry said it "condemns with the greatest severity" the wave of attacks. In a statement, the ministry said it "especially condemned" the attack outside France's honorary consulate in Nassiriya, which killed an Iraqi police officer and wounded a passerby.A string of smaller attacks struck nine other cities, including Baghdad, on Sunday.In the capital's eastern Shia neighbourhood of Husseiniyah, roadside bombs killed a policeman and a passerby, security and health officials said. Another eight people, including four soldiers, were wounded, the officials said.The rest of the attacks were car bombs that hit cities stretching from the southern port of Basra, Iraq's second largest city, to the city of Tal Afar north-west of Baghdad, near the Syrian border.The blast in Basra killed three people and wounded 24, while the bomb in Tal Afar killed two people and wounded seven, officials said.A pair of car bombs in southern Maysan province killed five people and wounded 40 outside a Shia shrine, said the holy site's director.A roadside bomb in Taji, just north of Baghdad, left two people dead and 11 injured, and explosions in the Sunni towns of Hawija and Ar Riyad, outside Kirkuk north of Baghdad, wounded seven people.In Tuz Khormato near Kirkuk a car bomb outside a market killed four and wounded 41 people, said Salahuddin provincial health director Raeed Ibrahim.
