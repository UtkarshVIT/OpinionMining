A boring press release arrives from Swiss International Airlines, heralding the launch of a new service from Zurich to the Canadian cities of Calgary and Vancouver. But wait! What are these strange annotations in the margin?The airline's announcement says that "Calgary and Vancouver, which are both located in southern Canada, are major destinations not only for their growing tourist popularity". But the reference to "southern Canada" has struck a dull note with somebody within Swiss, who clearly thinks of Canada as frozen tundra and who has added a caustic electronic note in the margin saying: "Well, yes, but most of the rest of the country is pretty much uninhabited!"The release also notes that the weekly Edelweiss flight leaves Switzerland for Canada at 9.25 every Monday morning and arrives back in Zurich at 9.55 on Tuesday mornings. But it doesn't detail departure times from Canada. The commentator in the margin has remarked: "This is a very Zurich-centric view! Why not give the other departure times, too?"Oh, the perils of email. This is hardly the ideal start in winning over Canadian travellers. An apologetic Swiss International spokesman, Jean-Claude Donzel, says: "Something went wrong with the sending of the press release. This was not the final version."
