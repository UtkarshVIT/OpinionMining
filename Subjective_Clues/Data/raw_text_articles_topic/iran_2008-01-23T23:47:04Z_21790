A meeting of foreign ministers in Berlin produced a compromise resolution, which slightly expanded existing sanctions on Iranian financial institutions and travel restrictions on government members. It does not, however, include the broader economic embargo sought by the US.The security council last year demanded that Iran cease uranium enrichment until it had convinced the international community of its peaceful intentions.The new draft resolution will be debated in the coming weeks at the UN in New York, and its final form may be influenced by the outcome of talks between Tehran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has asked Iran to resolve the remaining unanswered questions about its past nuclear activities by next month.The Russian and Chinese governments have opposed the passing of a new sanctions resolution before the IAEA report on Iranian cooperation, expected in mid-February.The compromise reached in Berlin will maintain pressure on Tehran, but only increase it marginally.
