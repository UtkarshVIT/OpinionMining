Barack Obama today signalled the start of a new push for peace in the Middle East following his speech in Cairo yesterday calling for a new beginning between the US and Muslim countries.During a visit to Germany, the US president said: "The moment is now for us to act."He announced that US special envoy George Mitchell would return to the region next week to follow up on his plea in Cairo for both Israeli and Palestinian leaders to give ground."I am confident that if we stick with it, having started early, we can make some serious progress this year," Obama told a joint news conference with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Dresden."The moment is now for us to act on what we all know to be the truth, which is that each side is going to have to make some difficult compromises."While the entire international community would have to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace, "ultimately the parties involved have to make the decision that the prosperity and security of their people are best served" by an accord, he said.Merkel promised to cooperate in her own right.Unlike George Bush, Obama has thrown the US into the cauldron of Middle East peacemaking from the beginning of his presidency. In his speech at Cairo University, Obama called on Palestinian and Arab leaders to contribute to the search for peace and choose "progress" over the "self-defeating" policies of the past. While declaring the US bond with Israel "unbreakable", he nevertheless publicly challenged the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, by declaring that the building of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land must stop.On other matters, Obama said he had seen "some progress" towards financial stability in the wake of the global economic crisis, and he and Merkel agreed they must continue to work closely to restore their economies and those of other countries.The leaders spoke after meeting privately at a castle in Dresden, a city flattened by air raids at the end of the second world war.Obama was next due to tour the Buchenwald concentration camp, where an estimated 56,000 people died, most being Jews who were worked to death, shot or hanged by Nazi guards. He will then travel to a US military hospital in Landstuhl, western Germany, to visit soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, before heading for the 65th anniversary of the D-Day landings in France.Obama is believed to want to use his trips to Germany and France to send a strong message to Americans that fighting tyranny demands sacrifice.
