A severe 6.6 magnitude earthquake has hit New Zealand's South Island, close to the capital Wellington, followed by a series of aftershocks ranging from 2.0 up to a severe 6.0.The quake (earlier reported to be 6.2), around 10km south east of Seddon, was felt across large parts of the country and left residents feeling unnerved but reportedly uninjured, as strong aftershocks continue to rattle the region.The shallow quake was felt as far south as Dunedin, and in Auckland in the north. There is no tsunami warning for the region.GeoNet says the first quake was recorded at 2.31pm local time at a depth of 8km. The aftershock measuring 6.0 was initially recorded as 6.3 shortly after 5.30pm local time before being downgraded.Dr James Goff, leader of the tsunami and natural hazards research group at the University of New South Wales, said large aftershocks "can happen"."In the New Zealand context and in other major earthquakes around the world you can get some pretty big ones, and you'd expect to have a lot more of the smaller aftershocks but you will get a big one every now and again as well," said Goff.There were reports of a house collapse as well as other homes damaged in the Marlborough region, and stuff.co.nz reported landslides in nearby Ward.New Zealanders were quick to jump on social media, to let friends and family know they were safe.The Australian Associated Press reported around 2,500 homes without power in the Wellington region; however, most were restored within the hour.Wellington Free Ambulance service told AAP they had received a spike in calls but could not confirm any injuries, and the fire service responded to a few calls from alarms tripped by the quake and some people stuck in lifts.There were also reports of power lines brought down in the Seddon area.People were leaving Wellington in large numbers as many office workers were sent home, resulting in heavy traffic and buses reportedly full, leaving large queues.Keep calm #wellington #respect each other take your time! pic.twitter.com/xTClcEF9a7— Dan Piper (@danpipernz) August 16, 2013  Buses are still running in central Wellington but there are massive queues.
