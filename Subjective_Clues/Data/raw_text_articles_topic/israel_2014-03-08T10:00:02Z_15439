Not enough women are progressing to the top levels of the civil service and private sectors, according to a report by the state comptroller, Justice Yosef Shapira, released to coincide with International Women's Day.Shapira, whose job it is to supervise and review government policies and operations, said previous Israeli governments had not done enough to address gender inequality.The report states that 64% of the public sector workforce are women, but less than 13% of senior officials are women. In 2013 there were six director-generals out of a total of 30.The situation is particularly bad in the defence ministry, the ministry of religious services, in government-run hospitals and the Israeli police, the report finds.A Kyrgyzstan-born woman who worked for Canada's financial intelligence service for nearly 18 months was denied top secret clearance and fired from Ottawa's bureaucracy after socialising with Russian officials.There is no suggestion that the intelligence analyst, Irina Koulatchenko, did anything illegal.The decision comes weeks after police arrested a naval intelligence officer on charges that he had sold sensitive files to Moscow between 2007 and 2012 – a case that led to increased scrutiny of soldiers and civil servants in Canada.S Swapna, a 23-year-old transgender woman, is campaigning for permission to apply for a job in public service from the government or the agency which conducts the civil service entrance examination.She fought for the legal right to be allowed to sit the public service entrance exam in the Indian state of Tamil Nudu, and has now set her sights on central government.There is currently no identity provision for transgender people in the application form.Swapna had to quit her MA in Tamil literature after being forced to leave home when her family learned about her gender.Prime minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif said high-performing civil servants should be rewarded to boost the standard of the civil service, at a meeting about civil service reforms.Sharif discussed various proposals to improve the performance grading process, in a briefing with the finance minister, the minister for planning and others. It was stated that compensation should be based on the official's position, workload and competency.• Want your say? Email us at public.leaders@theguardian.com.
