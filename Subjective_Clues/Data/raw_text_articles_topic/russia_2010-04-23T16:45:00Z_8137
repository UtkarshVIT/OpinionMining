A new row has erupted in the Caucasus after Georgia's president blamed Russia for a foiled attempt last month to smuggle highly enriched uranium across the volatile border.Moscow today accused Mikheil Saakashvili of lying after he declared that such nuclear seizures have been "mostly from the direction of Russia"."This is not the first time Saakashvili has been caught red-handed while making false statements," the Russian foreign ministry spokesman Igor Lyakin-Frolov said, according to the Associated Press. "He shouldn't present a lie as the truth."The row has inflamed longstanding tensions that erupted into open warfare in 2008 over control of South Ossetia, a pro-Russian separatist enclave inside Georgia.While not explicitly pointing the finger at Moscow, Saakashvili linked the most recent case – and previous uranium smuggling incidents in 2003 and 2006 – to the continued Russian military presence in South Ossetia and another enclave, Abkhazia, since the conflict. All but one of the border crossings between Russia and Georgia run through the two enclaves."If you are legally in occupation then you are responsible for controlling proliferation," Saakashvili told AP this week.Georgian officials have told the Guardian the seized uranium was highly enriched – "over 70%" – making it potentially suitable for a nuclear weapon, but the amount involved was small, measured in grams rather than kilograms. About 25kg would be needed for a warhead made from highly enriched uranium.The officials said the gang had been caught in a sting operation, and they had told would-be buyers it was a sample of a bigger batch.The news appears to echo the 2006 case of Oleg Khinsagov, a petty smuggler from North Ossetia – a Russian territory across the international border from South Ossetia. Khinsagov had also claimed the sample was part of a larger quantity. If the latest seized uranium proves to be from the same sample, it would add weight to fears that a significant quantity of fissile material may have been stolen after the fall of the Soviet Union. Not all the Soviet arsenal of nuclear material has been accounted for. It is unclear whether that is because some was taken or because of weaknesses in Soviet-era accounting.
