The Wall Street Journal is preparing to defend a lawsuit from Monaco-based hedge fund SRM Global over the publication of allegedly confidential financial information.The case, which will be held in the high court in London, centres on two articles published on WSJ.com in August, according to a report in the Financial Times.The reports, which carried the headlines "Woods Fund Takes a Beating" and "Hedge Fund Suffers Sharp Losses", disclosed that the fund run by former UBS trader Jon Wood had allegedly lost about 85% of its value since it was founded in 2006.This information was allegedly circulated to investors then passed on to a London-based WSJ journalist without SRM Global's consent, according to the FT.SRM Global's lawsuit reportedly claims the data was confidential and published in "flagrant disregard of its rights".The WSJ is claiming the articles were "responsible journalism on matters of legitimate public interest".A victory for SRM Global would potentially make it harder for media organisations to publish information that has been circulated to investors.The hedge fund was the largest shareholder in Northern Rock before the bank was nationalised and held a large stake in US home loan provider Countrywide.· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
