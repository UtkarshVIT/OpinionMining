China dramatically raised the stakes with Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto today when it charged four of the company's employees with industrial espionage and bribery.The move will also increase tension between Beijing and Australia because one of the employees is an Australian national, as well as cast a cloud over iron-ore price negotiations between China and western mining companies.The four Rio staff were detained last July and are being held in a prison in Shanghai. They are accused of using improper means to obtain commercial secrets from the country's steel industry and using that information to increase the price that China pays for its iron ore imports.China's Xinhua state news agency reported the prosecutor's office as saying that the four had "exploited their positions to seek gain for others, and numerous times either sought or illegally accepted massive bribes from a number of Chinese steel firms". No date has yet been set for a trial.Rio refused to comment but in the past has denied that its staff have been involved in any wrongdoing.China's latest move comes as Rio and other international mining groups attempt to clinch a contract to supply Chinese steel mills with iron ore for 12 months from April 2010. The Chinese have balked at demands for a price increase of up to 40% and negotiations remain deadlocked.Last year, talks broke down after Beijing refused to agree to prices agreed by the companies with South Korea and Japan. That left China to buy iron ore on the open market – a more expensive option when prices are soaring as they are today, unlike much of last year when commodity prices were slumping.The arrest of Rio's employees soured relations between Beijing and Canberra, which views their imprisonment as a provocative act at a time when China has emerged as Australia's biggest trading partner; Australia accounted for 42% of Chinese iron ore imports in 2008.The Australian national being held is Stern Hu, Rio's sales chief in China. Recently, Martin Ferguson, the Australian minister for resources and energy, said: "I hope that the issue is drawing to a fast ­conclusion, both from a point of view of our relationship with China and from the point of view of Stern Hu and his family."Some observers believe that deliberate attempts may be being made to prolong the detentions ahead of further talks between China and the steel producers. In the City, some investors have alleged that the arrest of the "Rio Four" was a straightforward act of retaliation on the part of the Chinese authorities as it came only a few weeks after Rio turned down a huge investment offer from Chinalco, China's state-owned aluminium group. Instead, Rio opted for a deal with BHP.
