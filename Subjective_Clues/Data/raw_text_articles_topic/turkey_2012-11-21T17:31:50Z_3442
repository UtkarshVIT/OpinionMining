Turkey has formally requested the deployment of Nato Patriot missiles on its territory in what it called a defensive measure against the threat of attack from Syria.The upgraded Patriot system that Turkey has requested can intercept both incoming missiles and aircraft, but Ankara has insisted that it would not be used to enforce a no-fly zone, but only to act as a defensive measure should Syria launch an attack. However, the move would bring Nato one step closer to involvement in the Syrian conflict.The alliance's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said the alliance would discuss it "without delay" and would send an advance team to Turkey next week to explore potential sites for the Patriot system. Rasmussen added that it was up to the countries which have the Patriot launchers and advanced missiles that Ankara is requesting – Germany, the Netherlands and the US – to decide whether they could provide them. The last time Patriot missiles were deployed in Turkey, at the time of the Iraq invasion in 2003, the system was provided by Germany and the Netherlands. Both governments have approached their parliaments to ask approval."Such a deployment would augment Turkey's air defence capabilities to defend the population and territory of Turkey," Rasmussen said in his statement confirming receipt of the Turkish letter of request. "It would contribute to the de-escalation of the crisis along Nato's south-eastern border. And it would be a concrete demonstration of Alliance solidarity and resolve."He noted that: "In its letter, the Turkish government stressed that the deployment will be defensive only, and that it will in no way support a no-fly zone or any offensive operation."A Nato official noted that Turkey had a formidable air force that could deal with the threat of Syrian warplanes encroaching into Turkish airspace but it did not have a means of intercepting incoming missiles, a capability that has added significance as Syria is believed to have chemical weapons.
