Greece is expected to return to the bond market in the coming days in a critical first test of a significant agreement by EU leaders to resolve the country's debt crisis.Exploiting the euphoria generated by the EU's long-awaited decision to save the indebted nation with a last-resort rescue plan last week, Athens is poised to tap public debt markets with a €5bn (£4.5bn) bond issue, according to Greek media.The sale, first mooted by the head of Greece's public debt management agency, Petros Christodoulou, would help to tackle the country's deficit, which stands at 12.7% of GDP.Buoyed by the decision of the European Central Bank, also announced last week, to continue to accept Greece's debt as collateral, Christodoulou told the Financial Times: "We would like to return to the markets within March."Greece is faced with a €300bn debt. This year it has to raise a staggering €55bn, with at least €16bn needed to service maturing debts between now and the end of May. The EU rescue plan, struck after months of wrangling, provides backstop support through a combination of loans from eurozone countries and aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the event that an indebted member state is unable to refinance itself.In the case of Greece, it is hoped that the deal will also lower the country's unprecedented premiums. Recent market forays have seen it pay yields on its sovereign debt in excess of 6%, nearly twice as high as the eurozone's benchmark German bund at 3.16%.Within hours of the deal being reached at an EU summit in Brussels, the Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, described it as sending a "very positive signal to the markets". While the objective was "never to use" the mechanism, it was hoped that its mere existence would "send a clear message to speculators", who have been blamed for the recent exorbitant rise in the country's borrowing costs."We will find an opportune time to go out on the market," he told reporters, looking visibly relieved.Analysts say that much rests on the bond sale. A positive response will not only provide relief from the crippling effect of high interest rates, it will also give Greece the breathing space to forge ahead with structural reforms deemed vital for an economy in the midst of recession and set to contract by 2% this year.Without dramatic further cuts to the bloated public sector and privatisation of loss-making state-run utilities, Greece still faces the risk of bankruptcy, said Miranda Xafa, the country's former representative at the IMF. Under the country's fiscal consolidation programme, the governing socialists have pledged to push ahead this year with the overhaul of the tax and pension systems – reforms that have previously met with stiff resistance from powerful Greek unions.Returning from Brussels, Papandreou told Greeks he would prioritise the passage of legislation that will spur growth and development by opening up what local experts now readily describe as Europe's last Stalinist economy. Cutting red tape to bring in badly needed foreign investment is also a priority.Strikes and protests have greeted the government's efforts to revamp the tax system – the first structural reform of which will be discussed in parliament this week. In a reaction to the threat of taxes being increased among higher-income earners, an estimated €10bn has been moved by wealthy Greeks to Switzerland and Cyprus.The Greek Orthodox Church, the country' biggest landowner, has also responded vehemently to suggestions that it should pay increased taxes, including a 20% levy on the commercial use of properties. "It is a myth that the church is in possession of legendary wealth," its spiritual leader, Archbishop Ieronymos, said. "It is not fair that we should be asked to pay these sums without any discussion."But with a 15 May deadline to report to the European Commission on progress made under its growth and development programme, the government appears determined.Yesterday, it said it would resort to new technologies to track down tax evaders. "Swimming pools that have been built but not declared will be located with the help of Google Earth," said Dimitris Yenakopoulos, a senior official at the ministry of economy.
