The Calvert Journal introduced us to 24 photographers changing the way the world sees Russia on the Guardian New East this week. From the pre-Sochi gay scene to life in the freezing north, a new generation of photographers offering a fresh take on Russian life. What do you think of the shots? What's missing and can you help us fill in the gaps? We want you see your photos of daily life in Russia that sum up national identity. If you are celebrating Russia Day we'd love to see photos of that too.
