BP has unveiled plans for a $7bn spending spree in the Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico.It has agreed to pay that amount to US producer Devon Energy for assets in the region which will help it meet its production growth target and also give it entry into Brazil. At the same time BP is selling Devon a 50% stake in its Kirby oil sands venture in Canada for $500m. Analysts said it was difficult to tell whether BP was paying a good price since the assets included fields which were still being explored. In addition the Brazil operations are in the Campos basin, rather than Santos where some major discoveries have been made.So BP's shares have slipped 5.3p to 619.6p, knocking nearly 4 points off the FTSE 100. Overall the leading index is pausing for breath after its recent gains, falling 18.05 points to 5622.52. Owen Ireland at ODL Securities said:The markets are taking a breather and it appears that traders are using this time to plot the next move. There is an air of uneasiness – the run up has slowed, and has almost come to a standstill. It feels as if we are at a pivotal point of the year – will the run continue, or are we set for a leg down?"Other fallers included Smith and Nephew. The medical equipment group is down 21p to 674.5p after news last night that a US court had ruled against the company and in favour of Kinetic Concepts in a patent dispute. S&N said it would seek to overturn the ruling.Insurer Old Mutual has fallen 2.6p to 121p after it announced a shake-up including disposing of its US life and asset management businesses via a sale and flotation respectively, to reduce its debt by £1.5bn. Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said:The issue is that the group remains highly vulnerable to market conditions both in terms of the likelihood of disposals and IPO (proceeds to be used to pay down debt) but also on the issues in its Bermuda business. Hence, despite the 32% discount to our 2010 forecast MCEV net asset value of 180p, we reiterate our hold recommendation.
