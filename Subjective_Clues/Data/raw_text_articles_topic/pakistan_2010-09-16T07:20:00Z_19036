The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for murdering journalist Misri Khan in Hangu, in the northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and have issued a threat to attack other journalists.A Taliban spokesman said: "We killed him because he twisted the facts. He had a leaning towards the army in what he wrote... There will be other attacks against those who speak out against the Taliban."Khan was shot dead on Tuesday outside his office. He had previously told colleagues he had received threats. His agency's office had also been set on fire.Source: Reporters Without Borders
