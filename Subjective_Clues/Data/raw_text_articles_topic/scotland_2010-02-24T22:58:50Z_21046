Two climbers died today when they fell 1,500ft after setting off an avalanche on one of Scotland's most dangerous mountains near Glencoe, Scotland.The men were climbing with another companion who escaped being engulfed by the avalanche and being carried down the steep ridge in an area known as Curved Ridge at Buachaille Etive Mor.The group had finished their climb and were making their descent when the accident occurred. Three people died last year in the same area."They were not far from the exact spot," said John Grieve, leader of Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team. "But, ironically, they had thought that exact route was too dangerous and were making their way in what they thought was a safer descent. The two men in front set off an avalanche and they fell 1,500ft down the steep icy face."Another group of climbers finished the descent with the third man, hoping to find his two companions."They found avalanche debris and a hand sticking out of the snow and dug out the two men.But they were obviously dead," Grieve said.A Northern Constabulary spokesman said no further details would be released until all next of kin had been informed.The Glencoe avalanche was the second suspected avalanche to happen in Scotland yesterday. A man was also injured in an avalanche at Cic Hut on the north face of Ben Nevis. He was found in Coire Na Ciste after falling several hundred feet from an ice climb.Rescue teams, including a helicopter, airlifted him to Belford Hospital in Fort William with serious injuries. He is expected to be transferred to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow for further treatment.Police said inquiries into the accident were continuing.The area commander chief inspector, John Chisholm, said: "We are expecting more severe weather and heavy snowfalls over the next couple of days. Any climbers going on to the hills should check the latest reports issued by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service and the latest weather reports."In January last year, three men were killed in an avalanche in the same area. Eamonn Murphy, 61, from Carrickfergus, Co Antrim, and his brother John Murphy, 63, from Portrush, Co Antrim, died along with Brian Murray, 46, from Monifieth, Tayside, when they were swept away by thousands of tonnes of snow on Buachaille Etive Mor.
