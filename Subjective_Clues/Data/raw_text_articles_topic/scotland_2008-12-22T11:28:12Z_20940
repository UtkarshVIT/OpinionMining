Among the responsibilities of Scotland's devolved parliament are such matters as justice, transport and education. But it has also apparently got a new one – paying tribute to AC/DC.Christine Grahame, MSP for South of Scotland, has filed a new motion entitled AC/DC, We Salute You. And while electricians may be excited at the prospect of celebrating alternating and direct currents, it's not energised matter Grahame has on her mind – it's rock'n'roll."After 35 years AC/DC are still contributing to music and giving fans enjoyment worldwide," the Scottish Nationalist MSP told BBC News. "I think they have long-deserved official recognition from their homeland ... and my parliamentary motion will go some way towards recognising that."The We Salute You motion is intended to formally welcome AC/DC to Scotland, recognise the band's Scottish roots, applaud their growing popularity, and thank them for the inspiration they've given to Scottish musicians.Angus and Malcolm Young, founding members of AC/DC, were born in Glasgow but later moved with their family to Australia, while former front man Bon Scott, who died in 1980, was born in Kirriemuir."It is clear Scott had a strong sense of his identity, from the 'Scotland forever' tattoo he had on his arm to his playing the bagpipes on the AC/DC track It's a Long Way to the Top," Grahame emphasised.AC/DC have sold more than 150 million albums worldwide since forming in 1973. They are to tour the UK next summer, in support of their new album, Black Ice. Grahame is particularly keen for the band to repeat a gesture from 1978, when they wore Scottish football strips at a Glasgow concert."It would be fitting if they were to do the same when the band play Hampden national football stadium next June," Grahame said.In return, perhaps Holyrood's MSPs could don AC/DC t-shirts.
