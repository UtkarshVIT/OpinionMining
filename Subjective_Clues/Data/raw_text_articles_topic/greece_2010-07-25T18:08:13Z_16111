Officials from the European commission, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank (ECB) will today begin a two-week mission to Greece to assess progress in implementing economic reforms, three months after the nation was handed a huge bailout.In an interview at the weekend, the Greek finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, said that the nation had begun to turn the corner, with the support of €110bn (£90bn) in emergency aid and after unprecedented austerity measures had been put in place."We have met the conditions that needed to be implemented by the end of June [in exchange for the rescue package] and we have actually taken further measures ahead of time," he said, on the eve of the crucial visit. "The programme is bearing fruit."In light of the progress, Athens would have no problem drawing down a second instalment of €9bn in loans to cover its borrowing requirements in September, Papaconstantinou told the weekend edition of Kosmo tou Ependyti (Investors' World).Greece narrowly avoided defaulting on its sovereign debt when it was injected with an initial rescue payment of €20bn in May. But under the exacting criteria of the EU and IMF-sponsored package, further cash injections will depend on headway made in enforcing the austerity plan.The visiting mission of experts from the EU, ECB and IMF is expected to urge the ruling socialists to expedite legislation that will increase the economy's notoriously low competitiveness by opening closed-shop professions and privatising loss-making utilities.Over the weekend the Greek media reported that pressure was growing for the closure of much of the nation's railway network, which loses up to €2.5m a day.Draconian budget deficit cuts aimed at saving €30bn by 2014 have ranged from a clampdown on state spending, repeated VAT hikes and cuts to civil servants' pay and pensions. The verdict, so far, appears to be good. This month Greek optimism was reinforced by an interim IMF report that noted the "considerable progress" the country was making in putting "public finances on a sustainable path". In a similar report, the EU commission said that Athens' ambitious goal of cutting the budget deficit from 13.6% in 2009 to 8.1% by the end of this year was "generally on track".After months in which Greece was effectively shut out of capital markets, there were signs that funding pressure was also easing after the high-risk, but relatively successful, sale of short-term treasury bills on the open market.Last week, to deflect criticism that it is unable to produce reliable financial data, Athens inaugurated its first independent statistics agency. In the course of such efforts, it has won praise from unexpected places, with the German economic newspaper Handelsblatt opining: "Europeans can now learn from Greece, rather than Germany, how to consolidate a budget."But with a debt mountain in excess of €300bn – by far the biggest in the EU – and an economy expected to contract by 4% this year, Greece is by no means out of the woods.Worsening recession, partly as a result of the austerity measures, has meant that VAT revenues have fallen short of government targets, while higher taxes are driving a growing number of international monopolies out of Greece.Fears abound that the country's debt problems could yet spread to other vulnerable eurozone member states if structural reforms to spur growth fail to be enacted soon. The government's inability to stymie expenditure overruns in the healthcare system and public enterprises has also raised alarm.The government has also called for the consolidation of the banking system to help boost market liquidity – Greece's state-run ATE bank was among seven European lenders that failed bank stress tests on Friday.But such reforms will not be easy. Although many Greeks privately admit that outside intervention was the only way of making a discredited political system tackle the vested interests needed to overhaul an economy teetering on the verge of collapse, criticism of both the EU and IMF has been virulent.Militant unionists and leftist parties have vowed to step up protests after the summer break. Strikes by truck drivers, who work in one of the country's biggest "closed" professions, will further pile pressure on the government this week to slow down the pace of reforms.Dissent is also growing within the ruling Pasok party over policies that senior socialist cadres fear will lead, inevitably, to a "social explosion" in the coming months.
