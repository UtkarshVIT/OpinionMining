Australia has launched its first armed combat mission against Islamic State (Isis) in Iraq, but did not strike any targets.Two RAAF Super Hornets were “on call to attack targets”, Defence said in a statement, but the aircraft “did not use their munitions”.They took off from the Australian support base in the United Arab Emirates shortly after 2pm local time on Sunday (2100 AEDT).The chief of the Defence force, Mark Binskin, confirmed the mission on Twitter and said the planes had returned safely to base. 2 F/A-18F completed 1st armed combat mission in Iraq. No munitions expended. Returned safely to base.An RAAF KC-30A airborne refuelling aircraft and its Wedgetail airborne early warning and control aircraft were also in the air over Iraq on Sunday.The Wedgetail wasn’t specifically supporting the Australian aircraft but directing coalition aircraft.Aircraft from the US, UK, France, UAE, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain have all conducted attacks against Isis in Iraq.On Friday the cabinet’s national security committee gave the go-ahead for combat missions and the deployment of special forces to advise and assist Iraqi forces. The special forces were still waiting for approval to deploy from the Iraqi government, Defence said.The department insisted no details of the mission be released until after midnight local time to allow for safe return of all aircraft.On Sunday the Defence Minister, David Johnston, stressed the need for careful targeting as Australia joined the international coalition of forces attacking Isis in Iraq. He said Australian defence forces were “one of the most restrictive” when it came to avoiding civilian casualties.“This aspect of our operations is at the forefront of our mind,” he said.“Our risk assessments, the way we do our targeting, the way we conduct our operations, particularly in a counter-insurgency, is focused almost exclusively as a first point on ‘Let’s not get this wrong, let’s not have any civilian casualties, let’s stay focused on the task.’”It would be impossible to deal successfully with Isis “if we are causing collateral damage”.
