I was born and raised in a socialist collective established by women and men eager to throw off the shackles of their traditional religious upbringing and embrace modern secular notions of equality in the new state of Israel.By the time I came along, a third generation to this small kibbutz, the system was already unravelling. Even so, the ideals behind this egalitarian society were as steadfast as ever and my mother installed me in the "children's home" days after my birth to be collectively raised by all the women in the kibbutz on a rotational basis.This unusual upbringing left its mark in my fierce determination to ensure all girls grow up in a world where the welfare of each child is everyone's concern. It also proved to me that women's participation in public life doesn't ensure more equal distribution of responsibilities in the home. In hindsight, I realise that although my mother was working in the banana fields alongside my father, she was also spending some of her nights watching over the babies in the children's home while he enjoyed a full night's sleep.Over the past three decades the kibbutz system has fallen apart. My own parents now live in a small town, and women's participation in Israeli public and political life has stagnated. The percentage of women in Israel's parliament has remained at an inadequate 14% for over a decade, and this is more than just a failure to translate women's gains in employment and education into decision-making bodies. I believe it is having a detrimental effect on foreign policy, which is increasingly being dictated by ex-military generals and other members of the "old boys' club".During my lifetime I have seen women's role as mothers acknowledged in influential political movements such as 4 Mothers, which successfully lobbied the Israeli government to withdraw from southern Lebanon. However, a true women-led movement that would unite Israeli, Arab-Israeli and Palestinian women in a shared call for an end to aggression on all sides is still a distant dream.I hope it won't take another 100 years for women to be able to influence the decisions that affect their lives, for men to take on their fair share of work at home, and for us all to be able to get a good night's sleep.
