Forget corridors of power: behind the black front door of Number Ten, Skye, it's the interiors that carry weight. Recently awarded Visit Scotland's highest five-star rating, Number Ten boasts self-catering accommodation as dramatic as Skye's landscape. In the bedroom, a black chandelier, stained-glass windows and a "subtly perfumed" whisky barrel bedhead set the tone; the living area features vast windows and a wood-burning stove. Owners Diane, a designer-artist, and Alan, a musician, supply wine, eggs, bacon, bread, butter and fruit on arrival, while the award-winning Three Chimneys restaurant is nearby. Spectacularly located at the end of a single-track road overlooking Loch Dunvegan, it's the perfect spot to indulge Crusoe tendencies - and for would-be drummers to practise (Alan offers tuition) without fear of annoying the neighbours. • Sleeps 2. From £900 per week, £450 for three days (includes welcome pack). 01470 511795, number10-skye.co.uk.
