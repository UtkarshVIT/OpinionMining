Heavy rains in Mexico led to a second landslide yesterday which killed 16 people as officials admitted that exaggerated reports about an earlier slide diverted resources from other storm-hit areas.Rescue workers at the scene of the first landslide in the town of Santa Maria Tlahuitoltepec in the southern state of Oaxaca recovered the bodies of four members of a family. Eleven people were buried in mud from a nearby mountain on Tuesday after three days of rain linked to Tropical Depression Matthew.The rescue operation was scaled down when initial reports that the landslide had killed hundreds of people proved unfounded.The chief rescue official in Oaxaca, Manuel Maza, said too many rescuers were sent to the area."The tail-end of Matthew left a dozen damaged bridges and about 20 villages cut off. The mobilisation to [Santa Maria Tlahuitoltepec] distracted attention from those areas," he said.The government confirmed that more people were killed yesterday in a mudslide in the neighbouring state of Chiapas."Unfortunately there has been a new landslide in Amatan, Chiapas. We are mobilising aid to help," President Felipe Calderón announced on Twitter.Laura Gurza, the chief of Mexico's emergency response agency, said 16 people were killed and 13 injured. Three people were missing after another landslide nearby."There are fears of more landslides in Chiapas, Oaxaca and the mountainous zone in this strip of territory in the country's south-east, since the ground is softened, is saturated," Gurza said.Questions continue to be asked about the exaggerated estimates of the scale of the mudslide in Santa Maria Tlahuitoltepec. Municipal authorities informed the government about the landslide by satellite phone immediately after it happened at about 4am on Tuesday."We didn't know how many houses had been buried because it was dark so we estimated," the mayor, Antonio Martínez, said. "We didn't count them at first."A few hours later the state governor, Ulises Ruiz, estimated the dead at between 500 and 1,000. The authorities had already launched an attempt to get to the town, but their progress along the unpaved mountain road was hampered by smaller landslides and a collapsed bridge.Heavy cloud cover prevented helicopters from landing or providing a clear view from the air. Calderón assured Mexicans everything was being done to get to the area, the US embassy offered help, and local organisations began collecting donations to help survivors.When the first contingent of state rescue workers and soldiers reached the town on Tuesday afternoon, after walking for several hours, they found considerable destruction in one small part of the town of some 9,000 inhabitants.Two houses were buried, two partly covered and 30 more in the path of the unstable mud flow.The authorities said 200 people were being evacuated from areas of the town in danger from further landslides.Mexico has been experiencing one of the most intense rainy seasons on record with large areas under water in lowland regions of Oaxaca and other southern states.Landslides are a danger in mountainous parts of the country, particularly those such as Oaxaca where there has been severe deforestation.
