A notorious paedophile who moved to Australia more than 50 years ago arrived back in the UK today after he was deported by the Queensland authorities.Raymond Horne was released yesterday after serving a 12-year sentence for abusing two homeless boys, and was immediately put on a plane to London. He arrived at Heathrow airport with his head covered by a blanket where he was met by police.The Australian authorities had planned to keep the 61-year-old in custody indefinitely but immigration officials decided to revoke his visa and deport him.Despite having emigrated with his family from Britain to Queensland in 1952, Horne never took Australian citizenship and was declared an "unlawful non-citizen".The Brisbane Courier Mail reported that a prison doctor said the risk of paedophiles such as Horne reoffending increased after deportation due to their heightened anxiety.The Home Office said: "Where it is known that a sex offender convicted in another country is to be deported to the UK, he is met at the port of entry by the police who interview him and pass any relevant information to the police in the area to which the offender is proposing to live."Horne will be placed on the sex offenders register, meaning he will face a five-year jail sentence if found alone with a child or near a playground.Horne was first jailed in 1968 for two months for abusing boys. In 1992 he was again imprisoned for indecently assaulting children.His latest sentence was imposed after he raped two homeless boys, aged 13 and 15, while working for a charity. The judge described Horne as "a persistent sex offender who preyed upon young, vulnerable boys", according to the Courier Mail.The Queensland police and corrective services minister, Judy Spence, said the state would be a safer place without Horne.
