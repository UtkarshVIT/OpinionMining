AustraliaBy Paul MacInnes (with apologies to Stuart Beattie, Baz Luhrmann, Ronald Harwood and Richard Flanagan)EXT. THE OUTBACK â€“ DAYThe beautiful and thin LADY SARAH ASHLEY and her lover/inspiration/ cowherd DROVER are outside their successful farm FARAWAY DOWNS. DINGOS, KANGAROOS and KOALA are frolicking by the BILLABONGDROVER (singing gaily)There's no business like cow business, like no business I know! Everything about it is appealing! Everything the traffic (of premium livestock) will allow!LADY SARAH(giggling)Oh my goodness, you're singing a song, you ruggedly handsome man of the outback with whom my fortunes are intertwined! You couldn't be butcher if you tried!DROVERI'm not butcher, I'm Drover! (laughs heartily, then starts chopping some LOGS with his TOP off)LADY SARAH (giggling)Oh sir! Why, I'm blushing! Oh how I wish this were a musical! It would be so much fun!DROVER stops chopping. He stands erect, the sweat DRIPPING down his muscular, honed BODY. His EYES, like burnished EMERALDS, fix LADY SARAH with a stern glare that cuts to your very SOUL, taking all your CLOTHES off in the processDROVERSarah, stop this madness now. This movie could never be a musical, no matter how much you, I, or indeed the director might have wished it.LADY SARAH (now serious)But why?DROVERBecause if it were a musical, this movie could not address the terrible plight of the Aborigines.Huge storm CLOUDS swarm over the sky. They are bright and full of contrast, almost as if somebody had spent five weeks souping them up on a COMPUTER. The camera pulls back from the clouds. It retreats 500 miles to show both the sheer scale of Australia and also that this movie has a budget of 130 million American dollars. It then zooms in once again, on to the beautiful face of an innocent Aboriginal boy. His name is NULLA. He's magic.NULLAI'm not a white fella or a brown fella. I'm a creamy fella. I'm the type of fella Baz Luhrmann would like to represent me country, Australia. Because if we try we can all get on together, see? And if we all get on, there's nothing wrong with purloining Aboriginal myth to brighten up an otherwise formulaic western in the mould of Honda.PAN across the immense DESERT. An old Aboriginal MAN is standing on one LEG at the top of a CLIFF. CLOSE-UP on his FACE. He is incredibly wise and would never hurt a FLY (which is the lead baddie's main hobby). His name is KING GEORGEKING GEORGE (singing directly at Nulla, hundreds of miles away)You tell 'em mate! Stick it to the white fella! I bloody love you!KING GEORGE becomes overexcited and falls over. Time moves on and, for no especial reason, we're suddenly in the middle of the second world war. The JAPANESE are attacking Darwin and DROVER is saving scores of Aboriginal CHILDREN. Alongside is his best Aboriginal friend, MAGARRI. CGI gunsmoke is all around.DROVERWe're being overrun by the Japs!MAGARRIYou go Drover! Take the kids back to safety! I'll hold off the Japs! And, inevitably, die ...DROVERThis reminds me of a song from Oklahoma! "It's a scandal. It's an outrage! On our manhood it's a blot! Where is the leader who will save us, and be the first man to be shot?"MAGARRISo do you want me to hold off the Japs and, inevitably, die then or not?DROVERYes, please, my boon chum. After all who would you want to raise a clan of abandoned Aboriginal children? An Aborigine? Or a hunky white stockman with the grace of a ballet dancer!DROVER JUMPS into the air and performs a beautiful PIROUETTEC'mon kids! Let's go! Last one to the scary thin lady is a croc sandwich!The sound of MAGARRI being mercilessly executed echoes briefly, only to be replaced with beautiful birdsong. The clouds clear, the sun shines, it is the DAWN of a BRIGHT TOMORROW.
