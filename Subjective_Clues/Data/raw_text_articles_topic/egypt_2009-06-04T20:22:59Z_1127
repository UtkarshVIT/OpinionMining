Barack Obama moved briskly wherever he went in Egypt today –down the steps of Air Force One, up the steps of the palace to embrace Hosni Mubarak, and then on to the podium at Cairo University to give his long-­heralded speech to the Muslim world.Every part of his day was choreographed and broadcast live on Egyptian TV, from the lance-wielding cavalry escort before talks with Mubarak at the Qubbeh palace to his guided tour – with a headscarfed Hillary Clinton in tow – of a medieval Cairo mosque. Last stop before leaving for Germany was the Giza Pyramids, where he was escorted, wearing jeans and T-shirt instead of his earlier dark suit, by Egypt's flamboyant antiquities chief, Zahi Hawass.On arrival in Egypt, the president stood stock still, with hand across heart, as an Egyptian army band boomed out the Star-Spangled Banner, a tad off-key and far too heavy on the cymbals.Obama saw little of ordinary Cairenes, as many took an enforced day off work while this sprawling capital's normally traffic-choked, sunbaked streets were cleared for his motorcade of black limousines, trucks and vans.Police easily foiled a protest planned by the secular group Kefaya (Enough) in front of the US embassy against what it called America's "unchangeable policies and double standards in dealing with the problems of the Middle East".Mubarak, strikingly, did not attend the president's speech. Perhaps it was ill health – he is 84 and is mourning the recent loss of a grandson – or a way of avoiding Obama's clear though carefully non-­specific strictures about democracy, freedom and accountability, all absent for nearly 80 million Egyptians.Rehan, a 27-year-old cleaner, felt the key issue was peace between Israel and the Palestinians, the issue that has involved Egypt in four wars, dominated its foreign policy for 60 years and led to the country's isolation when Anwar Sadat dared to break Arab ranks in 1977. "Inshallah, maybe Obama can succeed," he said. "We are very happy he is here."But there is a strong sense of apathy, especially about the prospects for internal change in the absence of international pressure.The piles of rubbish normally rotting in front of the university campus had been cleared away for the occasion, giving rise to sarcastic jokes from passers-by before the area was sealed off.Some were irritated by the religious focus of Obama's speech, held in conjunction with al-Azhar University, the nearest that mainstream Sunni Islam has to a centre of theological authority. "Not everyone wants to be portrayed as politically Muslim," complained Hisham Kassem, a secular politician and editor who was in the audience for the speech.Praise for Obama was mixed with scepticism. The previous secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, was here five years ago, promising to promote democracy, but that was abandoned in favour of "stability". One political scientist, Ezzedine Fishere-Shoukri, was disappointed by the speech: "People like Obama and trust him, but what's really new here in terms of policies?"Ibrahim Eissa, editor of the independent al-Dustur newspaper and a critic of the regime, turned down an invitation to attend. "If I went it would mean the problem was just with Bush, but the problem is with US policies in the world, which haven't yet changed."
