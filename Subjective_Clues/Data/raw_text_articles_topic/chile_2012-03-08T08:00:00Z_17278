Last month, the Chilean president Sebastián Piñera celebrated the fact that 30,000 women have taken up an offer of extended maternity leave, allowing mothers six months off rather than three. The new parental leave law came in last October and is regarded by the current government as the biggest achievement for women's rights in recent years. And it is important. But maternity rights are not the only ones that matter and we can only wait to see how this new law will affect female employment.Chile has one of the lowest percentages of female presence in the labour market in Latin America: while the average of the continent is 53%, in Chile it is only 42%. And this new law may be a new barrier.Then there is the quality of jobs on offer. Women earn 35.4% less than men in the same position, despite a law to prohibit this.One more achievement of the past year was Congress discussing the possibility of allowing therapeutic abortion. Chile is one of the six countries in the world that does not allow abortion in any scenario, and this discussion is as far as we have gone in more than 20 years. At least it was a beginning.This debate may have gone ahead faster if there were more women involved, but only 13.9% of members of our Congress are female. As this is an election year, to celebrate International Women's Day Chileans will demonstrate to raise awareness of that low presence of women in politics and its effects.We still have a long way to go regarding women's rights in Chile, but the good news is that we are more aware about this reality than ever and are taking an active role to make the necessary changes happen.• To comment on this article please visit our interactive map of what can be celebrated around the world this International Women's Day
