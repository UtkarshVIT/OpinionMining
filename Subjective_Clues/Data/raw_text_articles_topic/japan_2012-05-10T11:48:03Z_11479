Harry Potter is heading off to Japan following the announcement that a new theme park attraction based on JK Rowling's famous boy wizard is to open at Universal Studios' Osaka site in 2014.This Japanese attraction will be the third of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme parks. The first was opened in 2010 as a section of Universal's Islands of Adventure site at its resort in Orlando, Florida; a second, at Universal Studios park in Hollywood, California, is under construction and looks set to open in 2016. Hogwarts Castle will sit at the apex of each attraction, and visitors can also dine at the Three Broomsticks pub, pick up a wand at Ollivander's store or snack on sweets from Hogsmead's famous Honeyduke's sweet shop.Demand is likely to be high at the new Japanese Potter park. The seven films in the series have grossed more than $893m in Japan and been seen in cinemas by more than 78 million people."I was delighted to experience and enjoy the attention to detail, creativity and superb craft that went into the first Wizarding World in Orlando," said Rowling. "I am equally delighted that the same level of expertise and enjoyment will translate to the new park in Japan."So far there is no sign that the Wizarding World franchise is likely to arrive in Britain, where the Potter stories are ostensibly set, but the UK does have Warner Bros' The Making of Harry Potter in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, which opened in March and features sets used to film scenes in the Hogwarts Great Hall, Dumbledore's Office, Diagon Alley, the Ministry of Magic and Gryffindor Common Room among other attractions.
