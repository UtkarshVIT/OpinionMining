Deeba and her friend Zanna find themselves in mortal danger when they discover the city of UnLondon. UnLondon is full of walking and flying buses; houses made from all sorts of materials; ghosts and half-ghosts; not to mention the living umbrellas!Deeba and Zanna make all sorts of strange friends in UnLondon before they leave. Deeba and her group of out-of-this-worldly friends join the battle against the Terrible Cloud Smog. Here starts the dangerous and challenging journey through a forest in a house and black windows to retrieve the UnGun.My favourite character is Yoric Cavea (a bird that lives in a cage on the neck of a human body) because he risks his life for Deeba and because I think he is very funny.I would recommend this book to 10+ but if you want a good long book to read you could try it.â€¢ Buy this book at the Guardian Bookshop.Want to tell the world about a book you've read?
