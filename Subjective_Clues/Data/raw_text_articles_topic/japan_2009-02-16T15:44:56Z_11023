Judging by the fevered spending spree under way at one suburban Japanese mall over the weekend, it would be easy to think that the world's second biggest economy is the victim of a phantom recession.At Food One supermarket in Fujisawa, a commuter town south of Tokyo, shoppers queue along the aisles waiting to unload baskets piled high with groceries. At nearby Uniqlo, the clothing retailer's Spring collection flies off the shelves; McDonald's employees struggle to keep up with orders for double quarter pounders with cheese.But this flurry of activity conceals a deep-seated malaise. Japan's shoppers are spending, but only on the cheapest necessities.The country's usually prodigious consumers are saving for a rainy day now that, after several years of growth, Japan is careering towards the deepest recession in its postwar history.That grim reality was underlined today with the news that the economy shrank 3.3% from October to December last year, its worst performance since the oil crisis of 1974. Many economists now expect it to remain in the doldrums until 2010.Japan's GDP has fallen for three quarters in a row at an annualised rate of 12.7%, the decline in Japanese GDP was three times that of the US during the same quarter. The US contracted by 1% during the same quarter and the eurozone by 1.5%.Described somewhat nonchalantly as the "Lehman shokku" (or shock) only a few months ago, the global crisis has left the Japanese confronting an uncomfortable truth: that everyone is an investment banker now.The Nikkei stock market average has shed 32% since September and exports are in the deep freeze. In December unemployment rose to 3.9%, its sharpest rise for 40 years, household sentiment is near a 26-year low while exporters, rocked by plunging global demand, have slashed jobs and production targets.Wholesale prices fell 0.2% in the year to January – their first drop for five years. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than half of the economy, fell 0.4% between October and December, and the Bank of Japan [BoJ] is warning of a two-year battle with deflation.Bankruptcies are up 16% from last year, with total debts among failed firms reaching ¥839bn (£6.4bn). Those that have survived the onslaught are predicting an 83% fall in profits this year and a slew of redundancies: Nissan, Panasonic, Pioneer and NEC have announced a combined 65,000 job cuts in the past month alone."There is no doubt that this is the worst economic crisis of the postwar era," the economic and fiscal policy minister, Kaoru Yosano, said yesterday, adding that the collapse of car, machinery and IT exports had "battered" the economy.Though its banks are in comparatively good shape after an enforced house-cleaning earlier this decade, Japan's huge industrial base has left it hopelessly exposed to the fallout from the US financial crisis.While Japan's leaders boast that their country will be the first to emerge into the post-recession sunlight, it is likely to fall longer and harder than any of the G7 countries except Britain, according to the International Monetary Fund.The BoJ's chief economist, Kazuo Momma, warned that, even after last quarter's miserable performance, "We have to consider the possibility that there could be an even greater decline between January and March."Some analysts share his pessimism. "One thing we've learned over the past six months is that just because things are bad doesn't mean they can't get any worse," says Richard Jerram, chief Japan economist at Macquarie Securities In Tokyo."The Japanese consumer has gone into a state of panic, and people have decided that they want to avoid any major expenditure. There has been a sentiment shock."Having seen how Japan's refusal to heed the warnings 20 years ago led to a "lost decade" of stagnation, the US response has been quick by comparison.But in a week when the Congress passed a $789bn (£550bn) stimulus package, Japan's response has been rendered impotent by political gridlock and poor leadership.Even as a resurgent opposition stalls the passage of an existing ¥10tn stimulus package, the embattled prime minister, Taro Aso, is mulling ¥20tn in additional spending.Few believe the measures, including a one-off handout of ¥12,000 for each ­citizen, will kick-start flat consumer spending or bring Aso the boost he needs before a general election that must be held by September.Monetary measures have proved just as ineffective, despite a return to ultra-low interest rates and the BoJ's offer to buy up corporate debt and shares held by banks to ease the credit flow to vulnerable companies.Even Yosano appeared to concede that the government had run out of responses to the crisis. "The situation is rapidly changing, due to factors beyond the Japanese government's control," he said.Jerram agrees. "The government will work within all of the old reference points," he said, "and whatever it decides to do will probably be insufficient and way too late. The government is in a hole but it's not prepared to consider anything wild and ambitious."It is just sitting tight and waiting for the situation in the US to improve. That is not economic policy it is economic fatalism. And it is a pretty bad way to run an economy. Japan needs to think the unthinkable but this is not a system that lends itself to change."On top of the collapse in demand for exports, Japan's other great nemesis is the inexorable rise of the yen against other major currencies.Despite exporters' calls for intervention to rein in the yen, the finance ­minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, did not raise the issue with other G7 leaders in Rome last weekend, confining himself to the safe ground of condemning the "absolute evil" of protectionism.But resistance to foreign exchange intervention – flooding the money ­markets with yen – may crumble if, as many experts believe, the dollar sinks much further."It is hard to tell when intervention will begin, but any development that takes the yen close to the 80-85 mark against the dollar before the end of this fiscal year will trigger immediate action," says Kyohei Morita, chief economist at Japan Barclays Capital. "As long as the issue is the quantity of yen in the money markets and not interest rates, then it's the finance ministry's duty to act."
