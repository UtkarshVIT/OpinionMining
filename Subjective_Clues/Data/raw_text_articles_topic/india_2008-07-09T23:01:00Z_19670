What does Nirpal Dhaliwal's "the flirtation and sensuality of Bollywood isn't fantasy - it's how they [Indians] actually live" actually mean (The sound of my ticking, July 8)? Does he mean the sad wives of the unemployed alcoholics of below-poverty-line India, or is he talking about other people?He says: "The stricter sexual mores of society mean that when people get together here they are not wracked with doubts and thoughts of greener grass." Did he speak to any women before writing his piece? It's all very well to paint a rosy picture of the subcontinent - the saris are very colourful - but the shocking levels of violence against women and female foeticide are not. For all the singing and dancing of Bollywood, I've yet to see a film about dowry harassment leading to murder. Shah Rukh Khan is unlikely to make a film about the use of rape as an instrument of social control."In India ... there's no pressure on men to prove themselves with bedpost notches," says Dhaliwal. So who uses all the trafficked prostitute-slaves, some as young as 10, down in the Kamathipura red light district of Bombay? The people of India deserve more honest journalism. This is no Shangri-La.
