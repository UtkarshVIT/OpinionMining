We ought to have seen it coming last year when Conrad Black lumbered around London's TV studios plugging his latest book – and labelling Jeremy Paxman a "priggish, gullible, British fool" along the way. Oh the wonder at seeing a baleful bear of notoriety snarling and snapping at Paxo, Adam Boulton and Co! What on earth could he do next? Silly question: obvious answer. Black was surly and snarly enough to make a great talk-show host himself.And so it comes to pass, in Canada to begin with, as Conrad takes over half the presenting duties on something called The Zoomer – Television for Boomers with zip – which, being interpreted, means current affairs for those in late middle-age. He will offer an interview "with some of the world's greats" each week, plus a feature slot called, inevitably, Talk Black, where he can play grumpy old ex-newspaper proprietor and prison reformer to his heart's content."If ever you're giving a dinner party, this is the guy you want to invite," says Black's new boss, Moses Znaimer. Yet somehow, far in the distance, you can hear Paxo singing a new song for Moses. "Who's gullible now?"Sir Ray Tindle ought, at 87, to be putting his feet up, not buying ever more struggling newspapers and putting his private company profits up by 278% in 2012 (on the latest figures). But then Ray is the wisest, canniest old bird around. They laughed a couple of years back when he began buying shares in Johnston Press at 4.5p a time. But now JP is up to 12.5p and Ray, with more than 51m of them, has seen his bank account take a £3.1m bounce – bigger, as it happens, than the £1.52m profit his papers have just recorded. Life changing as recession recedes? Perhaps. But life-affirming? Absolutely.
