David Cameron confirmed that Scotland will be given greater taxation powers, possibly including the power to set its own income tax rates, and may receive millions of pounds released by the Treasury when he spoke at the Scottish parliament today.In the first moves to live up to his promised "respect agenda" with the Scottish government in Edinburgh, Cameron visited Holyrood today and promised he would implement new taxation powers proposed last year by the Calman commission set up by the Labour government and supported by the Tories and Lib Dems.Cameron did not commit to introducing specific Calman proposals, but they included allowing Scotland to set income tax rates above 10p in the pound, win capital borrowing powers and control other taxes such as aggregates tax and stamp duty.He also promised to listen to Alex Salmond's demands for up to £700m in extra funding for Holyrood, including releasing Scottish money held in Treasury reserves and paying a "consequential" share of the money spent on Olympic regeneration in London."I'm looking forward to have discussions with the first minister and what he will find is I'm open to listening to all of the arguments that he may puts forward," Cameron said, standing alongside Danny Alexander, the new Lib Dem Scottish Secretary."I believe and Danny believes that we should be pursing the Calman agenda and that is a much greater degree of fiscal autonomy for Scotland, I think that is right and that's what we want to put in place."Cameron also confirmed that there would be no cuts in the Scottish government's grant this year, because Holyrood's budget has already been set and implemented, despite the swingeing cuts being implemented across UK government departments."We'd already agreed before the election that the Scottish administration could delay that process and stick to its original budget this year and that's a good example of the respect agenda in action."But the prime minister dismissed SNP and Labour claims that the Tories, who came fourth in Scotland last Thursday and have only one MP in Scotland, have no legitimacy and mandate in Scotland. He said the Tory and Lib Dem votes combined totalled more than the SNP received when it won the Scottish parliament elections in 2007.In the general election, the two coalition parties took a total of 878,326 votes, a 35.6% share, against the 664,227 votes (32.9%) share of the constituency votes taken by Salmond's party in 2007."I do believe that the Conservatives particularly have to work hard to win the trust of people in Scotland, that's why I'm here today, that's what I think … the respect agenda is all about. I think actually our coalition actually helps to make sure we build that legitimacy and strength in Scotland, combining our votes into a larger share than the SNP achieved in the Scottish parliament," he said.
