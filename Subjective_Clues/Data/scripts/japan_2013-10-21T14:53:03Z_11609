One of the biggest acts in pop in Japan, this trio from Hiroshima – consisting of Ayano “Nocchi” Omoto, Yuka “Kashiyuka” Kashino, and Ayaka “A-Chan” Nishiwaki – have captured the hearts of anime otaku and hardcore music fans alike. They released their fourth album, Level 3, earlier this month, and 1mm is the lead track.Perfume producer Yasutaka Nakata is also responsible for Japanese pop acts including Kyary Pamyu Pamyu and his own group Capsule, and 1mm is a fine example of his sound; candy-pop melodies, distorted synths, and auto-tuned vocals have become ingrained into Perfume’s futuristic image.1mm is one of the more chilled-out tracks on Level 3 – the album itself is an eclectic mix of singsong pop and aggressive electro. It’s certainly not your typical J-pop album, with some sections leaving you wondering how Nakata manages to get away with such madness. It’s precisely this eagerness to push boundaries that makes Perfume one of the most compelling groups in modern J-pop.• More from Clear and Refreshing• Ice Prince – I Swear: New music from Nigeria• Teeth & Tongue – Good Man: New music from Australia
