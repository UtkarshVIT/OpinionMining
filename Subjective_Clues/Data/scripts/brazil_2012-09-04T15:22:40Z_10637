At Anglo American, our impact on the communities in which we operate is fundamental to our sustainability strategy. If we are to grow and flourish, these communities must grow and flourish too. Osiani Ephina is an embodiment of this vision.Osiani works in community relations with our iron ore mining operations in Amapá, a remote region in the north of Brazil. The population in the area has nearly doubled to over 11,000 since our arrival in 2007. During this time, Osiani has set up a diverse range of social projects and initiatives to support the community and make sure our impact in the area is a positive one.The growing community in Amapá faces a range of challenges particularly around sexual health, education and economic self-sufficiency. Working closely with the community, Osiani designs and directs investment into initiatives that meet these specific needs and change people's lives.Her projects, Conjunto da Obra, vary from health initiatives that give local hospitals the funding they need to invest in vital medicine and equipment, to educational projects to improve literacy and increase access to the internet. Other projects have included providing people with the knowledge and skills they need to improve their income: for example, through sewing, farming or business entrepreneurship.Osiani's work has had a huge impact on the lives of people in the area. In 2010, Amapá received a socio-economic assessment toolbox (SEAT) score of 3.2 for social performance, up from 1.6 in 2007. This score represents the fastest increase in social performance of all of Anglo American's business units worldwide.Copy on this page is provided by Anglo American, sponsor of the social impact hub
