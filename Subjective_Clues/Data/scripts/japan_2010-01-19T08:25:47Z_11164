Japan Airlines (JAL) was today reported to be hours away from bankruptcy – the first step in an attempt to free itself from the huge debts and poor management that have come to define a once-revered Japanese corporate symbol.As the Japanese transport minister, Seiji Maehara, prepared to put the airline in the hands of a state-backed turnaround body, it suffered the indignity of seeing shares reach a record low of four yen (2.6 pence).JAL, which has received three government bailouts in the past decade, has seen the value of its shares fall by 90% since the beginning of the month.With a market value of $150m (£91m) – less than the price of a Boeing 747 jet – the airline is now trailing the likes of Croatia Airlines and Jazeera Airways.JAL shares could soon be worth nothing if, as expected, they are de-listed from the Tokyo stock exchange.Despite filing for what would be Japan's sixth-biggest ever bankruptcy, the airline is expected to stay in business while it attempts to rid itself of debts of $16bn and repair its battered reputation."The government wants to continue to support JAL to ensure its continued stable and safe operations," Maehara told reporters.In exchange for financial backing from the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation (Etic), JAL will reportedly be asked to cut 15,600 jobs – one-third of its workforce – by March 2013 and cut unprofitable routes.The airline is expecting operating losses of 265bn yen (£1.8bn) for the year to the end of March, having amassed losses of 51bn yen last year.Its long-term future will be dependent on efforts to emerge as a leaner business, probably with additional support through new partnerships with overseas carriers that could transform the airline business in the Asia-Pacific market.The restructuring plan, due to be announced later today, could mark the anointing of JAL's rival All Nippon Airways as Japan's flagship carrier.Analysts were upbeat about JAL's immediate future but admitted questions over its potential for growth remained."I am not worried about the future of the carrier as I believe the government will strongly support it," Yasuhiro Matsumoto, a credit analyst at Shinsei Securities, said."But whether it will be able to grow as a business is unclear. I can't see how JAL is going to build its network domestically and internationally."JAL's decline has been a sobering experience for an airline that grew from a handful of leased planes in 1951 into a global fleet of 280 aircraft and almost 50,000 employees.It will begin its recovery by filing for court protection – a move akin to Chapter 11 in the US – which would pave the way for a 300bn yen injection of fresh capital from Etic.The body indicated that it would draw on government-backed funding to open a line of credit that would enable JAL to buy fuel and parts to keep its planes in the air.JAL's main creditors, which include three Japanese megabanks, have reportedly agreed to waive debts of 350bn yen.The airline is also likely to offload unprofitable side businesses to give itself a fighting chance of recovery amid falling passenger numbers, rising fuel prices and high restructuring costs.Its first obvious break with the past will be the expected appointment of Kazuo Inamori, the founder of the electrical components maker Kyocera, as the chief executive in place of Haruka Nishimatsu.A very different airline is expected to emerge under the stewardship of the 77-year-old Inamori, a successful entrepreneur but an airline industry novice.Under the restructuring plan, JAL could retire 53 of its largest jets and replace them with smaller aircraft suited to domestic and regional flights.The airline will also have to decide on rival offers of investment from two US airlines keen to gain a bigger foothold in Asia.American Airlines and its partners, including British Airways, say they are willing to invest $1.4bn to keep JAL as part of their Oneworld Alliance.However, reports suggest JAL is preparing to accept a rival offer, worth about $1bn, from Delta and defect to its Sky Team group.
