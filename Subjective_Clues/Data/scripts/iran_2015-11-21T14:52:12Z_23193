A drone has crashed in south-west Iran, the regional governor has told the Fars news agency.It was not clear if the drone, which crashed near Shush city, in Khuzestan province on Friday, had been shot down by Iran or failed due to technical problems.Fars news agency quoted the governor of Shush county as saying a foreign surveillance drone had come down. But later the state news agency, IRNA, quoted the same official, Reza Nejati, saying it was an Iranian machine and denying he had ever said otherwise. “This drone was flying a daily route inside the country,” Nejati was quoted as saying by IRNA, adding that technical issues had brought it down.In 2014, Iran said it had tested its own unmanned aircraft, reverse-engineered from US drones that it has captured in recent years.
