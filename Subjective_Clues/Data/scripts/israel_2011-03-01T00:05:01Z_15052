Your letter (The space where anti-Zionism becomes antisemitism, 24 February) quotes a few extreme cases of criticising Israel, as if they were the generality, in order to smear Universities UK with alleged antisemitism for daring to support universities in hosting speakers who criticise Israel. The authors' main complaint is that a recent speaker referred to the "Jewish lobby" instead of the "Zionist lobby". Supposedly, that proves the speaker and, by implication, many others, was engaging in the Jewish conspiracy theory, supported or at least tolerated by the universities.What nonsense. Most critics of Israel and its apologists refer correctly to an Israel lobby, or possibly a Zionist lobby, because they know the lobby comprises non-Jewish as well as Jewish organisations. They also know that many Jews, and a growing number of Jewish groups, such as JFJFP of which I am chair, are deeply critical of Israeli policy.However, a chorus of some establishment Jewish organisations muddies the water by constantly telling the world that all Jews always support what Israel does. (The authors of the letter of 24 February represent three of them.) So it isn't surprising if a few people fall into the trap of referring to a "Jewish lobby". It doesn't mean they are antisemitic, and it doesn't mean the universities which host them tolerate antisemitism.There is a deep dishonesty in the chorus. Not only does it deliberately fail to acknowledge the wide range of attitudes within the Jewish community towards Israeli policy, it also tries to have it both ways. Having told the world how all Jews support Israeli policy, it cries foul when some people take them at their word.Arthur GoodmanJews for Justice for Palestinians
