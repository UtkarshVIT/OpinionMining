It's too big," said Shellani. "This can't be our boat, we don't know how to drive it!" But it was, and we were about to learn. First lesson, it's not called driving – you captain the ship, explained Rory. He would show us the ropes for two hours, then the boat was ours for a week – a shiny, expensive-looking 40ft yacht, entrusted to two young Poms with zero boat-driving experience.We were in the Whitsundays, a scattering of around 70 mostly uninhabited tropical islands off the coast of Queensland. It's a location that scores highly for romance. But it would also be a test. You don't truly get to know someone until you spend a week alone on a boat with them. Cooped up in an enclosed space, surrounded by water, it's like seven years of marriage condensed into seven days.We found a quiet, sheltered cove and stayed put for most of our holiday, too scared to drive the boat anywhere. But what a place – beautifully peaceful save for the sound of the lorikeets in the trees and the waves bumping against the boat. We spent the days reading, sunbathing and jumping in the water.In the evenings we cooked fish, chatted, played Scrabble by moonlight and watched the stars. It was a magical existence. And what did I learn about Shellani on our voyage of discovery? Well, mainly that she was extremely good at Scrabble. I never won a game.Jonathan Knight founded Punk Publishing, which produces Cool Camping (www.coolcamping.co.uk). A week's yacht charter around the Whitsundays costs from £1,560 per boat with Sunsail (www.sunsail.co.uk), who can also arrange flights from the UK to Hamilton Island for around £700
