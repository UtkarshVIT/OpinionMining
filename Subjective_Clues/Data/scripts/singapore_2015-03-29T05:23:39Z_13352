Tens of thousands of Singaporeans have braved torrential rain to pay tribute to the country’s first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, lining a 15km route through the southeast Asian city-state for his funeral cortege.People began gathering just after dawn, wearing ponchos and carrying umbrellas, for the procession which began early in the afternoon.Lee’s coffin, protected from the downpour by a glass casing, lay on a ceremonial gun carriage that was led past city landmarks from parliament to a cultural centre where the state funeral will be held.

The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe are among the mourners as is the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott. Leader of the House of Commons William Hague is representing the UK. The US delegation is led by former US president Bill Clinton and former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, a long-time friend of Lee’s.More than 1.2 million Singaporeans have formally paid their respects to Lee since he died on Monday, aged 91. Nearly half a million queued to file past his body lying in state at parliament house, while more than 800,000 attended community tribute sites around the island.The funeral procession, past significant landmarks such as Singapore’s Old Parliament House, Marina Barrage, and St Andrew’s Cathedral, will precede Lee’s funeral service at the National University of Singapore Sunday afternoon.Lee’s coffin was borne to the gun carriage for the procession by eight members of the Singapore armed forces, and the Singapore police force.Singaporeans waved national flags and chanted Lee’s name as the cortege passed.The country will observe one minute’s silence at 4pm.Singapore’s current prime minister, and Lee Kuan Yew’s son, Lee Hsien Loong thanked the people of Singapore for their condolences.“My family and I are deeply grateful to everyone who came to pay their last respects to Mr Lee at Parliament House, [prime ministerial residence] Sri Temasek, and the 18 island-wide community tribute sites. We are overwhelmed by your good wishes, messages, gifts, understanding and patience.”The younger Lee said the country had been united by his father.“It has been a tremendous experience this week since Mr Lee Kuan Yew passed away. I think the response from all segments of our society, everybody, has been overwhelming.”The elder Leewas a founding member of the governing People’s Action Party and is credited with transforming Singapore from a sleepy Asian entrepot into a bustling and wealthy financial hub.He was prime minister from 1959, when colonial ruler Britain granted Singapore self-rule, until 1990, leading Singapore to outright independence in 1965 after a brief and stormy union with Malaysia.He encouraged economic growth with easy regulation and low taxes for business, and by employing a large government apparatus to look after citizens.Singapore enjoys one of the world’s highest per-capita incomes and its residents enjoy near-universal home ownership, low crime rates and first-class infrastructure.But progress came at the expense of civil liberties. Critics and human rights groups condemned his iron-fisted rule of his country which saw his political opponents jailed, exiled, or driven to financial ruin through costly libel suits.Media freedoms were also stifled, and political dissent was not tolerated.Only 12 opposition politicians have ever been elected to parliament in Singapore.From 1965 to 1981, the ruling party won every seat in every election. Parliament was formed with no elected opposition MPs for almost two decades.Lee retained cabinet-level advisory posts – such as “minister mentor” after handing over the premiership to Goh Chok Tong in 1990.He resigned from the cabinet in May 2011 after his party won its 14th consecutive general election.The People’s Action party’s 2011 election win was by its slimmest ever margin, though the party still commands a dominant parliamentary majority.Lee was re-elected to his seat unopposed and remained a member of parliament until his death.
