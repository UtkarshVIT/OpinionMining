The appearance of the South Korean flag alongside photos of the North Korean women's football team on the opening day of the London Olympics turned out to be as portentous as it was embarrassing.The flag mishap set the tone for the early stages of the Games, during which the historical rivals, who are still technically at war, have maintained a theme of mutual loathing that will intensify this week in a showdown in the men's team table tennis.To its credit, North Korea has added sporting achievement to the usual cold war intrigue that accompanies its presence at international sports events, with an impressive start that propelled it to fifth place in the medals table – just two places behind its much wealthier neighbour.By the close of day five North Korea, which took 56 athletes to London, had won four gold medals and a bronze; South Korea 12 medals, including six golds.The countries' separate entrance to the Olympic stadium during the opening ceremony reflects the dramatic deterioration in bilateral relations since they marched together, under the blue-and-white flag of a united Korean peninsula, in Sydney 12 years ago.The thaw was noticeably absent in Beijing, soon after North Korean guards had shot dead a South Korean tourist, and there has been little evidence of rapprochement in London.The flag mix-up aside, North Korea's table tennis coach has complained to the organisers after practically accusing photographers from the South of disrupting a training session. In the South, frustration at a series of refereeing decisions can only have been compounded by the sight of the impoverished North near the top of the medals table.Generosity of spirit has not, however, been totally absent. South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper paid tribute to the North's "sensational start" in London and predicted more medals would follow.When the teams compete at table tennis on Saturday, there will be far more at stake than national pride.It is rumoured that North Korean athletes who embarrass the homeland in international competitions face being sent to labour camps on their return home — one explanation, perhaps, for the excessively long protest launched by the women's football team at Hampden Park last week.North Korean athletes are something of an enigma. While the US women's football team shopped and ate out in the run-up to their meeting on Tuesday, the North Koreans holed up in their hotel. Their coach explained that it rained too often to venture out, and the players had become rather attached to their Glasgow digs.Back home, it is difficult to gauge what ordinary North Koreans think of their team's sterling start to the Games. Viewer figures aren't available, but some at least are being treated to up to five hours of recorded Olympic coverage every day, having had to make do with just 15 minutes until their compatriots started winning medals."People back home are excited about our athletes' great performances," Ri Kwang-chol, the head of the North's radio and television broadcasting committee, told South Korea's Yonhap news agency.According to the Korean Central News Agency, the North Korean regime's official mouthpiece, every one of the country's 23 million people has been caught up in "a tumult of joy".When An Kum-ae won her judo gold, a team official praised her "strong perseverance and high technique" on its English-language website, adding, predictably, that she had "displayed pluck and confidence instilled by the Supreme Commander Kim Jong-un".He went on: "Her success has given great strength and courage to the servicepersons and civilians of [North Korea] in making victorious advance."Praise for the Kim dynasty aside, North Korean coverage of a global event would not be complete without a jibe hurled in the general direction of the west. An official in the ministry of posts and telecommunications in Pyongyang derided "evil-minded foreign media [which] asserted that North Korea would take only one silver medal, but our sportspersons refuted such assertions with good results".Goldman Sachs earned a similar rebuke from the KCNA for predicting that, based on its per capita income, North Korea would leave London without a single medal.South Korea's promising start has been overshadowed by controversies involving its athletes which, according to the Korea Times, had "marred the credibility of the Olympics" and "triggered an enormous outpouring of public outrage".Shin A-lam's contentious loss in the semi-final of the women's épée was one of several poor judging decisions that had some commentators sounding more like their indignant counterparts in the North.One even pointed to a conspiracy among European countries to keep Korean athletes off the podium. "The west has made most sports rules," Prof Lee Jeong-hak of Kyung Hee University in Seoul told the Korea Times. "They might strongly believe that as the host they are entitled to do so. As they feel depressed because of the current euro economic crisis, there could have been jealousy against Korea."If the dastardly Europeans are beyond the pale, at least South Korea can still depend on its chief ally for moral support. A day after its women defeated North Korea in the football tournament, the US embassy in Seoul chipped in with some encouragement on Twitter: "Go, #TeamKorea! They're No.3 in the @London2012 #Olympic medal count, just behind #TeamUSA! How long can they hold on?"
