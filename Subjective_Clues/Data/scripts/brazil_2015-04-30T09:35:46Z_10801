Populous has designed a world class football stadium with a difference. One of four stadiums built for the 2014 football world cup in Brazil, the Arena das Dunas, was conceived as a multi-purpose venue for the people of Natal, with an emphasis on forging a strong environmental, economic and cultural legacy.Working in a remote region of north-eastern Brazil, the Populous team – designers, architects and technical experts – knew that creative, practical solutions would be important in developing and operating a stadium in the long term. Populous chose concrete as the main material for the stadium, reflecting its ready availability in the region and keeping it in character with existing buildings nearby. It used practical, low-cost construction techniques, drawing on local methods and providing employment opportunities for local builders. The asymmetric roof shields spectators from sunlight, while capturing up to 3,000m3 of rainwater that can be reused in the toilets and for irrigating the pitch in the dry season. The undulating form of the main stands (reminiscent of neighbouring sand dunes) catches the prevailing onshore breeze and helps to keep players and spectators cool without relying on costly air-conditioning systems.With 10,000 removable seats, the stadium will host a myriad of sporting events, trade shows and concerts. And as it will be the home stadium for two local football teams for the next 20 years, it is forging its place at the heart of the community.
