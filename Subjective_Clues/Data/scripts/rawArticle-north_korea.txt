The Phil is, to some degree, an embodiment of American values and soft power, and it is well practiced in the role of cultural emissary, having spearheaded a number of Cold War cultural exchange visits to the Soviet Union and its satellites nearly half a century ago.The programme for Tuesday's Pyongyang concert has been the subject of intense negotiations between the NYPO's executive director Zarin Mehta (brother of the conductor Zubin Mehta) and Korean officials. The agreed running order is the Prelude to Act III of Wagner's Lohengrin (which, appropriately for this international getting-to-know-you event, leads straight into the tune better known as Here Comes the Bride), Gershwin's An American in Paris, and finally Dvorak's New World Symphony. As encores, and to prove all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds, the orchestra will play the Candide overture by Leonard Bernstein (who led the Phil on its historic 1959 trip to the USSR) and the Korean folksong Arirang. It will be streamed online from March 4 at the New York Philharmonic's website.I suppose you could argue that this is mostly an assertively Yankee programme and thus a fearless gesture against the tyranny under which North Koreans live. But a performance of the New World symphony in Pyongyang isn't half as provocative as Bernstein's defiant insistence, back in 1959, on programming music by Igor Stravinsky (then still largely banned in the USSR as a bourgeois decadent) and his invitation to the banned Nobel literature prize winner Boris Pasternak to attend the concert.

Some worried, however, that their performance tomorrow would fail to bring significant change.The Philharmonic's president and executive director, Zarin Mehta, said the North Koreans had met all the group's requests for the trip, agreeing to stage the performance in a larger hall and to broadcast it live by radio and TV. Beyond the concert, the Philharmonic musicians will hold master classes for North Korean students and play chamber music with members of the state symphony orchestra.\"There's going to be major interaction with their musical community and that's what we wanted to do,\" Mehta told the Associated Press in Beijing, where the orchestra - America's oldest - was playing before departing today for its 48-hour visit to North Korea.Mehta, who visited North Korea twice last year to organise the event, said some of the anti-American propaganda he had seen earlier on the streets of Pyongyang was being removed.Despite that claim, North Korea's state-controlled media kept up its usual vitriol yesterday, with the main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, condemning \"US warmongers\" for staging joint military exercises with South Korea which, it said, brought the peninsula \"to the brink of a war.\"Mehta said one of his first considerations in organising the event was making sure the orchestra's diverse members, which include eight Koreans, would all be allowed to participate.The North Koreans expressed surprise that the group included so many nationalities.\"Our objective is to prove that we're not fiends and ogres and that we're there to show what American culture and friendship and civility is all about,\" Mehta said.The orchestra will perform both countries' national anthems at the start of the concert.It was not known whether the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, would attend the concert, and Philharmonic spokesman Eric Latzky said the organisation had not directly extended an invitation to him.The Swedish embassy handles US interests in North Korea as the two countries have no formal diplomatic relations, and is working with its foreign ministry on the guest list for the event, he said.Latzky implied that reporters accompanying the Philharmonic should be ready for the unexpected, saying the orchestra staff would let them know about any \"surprise guests\" to appear at the concert.Musicians from the orchestra differed on whether their visit would bring about broader changes in the tense relations between the two countries.\"It's naive to think that playing a single concert for what is bound to be the elite, is really going to result in a substantive opening of North Korea,\" said violist Dawn Hannay, 52.Jon Deak, associate principal bass, performed with the orchestra when it celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall under the direction of Leonard Bernstein.

A senior official confirmed South Korea would vote in favour of the resolution today, a move that could anger the communist North amid a deadlock in international nuclear talks.Lee, who took office last month, has promised a tougher stance in dealing with North Korea. Since 2003, South Korea has voted only once for a UN resolution on North Korean human rights - after the North's nuclear test in October 2006. In other votes, South Korea either abstained or stayed away out of concern that its criticism might harm efforts to resolve the nuclear standoff with the North.According to a copy of the draft resolution, the UN Human Rights Council will say it is \"deeply concerned at the continuing reports of systematic, widespread and grave violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights\" in North Korea.The resolution also calls for a one-year extension of the mandate of Vitit Muntarbhorn, the UN special rapporteur on North Korean human rights. Muntarbhorn is tasked with investigating rights abuses in the country, but has never been allowed to visit.International advocacy groups say North Korea is among the world's worst abusers of human rights. It has been accused, among other things, of running a network of prison camps believed to house some 200,000 political detainees.\"I believe the North Korean people should get to a point where they can enjoy the minimum basic happiness of human beings,\" Lee said in a meeting with unification ministry officials. The two Koreas have remained technically at war since 1953, when the three-year Korean war was brought to a halt with an armistice.The North Korean government rejects criticism of its rights record, denouncing it as part of an American attempt to overthrow the regime.Pyongyang has not yet satisfied Washington's demand for a full audit of its nuclear programmes. Today, the nominee to head South Korea's joint chiefs of staff, General Kim Tae-young, told parliament he believed North Korea has enough plutonium to build six to seven nuclear weapons.", "tags": ["Human rights", "United Nations", "World news", "South Korea", "North Korea", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "South Korea to condemn North on human rights"},{"date": "2008-02-25T13:15:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "\"Try to avoid politics\" was the diplomatic advice to members of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra as they prepared for this week's landmark visit to North Korea. Not surprisingly, the musicians' reaction was to burst out laughing at the diplomat's remarks. For how can the first ever visit by a western orchestra to the last Stalinist country on the planet - and an orchestra, what's more, from a country with which North Korea considers inself at war - not be political in every way?\"We're there to give a concert, that's all,\" was the New York Phil's conductor Lorin Maazel's on-message comment as the orchestra prepared to fly in to Pyongyang today. But tomorrow's event in the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre is hardly just another concert. And frankly no one believes it could be.As I wrote in the Guardian in December, when the visit was first announced, the New York Phil is not just another orchestra and so, in places like Pyongyang, it can never give just another concert. The Phil is, to some degree, an embodiment of American values and soft power, and it is well practiced in the role of cultural emissary, having spearheaded a number of Cold War cultural exchange visits to the Soviet Union and its satellites nearly half a century ago.The programme for Tuesday's Pyongyang concert has been the subject of intense negotiations between the NYPO's executive director Zarin Mehta (brother of the conductor Zubin Mehta) and Korean officials. The agreed running order is the Prelude to Act III of Wagner's Lohengrin (which, appropriately for this international getting-to-know-you event, leads straight into the tune better known as Here Comes the Bride), Gershwin's An American in Paris, and finally Dvorak's New World Symphony. As encores, and to prove all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds, the orchestra will play the Candide overture by Leonard Bernstein (who led the Phil on its historic 1959 trip to the USSR) and the Korean folksong Arirang. It will be streamed online from March 4 at the New York Philharmonic's website.I suppose you could argue that this is mostly an assertively Yankee programme and thus a fearless gesture against the tyranny under which North Koreans live. But a performance of the New World symphony in Pyongyang isn't half as provocative as Bernstein's defiant insistence, back in 1959, on programming music by Igor Stravinsky (then still largely banned in the USSR as a bourgeois decadent) and his invitation to the banned Nobel literature prize winner Boris Pasternak to attend the concert. If only someone had written a piece for this year's trip called American Seoul Music.\"I don't think we should get carried away with what listening to Dvorak is going to do in North Korea,\" the highly musical Condoleezza Rice observed in Washington last week. But then the secretary of state added, \"I think it's a good thing.\" Contrary to some bloggers' views, that's surely right. The invitation to the New York Philharmonic is at some level an indication that North Korea is willing to engage peacefully with the world. In the end, there is only one outcome of that process - just as there was in the Soviet Union.

It is perhaps the last living example of pure totalitarianism - control of the state over every aspect of human life. Is such a place the right venue for a western orchestra? Can one imagine the New York Philharmonic, which performed to great acclaim in Pyongyang, entertaining Stalin or Hitler?All totalitarian systems have one thing in common: by crushing all forms of political expression except adulation of the regime, they make everything political. There is no such thing in North Korea as non-political sports or culture. So there is no question that the invitation to the New York Philharmonic was meant to burnish the prestige of a regime, ruled by the Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, whose standing is so low - even in neighbouring China - that it needs all the burnishing it can get.Interviews with some of the musicians revealed an awareness of this. A violinist was quoted as saying that \"a lot of us are ... not buying into this party line that music transcends the political\". The conductor, Lorin Maazel, was less cynical. The concert, he said, would \"take on a momentum of its own\", and have a positive effect on North Korean society. But could he possibly be right? No one, not even Maazel, pretends that one concert by a great western orchestra can blow a dictatorship away, but authoritarians' wariness of the subversive power of music dates back to Plato's Republic. In Plato's view music, if not strictly controlled, inflames the passions and makes people unruly. He wanted to limit musical expression to sounds that were conducive to harmony and order. This, more or less, has been the line taken by dictatorships as well. The officially prescribed musical diet of North Koreans consists of patriotic hymns to the Communist party, odes to the Dear Leader, to his father (the Great Leader, Kim Il-sung), and to the heroic spirit of the Korean people. Almost nothing else is permitted - except in the inner sanctum of the rulers. The Dear Leader's son, Kim Jong-chol, is said to be a fan of Eric Clapton. An invitation has gone out to the rock star to perform in North Korea, which really would be something new. Rock music was severely restricted in communist dictatorships, just as jazz was under Hitler, for all the Platonic reasons. Precisely because of this, \"forbidden\" music was politicised. Subversive youths in Nazi Germany - the Swing-Jugend - secretly listened to jazz. The air of Czechoslovakia in 1968 was electric with the imported sounds of the Rolling Stones and Frank Zappa. After Soviet tanks put an end to the Prague Spring, a Russian policeman threatened one young Czech that he would \"beat the Zappa out\" of him.V\u00e1clav Havel was a fan of Zappa. So was a Czech rock band called the Plastic People of the Universe, who so upset the commissars that they were thrown in prison - not because they were engaged in political activities but because, as the singer, Milan Hlavsa, put it: \"We just wanted to do what we liked doing.\" Of course, that was the point. Hlavsa and his long-haired fans didn't want the state to spoil their party. They didn't care what the commissars thought. They wanted to dance to their own tunes. Obviously, Dvorak and Wagner are not Zappa and the Stones. And if Clapton came to Pyongyang, he might not have enough \"street cred\" left to light the fuse of rebellion. When the Stones finally performed in China, in 2003, they agreed not to perform some of their racier numbers because, as their local promoter put it: \"They know there are differences between Chinese and western cultures. They don't want to do anything against the Chinese government.\" So much for the spirit of 1968. Nevertheless, Maazel may have a point. Performing good music in North Korea just might have a positive effect. Stalin's empire needed no foreign classical orchestras. It had enough of its own. China no longer needed the Stones, either. There are plenty of rock bands in China already. But the stranglehold of North Korea's dictatorship is based on total isolation. For half a century, the North Koreans have been deprived of any art, ideas or music not authorised by the state. They were told that North Korea was a heroic little country besieged by satanic enemies, led by the US. This permanent diet of paranoia has created something akin to a nationwide insane asylum, where ignorance, terror and suspicion rule. In such conditions, even a conventional programme of classical music by the New York Philharmonic comes as a gust of fresh air. It may not topple the dictatorship, but it will offer some solace to those who are forced to live in it. And that, for the time being, is a good enough reason to play. \u00b7 Ian Buruma is professor of human rights at Bard College, New York \u00a9 Project Syndicate project-syndicate.org", "tags": ["North Korea", "Classical music", "World news", "Music", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Ian Buruma: The music of liberation in North Korea"},{"date": "2008-04-01T23:06:59Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea today unleashed a rhetorical tirade against the new South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, amid worries about renewed friction on the peninsula.In its fiercest personal attack since Lee took power in February, Pyongyang's state media said the president's more assertive stance in talks on nuclear decommissioning would result in \"catastrophic consequences\".In a shift from the \"sunshine policy\" of engagement pursued by his two predecessors, Lee says humanitarian assistance depends on the progress made by Pyongyang in dismantling its nuclear weapons programme.

The White House described the alleged reactor as \"a dangerous and potentially destabilising development for the region and the world\". After seven months of silence and evasion from the Bush administration, the CIA director, Michael Hayden, briefed members of the Senate and House armed services, intelligence and foreign affairs committees, saying his weapons specialists found the evidence compelling.After the Israeli attack last September, there had been speculation that the target was a nuclear reactor but this the first time there has been an official statement, complete with details, and the first time that North Korea has been implicated.The Bush administration also disclosed that Israel had consulted Washington before launching the strike.The White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, speaking after the Senate and House of Representatives had been briefed, said Syria had built the plant \"carefully hidden from view\" in a remote desert area in the east of the country, in breach of its international obligations.\"We are convinced, based on a variety of information, that North Korea assisted Syria's covert nuclear activities. We have good reason to believe that the reactor, which was damaged beyond repair on September 6 of last year, was not intended for peaceful purposes,\" she said.The White House added that the regime moved quickly to bury evidence of its existence, covering over the wreckage and constructing a new building on the site.US officials said yesterday the Bush administration was putting the information out in order to clear the decks before doing a deal with North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programme.The video, made public last night after Congress had been briefed, is a collection of material from various sources, in addition to Israeli intelligence. There is no tape from inside the alleged reactor, only two still photographs, apparently taken by a human hand on the ground rather than a drone or satellite. This was supported by satellite pictures and graphs.The pictures taken on the ground show an apparently empty brown-grey, solid building, but nothing that seems to indicate it is being used for nuclear purposes.In the video, which shows the site before and after the bombing, the CIA claims that the alleged reactor is similar to one in Yongbyon, 55 miles north of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.One official said the Syrian plant was within weeks or months of being operational. \"This thing was good to go,\" he said. Congress was told that the reactor was designed to produce a small amount of plutonium, which can be used to build a nuclear bomb.In releasing the video, the Bush administration is taking the risk that the North Korea regime may use it as an excuse to walk out of US-North Korean negotiations about dismantling its nuclear programme, but is banking on any such walkout as being only temporary.Under a deal agreed last year between North Korea, the US, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, Pyongyang is required to detail whether it has provided nuclear help to Syria and other countries round the world. So far it has failed to deliver.A US official who had seen the video said: \"We cannot move forward [on a deal with North Korea] unless you acknowledge we are doing this with our eyes wide open. And we are going ahead with our eyes wide open.\"The Syrian government yesterday denied it had been building a nuclear reactor with North Korean help. Syria's ambassador to Britain, Sami al-Khiyami, described the video as ridiculous: \"Unfortunately the scenario of taking and retaking pictures looks like what happened before the Iraq war, when the US administration was trying to convince the world that Iraq had nuclear weapons.\" In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration showed photographs and other material to the UN security council that it claimed amounted to evidence of Saddam Hussein's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, but which were subsequently proven to be false.Joseph Cirincione, an expert on nuclear proliferation and head of the Washington-based Ploughshares Fund, said: \"We should learn first from the past and be very cautious about any intelligence from the US about other country's weapons.\"He insisted there had been no justification for Israeli launching the strike on another country, given there was no imminent danger. He added that Syria was a sideshow that should not deflect attention from the bigger prize of North Korea dismantling its nuclear programme. \"The administration is trying to clear up old business, so it does not get in the way of an agreement with North Korea.\"The Israeli strike destroyed a large building in the desert near the village of At Tibnah in the Dayr az Zawr region, 90 miles from the Iraqi border. The strike was reminiscent of one on the Iraqi reactor at Osirk in 1981. But, unlike the Iraqi strike, the attack on Syria initially remained shrouded in mystery, with Bush and other leaders repeatedly deflecting reporters' questions.At the time, the British intelligence service, MI6, privately briefed the British government that Syria had been building a nuclear reactor. The British government accepted this as credible.If Syria had been secretly building a nuclear plant, it would have been in breach of the non-proliferation treaty, which requires Damascus to notify the UN watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, of any such plans.The US media and some analysts speculated that neo-conservatives in the Bush administration, led by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, wanted the North Korea-Syria link publicised to try to wreck the prospect of a deal and to undermine the state department official leading the negotiations, Christopher Hill, the assistant secretary of state for Asia But US officials, as well as analysts, discounted this, saying the neo-conservatives had been discredited and that pragmatists such as the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who favours a deal with North Korea, remained in the ascendancy.BackstoryIsrael is the sole nuclear power in the Middle East, though it publicly refuses to acknowledge this, and is intent on remaining so. It carried out a pre-emptive air strike against Saddam Hussein's nuclear plant at Osirk in 1981, from which the dictator's nuclear ambitions never recovered, and hinted at similar strikes against Iran, saying it will not allow Tehran to acquire a nuclear weapon. It was against this background that Israel bombed the alleged Syrian nuclear plant in September. It came as a surprise, given that there had been no speculation that Damascus had been engaged in any such programme. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, imposed a news blackout and George Bush also refused at White House press conferences to confirm whether the target was a suspect nuclear plant, until yesterday. At the time, there were questions over why Israel should strike against Syria at such an early stage. One theory was that it was meant as a signal to Iran that if it continued to pursue uranium enrichment, a process that could lead to a nuclear bomb, Israel would bomb its nuclear sites.", "tags": ["US news", "US foreign policy", "Syria", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "US politics"], "title": "US claims North Korea helped build Syria reactor plant"},{"date": "2008-04-01T23:06:59Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea today unleashed a rhetorical tirade against the new South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, amid worries about renewed friction on the peninsula.In its fiercest personal attack since Lee took power in February, Pyongyang's state media said the president's more assertive stance in talks on nuclear decommissioning would result in \"catastrophic consequences\".In a shift from the \"sunshine policy\" of engagement pursued by his two predecessors, Lee says humanitarian assistance depends on the progress made by Pyongyang in dismantling its nuclear weapons programme.

The facility is now being fully disabled, under the scrutiny of US experts.North Korea's denuclearisation took another significant step forwards yesterday when it submitted a long-awaited inventory of its atomic activities, prompting the US to initiate steps to remove Pyongyang from its list of states that sponsor terrorism.The breakthrough, which will also see Washington lift some sanctions and Pyongyang demolish some of its nuclear facilities, is expected to jump-start six-party talks aimed at easing 55 years of tension on the peninsula.For George Bush, the compromise represents a remarkable turnaround from the days when he labelled North Korea a part of the \"axis of evil\".Yesterday, he was cautiously upbeat about the prospects for progress. \"Today is a positive day, it's a positive step forward. There's more work to be done and we've got the process in place to get it done in a verifiable way,\" Bush said.

Bush said the US would continue to observe North Korea's actions carefully and that UN sanctions would remain in effect. For its international isolation to end, Pyongyang had to fully disclose its nuclear activities and meet other obligations, he said.But the symbolism of the change in status is important. Pyongyang has been on the rogue list for 20 years and tested a nuclear weapon less than two years ago.Following today's destruction of the cooling tower, tougher tasks lie ahead, including assessing, locating and eliminating North Korea's atomic arsenal in return for economic aid and diplomatic recognition.\"Obviously, the weapons and all the programmes are going to have to be dealt with and dismantled if we are to have denuclearisation, and it's going to have to be done verifiably,\" the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said.\"If we can verifiably determine the amount of plutonium that has been made, we then have an upper hand in understanding what may have happened in terms of weaponisation.\"According to the AFP news agency, the North Korean inventory is likely to include a 37kg (81lb) plutonium stockpile - less than the 40-50kg that US intelligence officials have estimated it has. US officials said they expected the amount to be within intelligence agency estimates.The accuracy of the inventory will be assessed over the next 45 days by international inspectors at the Yongbyon plant.Estimates earlier this year by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security reckoned that Pyongyang had between 28-50kg of weapons-grade plutonium, enough for six to 10 bombs. Officials also said disagreements over whether North Korea had been enriching uranium had to be resolved.But the two sides have shown a willingness to compromise, in contrast with the Bush administration's approach to the other two \"axis of evil\" countries - Iraq and Iran. That approach is likely to spark a fierce foreign policy debate during the upcoming US presidential election.Japan was more cautious about the significance of the inventory. \"It's good that they made the declaration, but the issue is what's in it,\" said the foreign minister, Masahiko Komura.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Japan", "US news", "World news", "Nuclear weapons", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea blows up cooling tower in nuclear concession"},{"date": "2008-06-06T11:11:19Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "South Korea today signalled a further shift from its tough stance on North Korea as its president, Lee Myung-bak, praised the north for its cooperation in nuclear talks.\"I assess North Korea very positively for cooperating with the international community on denuclearisation,\" Lee said in a televised speech on South Korea's memorial day, which honours the millions that died during the war with the north.The speech displayed a marked change in tone for Lee, who was elected in a landslide in December after pledging a more robust approach to Pyongyang. The shift reflected growing impatience in some quarters that the decade-old \"sunshine policy\" of giving generous aid had failed to modify North Korea's intransigence. Lee was determined to inject more stick and less carrot in his policy towards Pyongyang.Lee started his term with a can-do reputation from his days at the industrial giant Hyundai and as the mayor of Seoul. As mayor, he rammed through initiatives that cemented his reputation as a man of action. Among his most visible legacies in Seoul is an artificial river that starts in the city centre, its source marked by a giant snail-like sculpture. He also decreed that buses should run in the central lanes of the city's wide thoroughfares.But his approach has been less effective at national and international level. He signalled a tougher approach to North Korea by announcing plans to downgrade the ministry of unification, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, as it was distorting South Korea's overall international diplomacy. He also unveiled an ambitious initiative to triple North Korea's per capita income to $3,000 a month if it abandoned its nuclear weapons programme and opened up politically.The so-called Vision 3000 denuclearisation and openness plan was too big a cake for Pyongyang to swallow, says Bong-Geun Jun, a professor at the institute of foreign affairs and national security. North Korea also reacted badly to the move to downgrade the ministry of unification. Lee backed down following protests from within his own party, but the damage had been done.North Korea broke off official contact with Seoul and reconciliation talks went into a deep freeze. Meanwhile, Pyongyang launched vituperative personal attacks on Lee. His timing was unfortunate, as the Bush administration dropped its hardline stance against North Korea to resume a dialogue.George Bush even wrote a friendly letter to Kim Jong-Il, after previously belittling the North Korean leader. The chief US negotiater in the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programme, Christopher Hill, is reported to get on well with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan.Amid fears that Seoul was being frozen out of this budding relationship, South Korea has had to change gears. The tough rhetoric has stopped.In an interview with theguardian.com, South Korea's urbane chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Sook, said: \"We see some signs of sincerity [on North Korea's part]. Most of the credit must go to the US. The important thing is that they have agreed in principle to abandon all nuclear programmes and weapons through negotiations in the six-party talks. It will be a long and winding road and we will have to show patience and perseverance in the months ahead.\"North Korea recently handed over 18,000 pages of logs from its Yongbyon nuclear facility dating back to 1986. Having been briefed by the US, South Korea is making positive noises about recent North Korean moves. The next step is for North Korea to present its declaration on its nuclear programme to China, one of the participants in the six-party talks along with the US, Russia, Japan and the two Koreas.Kim seemed keen to draw a line under North Korea's alleged nuclear cooperation with Syria. \"I believe that such cooperation has stopped and we have seen no sign since last autumn that such cooperation has continued,\" he said.While some scepticism lingers as to whether North Korea actually provided nuclear help to Syria, Kim said US intelligence and information on the matter had been credible. \"It is more important than ever that we ensure that such cooperation will not happen in the future,\" he said.But Kim's fundamental message to North Korea was one of reconciliation despite whatever what was said at the start of Lee's administration. \"Our present policy to North Korea is based on reconciliation,\" he said. \"We always prefer to have dialogue and would like to assist North Korea by whatever means to re-establish their economy and their bad food situation.\"But North Korea can afford to reject South Korea's offers of help as the US has just come through with a previous offer to deliver 500,000 tonnes of rice in emergency food aid. South Korea finds itself in an awkward position, having to watch Pyongyang apparently pulling all the diplomatic strings.\"That's right, they can manipulate everyone around them because they have one-man rule,\" Jun said. \"They are quite proud of it as they do it very well, but I feel sorry for them.

The White House described the alleged reactor as \"a dangerous and potentially destabilising development for the region and the world\". After seven months of silence and evasion from the Bush administration, the CIA director, Michael Hayden, briefed members of the Senate and House armed services, intelligence and foreign affairs committees, saying his weapons specialists found the evidence compelling.After the Israeli attack last September, there had been speculation that the target was a nuclear reactor but this the first time there has been an official statement, complete with details, and the first time that North Korea has been implicated.The Bush administration also disclosed that Israel had consulted Washington before launching the strike.The White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, speaking after the Senate and House of Representatives had been briefed, said Syria had built the plant \"carefully hidden from view\" in a remote desert area in the east of the country, in breach of its international obligations.\"We are convinced, based on a variety of information, that North Korea assisted Syria's covert nuclear activities. We have good reason to believe that the reactor, which was damaged beyond repair on September 6 of last year, was not intended for peaceful purposes,\" she said.The White House added that the regime moved quickly to bury evidence of its existence, covering over the wreckage and constructing a new building on the site.US officials said yesterday the Bush administration was putting the information out in order to clear the decks before doing a deal with North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programme.The video, made public last night after Congress had been briefed, is a collection of material from various sources, in addition to Israeli intelligence. There is no tape from inside the alleged reactor, only two still photographs, apparently taken by a human hand on the ground rather than a drone or satellite. This was supported by satellite pictures and graphs.The pictures taken on the ground show an apparently empty brown-grey, solid building, but nothing that seems to indicate it is being used for nuclear purposes.In the video, which shows the site before and after the bombing, the CIA claims that the alleged reactor is similar to one in Yongbyon, 55 miles north of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.One official said the Syrian plant was within weeks or months of being operational. \"This thing was good to go,\" he said. Congress was told that the reactor was designed to produce a small amount of plutonium, which can be used to build a nuclear bomb.In releasing the video, the Bush administration is taking the risk that the North Korea regime may use it as an excuse to walk out of US-North Korean negotiations about dismantling its nuclear programme, but is banking on any such walkout as being only temporary.Under a deal agreed last year between North Korea, the US, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, Pyongyang is required to detail whether it has provided nuclear help to Syria and other countries round the world. So far it has failed to deliver.A US official who had seen the video said: \"We cannot move forward [on a deal with North Korea] unless you acknowledge we are doing this with our eyes wide open. And we are going ahead with our eyes wide open.\"The Syrian government yesterday denied it had been building a nuclear reactor with North Korean help. Syria's ambassador to Britain, Sami al-Khiyami, described the video as ridiculous: \"Unfortunately the scenario of taking and retaking pictures looks like what happened before the Iraq war, when the US administration was trying to convince the world that Iraq had nuclear weapons.\" In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration showed photographs and other material to the UN security council that it claimed amounted to evidence of Saddam Hussein's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, but which were subsequently proven to be false.Joseph Cirincione, an expert on nuclear proliferation and head of the Washington-based Ploughshares Fund, said: \"We should learn first from the past and be very cautious about any intelligence from the US about other country's weapons.\"He insisted there had been no justification for Israeli launching the strike on another country, given there was no imminent danger. He added that Syria was a sideshow that should not deflect attention from the bigger prize of North Korea dismantling its nuclear programme. \"The administration is trying to clear up old business, so it does not get in the way of an agreement with North Korea.\"The Israeli strike destroyed a large building in the desert near the village of At Tibnah in the Dayr az Zawr region, 90 miles from the Iraqi border. The strike was reminiscent of one on the Iraqi reactor at Osirk in 1981. But, unlike the Iraqi strike, the attack on Syria initially remained shrouded in mystery, with Bush and other leaders repeatedly deflecting reporters' questions.At the time, the British intelligence service, MI6, privately briefed the British government that Syria had been building a nuclear reactor. The British government accepted this as credible.If Syria had been secretly building a nuclear plant, it would have been in breach of the non-proliferation treaty, which requires Damascus to notify the UN watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, of any such plans.The US media and some analysts speculated that neo-conservatives in the Bush administration, led by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, wanted the North Korea-Syria link publicised to try to wreck the prospect of a deal and to undermine the state department official leading the negotiations, Christopher Hill, the assistant secretary of state for Asia But US officials, as well as analysts, discounted this, saying the neo-conservatives had been discredited and that pragmatists such as the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who favours a deal with North Korea, remained in the ascendancy.BackstoryIsrael is the sole nuclear power in the Middle East, though it publicly refuses to acknowledge this, and is intent on remaining so. It carried out a pre-emptive air strike against Saddam Hussein's nuclear plant at Osirk in 1981, from which the dictator's nuclear ambitions never recovered, and hinted at similar strikes against Iran, saying it will not allow Tehran to acquire a nuclear weapon. It was against this background that Israel bombed the alleged Syrian nuclear plant in September. It came as a surprise, given that there had been no speculation that Damascus had been engaged in any such programme. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, imposed a news blackout and George Bush also refused at White House press conferences to confirm whether the target was a suspect nuclear plant, until yesterday. At the time, there were questions over why Israel should strike against Syria at such an early stage. One theory was that it was meant as a signal to Iran that if it continued to pursue uranium enrichment, a process that could lead to a nuclear bomb, Israel would bomb its nuclear sites.", "tags": ["US news", "US foreign policy", "Syria", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "US politics"], "title": "US claims North Korea helped build Syria reactor plant"},{"date": "2008-04-24T15:09:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The White House was today set to reveal video images it claims support allegations that North Korea was helping Syria to build a nuclear reactor.The suspected reactor was destroyed by Israeli planes last September in a raid reminiscent of its 1981 raid on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq.Little remains known about the raid seven months later, and today's evidence has been keenly anticipated. US media reports said the video images \u2013 believed to have been obtained via Israeli intelligence - show Korean faces among the workers at the Syrian plant.The reports said the video also revealed that the Syrian reactor core's design was the same as that of the North Korean reactor at Yongbon, including a virtually identical configuration and number of holes for fuel rods.Following the Israeli attack, Syria kept relatively quiet about the bombing raid on its territory, bulldozing the area and constructing a new building on the exact location of the old one.Damascus refused to allow international nuclear inspectors to visit the location, fuelling suspicions that it had something to cover up. Speaking in London, the Syrian ambassador to Britain dismissed US accusations that it was helping build a nuclear reactor that could produce plutonium. Sami al-Khiyami told Reuters that the accusation was intended to put pressure on North Korea in talks about Pyongyang's nuclear programme. \"This has nothing to do with North Korea and Syria,\" he said. \"They just want to exert more pressure on North Korea. This is why they are coming up with this story. \"The cooperation between North Korea and Syria has nothing to do with [building] a nuclear facility. Cooperation is mainly economic. The Bush administration is going public with the video at a sensitive time in negotiations with North Korea about its nuclear programme.Under a recent deal, Pyongyang said it would reveal full details of its nuclear programme in return for a lifting of US economic sanctions.However, progress has stalled. North Korea failed to meet a December 31 2007 deadline for giving a complete list of its fissile material and nuclear weaponry as well as responding to US suspicions of proliferating technology to Syria.Pyongyang's foreign ministry today said technical matters had been discussed with the US team. \"The negotiations proceeded in a sincere and constructive manner,\" a statement said.There has been speculation that the timing of the briefing is a ploy by administration hawks, such as the vice-president, Dick Cheney, to scupper the talks with North Korea.They believe North Korea is about to be rewarded for its \"bad behaviour\".Christopher Hill, the US negotiator with North Korea, has played down the importance of the Syrian incident as a sideshow, and believes the key is stopping Pyongyang from producing more plutonium and giving up what it has.\"Making public the pictures is likely to inflame the North Koreans,\" a senior administration official told the New York Times. \"And that's just what opponents of this whole arrangement want, because they think the North Koreans will stalk off.\"Syria has denounced US and Israeli claims about the alleged reactor, pointing out that the Bush administration presented bogus evidence to the UN security council before the Iraq war.", "tags": ["US news", "North Korea", "Syria", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US claims video shows North Korea helped build Syrian reactor"},{"date": "2008-06-26T10:50:15Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The move followed Pyongyang's long-awaited declaration of nuclear activities a few hours earlier.US financial sanctions imposed under the Trading With the Enemy Act will be lifted within 45 days, on condition that international inspectors verify the inventory, Bush said.The US state department will meanwhile start the process of taking North Korea - which Bush once named as part of an \"axis of evil\" along with Iran and Saddam Hussein's Iraq - off its list of nations that sponsor terrorism.Sanctions will be lifted unless Congress blocks such a move. That is unlikely as the Democratic majority in Congress has supported Bush's diplomatic courtship of Pyongyang.But the US Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, said US sanctions should only be lifted \"based on North Korean performance\". He called on Congress to examine the North Korean declaration and verification procedures.Obama's Republican opponent, John McCain, was also cautious.\"We'll have to have a look and see how the overall agreement is and whether we should continue to lift sanctions, whether the Japanese and South Korean concerns have been addressed,\" the Arizona senator told reporters in Cincinnati.Hardline Republicans were quick to condemn the White House's rapprochement with North Korea.\"It's shameful,\" John Bolton, Bush's former US ambassador at the United Nations, said of the president's decision. \"This represents the final collapse of Bush's foreign policy.\" \"Profound disappointment\" was the reaction of a Republican member of the House of Representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.In his announcement in the Rose garden at the White House, Bush said the US would continue to carefully observe the actions of the North Korean government and UN sanctions would remain in effect. For its international isolation to end, Pyongyang had to fully disclose all of its nuclear activities and meet other obligations, he said.Pyongyang has been on the rogue list since 1986, when North Korean agents planted a bomb on a South Korean airliner, killing 115 people.As a visible sign that it is dismantling its programme, North Korea will allow dozens of foreign TV companies to film and broadcast the demolition tomorrow of the cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear plant.Coming half a year after an agreed deadline, the declaration will kick-start stalled six-party talks on the denuclearisation of the peninsular, but tougher tasks lie ahead, including assessing, locating and eliminating North Korea's atomic arsenal in return for economic aid and diplomatic recognition.\"Obviously, the weapons and all the programmes are going to have to be dealt with and dismantled if we are to have denuclearisation and it's going to have to be done so verifiably,\" said the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. \"If we can verifiably determine the amount of plutonium that has been made, we then have an upper hand in understanding what may have happened in terms of weaponisation.\"The accuracy of the inventory will be assessed over the next 45 days by international inspectors at the Yongbyon plant.Estimates earlier this year by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security reckoned Pyongyang has between 28-50kg of weapons-grade plutonium, enough for six to 10 bombs.North Korea joined the nuclear club in October 2006, when it conducted an underground test explosion of a small plutonium bomb. It has denied US allegations that it was also enriching uranium for a secret nuclear programme. Those claims, made by a US diplomat in 2002, led to a tense standoff between Washington and Pyongyang.The two sides have now compromised, in sharp contrast to the Bush administration's approach to the other two \"axis of evil\" nations, Iraq and Iran. This is likely to spark a fierce foreign policy debate in the upcoming US presidential election.Calling North Korea's declaration of its nuclear activities a step in the right direction, Bush told reporters at the White House that multilateral diplomacy was the best way to peacefully resolve issues.The issue of North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens remains a sore point with Tokyo, and Bush said the US would pressure Pyongyang to swiftly resolve the issue.", "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US to take North Korea off rogue states list and lift sanctions"},{"date": "2008-04-01T23:06:59Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea today unleashed a rhetorical tirade against the new South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, amid worries about renewed friction on the peninsula.In its fiercest personal attack since Lee took power in February, Pyongyang's state media said the president's more assertive stance in talks on nuclear decommissioning would result in \"catastrophic consequences\".In a shift from the \"sunshine policy\" of engagement pursued by his two predecessors, Lee says humanitarian assistance depends on the progress made by Pyongyang in dismantling its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea is furious that the two issues are being linked.In commentary today, the Communist party newspaper Rodong Sinmun labelled Lee a \"political charlatan\", an \"absent-minded traitor\" and a \"US sycophant\".Hostilities are rising. Last week, Pyongyang test-fired three missiles and ordered South Korean officials to leave a shared industrial zone. Military commanders in the south have talked hypothetically about targeting suspected North Korean nuclear facilities. In response, a North Korean military commentator warned at the weekend that the south would be reduced to \"ashes\" in a pre-emptive strike. But the two sides are still far from the furious confrontations that marked much of the cold war. Over the past 10 years of liberal rule in the South, Seoul and Pyongyang have moved closer toward reconciliation. They have held two summits, reconnected road and rail links and conducted a handful of reunions of divided families. Lee has proposed an aid package that he says would lift average incomes in the North to $3,000, but Pyongyang has dismissed the plan as \"piffle\".", "tags": ["World news", "South Korea", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea slams aid conditions"},{"date": "2008-06-27T09:27:57Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea today took a dramatic and visually symbolic step towards dismantling its atomic arsenal by blowing up a 20-metre cooling tower at its main nuclear reactor complex.The structure at the Yongbyon nuclear facility, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, was destroyed in a controlled blast shortly after 4pm (0800 BST), foreign media crews invited to witness the event reported.TV footage released later showed the tower exploding in a single blast, sending a puff of grey smoke into the air.The edifice was the single most visible symbol of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, topping the plant that produced the plutonium used in the country's first atomic weapons test, in October 2006.As part of long and complex negotiations with the US, China and other nations over ending nuclear development in exchange for concessions, the reactor at Yongbyon was switched off last year. The facility is now being fully disabled, under the scrutiny of US experts.North Korea's denuclearisation took another significant step forwards yesterday when it submitted a long-awaited inventory of its atomic activities, prompting the US to initiate steps to remove Pyongyang from its list of states that sponsor terrorism.The breakthrough, which will also see Washington lift some sanctions and Pyongyang demolish some of its nuclear facilities, is expected to jump-start six-party talks aimed at easing 55 years of tension on the peninsula.For George Bush, the compromise represents a remarkable turnaround from the days when he labelled North Korea a part of the \"axis of evil\".Yesterday, he was cautiously upbeat about the prospects for progress. \"Today is a positive day, it's a positive step forward. There's more work to be done and we've got the process in place to get it done in a verifiable way,\" Bush said. US financial sanctions would be lifted within 45 days, on condition that international inspectors verified the inventory, the president said.The much-anticipated dossier was handed over by the North Korean ambassador, Choe Jin-Su, to the Chinese government, which has hosted the six-party talks on the denuclearisation of the peninsula.Six months overdue, the declaration of the secretive nation's nuclear materials, facilities and programmes was expected to be limited to the processing of plutonium and not to include a list of its nuclear weapons, which would come later.Nor was it thought likely to address US claims that Pyongyang has exported nuclear technology to Syria and covertly launched its own uranium enrichment programme.The economic impact will be limited. Bush said the US would continue to observe North Korea's actions carefully and that UN sanctions would remain in effect. For its international isolation to end, Pyongyang had to fully disclose its nuclear activities and meet other obligations, he said.But the symbolism of the change in status is important. Pyongyang has been on the rogue list for 20 years and tested a nuclear weapon less than two years ago.Following today's destruction of the cooling tower, tougher tasks lie ahead, including assessing, locating and eliminating North Korea's atomic arsenal in return for economic aid and diplomatic recognition.\"Obviously, the weapons and all the programmes are going to have to be dealt with and dismantled if we are to have denuclearisation, and it's going to have to be done verifiably,\" the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said.\"If we can verifiably determine the amount of plutonium that has been made, we then have an upper hand in understanding what may have happened in terms of weaponisation.\"According to the AFP news agency, the North Korean inventory is likely to include a 37kg (81lb) plutonium stockpile - less than the 40-50kg that US intelligence officials have estimated it has. US officials said they expected the amount to be within intelligence agency estimates.The accuracy of the inventory will be assessed over the next 45 days by international inspectors at the Yongbyon plant.Estimates earlier this year by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security reckoned that Pyongyang had between 28-50kg of weapons-grade plutonium, enough for six to 10 bombs.

The White House described the alleged reactor as \"a dangerous and potentially destabilising development for the region and the world\". After seven months of silence and evasion from the Bush administration, the CIA director, Michael Hayden, briefed members of the Senate and House armed services, intelligence and foreign affairs committees, saying his weapons specialists found the evidence compelling.After the Israeli attack last September, there had been speculation that the target was a nuclear reactor but this the first time there has been an official statement, complete with details, and the first time that North Korea has been implicated.The Bush administration also disclosed that Israel had consulted Washington before launching the strike.The White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, speaking after the Senate and House of Representatives had been briefed, said Syria had built the plant \"carefully hidden from view\" in a remote desert area in the east of the country, in breach of its international obligations.\"We are convinced, based on a variety of information, that North Korea assisted Syria's covert nuclear activities. We have good reason to believe that the reactor, which was damaged beyond repair on September 6 of last year, was not intended for peaceful purposes,\" she said.The White House added that the regime moved quickly to bury evidence of its existence, covering over the wreckage and constructing a new building on the site.US officials said yesterday the Bush administration was putting the information out in order to clear the decks before doing a deal with North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programme.The video, made public last night after Congress had been briefed, is a collection of material from various sources, in addition to Israeli intelligence. There is no tape from inside the alleged reactor, only two still photographs, apparently taken by a human hand on the ground rather than a drone or satellite. This was supported by satellite pictures and graphs.The pictures taken on the ground show an apparently empty brown-grey, solid building, but nothing that seems to indicate it is being used for nuclear purposes.In the video, which shows the site before and after the bombing, the CIA claims that the alleged reactor is similar to one in Yongbyon, 55 miles north of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.One official said the Syrian plant was within weeks or months of being operational. \"This thing was good to go,\" he said. Congress was told that the reactor was designed to produce a small amount of plutonium, which can be used to build a nuclear bomb.In releasing the video, the Bush administration is taking the risk that the North Korea regime may use it as an excuse to walk out of US-North Korean negotiations about dismantling its nuclear programme, but is banking on any such walkout as being only temporary.Under a deal agreed last year between North Korea, the US, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, Pyongyang is required to detail whether it has provided nuclear help to Syria and other countries round the world. So far it has failed to deliver.A US official who had seen the video said: \"We cannot move forward [on a deal with North Korea] unless you acknowledge we are doing this with our eyes wide open. And we are going ahead with our eyes wide open.\"The Syrian government yesterday denied it had been building a nuclear reactor with North Korean help. Syria's ambassador to Britain, Sami al-Khiyami, described the video as ridiculous: \"Unfortunately the scenario of taking and retaking pictures looks like what happened before the Iraq war, when the US administration was trying to convince the world that Iraq had nuclear weapons.\" In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration showed photographs and other material to the UN security council that it claimed amounted to evidence of Saddam Hussein's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, but which were subsequently proven to be false.Joseph Cirincione, an expert on nuclear proliferation and head of the Washington-based Ploughshares Fund, said: \"We should learn first from the past and be very cautious about any intelligence from the US about other country's weapons.\"He insisted there had been no justification for Israeli launching the strike on another country, given there was no imminent danger. He added that Syria was a sideshow that should not deflect attention from the bigger prize of North Korea dismantling its nuclear programme. \"The administration is trying to clear up old business, so it does not get in the way of an agreement with North Korea.\"The Israeli strike destroyed a large building in the desert near the village of At Tibnah in the Dayr az Zawr region, 90 miles from the Iraqi border. The strike was reminiscent of one on the Iraqi reactor at Osirk in 1981. But, unlike the Iraqi strike, the attack on Syria initially remained shrouded in mystery, with Bush and other leaders repeatedly deflecting reporters' questions.At the time, the British intelligence service, MI6, privately briefed the British government that Syria had been building a nuclear reactor. The British government accepted this as credible.If Syria had been secretly building a nuclear plant, it would have been in breach of the non-proliferation treaty, which requires Damascus to notify the UN watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, of any such plans.The US media and some analysts speculated that neo-conservatives in the Bush administration, led by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, wanted the North Korea-Syria link publicised to try to wreck the prospect of a deal and to undermine the state department official leading the negotiations, Christopher Hill, the assistant secretary of state for Asia But US officials, as well as analysts, discounted this, saying the neo-conservatives had been discredited and that pragmatists such as the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who favours a deal with North Korea, remained in the ascendancy.BackstoryIsrael is the sole nuclear power in the Middle East, though it publicly refuses to acknowledge this, and is intent on remaining so. It carried out a pre-emptive air strike against Saddam Hussein's nuclear plant at Osirk in 1981, from which the dictator's nuclear ambitions never recovered, and hinted at similar strikes against Iran, saying it will not allow Tehran to acquire a nuclear weapon. It was against this background that Israel bombed the alleged Syrian nuclear plant in September. It came as a surprise, given that there had been no speculation that Damascus had been engaged in any such programme. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, imposed a news blackout and George Bush also refused at White House press conferences to confirm whether the target was a suspect nuclear plant, until yesterday. At the time, there were questions over why Israel should strike against Syria at such an early stage. One theory was that it was meant as a signal to Iran that if it continued to pursue uranium enrichment, a process that could lead to a nuclear bomb, Israel would bomb its nuclear sites.", "tags": ["US news", "US foreign policy", "Syria", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "US politics"], "title": "US claims North Korea helped build Syria reactor plant"},{"date": "2008-04-24T15:09:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The White House was today set to reveal video images it claims support allegations that North Korea was helping Syria to build a nuclear reactor.The suspected reactor was destroyed by Israeli planes last September in a raid reminiscent of its 1981 raid on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq.Little remains known about the raid seven months later, and today's evidence has been keenly anticipated. US media reports said the video images \u2013 believed to have been obtained via Israeli intelligence - show Korean faces among the workers at the Syrian plant.The reports said the video also revealed that the Syrian reactor core's design was the same as that of the North Korean reactor at Yongbon, including a virtually identical configuration and number of holes for fuel rods.Following the Israeli attack, Syria kept relatively quiet about the bombing raid on its territory, bulldozing the area and constructing a new building on the exact location of the old one.Damascus refused to allow international nuclear inspectors to visit the location, fuelling suspicions that it had something to cover up. Speaking in London, the Syrian ambassador to Britain dismissed US accusations that it was helping build a nuclear reactor that could produce plutonium. Sami al-Khiyami told Reuters that the accusation was intended to put pressure on North Korea in talks about Pyongyang's nuclear programme. \"This has nothing to do with North Korea and Syria,\" he said. \"They just want to exert more pressure on North Korea. This is why they are coming up with this story. \"The cooperation between North Korea and Syria has nothing to do with [building] a nuclear facility. Cooperation is mainly economic. The Bush administration is going public with the video at a sensitive time in negotiations with North Korea about its nuclear programme.Under a recent deal, Pyongyang said it would reveal full details of its nuclear programme in return for a lifting of US economic sanctions.However, progress has stalled. North Korea failed to meet a December 31 2007 deadline for giving a complete list of its fissile material and nuclear weaponry as well as responding to US suspicions of proliferating technology to Syria.Pyongyang's foreign ministry today said technical matters had been discussed with the US team. \"The negotiations proceeded in a sincere and constructive manner,\" a statement said.There has been speculation that the timing of the briefing is a ploy by administration hawks, such as the vice-president, Dick Cheney, to scupper the talks with North Korea.They believe North Korea is about to be rewarded for its \"bad behaviour\".Christopher Hill, the US negotiator with North Korea, has played down the importance of the Syrian incident as a sideshow, and believes the key is stopping Pyongyang from producing more plutonium and giving up what it has.\"Making public the pictures is likely to inflame the North Koreans,\" a senior administration official told the New York Times. \"And that's just what opponents of this whole arrangement want, because they think the North Koreans will stalk off.\"Syria has denounced US and Israeli claims about the alleged reactor, pointing out that the Bush administration presented bogus evidence to the UN security council before the Iraq war.", "tags": ["US news", "North Korea", "Syria", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US claims video shows North Korea helped build Syrian reactor"},{"date": "2008-06-26T10:50:15Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The move followed Pyongyang's long-awaited declaration of nuclear activities a few hours earlier.US financial sanctions imposed under the Trading With the Enemy Act will be lifted within 45 days, on condition that international inspectors verify the inventory, Bush said.The US state department will meanwhile start the process of taking North Korea - which Bush once named as part of an \"axis of evil\" along with Iran and Saddam Hussein's Iraq - off its list of nations that sponsor terrorism.Sanctions will be lifted unless Congress blocks such a move. That is unlikely as the Democratic majority in Congress has supported Bush's diplomatic courtship of Pyongyang.But the US Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, said US sanctions should only be lifted \"based on North Korean performance\". He called on Congress to examine the North Korean declaration and verification procedures.Obama's Republican opponent, John McCain, was also cautious.\"We'll have to have a look and see how the overall agreement is and whether we should continue to lift sanctions, whether the Japanese and South Korean concerns have been addressed,\" the Arizona senator told reporters in Cincinnati.Hardline Republicans were quick to condemn the White House's rapprochement with North Korea.\"It's shameful,\" John Bolton, Bush's former US ambassador at the United Nations, said of the president's decision. \"This represents the final collapse of Bush's foreign policy.\" \"Profound disappointment\" was the reaction of a Republican member of the House of Representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.In his announcement in the Rose garden at the White House, Bush said the US would continue to carefully observe the actions of the North Korean government and UN sanctions would remain in effect. For its international isolation to end, Pyongyang had to fully disclose all of its nuclear activities and meet other obligations, he said.Pyongyang has been on the rogue list since 1986, when North Korean agents planted a bomb on a South Korean airliner, killing 115 people.As a visible sign that it is dismantling its programme, North Korea will allow dozens of foreign TV companies to film and broadcast the demolition tomorrow of the cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear plant.Coming half a year after an agreed deadline, the declaration will kick-start stalled six-party talks on the denuclearisation of the peninsular, but tougher tasks lie ahead, including assessing, locating and eliminating North Korea's atomic arsenal in return for economic aid and diplomatic recognition.\"Obviously, the weapons and all the programmes are going to have to be dealt with and dismantled if we are to have denuclearisation and it's going to have to be done so verifiably,\" said the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. \"If we can verifiably determine the amount of plutonium that has been made, we then have an upper hand in understanding what may have happened in terms of weaponisation.\"The accuracy of the inventory will be assessed over the next 45 days by international inspectors at the Yongbyon plant.Estimates earlier this year by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security reckoned Pyongyang has between 28-50kg of weapons-grade plutonium, enough for six to 10 bombs.North Korea joined the nuclear club in October 2006, when it conducted an underground test explosion of a small plutonium bomb. It has denied US allegations that it was also enriching uranium for a secret nuclear programme. Those claims, made by a US diplomat in 2002, led to a tense standoff between Washington and Pyongyang.The two sides have now compromised, in sharp contrast to the Bush administration's approach to the other two \"axis of evil\" nations, Iraq and Iran. This is likely to spark a fierce foreign policy debate in the upcoming US presidential election.Calling North Korea's declaration of its nuclear activities a step in the right direction, Bush told reporters at the White House that multilateral diplomacy was the best way to peacefully resolve issues.The issue of North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens remains a sore point with Tokyo, and Bush said the US would pressure Pyongyang to swiftly resolve the issue.", "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US to take North Korea off rogue states list and lift sanctions"},{"date": "2008-06-26T23:01:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea came in from the cold yesterday, after handing over a declaration of its nuclear programme to Chinese officials. Even though the declaration falls short of what the US once demanded, President George Bush said he would lift US trade sanctions and notify Congress that he intends to take North Korea off the state department list of nations that sponsor terrorism. One of the spokes seems to have come off the axis of evil.There was no shortage of irony in yesterday's statements. With the clock ticking on his remaining months in power, North Korea could well go down as Mr Bush's sole foreign policy success. And yet it was achieved only after a dramatic U-turn, from which John Bolton, a former leading neoconservative, is still smarting. Mr Bolton's muscular treatment of North Korea was jettisoned, and the state department dusted off a policy of pragmatic engagement pursued by Bill Clinton a decade earlier. Washington was jolted into action by a nuclear test. The device only partially exploded, but the diplomatic shockwave travelled the world. Rogue states take note: if you have a weapon of mass destruction, use it as soon as you can, because only then will anyone take you seriously.Christopher Hill, the US negotiator whose triumph this is, cautions against drawing too many conclusions. Unlike Iran, North Korea is on its knees, one flood or typhoon away from mass starvation. Another factor is psychological: North Korea's awareness of its own isolation. It is surrounded by booming economies and selling off the secrets of its nuclear programme is the only card the regime has left to play.This is not the end of the North Korean story, but the start of another, equally anguished phase for the peninsula as a whole. The economic gap between north and south is many times wider than that which existed between east and west Germany when the wall came down. A sudden collapse of the regime in Pyongyang is the last thing Seoul needs. The probable ending of the North Korean nuclear programme (questions over the number of bombs created and a parallel programme of uranium enrichment are still to be answered) will not only lead to the ending of the last conflict of the cold war - it is an opportunity to learn from the blunders made in nation-building in recent history. Both the implosion of the Soviet Union and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein should have taught the west the limitations of trying to fashion other countries in our image. Demolition, alone, is not enough.

North Korea is furious that the two issues are being linked.In commentary today, the Communist party newspaper Rodong Sinmun labelled Lee a \"political charlatan\", an \"absent-minded traitor\" and a \"US sycophant\".Hostilities are rising. Last week, Pyongyang test-fired three missiles and ordered South Korean officials to leave a shared industrial zone. Military commanders in the south have talked hypothetically about targeting suspected North Korean nuclear facilities. In response, a North Korean military commentator warned at the weekend that the south would be reduced to \"ashes\" in a pre-emptive strike. But the two sides are still far from the furious confrontations that marked much of the cold war. Over the past 10 years of liberal rule in the South, Seoul and Pyongyang have moved closer toward reconciliation. They have held two summits, reconnected road and rail links and conducted a handful of reunions of divided families. Lee has proposed an aid package that he says would lift average incomes in the North to $3,000, but Pyongyang has dismissed the plan as \"piffle\".", "tags": ["World news", "South Korea", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea slams aid conditions"},{"date": "2008-06-27T09:27:57Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea today took a dramatic and visually symbolic step towards dismantling its atomic arsenal by blowing up a 20-metre cooling tower at its main nuclear reactor complex.The structure at the Yongbyon nuclear facility, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, was destroyed in a controlled blast shortly after 4pm (0800 BST), foreign media crews invited to witness the event reported.TV footage released later showed the tower exploding in a single blast, sending a puff of grey smoke into the air.The edifice was the single most visible symbol of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, topping the plant that produced the plutonium used in the country's first atomic weapons test, in October 2006.As part of long and complex negotiations with the US, China and other nations over ending nuclear development in exchange for concessions, the reactor at Yongbyon was switched off last year. The facility is now being fully disabled, under the scrutiny of US experts.North Korea's denuclearisation took another significant step forwards yesterday when it submitted a long-awaited inventory of its atomic activities, prompting the US to initiate steps to remove Pyongyang from its list of states that sponsor terrorism.The breakthrough, which will also see Washington lift some sanctions and Pyongyang demolish some of its nuclear facilities, is expected to jump-start six-party talks aimed at easing 55 years of tension on the peninsula.For George Bush, the compromise represents a remarkable turnaround from the days when he labelled North Korea a part of the \"axis of evil\".Yesterday, he was cautiously upbeat about the prospects for progress. \"Today is a positive day, it's a positive step forward. There's more work to be done and we've got the process in place to get it done in a verifiable way,\" Bush said. US financial sanctions would be lifted within 45 days, on condition that international inspectors verified the inventory, the president said.The much-anticipated dossier was handed over by the North Korean ambassador, Choe Jin-Su, to the Chinese government, which has hosted the six-party talks on the denuclearisation of the peninsula.Six months overdue, the declaration of the secretive nation's nuclear materials, facilities and programmes was expected to be limited to the processing of plutonium and not to include a list of its nuclear weapons, which would come later.Nor was it thought likely to address US claims that Pyongyang has exported nuclear technology to Syria and covertly launched its own uranium enrichment programme.The economic impact will be limited. Bush said the US would continue to observe North Korea's actions carefully and that UN sanctions would remain in effect. For its international isolation to end, Pyongyang had to fully disclose its nuclear activities and meet other obligations, he said.But the symbolism of the change in status is important. Pyongyang has been on the rogue list for 20 years and tested a nuclear weapon less than two years ago.Following today's destruction of the cooling tower, tougher tasks lie ahead, including assessing, locating and eliminating North Korea's atomic arsenal in return for economic aid and diplomatic recognition.\"Obviously, the weapons and all the programmes are going to have to be dealt with and dismantled if we are to have denuclearisation, and it's going to have to be done verifiably,\" the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said.\"If we can verifiably determine the amount of plutonium that has been made, we then have an upper hand in understanding what may have happened in terms of weaponisation.\"According to the AFP news agency, the North Korean inventory is likely to include a 37kg (81lb) plutonium stockpile - less than the 40-50kg that US intelligence officials have estimated it has. US officials said they expected the amount to be within intelligence agency estimates.The accuracy of the inventory will be assessed over the next 45 days by international inspectors at the Yongbyon plant.Estimates earlier this year by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security reckoned that Pyongyang had between 28-50kg of weapons-grade plutonium, enough for six to 10 bombs. Officials also said disagreements over whether North Korea had been enriching uranium had to be resolved.But the two sides have shown a willingness to compromise, in contrast with the Bush administration's approach to the other two \"axis of evil\" countries - Iraq and Iran. That approach is likely to spark a fierce foreign policy debate during the upcoming US presidential election.Japan was more cautious about the significance of the inventory. \"It's good that they made the declaration, but the issue is what's in it,\" said the foreign minister, Masahiko Komura.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Japan", "US news", "World news", "Nuclear weapons", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea blows up cooling tower in nuclear concession"},{"date": "2008-06-06T11:11:19Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "South Korea today signalled a further shift from its tough stance on North Korea as its president, Lee Myung-bak, praised the north for its cooperation in nuclear talks.\"I assess North Korea very positively for cooperating with the international community on denuclearisation,\" Lee said in a televised speech on South Korea's memorial day, which honours the millions that died during the war with the north.The speech displayed a marked change in tone for Lee, who was elected in a landslide in December after pledging a more robust approach to Pyongyang. The shift reflected growing impatience in some quarters that the decade-old \"sunshine policy\" of giving generous aid had failed to modify North Korea's intransigence. Lee was determined to inject more stick and less carrot in his policy towards Pyongyang.Lee started his term with a can-do reputation from his days at the industrial giant Hyundai and as the mayor of Seoul. As mayor, he rammed through initiatives that cemented his reputation as a man of action. Among his most visible legacies in Seoul is an artificial river that starts in the city centre, its source marked by a giant snail-like sculpture. He also decreed that buses should run in the central lanes of the city's wide thoroughfares.But his approach has been less effective at national and international level. He signalled a tougher approach to North Korea by announcing plans to downgrade the ministry of unification, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, as it was distorting South Korea's overall international diplomacy. He also unveiled an ambitious initiative to triple North Korea's per capita income to $3,000 a month if it abandoned its nuclear weapons programme and opened up politically.The so-called Vision 3000 denuclearisation and openness plan was too big a cake for Pyongyang to swallow, says Bong-Geun Jun, a professor at the institute of foreign affairs and national security. North Korea also reacted badly to the move to downgrade the ministry of unification. Lee backed down following protests from within his own party, but the damage had been done.North Korea broke off official contact with Seoul and reconciliation talks went into a deep freeze. Meanwhile, Pyongyang launched vituperative personal attacks on Lee. His timing was unfortunate, as the Bush administration dropped its hardline stance against North Korea to resume a dialogue.George Bush even wrote a friendly letter to Kim Jong-Il, after previously belittling the North Korean leader. The chief US negotiater in the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programme, Christopher Hill, is reported to get on well with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan.Amid fears that Seoul was being frozen out of this budding relationship, South Korea has had to change gears. The tough rhetoric has stopped.In an interview with theguardian.com, South Korea's urbane chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Sook, said: \"We see some signs of sincerity [on North Korea's part]. Most of the credit must go to the US. The important thing is that they have agreed in principle to abandon all nuclear programmes and weapons through negotiations in the six-party talks. It will be a long and winding road and we will have to show patience and perseverance in the months ahead.\"North Korea recently handed over 18,000 pages of logs from its Yongbyon nuclear facility dating back to 1986. Having been briefed by the US, South Korea is making positive noises about recent North Korean moves. The next step is for North Korea to present its declaration on its nuclear programme to China, one of the participants in the six-party talks along with the US, Russia, Japan and the two Koreas.Kim seemed keen to draw a line under North Korea's alleged nuclear cooperation with Syria. \"I believe that such cooperation has stopped and we have seen no sign since last autumn that such cooperation has continued,\" he said.While some scepticism lingers as to whether North Korea actually provided nuclear help to Syria, Kim said US intelligence and information on the matter had been credible. \"It is more important than ever that we ensure that such cooperation will not happen in the future,\" he said.But Kim's fundamental message to North Korea was one of reconciliation despite whatever what was said at the start of Lee's administration. \"Our present policy to North Korea is based on reconciliation,\" he said. \"We always prefer to have dialogue and would like to assist North Korea by whatever means to re-establish their economy and their bad food situation.\"But North Korea can afford to reject South Korea's offers of help as the US has just come through with a previous offer to deliver 500,000 tonnes of rice in emergency food aid. South Korea finds itself in an awkward position, having to watch Pyongyang apparently pulling all the diplomatic strings.\"That's right, they can manipulate everyone around them because they have one-man rule,\" Jun said. \"They are quite proud of it as they do it very well, but I feel sorry for them.

He added that Syria was a sideshow that should not deflect attention from the bigger prize of North Korea dismantling its nuclear programme. \"The administration is trying to clear up old business, so it does not get in the way of an agreement with North Korea.\"The Israeli strike destroyed a large building in the desert near the village of At Tibnah in the Dayr az Zawr region, 90 miles from the Iraqi border. The strike was reminiscent of one on the Iraqi reactor at Osirk in 1981. But, unlike the Iraqi strike, the attack on Syria initially remained shrouded in mystery, with Bush and other leaders repeatedly deflecting reporters' questions.At the time, the British intelligence service, MI6, privately briefed the British government that Syria had been building a nuclear reactor. The British government accepted this as credible.If Syria had been secretly building a nuclear plant, it would have been in breach of the non-proliferation treaty, which requires Damascus to notify the UN watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, of any such plans.The US media and some analysts speculated that neo-conservatives in the Bush administration, led by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, wanted the North Korea-Syria link publicised to try to wreck the prospect of a deal and to undermine the state department official leading the negotiations, Christopher Hill, the assistant secretary of state for Asia But US officials, as well as analysts, discounted this, saying the neo-conservatives had been discredited and that pragmatists such as the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who favours a deal with North Korea, remained in the ascendancy.BackstoryIsrael is the sole nuclear power in the Middle East, though it publicly refuses to acknowledge this, and is intent on remaining so. It carried out a pre-emptive air strike against Saddam Hussein's nuclear plant at Osirk in 1981, from which the dictator's nuclear ambitions never recovered, and hinted at similar strikes against Iran, saying it will not allow Tehran to acquire a nuclear weapon. It was against this background that Israel bombed the alleged Syrian nuclear plant in September. It came as a surprise, given that there had been no speculation that Damascus had been engaged in any such programme. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, imposed a news blackout and George Bush also refused at White House press conferences to confirm whether the target was a suspect nuclear plant, until yesterday. At the time, there were questions over why Israel should strike against Syria at such an early stage. One theory was that it was meant as a signal to Iran that if it continued to pursue uranium enrichment, a process that could lead to a nuclear bomb, Israel would bomb its nuclear sites.", "tags": ["US news", "US foreign policy", "Syria", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "US politics"], "title": "US claims North Korea helped build Syria reactor plant"},{"date": "2008-04-24T15:09:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The White House was today set to reveal video images it claims support allegations that North Korea was helping Syria to build a nuclear reactor.The suspected reactor was destroyed by Israeli planes last September in a raid reminiscent of its 1981 raid on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq.Little remains known about the raid seven months later, and today's evidence has been keenly anticipated. US media reports said the video images \u2013 believed to have been obtained via Israeli intelligence - show Korean faces among the workers at the Syrian plant.The reports said the video also revealed that the Syrian reactor core's design was the same as that of the North Korean reactor at Yongbon, including a virtually identical configuration and number of holes for fuel rods.Following the Israeli attack, Syria kept relatively quiet about the bombing raid on its territory, bulldozing the area and constructing a new building on the exact location of the old one.Damascus refused to allow international nuclear inspectors to visit the location, fuelling suspicions that it had something to cover up. Speaking in London, the Syrian ambassador to Britain dismissed US accusations that it was helping build a nuclear reactor that could produce plutonium. Sami al-Khiyami told Reuters that the accusation was intended to put pressure on North Korea in talks about Pyongyang's nuclear programme. \"This has nothing to do with North Korea and Syria,\" he said. \"They just want to exert more pressure on North Korea. This is why they are coming up with this story. \"The cooperation between North Korea and Syria has nothing to do with [building] a nuclear facility. Cooperation is mainly economic. The Bush administration is going public with the video at a sensitive time in negotiations with North Korea about its nuclear programme.Under a recent deal, Pyongyang said it would reveal full details of its nuclear programme in return for a lifting of US economic sanctions.However, progress has stalled. North Korea failed to meet a December 31 2007 deadline for giving a complete list of its fissile material and nuclear weaponry as well as responding to US suspicions of proliferating technology to Syria.Pyongyang's foreign ministry today said technical matters had been discussed with the US team. \"The negotiations proceeded in a sincere and constructive manner,\" a statement said.There has been speculation that the timing of the briefing is a ploy by administration hawks, such as the vice-president, Dick Cheney, to scupper the talks with North Korea.They believe North Korea is about to be rewarded for its \"bad behaviour\".Christopher Hill, the US negotiator with North Korea, has played down the importance of the Syrian incident as a sideshow, and believes the key is stopping Pyongyang from producing more plutonium and giving up what it has.\"Making public the pictures is likely to inflame the North Koreans,\" a senior administration official told the New York Times. \"And that's just what opponents of this whole arrangement want, because they think the North Koreans will stalk off.\"Syria has denounced US and Israeli claims about the alleged reactor, pointing out that the Bush administration presented bogus evidence to the UN security council before the Iraq war.", "tags": ["US news", "North Korea", "Syria", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US claims video shows North Korea helped build Syrian reactor"},{"date": "2008-06-26T10:50:15Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The move followed Pyongyang's long-awaited declaration of nuclear activities a few hours earlier.US financial sanctions imposed under the Trading With the Enemy Act will be lifted within 45 days, on condition that international inspectors verify the inventory, Bush said.The US state department will meanwhile start the process of taking North Korea - which Bush once named as part of an \"axis of evil\" along with Iran and Saddam Hussein's Iraq - off its list of nations that sponsor terrorism.Sanctions will be lifted unless Congress blocks such a move. That is unlikely as the Democratic majority in Congress has supported Bush's diplomatic courtship of Pyongyang.But the US Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, said US sanctions should only be lifted \"based on North Korean performance\". He called on Congress to examine the North Korean declaration and verification procedures.Obama's Republican opponent, John McCain, was also cautious.\"We'll have to have a look and see how the overall agreement is and whether we should continue to lift sanctions, whether the Japanese and South Korean concerns have been addressed,\" the Arizona senator told reporters in Cincinnati.Hardline Republicans were quick to condemn the White House's rapprochement with North Korea.\"It's shameful,\" John Bolton, Bush's former US ambassador at the United Nations, said of the president's decision. \"This represents the final collapse of Bush's foreign policy.\" \"Profound disappointment\" was the reaction of a Republican member of the House of Representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.In his announcement in the Rose garden at the White House, Bush said the US would continue to carefully observe the actions of the North Korean government and UN sanctions would remain in effect. For its international isolation to end, Pyongyang had to fully disclose all of its nuclear activities and meet other obligations, he said.Pyongyang has been on the rogue list since 1986, when North Korean agents planted a bomb on a South Korean airliner, killing 115 people.As a visible sign that it is dismantling its programme, North Korea will allow dozens of foreign TV companies to film and broadcast the demolition tomorrow of the cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear plant.Coming half a year after an agreed deadline, the declaration will kick-start stalled six-party talks on the denuclearisation of the peninsular, but tougher tasks lie ahead, including assessing, locating and eliminating North Korea's atomic arsenal in return for economic aid and diplomatic recognition.\"Obviously, the weapons and all the programmes are going to have to be dealt with and dismantled if we are to have denuclearisation and it's going to have to be done so verifiably,\" said the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. \"If we can verifiably determine the amount of plutonium that has been made, we then have an upper hand in understanding what may have happened in terms of weaponisation.\"The accuracy of the inventory will be assessed over the next 45 days by international inspectors at the Yongbyon plant.Estimates earlier this year by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security reckoned Pyongyang has between 28-50kg of weapons-grade plutonium, enough for six to 10 bombs.North Korea joined the nuclear club in October 2006, when it conducted an underground test explosion of a small plutonium bomb. It has denied US allegations that it was also enriching uranium for a secret nuclear programme. Those claims, made by a US diplomat in 2002, led to a tense standoff between Washington and Pyongyang.The two sides have now compromised, in sharp contrast to the Bush administration's approach to the other two \"axis of evil\" nations, Iraq and Iran. This is likely to spark a fierce foreign policy debate in the upcoming US presidential election.Calling North Korea's declaration of its nuclear activities a step in the right direction, Bush told reporters at the White House that multilateral diplomacy was the best way to peacefully resolve issues.The issue of North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens remains a sore point with Tokyo, and Bush said the US would pressure Pyongyang to swiftly resolve the issue.", "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US to take North Korea off rogue states list and lift sanctions"},{"date": "2008-06-26T23:01:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea came in from the cold yesterday, after handing over a declaration of its nuclear programme to Chinese officials. Even though the declaration falls short of what the US once demanded, President George Bush said he would lift US trade sanctions and notify Congress that he intends to take North Korea off the state department list of nations that sponsor terrorism. One of the spokes seems to have come off the axis of evil.There was no shortage of irony in yesterday's statements. With the clock ticking on his remaining months in power, North Korea could well go down as Mr Bush's sole foreign policy success. And yet it was achieved only after a dramatic U-turn, from which John Bolton, a former leading neoconservative, is still smarting. Mr Bolton's muscular treatment of North Korea was jettisoned, and the state department dusted off a policy of pragmatic engagement pursued by Bill Clinton a decade earlier. Washington was jolted into action by a nuclear test. The device only partially exploded, but the diplomatic shockwave travelled the world. Rogue states take note: if you have a weapon of mass destruction, use it as soon as you can, because only then will anyone take you seriously.Christopher Hill, the US negotiator whose triumph this is, cautions against drawing too many conclusions. Unlike Iran, North Korea is on its knees, one flood or typhoon away from mass starvation. Another factor is psychological: North Korea's awareness of its own isolation. It is surrounded by booming economies and selling off the secrets of its nuclear programme is the only card the regime has left to play.This is not the end of the North Korean story, but the start of another, equally anguished phase for the peninsula as a whole. The economic gap between north and south is many times wider than that which existed between east and west Germany when the wall came down. A sudden collapse of the regime in Pyongyang is the last thing Seoul needs. The probable ending of the North Korean nuclear programme (questions over the number of bombs created and a parallel programme of uranium enrichment are still to be answered) will not only lead to the ending of the last conflict of the cold war - it is an opportunity to learn from the blunders made in nation-building in recent history. Both the implosion of the Soviet Union and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein should have taught the west the limitations of trying to fashion other countries in our image. Demolition, alone, is not enough.

North Korea is furious that the two issues are being linked.In commentary today, the Communist party newspaper Rodong Sinmun labelled Lee a \"political charlatan\", an \"absent-minded traitor\" and a \"US sycophant\".Hostilities are rising. Last week, Pyongyang test-fired three missiles and ordered South Korean officials to leave a shared industrial zone. Military commanders in the south have talked hypothetically about targeting suspected North Korean nuclear facilities. In response, a North Korean military commentator warned at the weekend that the south would be reduced to \"ashes\" in a pre-emptive strike. But the two sides are still far from the furious confrontations that marked much of the cold war. Over the past 10 years of liberal rule in the South, Seoul and Pyongyang have moved closer toward reconciliation. They have held two summits, reconnected road and rail links and conducted a handful of reunions of divided families. Lee has proposed an aid package that he says would lift average incomes in the North to $3,000, but Pyongyang has dismissed the plan as \"piffle\".", "tags": ["World news", "South Korea", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea slams aid conditions"},{"date": "2008-06-27T09:27:57Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea today took a dramatic and visually symbolic step towards dismantling its atomic arsenal by blowing up a 20-metre cooling tower at its main nuclear reactor complex.The structure at the Yongbyon nuclear facility, 60 miles north of Pyongyang, was destroyed in a controlled blast shortly after 4pm (0800 BST), foreign media crews invited to witness the event reported.TV footage released later showed the tower exploding in a single blast, sending a puff of grey smoke into the air.The edifice was the single most visible symbol of North Korea's nuclear ambitions, topping the plant that produced the plutonium used in the country's first atomic weapons test, in October 2006.As part of long and complex negotiations with the US, China and other nations over ending nuclear development in exchange for concessions, the reactor at Yongbyon was switched off last year. The facility is now being fully disabled, under the scrutiny of US experts.North Korea's denuclearisation took another significant step forwards yesterday when it submitted a long-awaited inventory of its atomic activities, prompting the US to initiate steps to remove Pyongyang from its list of states that sponsor terrorism.The breakthrough, which will also see Washington lift some sanctions and Pyongyang demolish some of its nuclear facilities, is expected to jump-start six-party talks aimed at easing 55 years of tension on the peninsula.For George Bush, the compromise represents a remarkable turnaround from the days when he labelled North Korea a part of the \"axis of evil\".Yesterday, he was cautiously upbeat about the prospects for progress. \"Today is a positive day, it's a positive step forward. There's more work to be done and we've got the process in place to get it done in a verifiable way,\" Bush said. US financial sanctions would be lifted within 45 days, on condition that international inspectors verified the inventory, the president said.The much-anticipated dossier was handed over by the North Korean ambassador, Choe Jin-Su, to the Chinese government, which has hosted the six-party talks on the denuclearisation of the peninsula.Six months overdue, the declaration of the secretive nation's nuclear materials, facilities and programmes was expected to be limited to the processing of plutonium and not to include a list of its nuclear weapons, which would come later.Nor was it thought likely to address US claims that Pyongyang has exported nuclear technology to Syria and covertly launched its own uranium enrichment programme.The economic impact will be limited. Bush said the US would continue to observe North Korea's actions carefully and that UN sanctions would remain in effect. For its international isolation to end, Pyongyang had to fully disclose its nuclear activities and meet other obligations, he said.But the symbolism of the change in status is important. Pyongyang has been on the rogue list for 20 years and tested a nuclear weapon less than two years ago.Following today's destruction of the cooling tower, tougher tasks lie ahead, including assessing, locating and eliminating North Korea's atomic arsenal in return for economic aid and diplomatic recognition.\"Obviously, the weapons and all the programmes are going to have to be dealt with and dismantled if we are to have denuclearisation, and it's going to have to be done verifiably,\" the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said.\"If we can verifiably determine the amount of plutonium that has been made, we then have an upper hand in understanding what may have happened in terms of weaponisation.\"According to the AFP news agency, the North Korean inventory is likely to include a 37kg (81lb) plutonium stockpile - less than the 40-50kg that US intelligence officials have estimated it has. US officials said they expected the amount to be within intelligence agency estimates.The accuracy of the inventory will be assessed over the next 45 days by international inspectors at the Yongbyon plant.Estimates earlier this year by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security reckoned that Pyongyang had between 28-50kg of weapons-grade plutonium, enough for six to 10 bombs. Officials also said disagreements over whether North Korea had been enriching uranium had to be resolved.But the two sides have shown a willingness to compromise, in contrast with the Bush administration's approach to the other two \"axis of evil\" countries - Iraq and Iran. That approach is likely to spark a fierce foreign policy debate during the upcoming US presidential election.Japan was more cautious about the significance of the inventory. \"It's good that they made the declaration, but the issue is what's in it,\" said the foreign minister, Masahiko Komura.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Japan", "US news", "World news", "Nuclear weapons", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea blows up cooling tower in nuclear concession"},{"date": "2008-06-06T11:11:19Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "South Korea today signalled a further shift from its tough stance on North Korea as its president, Lee Myung-bak, praised the north for its cooperation in nuclear talks.\"I assess North Korea very positively for cooperating with the international community on denuclearisation,\" Lee said in a televised speech on South Korea's memorial day, which honours the millions that died during the war with the north.The speech displayed a marked change in tone for Lee, who was elected in a landslide in December after pledging a more robust approach to Pyongyang. The shift reflected growing impatience in some quarters that the decade-old \"sunshine policy\" of giving generous aid had failed to modify North Korea's intransigence. Lee was determined to inject more stick and less carrot in his policy towards Pyongyang.Lee started his term with a can-do reputation from his days at the industrial giant Hyundai and as the mayor of Seoul. As mayor, he rammed through initiatives that cemented his reputation as a man of action. Among his most visible legacies in Seoul is an artificial river that starts in the city centre, its source marked by a giant snail-like sculpture. He also decreed that buses should run in the central lanes of the city's wide thoroughfares.But his approach has been less effective at national and international level. He signalled a tougher approach to North Korea by announcing plans to downgrade the ministry of unification, which deals with inter-Korean affairs, as it was distorting South Korea's overall international diplomacy. He also unveiled an ambitious initiative to triple North Korea's per capita income to $3,000 a month if it abandoned its nuclear weapons programme and opened up politically.The so-called Vision 3000 denuclearisation and openness plan was too big a cake for Pyongyang to swallow, says Bong-Geun Jun, a professor at the institute of foreign affairs and national security. North Korea also reacted badly to the move to downgrade the ministry of unification. Lee backed down following protests from within his own party, but the damage had been done.North Korea broke off official contact with Seoul and reconciliation talks went into a deep freeze. Meanwhile, Pyongyang launched vituperative personal attacks on Lee. His timing was unfortunate, as the Bush administration dropped its hardline stance against North Korea to resume a dialogue.George Bush even wrote a friendly letter to Kim Jong-Il, after previously belittling the North Korean leader. The chief US negotiater in the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programme, Christopher Hill, is reported to get on well with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan.Amid fears that Seoul was being frozen out of this budding relationship, South Korea has had to change gears. The tough rhetoric has stopped.In an interview with theguardian.com, South Korea's urbane chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Sook, said: \"We see some signs of sincerity [on North Korea's part]. Most of the credit must go to the US. The important thing is that they have agreed in principle to abandon all nuclear programmes and weapons through negotiations in the six-party talks. It will be a long and winding road and we will have to show patience and perseverance in the months ahead.\"North Korea recently handed over 18,000 pages of logs from its Yongbyon nuclear facility dating back to 1986. Having been briefed by the US, South Korea is making positive noises about recent North Korean moves. The next step is for North Korea to present its declaration on its nuclear programme to China, one of the participants in the six-party talks along with the US, Russia, Japan and the two Koreas.Kim seemed keen to draw a line under North Korea's alleged nuclear cooperation with Syria. \"I believe that such cooperation has stopped and we have seen no sign since last autumn that such cooperation has continued,\" he said.While some scepticism lingers as to whether North Korea actually provided nuclear help to Syria, Kim said US intelligence and information on the matter had been credible. \"It is more important than ever that we ensure that such cooperation will not happen in the future,\" he said.But Kim's fundamental message to North Korea was one of reconciliation despite whatever what was said at the start of Lee's administration. \"Our present policy to North Korea is based on reconciliation,\" he said. \"We always prefer to have dialogue and would like to assist North Korea by whatever means to re-establish their economy and their bad food situation.\"But North Korea can afford to reject South Korea's offers of help as the US has just come through with a previous offer to deliver 500,000 tonnes of rice in emergency food aid. South Korea finds itself in an awkward position, having to watch Pyongyang apparently pulling all the diplomatic strings.\"That's right, they can manipulate everyone around them because they have one-man rule,\" Jun said. \"They are quite proud of it as they do it very well, but I feel sorry for them.

The White House described the alleged reactor as \"a dangerous and potentially destabilising development for the region and the world\". After seven months of silence and evasion from the Bush administration, the CIA director, Michael Hayden, briefed members of the Senate and House armed services, intelligence and foreign affairs committees, saying his weapons specialists found the evidence compelling.After the Israeli attack last September, there had been speculation that the target was a nuclear reactor but this the first time there has been an official statement, complete with details, and the first time that North Korea has been implicated.The Bush administration also disclosed that Israel had consulted Washington before launching the strike.The White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, speaking after the Senate and House of Representatives had been briefed, said Syria had built the plant \"carefully hidden from view\" in a remote desert area in the east of the country, in breach of its international obligations.\"We are convinced, based on a variety of information, that North Korea assisted Syria's covert nuclear activities. We have good reason to believe that the reactor, which was damaged beyond repair on September 6 of last year, was not intended for peaceful purposes,\" she said.The White House added that the regime moved quickly to bury evidence of its existence, covering over the wreckage and constructing a new building on the site.US officials said yesterday the Bush administration was putting the information out in order to clear the decks before doing a deal with North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programme.The video, made public last night after Congress had been briefed, is a collection of material from various sources, in addition to Israeli intelligence. There is no tape from inside the alleged reactor, only two still photographs, apparently taken by a human hand on the ground rather than a drone or satellite. This was supported by satellite pictures and graphs.The pictures taken on the ground show an apparently empty brown-grey, solid building, but nothing that seems to indicate it is being used for nuclear purposes.In the video, which shows the site before and after the bombing, the CIA claims that the alleged reactor is similar to one in Yongbyon, 55 miles north of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.One official said the Syrian plant was within weeks or months of being operational. \"This thing was good to go,\" he said. Congress was told that the reactor was designed to produce a small amount of plutonium, which can be used to build a nuclear bomb.In releasing the video, the Bush administration is taking the risk that the North Korea regime may use it as an excuse to walk out of US-North Korean negotiations about dismantling its nuclear programme, but is banking on any such walkout as being only temporary.Under a deal agreed last year between North Korea, the US, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, Pyongyang is required to detail whether it has provided nuclear help to Syria and other countries round the world. So far it has failed to deliver.A US official who had seen the video said: \"We cannot move forward [on a deal with North Korea] unless you acknowledge we are doing this with our eyes wide open. And we are going ahead with our eyes wide open.\"The Syrian government yesterday denied it had been building a nuclear reactor with North Korean help. Syria's ambassador to Britain, Sami al-Khiyami, described the video as ridiculous: \"Unfortunately the scenario of taking and retaking pictures looks like what happened before the Iraq war, when the US administration was trying to convince the world that Iraq had nuclear weapons.\" In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration showed photographs and other material to the UN security council that it claimed amounted to evidence of Saddam Hussein's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, but which were subsequently proven to be false.Joseph Cirincione, an expert on nuclear proliferation and head of the Washington-based Ploughshares Fund, said: \"We should learn first from the past and be very cautious about any intelligence from the US about other country's weapons.\"He insisted there had been no justification for Israeli launching the strike on another country, given there was no imminent danger.

US media reports said the video images \u2013 believed to have been obtained via Israeli intelligence - show Korean faces among the workers at the Syrian plant.The reports said the video also revealed that the Syrian reactor core's design was the same as that of the North Korean reactor at Yongbon, including a virtually identical configuration and number of holes for fuel rods.Following the Israeli attack, Syria kept relatively quiet about the bombing raid on its territory, bulldozing the area and constructing a new building on the exact location of the old one.Damascus refused to allow international nuclear inspectors to visit the location, fuelling suspicions that it had something to cover up. Speaking in London, the Syrian ambassador to Britain dismissed US accusations that it was helping build a nuclear reactor that could produce plutonium. Sami al-Khiyami told Reuters that the accusation was intended to put pressure on North Korea in talks about Pyongyang's nuclear programme. \"This has nothing to do with North Korea and Syria,\" he said. \"They just want to exert more pressure on North Korea. This is why they are coming up with this story. \"The cooperation between North Korea and Syria has nothing to do with [building] a nuclear facility. Cooperation is mainly economic. The Bush administration is going public with the video at a sensitive time in negotiations with North Korea about its nuclear programme.Under a recent deal, Pyongyang said it would reveal full details of its nuclear programme in return for a lifting of US economic sanctions.However, progress has stalled. North Korea failed to meet a December 31 2007 deadline for giving a complete list of its fissile material and nuclear weaponry as well as responding to US suspicions of proliferating technology to Syria.Pyongyang's foreign ministry today said technical matters had been discussed with the US team. \"The negotiations proceeded in a sincere and constructive manner,\" a statement said.There has been speculation that the timing of the briefing is a ploy by administration hawks, such as the vice-president, Dick Cheney, to scupper the talks with North Korea.They believe North Korea is about to be rewarded for its \"bad behaviour\".Christopher Hill, the US negotiator with North Korea, has played down the importance of the Syrian incident as a sideshow, and believes the key is stopping Pyongyang from producing more plutonium and giving up what it has.\"Making public the pictures is likely to inflame the North Koreans,\" a senior administration official told the New York Times. \"And that's just what opponents of this whole arrangement want, because they think the North Koreans will stalk off.\"Syria has denounced US and Israeli claims about the alleged reactor, pointing out that the Bush administration presented bogus evidence to the UN security council before the Iraq war.", "tags": ["US news", "North Korea", "Syria", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Israel", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US claims video shows North Korea helped build Syrian reactor"},{"date": "2008-06-26T10:50:15Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The move followed Pyongyang's long-awaited declaration of nuclear activities a few hours earlier.US financial sanctions imposed under the Trading With the Enemy Act will be lifted within 45 days, on condition that international inspectors verify the inventory, Bush said.The US state department will meanwhile start the process of taking North Korea - which Bush once named as part of an \"axis of evil\" along with Iran and Saddam Hussein's Iraq - off its list of nations that sponsor terrorism.Sanctions will be lifted unless Congress blocks such a move. That is unlikely as the Democratic majority in Congress has supported Bush's diplomatic courtship of Pyongyang.But the US Democratic presidential candidate, Barack Obama, said US sanctions should only be lifted \"based on North Korean performance\". He called on Congress to examine the North Korean declaration and verification procedures.Obama's Republican opponent, John McCain, was also cautious.\"We'll have to have a look and see how the overall agreement is and whether we should continue to lift sanctions, whether the Japanese and South Korean concerns have been addressed,\" the Arizona senator told reporters in Cincinnati.Hardline Republicans were quick to condemn the White House's rapprochement with North Korea.\"It's shameful,\" John Bolton, Bush's former US ambassador at the United Nations, said of the president's decision. \"This represents the final collapse of Bush's foreign policy.\" \"Profound disappointment\" was the reaction of a Republican member of the House of Representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.In his announcement in the Rose garden at the White House, Bush said the US would continue to carefully observe the actions of the North Korean government and UN sanctions would remain in effect. For its international isolation to end, Pyongyang had to fully disclose all of its nuclear activities and meet other obligations, he said.Pyongyang has been on the rogue list since 1986, when North Korean agents planted a bomb on a South Korean airliner, killing 115 people.As a visible sign that it is dismantling its programme, North Korea will allow dozens of foreign TV companies to film and broadcast the demolition tomorrow of the cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear plant.Coming half a year after an agreed deadline, the declaration will kick-start stalled six-party talks on the denuclearisation of the peninsular, but tougher tasks lie ahead, including assessing, locating and eliminating North Korea's atomic arsenal in return for economic aid and diplomatic recognition.\"Obviously, the weapons and all the programmes are going to have to be dealt with and dismantled if we are to have denuclearisation and it's going to have to be done so verifiably,\" said the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. \"If we can verifiably determine the amount of plutonium that has been made, we then have an upper hand in understanding what may have happened in terms of weaponisation.\"The accuracy of the inventory will be assessed over the next 45 days by international inspectors at the Yongbyon plant.Estimates earlier this year by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security reckoned Pyongyang has between 28-50kg of weapons-grade plutonium, enough for six to 10 bombs.North Korea joined the nuclear club in October 2006, when it conducted an underground test explosion of a small plutonium bomb. It has denied US allegations that it was also enriching uranium for a secret nuclear programme. Those claims, made by a US diplomat in 2002, led to a tense standoff between Washington and Pyongyang.The two sides have now compromised, in sharp contrast to the Bush administration's approach to the other two \"axis of evil\" nations, Iraq and Iran. This is likely to spark a fierce foreign policy debate in the upcoming US presidential election.Calling North Korea's declaration of its nuclear activities a step in the right direction, Bush told reporters at the White House that multilateral diplomacy was the best way to peacefully resolve issues.The issue of North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens remains a sore point with Tokyo, and Bush said the US would pressure Pyongyang to swiftly resolve the issue.", "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US to take North Korea off rogue states list and lift sanctions"},{"date": "2008-06-26T23:01:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea came in from the cold yesterday, after handing over a declaration of its nuclear programme to Chinese officials. Even though the declaration falls short of what the US once demanded, President George Bush said he would lift US trade sanctions and notify Congress that he intends to take North Korea off the state department list of nations that sponsor terrorism. One of the spokes seems to have come off the axis of evil.There was no shortage of irony in yesterday's statements. With the clock ticking on his remaining months in power, North Korea could well go down as Mr Bush's sole foreign policy success. And yet it was achieved only after a dramatic U-turn, from which John Bolton, a former leading neoconservative, is still smarting. Mr Bolton's muscular treatment of North Korea was jettisoned, and the state department dusted off a policy of pragmatic engagement pursued by Bill Clinton a decade earlier. Washington was jolted into action by a nuclear test. The device only partially exploded, but the diplomatic shockwave travelled the world. Rogue states take note: if you have a weapon of mass destruction, use it as soon as you can, because only then will anyone take you seriously.Christopher Hill, the US negotiator whose triumph this is, cautions against drawing too many conclusions. Unlike Iran, North Korea is on its knees, one flood or typhoon away from mass starvation. Another factor is psychological: North Korea's awareness of its own isolation. It is surrounded by booming economies and selling off the secrets of its nuclear programme is the only card the regime has left to play.This is not the end of the North Korean story, but the start of another, equally anguished phase for the peninsula as a whole. The economic gap between north and south is many times wider than that which existed between east and west Germany when the wall came down. A sudden collapse of the regime in Pyongyang is the last thing Seoul needs. The probable ending of the North Korean nuclear programme (questions over the number of bombs created and a parallel programme of uranium enrichment are still to be answered) will not only lead to the ending of the last conflict of the cold war - it is an opportunity to learn from the blunders made in nation-building in recent history. Both the implosion of the Soviet Union and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein should have taught the west the limitations of trying to fashion other countries in our image. Demolition, alone, is not enough. It will take more time and skill to construct a viable new order, one which genuinely serves the needs of the Korean peninsula.", "tags": ["North Korea", "George Bush", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Editorial: North Korea no more part of axis of Evil"},{"date": "2008-05-06T15:21:33Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A US state department specialist on Korean affairs is planning to travel to North Korea to discuss an impasse in six-nation nuclear disarmament negotiations.State department spokesman Sean McCormack says Sung Kim will leave today.

Pyongyang's long-delayed accounting of its weapons programme kicked off the process of removing it from the terrorism blacklist, but US officials had said any such move today was unlikely.In his conversation with Rice, the official said, Komura pointed out that North Korea had yet to specify how Pyongyang's dismantling of its nuclear weapons programme would be verified. \"I didn't think it [the delisting] would happen because North Korea has yet to agree on concrete verification.\"The official quoted Komura as asking Rice: \"Can I understand there will be no delisting on today, the 11th?\"\"To that question, Rice said, 'That's right,'\" the official said.Last month, Rice held talks with her North Korean counterpart, the first such meeting in four years. The US is seeking extensive inspections of nuclear facilities, soil sampling and access to key scientists. The goal was to reach a deal on the document by mid-August, the US nuclear negotiator, Christopher Hill, said before last month's talks.Removal from the terrorism blacklist would end US sanctions that have seen Pyongyang mostly cut off from international banking. It would also clear the way for multilateral aid packages.The delay is likely to be welcomed in Japan, where there are grave concerns that an easing of US sanctions would lessen Tokyo's chances of settling a feud over citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago. Japanese and North Korean officials today began two days of talks in the north-east China city of Shenyang on the abductions by North Korea.

Last week, it announced it had halted disabling work at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor because of anger at Washington's failure to drop it from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.Officials from countries negotiating with Pyongyang said some equipment was being moved out of storage and back to the plant. \"This is a critical moment, and we should try to break this deadlock as soon as possible so that North Korea can promptly restart nuclear disarmament and come back to the six-party talks,\" Kim Sook, South Korea's chief nuclear envoy, said.\"There is no information on whether North Korean officials will come to Beijing.\" The US has been in \"near daily\" contact with North Korea on how to verify the contents of a declaration on its nuclear inventory, a senior Washington official said yesterday. The official said the contacts - including the most recent, which took place on Wednesday - were one reason why the US was not unduly disturbed by Pyongyang's decision to take equipment at the nuclear complex out of storage.Analysts said the North might be attempting to pressure the outgoing Bush administration as it looks for diplomatic successes to bolster its legacy, and might also believe it could get a better deal by waiting for a new US president.US officials said they viewed North Korea's moves more as a negotiating tactic than a genuine effort to rebuild Yongbyon, which proliferation experts claim has produced enough plutonium for six to eight bombs.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Japan", "US news", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Beijing talks aim to break North Korea nuclear deadlock"},{"date": "2008-08-11T12:30:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The US will not immediately remove North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said today.Rice's comments came in a telephone conversation with the Japanese foreign minister, Masahiko Komura, a Japanese foreign ministry official said.Today was the earliest that the US could have delisted North Korea in exchange for the communist nation's June disclosure of its nuclear programmes. Pyongyang's long-delayed accounting of its weapons programme kicked off the process of removing it from the terrorism blacklist, but US officials had said any such move today was unlikely.In his conversation with Rice, the official said, Komura pointed out that North Korea had yet to specify how Pyongyang's dismantling of its nuclear weapons programme would be verified. \"I didn't think it [the delisting] would happen because North Korea has yet to agree on concrete verification.\"The official quoted Komura as asking Rice: \"Can I understand there will be no delisting on today, the 11th?\"\"To that question, Rice said, 'That's right,'\" the official said.Last month, Rice held talks with her North Korean counterpart, the first such meeting in four years. The US is seeking extensive inspections of nuclear facilities, soil sampling and access to key scientists. The goal was to reach a deal on the document by mid-August, the US nuclear negotiator, Christopher Hill, said before last month's talks.Removal from the terrorism blacklist would end US sanctions that have seen Pyongyang mostly cut off from international banking. It would also clear the way for multilateral aid packages.The delay is likely to be welcomed in Japan, where there are grave concerns that an easing of US sanctions would lessen Tokyo's chances of settling a feud over citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago. Japanese and North Korean officials today began two days of talks in the north-east China city of Shenyang on the abductions by North Korea. They remain an emotive issue in Japan and a major obstacle to the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries.North Korea in 2002 admitted kidnapping 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s. It allowed five of the victims to return home, claiming that the other eight were dead. Japan, however, has demanded proof of the deaths, as well as an investigation into other alleged kidnappings.", "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US to keep North Korea on terrorism list"},{"date": "2008-08-03T23:01:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea said yesterday it would eject South Korean tourists from a resort inside its territory which was once symbolic of reconciliation efforts between the two states.The move comes after a South Korean tourist was shot by a North Korean soldier at Diamond Mountain last month, prompting strong protests from Seoul.The North's military unit in the resort said in a statement through an official news agency that it would expel all South Koreans \"we deem unnecessary\".

Their meeting in Tokyo was arranged by a group campaigning for the return of the abductees.Hajime said a woman believed to be Kyoko Matsumoto had passed a message to the Chinese contact that included personal details only his sister could have known.\"Say hello to Ina-chan for me,\" she reportedly said, an apparent reference to a woman with whom she worked before her abduction.The contact told Hajime that North Korean officials were planning to arrange the first meeting for 31 years between his sister, now 60, and her family in Japan.\"It has become increasingly likely that Kyoko is still alive,\" Hajime told the news agency. \"It is hard to tell how reliable the information is but I would go and meet her if asked.\"The Japanese government said it was taking the report seriously. \"If the information is true we will try to resolve it through diplomatic channels,\" the foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone, said in a TV interview.Five of the abductees were allowed to return to Japan in October 2002 after a landmark summit in Pyongyang between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, and the then Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi.The abductees included Hitomi Soga, wife of the US deserter Charles Jenkins, who joined her in Japan with their two daughters in 2004.The best-known of those Japan believes are still in North Korea is Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she disappeared on her way home from school in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, in November 1977.North Korea said Yokota, who married a North Korean with whom she had a daughter, now 21, had committed suicide in 1994 while being treated in a psychiatric hospital for depression. Japan refuses to believe the claim and DNA tests on \"remains\" North Korea said belonged to Yokota proved inconclusive.Her plight, and her parents' high-profile campaign for her return, have kept the abductions near the top of the domestic political agenda for six years.Last month, Japan's new prime minister, Taro Aso, vowed to do all he could to bring the abductees home. \"Without a resolution there can be no normalisation of relations,\" he said. \"What we are waiting for is action by North Korea. Thirty years have passed, and this is a battle against time.\"But Japan, a member of the six-party talks on the North's nuclear weapons programme, now risks losing diplomatic traction in its bid to resolve the abduction issue.It created tension between Japan and the US last month when Washington removed North Korea from its list of states that sponsor terrorism. That move came hours after the regime agreed to resume dismantling its nuclear facilities and allow visits by international inspectors.The US said it had removed North Korea \u2013 once a member of George Bush's axis of evil \u2013 from the terror list to breathe life into the stalled nuclear negotiations and would continue to pressure Pyongyang to resolve the abduction issue.Japan refuses to normalise diplomatic ties or provide aid until the matter is settled, just as the US, China, Russia and South Korea are considering resuming energy assistance amid progress on the nuclear issue. Under a 2007 agreement, North Korea stands to receive a million tons of fuel oil in return for abandoning its plutonium-based nuclear programme. According to a Japanese newspaper report, the North has decided to cancel another investigation into the abductions because it sees no diplomatic mileage in doing so. Earlier this week it also threatened to adopt an \"ultra-hard line\" against Japan unless it dropped the issue and relaxed sanctions.North Korea's abduction programme is one of the most bizarre episodes of the East Asian cold war. It abducted more than a dozen Japanese men and women between 1977 and 1983.Most of the victims were employed teaching Japanese to spies, while older abductees were rumoured to have been killed and their identities adopted by agents working inside Japan.There are unsubstantiated claims that others were murdered after stumbling on North Korean agents operating on Japanese soil.The first abduction came seven years after members of the Japanese Red Army hijacked a Japan Airlines passenger jet and forced it to land in Pyongyang, where the hijackers were granted political asylum.After years of inaction by the Japanese government, the abductees' plight became a cause celebre in 2002 after Megumi Yao, the wife of a Red Army hijacker, told a court she had tricked one of the abductees, Keiko Arimoto, into flying to Pyongyang.Arimoto, who married another Japanese abductee, was studying in England when she was approached by Yao.The National Association for the Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea, a pressure group with links to rightwing politicians, believes that the regime abducted as many as 100 Japanese citizens.It claims that citizens were also seized from more than 10 other countries, including South Korea, Romania and Thailand.", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japanese woman abducted by North Korea 'still alive'"},{"date": "2008-11-12T09:40:54Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea will halt border crossings with the South from next month, the increasingly isolated state announced today.It blamed the \"confrontational\" approach of its neighbour, which it said had taken conflict \"beyond the danger level\".Relations have deteriorated since President Lee Myung-bak took office in South Korea in February.

It runs services in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa, including Zimbabwe.North Korea first experimented with mobile phones in 2002, but recalled the handsets 18 months later after a mysterious train explosion that killed an estimated 160 people. Some experts argue that officials feared the incident was an attempt to assassinate the regime's \"dear leader\", Kim Jong-il, and that mobile phones were involved.Others think the authorities were simply nervous that they were losing control of the flow of information. Officials have clamped down repeatedly on residents in border areas who are able to use Chinese networks with smuggled handsets.The country recently said it was closing its border crossing with China and refugee groups say it has stepped up punishments for those caught trying to flee.Paik Hak-soon, of South Korea's Sejong Institute thinktank, said that \"government, party, military people\" would be the beneficiaries of the new service, although traders might also be allowed to use it.Orascom's chairman, Naguib Sawiris, has said he expects up to 10% of the population to use the service, with about 50,000 signing up in the first six months. Coverage will initially be limited to the capital and other big cities. He said: \"This is not just about providing third-generation mobile services.

McCain said in a statement he would not support the step unless it was clear North Korea was serious about disarmament and would accept intrusive inspections of its nuclear sites.\"I expect the administration to explain exactly how this new verification agreement advances American interests and those of our allies before I will be able to support any decision to remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism,\" he said.McCain said he was \"concerned that this latest agreement appears to have been reached between Washington and Pyongyang and only then discussed with our Asian allies in an effort to garner their support\".Yesterday, US officials said they were trying to build a consensus among negotiating partners on the decision and on inspection rules that Washington insists must accompany removing North Korea from the list.North Korea, along with Iran and Iraq, were branded as part of an \"axis of evil\" by Bush after the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001.", "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "George Bush", "John McCain", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US removes North Korea from terrorism blacklist"},{"date": "2008-10-02T10:48:15Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The US nuclear negotiator, Christopher Hill, is extending his visit to North Korea to try to salvage a troubled disarmament-for-aid deal.Hill had been due to leave Pyongyang today but US and South Korean officials announced that he would stay at least another day in an attempt to reach a compromise deal and persuade Pyongyang not to restart its nuclear plant.His visit coincided with the first military talks between North and South Korea in eight months. The talks broke up early with little progress made. Reports said South Korea had complained about insults to its president in the north's official media, while North Korea complained about leaflets spread by human rights activists from the south.Meanwhile Hill is aiming to persuade North Korea to accept a verification system to account for its nuclear arsenal while the north wants the US to first remove it from a list of state sponsors of terrorism.The state department spokesman, Sean McCormack, said yesterday that Hill would not offer to change the \"substance\" of any verification mechanism.Analysts have said North Korea might be trying to pressure the outgoing Bush administration as it seeks diplomatic successes to bolster its legacy. The north might also think it could reach a better deal under a new president.In an act of defiance, the north has reportedly started to restore the nuclear site where it conducted its first ever test in October 2006.South Korea's Yonhap news agency cited an unidentified government official as saying smoke has been seen rising from the Punggyeri site in the country's north-east.North and South Korea have been at war since the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce rather than a peace pact.", "tags": ["North Korea", "US news", "World news", "Nuclear weapons", "South Korea", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea nuclear disarmament-for-aid talks extended"},{"date": "2008-12-16T00:01:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A mobile phone service has been launched in North Korea, one of the world's most secretive and tightly controlled states, the official news agency has reported.The move is striking in a country where the tuning of television sets and radios is limited to state channels and internet access is restricted to senior government and military officials.Officials concluded a deal with the Egyptian telecommunications group Orascom to launch a third-generation mobile network, but the service is likely to be available to only a few of North Korea's 23 million inhabitants.Orascom announced in January that it would invest $400m (\u00a3262m) in North Korea. It runs services in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa, including Zimbabwe.North Korea first experimented with mobile phones in 2002, but recalled the handsets 18 months later after a mysterious train explosion that killed an estimated 160 people. Some experts argue that officials feared the incident was an attempt to assassinate the regime's \"dear leader\", Kim Jong-il, and that mobile phones were involved.Others think the authorities were simply nervous that they were losing control of the flow of information. Officials have clamped down repeatedly on residents in border areas who are able to use Chinese networks with smuggled handsets.The country recently said it was closing its border crossing with China and refugee groups say it has stepped up punishments for those caught trying to flee.Paik Hak-soon, of South Korea's Sejong Institute thinktank, said that \"government, party, military people\" would be the beneficiaries of the new service, although traders might also be allowed to use it.Orascom's chairman, Naguib Sawiris, has said he expects up to 10% of the population to use the service, with about 50,000 signing up in the first six months. Coverage will initially be limited to the capital and other big cities. He said: \"This is not just about providing third-generation mobile services.

The unexpected move, reported by Japanese media yesterday, offers hope to the families of other Japanese nationals who were taken to North Korea in the 1970s and 80s to teach their language and customs to spies.Tokyo claims that 17 of its citizens were abducted at the height of the cold war as the communist state attempted to nurture a generation of agents who could operate inside Japan without attracting suspicion.In 2002, North Korea admitted abducting 13 Japanese citizens and allowed five to return home later that year. It said eight others had died, and claimed that the remaining four on Japan's list had never entered the country.The woman at the centre of the reports, Kyoko Matsumoto, was 29 when she went missing on her way to a knitting class near her home in Tottori, western Japan, in September 1977.Though Pyongyang denies knowledge of her, the Kyodo news agency reported that Matsumoto, now married, was living in North Korea and working alongside an unidentified Japanese couple who might also have been abducted.Her brother, Hajime, said a Chinese businessman with trading interests in North Korea gave him the information last month at a meeting in Tokyo arranged by a group campaigning for the return of the abductees.Hajime said a woman believed to be Kyoko Matsumoto had passed a message to the Chinese contact that included details only his sister could have known. \"Say hello to Ina-chan for me,\" she reportedly said, an apparent reference to a woman with whom she worked before her abduction.The contact told Hajime that North Korean officials were planning to arrange the first meeting for 31 years between his sister, who is now 60, and her family in Japan. \"It has become increasingly likely that Kyoko is still alive,\" Hajime told Kyodo. \"It is hard to tell how reliable the information is, but I would go and meet her if asked.\"The Japanese government said it was taking the report seriously. \"If the information is true ... then we will try and resolve this through diplomatic channels,\" the foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone, said in a television interview.Five of the abductees were allowed to return to Japan in October 2002 after a landmark summit in Pyongyang between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, and the then Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi. They included Hitomi Soga, the wife of an American army deserter, Charles Jenkins, who joined her in Japan with their two daughters in 2004.The best-known of the abductees that Tokyo believes are still in North Korea is Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she disappeared on her way home from school in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, in November 1977. North Korea said Yokota, who married a North Korean with whom she had a daughter, had taken her own life in 1994 while being treated in a psychiatric hospital for depression.Japan refuses to believe the claim.

Japan refuses to believe the claim and DNA tests on \"remains\" North Korea said belonged to Yokota proved inconclusive.Her plight, and her parents' high-profile campaign for her return, have kept the abductions near the top of the domestic political agenda for six years.Last month, Japan's new prime minister, Taro Aso, vowed to do all he could to bring the abductees home. \"Without a resolution there can be no normalisation of relations,\" he said. \"What we are waiting for is action by North Korea. Thirty years have passed, and this is a battle against time.\"But Japan, a member of the six-party talks on the North's nuclear weapons programme, now risks losing diplomatic traction in its bid to resolve the abduction issue.It created tension between Japan and the US last month when Washington removed North Korea from its list of states that sponsor terrorism. That move came hours after the regime agreed to resume dismantling its nuclear facilities and allow visits by international inspectors.The US said it had removed North Korea \u2013 once a member of George Bush's axis of evil \u2013 from the terror list to breathe life into the stalled nuclear negotiations and would continue to pressure Pyongyang to resolve the abduction issue.Japan refuses to normalise diplomatic ties or provide aid until the matter is settled, just as the US, China, Russia and South Korea are considering resuming energy assistance amid progress on the nuclear issue. Under a 2007 agreement, North Korea stands to receive a million tons of fuel oil in return for abandoning its plutonium-based nuclear programme. According to a Japanese newspaper report, the North has decided to cancel another investigation into the abductions because it sees no diplomatic mileage in doing so. Earlier this week it also threatened to adopt an \"ultra-hard line\" against Japan unless it dropped the issue and relaxed sanctions.North Korea's abduction programme is one of the most bizarre episodes of the East Asian cold war. It abducted more than a dozen Japanese men and women between 1977 and 1983.Most of the victims were employed teaching Japanese to spies, while older abductees were rumoured to have been killed and their identities adopted by agents working inside Japan.There are unsubstantiated claims that others were murdered after stumbling on North Korean agents operating on Japanese soil.The first abduction came seven years after members of the Japanese Red Army hijacked a Japan Airlines passenger jet and forced it to land in Pyongyang, where the hijackers were granted political asylum.After years of inaction by the Japanese government, the abductees' plight became a cause celebre in 2002 after Megumi Yao, the wife of a Red Army hijacker, told a court she had tricked one of the abductees, Keiko Arimoto, into flying to Pyongyang.Arimoto, who married another Japanese abductee, was studying in England when she was approached by Yao.The National Association for the Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea, a pressure group with links to rightwing politicians, believes that the regime abducted as many as 100 Japanese citizens.It claims that citizens were also seized from more than 10 other countries, including South Korea, Romania and Thailand.", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japanese woman abducted by North Korea 'still alive'"},{"date": "2008-10-13T10:47:49Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea said today it would allow UN monitors renewed access to its nuclear facilities after the US removed the country from the list of states that sponsor terrorism, according to diplomats.Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency would be allowed to \"access all facilities\" at the Yongbyon complex north of Pyongyang, including a plant which processes plutonium for nuclear weapons, a diplomat in Vienna, where the UN nuclear agency is based, told Reuters. There was no immediate confirmation by IAEA officials.The apparent move followed an announcement by North Korea yesterday, hours after it was removed from the terror list, that it would resume dismantling its nuclear weapons programme.Tensions over North Korea's nuclear ambitions rose sharply last month when the country expelled IAEA inspectors and pledged to resume plutonium reprocessing.This called into question years of efforts to secure the reclusive communist state's denuclearisation in return for promises of aid and other incentives. Six-party disarmament talks had stalled in August when North Korea stopped disabling the Yongbyon plant in protest at delays in its being removed from the US blacklist.Yesterday, the official Korean Central News Agency said North Korea welcomed Washington's decision to \"honour its commitment\" over the list.

It has hinted that it seeks a rapprochement with the US while repeatedly threatening its neighbour.\"[The South Korean president's] group of traitors should never forget that the [North] Korean People's Army is fully ready for an all-out confrontation,\" the North's KCNA news agency said, quoting an unnamed military official.It added that the country could be forced to counter-strike against joint US-South Korean military drills announced yesterday, which Seoul and Washington say are defensive.\"If bellicose US forces and South Korean puppets dare wage aggression against us wrapped up in foolish delusion, we will explode our might \u2026 and ruthlessly destroy the invasionary forces,\" KCNA said.Radio Pyongyang reportedly said that armed skirmishes could break out near a disputed sea border at any time.Clinton has already warned that a missile launch would be \"very unhelpful\" and urged Pyongyang to halt \"provocative\" actions.Relations on the peninsula deteriorated after President Lee Myung-bak took office in Seoul last year, abandoning his predecessor's \"sunshine policy\" and cutting aid. Pyongyang recently announced it was ditching a peace deal and all other treaties with its neighbour.North Korea is expected to top the agenda when Clinton meets Lee tomorrow, and she is also expected to discuss it with senior officials when she arrives in China for the final leg of her tour. A six-nation aid-for-disarmament deal stalled in December last year.Clinton is believed to be the first US secretary of state since the 60s to go to Asia on a maiden trip.Earlier today, she sought to reassure citizens in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, of America's good intentions. She said Washington had previously neglected south-east Asia.She appeared on a popular music TV show and toured US-funded aid projects before meeting President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.Tomorrow she will arrive in Beijing, to meet President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, as well as the foreign minister, Yang Jiechi.

Selig Harrison said senior officials warned that North Korea was now a nuclear weapons state and would not commit itself on when it would give them up. The claims came as the North Korean military announced an \"all-out confrontational posture\" against the South on TV yesterday.Relations have been increasingly hostile since the South Korea president, Lee Myung-bak, took office last year, pledging to get tough on Pyongyang. Bush administration officials had predicted North Korea might try to catch the US off-guard as the new administration took charge and the regime has sent mixed signals recently. While it sounds increasingly hawkish in some ways, Harrison said the foreign minister, Pak Ui Chun, and others had stressed their hopes for friendly relations with the US once Barack Obama took office.Harrison, director of the Asia programme at the Washington-based Centre for International Policy, described North Korea's diplomatic strategy as \"a non-stop bargaining and probing process\" in which they frequently changed tack - but said they had raised the bar with their announcement and would find it difficult to back away from the claim.North Korea is believed to have conducted a nuclear test in 2006 and 30.8kg of non-weapons grade plutonium were declared last year. The country's state media said yesterday: \"It will be wrong if the United States thinks that we are giving up [our] nuclear programme in exchange for normalising diplomatic ties with them ... what we want is to bolster our nuclear deterrent power to protect our country.\"", "tags": ["North Korea", "World news"], "title": "North Korea issues nuclear threat"},{"date": "2009-03-26T06:36:40Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is days away from the launch of a long-range missile, United States officials have said, heightening concerns about the risks to regional stability.Counter-proliferation and intelligence officials said the country had mounted a rocket on a launch pad and placed together two stages of what will probably be a three-stage device, Reuters reported today. It could be ready to fire as early as the weekend, sooner than expected.The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, warned that firing a long-range rocket would be a \"provocative act\" that would have consequences, while South Korea said it would be \"a serious challenge and provocation\", threatening regional stability.Pyongyang has said it plans to launch a communications satellite between 4 and 8 April. But Washington, Seoul and Tokyo accuse it of planning a weapons test in breach of a United Nations security council ban. The launch technology for either scenario is nearly identical.While relations between North and South Korea have deteriorated dramatically since President Lee Myung-bak came to power in Seoul last year and took a tougher stance towards his neighbour, Pyongyang has appeared to be seeking improved relations with the new US administration, drawing back from the denunciations it directed at the former president George Bush.South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper said today that US spy satellites detected the rocket on the launch pad at the north-eastern Musudan-ri missile base two days ago.\"Technically a launch is possible within three to four days,\" an unnamed diplomatic source in Seoul told the publication.Seoul's defence ministry said it could not confirm the rocket's placement.But spokesman Won Tae-jae said: \"We are strongly urging the north to immediately halt [preparations].\"Experts believe it is a Taepodong-2 \u2013 the north's longest range missile. In theory it could carry a warhead as far as Alaska, although a previous test flight failed within seconds of the launch in 2006.A successful test this time would boost domestic morale and be seen as a humiliation for the south, which hopes to launch its own satellite later this year.Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency said Seoul was trying to stop the launch because \"it can only be a serious blow to the Lee group, which has been trying to suffocate its compatriots\".North Korea has warned international agencies of the rocket's planned trajectory, which would take it over Japan, dropping booster stages to the east and west.Officials in northern Japanese coastal cities today began setting up emergency networks and running drills to prepare for falling debris in case the launch fails. The government is preparing an order to deploy a missile shield, including interceptors, to protect against debris.Admiral Timothy Keating, the head of US Pacific Command, has said the US military could, with \"high probability\", intercept any missile heading for American territory if ordered to do so.But Pyongyang has said any attempt to shoot down its \"for peaceful purpose\" satellite would be an act of war and has warned it would quit the stalled six-party aid-for-nuclear-disarmament talks.Discord on the peninsula has been exacerbated by the annual joint military drill by South Korean and US troops, which has been larger than usual.The situation may be further complicated by the north's detention of two US journalists, who were arrested last week on the Chinese border.

North Korea has also threatened a naval clash with South Korea on their disputed western sea border.\"One will come to know later what will be launched,\" the North's state-run news agency, KCNA, said, referring to recent news reports in the region that North Korean engineers have been assembling the 105ft rocket.By visiting Asia first, Clinton has broken with a long tradition among new secretaries of state of visiting Europe or the Middle East first, a move seen as an acknowledgement of China's growing status as an economic and military power. Part of her visit to Japan is intended to reassure her hosts that Japan will not be bypassed diplomatically as the Obama attempts to win Chinese co-operation on trade, the environment and regional security.Clinton will meet families of several Japanese nationals who were kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 80s, an issue Tokyo views with more urgency than even the communist state's nuclear ambitions.The US angered Japan last year by removing North Korea from its list of states that sponsor terrorism without consulting its ally. Japan has made resolving the abduction a part of any nuclear deal.Clinton's arrival in Tokyo came hours after Japan reported its economy had shrunk in the last quarter at its fastest rate since the 1974 oil shock.\"The global economic crisis is the backdrop against which this visit takes place,\" she told reporters en route to \u00adTokyo, where she will meet the embattled prime minister, Taro Aso and the foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone.In a sign of Aso's precarious grip on power, Clinton will also hold brief talks with the leader of the main opposition party, Ichiro Ozawa.A year after her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, apologised for crimes committed by US military personnel in Japan, Clinton will sign a deal to relocate 8,000 marines from the southern island of Okinawa to the US Pacific territory of Guam.But she is also expected to reiterate Washington's commitment to its military alliances with Japan and South Korea, which together host tens of thousands of US troops.\"We have and continue to support a policy of extended deterrence that provides protection as part of our alliance with Japan,\" Clinton said last week. \"It remains as strong as it has ever been, we are absolutely committed to it.\"While participating in a purification rite and welcoming ceremony at a Shinto shrine to Emperor Meiji today, she said its message of \"balance and harmony\" would set the tone for the Obama administration's foreign policy, especially in tough economic times.\"It's not only a good concept for religious shrines, it's a good concept for America's role in the world,\" she told about 200 embassy employees afterward. \"We need to be looking to create more balance, more harmony. We're going to reaching out to friends and allies like our hosts here in Japan.\"Clinton, who said last year that \"our relationship with China will be the most important bilateral relationship in the world this century,\" faces a potentially difficult meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing.The US hopes to persuade China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, to support new attempts to cut carbon emissions, and to take a lead in restructuring the global financial system. The US is China's biggest export market and China is the largest holder of US treasury bonds.She said human rights would be \"part of our agenda\" in talks with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, and the premier, Wen Jiabao, scheduled for the end of the week after stays in Indonesia and South Korea.", "tags": ["US news", "Japan", "China", "World news", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "Hillary Clinton", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Clinton issues warning on North Korea"},{"date": "2009-01-18T00:01:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korean officials say they have \"weaponised\" around 30kg of plutonium - enough to make four or five warheads - a US expert reported yesterday as he returned from talks in Pyongyang.

It has hinted that it seeks a rapprochement with the US while repeatedly threatening its neighbour.\"[The South Korean president's] group of traitors should never forget that the [North] Korean People's Army is fully ready for an all-out confrontation,\" the North's KCNA news agency said, quoting an unnamed military official.It added that the country could be forced to counter-strike against joint US-South Korean military drills announced yesterday, which Seoul and Washington say are defensive.\"If bellicose US forces and South Korean puppets dare wage aggression against us wrapped up in foolish delusion, we will explode our might \u2026 and ruthlessly destroy the invasionary forces,\" KCNA said.Radio Pyongyang reportedly said that armed skirmishes could break out near a disputed sea border at any time.Clinton has already warned that a missile launch would be \"very unhelpful\" and urged Pyongyang to halt \"provocative\" actions.Relations on the peninsula deteriorated after President Lee Myung-bak took office in Seoul last year, abandoning his predecessor's \"sunshine policy\" and cutting aid. Pyongyang recently announced it was ditching a peace deal and all other treaties with its neighbour.North Korea is expected to top the agenda when Clinton meets Lee tomorrow, and she is also expected to discuss it with senior officials when she arrives in China for the final leg of her tour. A six-nation aid-for-disarmament deal stalled in December last year.Clinton is believed to be the first US secretary of state since the 60s to go to Asia on a maiden trip.Earlier today, she sought to reassure citizens in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, of America's good intentions. She said Washington had previously neglected south-east Asia.She appeared on a popular music TV show and toured US-funded aid projects before meeting President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.Tomorrow she will arrive in Beijing, to meet President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, as well as the foreign minister, Yang Jiechi. Officials said talks will concentrate on climate change, but analysts expect the global economic crisis and growing tension on the Korean peninsula to be high on the agenda.\"Some believe that China on the rise is by definition an adversary,\" Clinton said in New York on the eve of her tour.\"To the contrary, we believe the US and China benefit from, and contribute to, each other's successes.\"The two countries have already agreed to resume the military dialogue halted last year. But optimism in China is tempered by fears of US economic protectionism and concerns about the role of sensitive issues such as human rights in discussions.\"There are two possibilities: because the US needs China even more, because of the economic situation, Sino-American relations could become even stronger,\" said Professor Shi Yinhong, director of the Centre for American Studies at Renmin University in Beijing.\"But another possibility is that the economic situation deteriorates and there are incentives making people keener to adopt protectionist measures and for the Obama administration to become too focused on trade disputes.\"He said China generally regarded current means of co-operation as focused and effective, and would want to see detailed proposals before agreeing to reshape them.Clinton is perhaps best known in China for her forceful speech to the UN women's conference in Beijing in 1995. She has pledged to raise human rights issues while in China and is to visit a church and hold a town hall meeting.But Professor Shen Dingli, director of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University, said: \"Now she is more mature and a better politician [than in 1995] and I think she will better handle sensitive issues like human rights.\"She will meet with Chinese leaders privately and will certainly raise it then. But I would expect her to spend far more time focusing on areas where the two countries can co-operate.\"", "tags": ["Hillary Clinton", "US news", "China", "Obama administration", "World news", "South Korea", "North Korea", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Hillary Clinton Asia tour: North Korea 'ready for war with South'"},{"date": "2009-02-16T19:26:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Hillary Clinton arrived in Asia on her first overseas trip as US secretary of state today as North Korea prepared to test a ballistic missile which is believed to have sufficient range to reach US territory.In a move that looked set to heighten rather than defuse tensions between the two countries, the Pyongyang regime announced it would launch a missile, widely though to to be the Taepodong-2, from a base on its east coast.Before leaving Washington on Sunday, Clinton had said the United States is willing to normalise ties with North Korea and help rebuild its economy if it abandons its nuclear weapons.On the first day of her trip, which began in Japan today, Clinton said: \"My goal is the denuclearisation of North Korea and that means a verifiably complete accounting of whatever programmes they had and the removal of reprocessed plutonium.\"Later, she warned North Korea against following through on a threatened missile launch, saying it would damage its prospects for improved relations with the United States and the world.Without prompting, she told reporters at a joint news conference with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone that such a move would jeopardise the Obama administration's willingness to work for better ties with Pyongyang.\"The possible missile launch that North Korea is talking about would be very unhelpful in moving our relationship forward,\" she said, adding that if Pyongyang wants to end its isolation it also has to fulfill unmet denuclearization pledges made during the Bush administration.\"The decision as to whether North Korea will cooperate in the six-party talks, end provocative language and actions is up to them and we are watching very closely,\" Clinton said, referring to the six-nation talks aimed at getting North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons.\"If North Korea abides by the obligations it has already entered into and verifiably and completely eliminates its nuclear program, then there will be a reciprocal response certainly from the United States,\" she said. \"It is truly up to the North Koreans.\"Analysts and government officials in the region have feared that North Korea may launch a long-range missile to help make its nuclear program a top foreign policy issue for President Barack Obama. North Korea has also threatened a naval clash with South Korea on their disputed western sea border.\"One will come to know later what will be launched,\" the North's state-run news agency, KCNA, said, referring to recent news reports in the region that North Korean engineers have been assembling the 105ft rocket.By visiting Asia first, Clinton has broken with a long tradition among new secretaries of state of visiting Europe or the Middle East first, a move seen as an acknowledgement of China's growing status as an economic and military power. Part of her visit to Japan is intended to reassure her hosts that Japan will not be bypassed diplomatically as the Obama attempts to win Chinese co-operation on trade, the environment and regional security.Clinton will meet families of several Japanese nationals who were kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 80s, an issue Tokyo views with more urgency than even the communist state's nuclear ambitions.The US angered Japan last year by removing North Korea from its list of states that sponsor terrorism without consulting its ally. Japan has made resolving the abduction a part of any nuclear deal.Clinton's arrival in Tokyo came hours after Japan reported its economy had shrunk in the last quarter at its fastest rate since the 1974 oil shock.\"The global economic crisis is the backdrop against which this visit takes place,\" she told reporters en route to \u00adTokyo, where she will meet the embattled prime minister, Taro Aso and the foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone.In a sign of Aso's precarious grip on power, Clinton will also hold brief talks with the leader of the main opposition party, Ichiro Ozawa.A year after her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, apologised for crimes committed by US military personnel in Japan, Clinton will sign a deal to relocate 8,000 marines from the southern island of Okinawa to the US Pacific territory of Guam.But she is also expected to reiterate Washington's commitment to its military alliances with Japan and South Korea, which together host tens of thousands of US troops.\"We have and continue to support a policy of extended deterrence that provides protection as part of our alliance with Japan,\" Clinton said last week. \"It remains as strong as it has ever been, we are absolutely committed to it.\"While participating in a purification rite and welcoming ceremony at a Shinto shrine to Emperor Meiji today, she said its message of \"balance and harmony\" would set the tone for the Obama administration's foreign policy, especially in tough economic times.\"It's not only a good concept for religious shrines, it's a good concept for America's role in the world,\" she told about 200 embassy employees afterward. \"We need to be looking to create more balance, more harmony. We're going to reaching out to friends and allies like our hosts here in Japan.\"Clinton, who said last year that \"our relationship with China will be the most important bilateral relationship in the world this century,\" faces a potentially difficult meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing.The US hopes to persuade China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, to support new attempts to cut carbon emissions, and to take a lead in restructuring the global financial system. The US is China's biggest export market and China is the largest holder of US treasury bonds.She said human rights would be \"part of our agenda\" in talks with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, and the premier, Wen Jiabao, scheduled for the end of the week after stays in Indonesia and South Korea.", "tags": ["US news", "Japan", "China", "World news", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "Hillary Clinton", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Clinton issues warning on North Korea"},{"date": "2009-02-16T09:24:09Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea today celebrated the birthday of its leader, Kim Jong-il, with lavish displays of synchronised swimming, extravagant rallies and the customary paeans in the state-owned media.However, there were no reports that the 67-year-old had appeared in public, fuelling speculation that he has not fully recovered from a stroke he apparently suffered last summer.His birthday celebrations came amid fears abroad that Pyongyang plans to stage a missile test.There are growing concerns that the country is preparing to test a long-range missile, following surveillance reports of long objects being moved towards the coast and of Chinese ships vacating the area.The official Korean Central news agency (KCNA) reported earlier today that Pyongyang would press ahead with a launch, saying it was part of a space programme.On the inter-Korean border, defectors and activists in South Korea flew tens of thousands of anti-Kim leaflets to the North by balloon, ignoring a warning from their government that the campaign could provoke Pyongyang.Activists put North Korean cash into some of the vinyl leaflets in an effort to entice North Koreans to read their calls for an uprising against Kim.Suzanne Scholte, the chairwoman of the North Korea Freedom Coalition, based in the US, said the leaflet campaign was a way of providing North Koreans with \"true information about their circumstances\".\"It is more important than ever that North Koreans realise that the greatest threat to their well-being and security is their own dear leader,\" she said during the leafleting campaign at the border town of Imjingak.Inside the North, the KCNA reported a surge of congratulatory messages and gifts flooding in from overseas for Kim.Streets and villages in North Korea had been festooned with flowers and other decorations to mark the anniversary, and the country was overflowing with \"warm wishes\" for the leader, the agency said.\"Comrade Kim Jong-il is a great politician, a heaven-made commander and an affectionate father who safeguards and illuminates the fate of our nation and people,\" the country's main Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a lengthy editorial.\"We have to sincerely uphold the dear general's military-first leadership.\"Kim's birthday is one of the North's biggest national holidays, along with that of his late father and national founder Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994.His apparent stroke last year has raised concerns about possible instability in the totalitarian nation in case he is incapacitated, because he has not named any of his three sons as a successor.", "tags": ["North Korea", "World news", "Kim Jong-il"], "title": "North Korea celebrates Kim Jong-il's birthday"},{"date": "2009-05-29T20:19:26Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "1993 North Korea pulls out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty1994 Pyongyang freezes nuclear programme in return for western aid2000 Korean summit in Pyongyang sees \"sunshine policy\" created2002 George Bush names North Korea in \"axis of evil\"; North Korea expels nuclear inspectors and restarts nuclear programme2005 North Korea says it has a nuclear weapon2006 North Korea carries out nuclear test; UN responds with sanctions2007 North Korea shuts down Yongbyon reactor as new deal is reached2008 US removes North Korea from list of states sponsoring terrorism5 April 2009 North Korea launches long-range rocket from north-east coast13 April UN security council condemns launch14 April North Korea announces \u00adwithdrawal from disarmament talks and says it will restore nuclear facilities25 April North Korea announces start of reprocessing of spent fuel rods from its nuclear plant.

The UN security council is reportedly considering adding to the sanctions agreed after the regime detonated its first nuclear weapon in October 2006. One of the options may be to authorise military interdictions under the US-led Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), a loose \"coalition of the willing\" created in 2003 during the Bush administration.PSI participants co-operate to try to intercept cargoes of suspected banned weapons, their means of delivery and other related materials. They also enact laws to facilitate seizure of such materials and take part in interdiction exercises and actual operations. With the addition of South Korea, which was previously an observer nation in interdiction drills, 95 countries on six continents are now PSI participants. Pyongyang has responded by warning of an \"immediate, strong military measures\" if South Korea stops and searches any of its ships.Could the PSI be utilised to enforce a blockade of North Korea? Blockades have been used in nuclear diplomacy before, with President John F Kennedy imposing one around Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. In this contemporary crisis, a blockade is no easy task given that Pyongyang has a history of procurement and proliferation via a variety of land, sea and air routes. Uranium enrichment equipment from the AQ Khan network, for example, was supplied along the Karakoram highway, which runs across northern China from Pakistan in the west to North Korea in the east. Pakistan has received missile-related shipments from the North via the same highway and through air shipments.North Korea's maritime trading routes are the most vulnerable to interdiction and several cargo vessels have been tracked and intercepted in the last decade, including So San (2002), BBC China (2003) and Ville de Virgo (2003). However, these either pre-date PSI or were part of existing law enforcement practices and it remains unclear whether the initiative has resulted in the boarding of a single North Korean ship since it was launched. US officials claim that dozens of interdictions have taken place slowing nuclear and missile programs in Asia and the Middle East, but provide few specifics.The political and operational obstacles to mounting a blockade against North Korea remain formidable. The support or permission of the surrounding countries would be required to intercept all suspicious cargo travelling by road or rail and successfully divert air traffic entering or leaving North Korean territory or airspace. China in particular remains suspicious of the PSI and has previously pledged only to \"inspect\" rather than \"interdict\" cargo destined for the North.The legality of vessel interdiction in international law is also still a point of contention. Under security council resolution 1718 two suspect vessels were boarded and searched in Hong Kong and India in 2006, although no prohibited technology or equipment was discovered. However, the resolution does not allow the use of force to intercept suspect cargo and President Obama may now seek this in a more robustly worded UN decision.So-called \"soft\" proliferation (the transfer of technical drawings, blueprints, data, intellectual property, knowledge and expertise and financial transactions) provides another challenge. Transferred electronically or through direct person-to-person contact this type of activity is much less easily identified, tracked and intercepted. And as more legitimate supply routes are closed down, and procurement efforts move from legal to grey or illicit markets the task becomes even harder.Solid working partnerships under the rubric of the PSI also appear thin on the ground and outside of Nato's Shipping Centre (which does not have a specific counter-proliferation remit) there is little evidence of the diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement and military force components being integrated to good effect. Moreover, the PSI cannot \"turn back the clock\" and eliminate the nuclear facilities and missile systems already constructed, or North Korea's indigenous WMD developmental capability.North Korea also has the capability to raise the political and economic costs of PSI interdiction, possibly to levels that many participating states will consider outweigh the benefits. Ultimately, it will take a political settlement to resolve the underlying conflict over North Korea's nuclear programme. The PSI will at best only be partially effective in intercepting shipments of nuclear and missile hardware and does not offer a permanent solution to the crisis.

But the official news agency statement described this morning's test as \"on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control\" and said it had \"helped satisfactorily settle the scientific and technological problems arising in further increasing the power of nuclear weapons and steadily developing nuclear technology\".Seismological evidence may confirm the country's claims. The Japan Meteorological Agency measured activity at magnitude 5.3. The previous test measured magnitude 3.6, an official at the Korea Meteorological Administration in Seoul told the Associated Press. Russian estimates suggest the underground blast could have been 20 times as great as in 2006.Analysts had previously concluded that North Korea could not miniaturise its nuclear devices to mount on to a missile \u2013 but some are changing their views. Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said last month that it was a \"matter of fact\" that the country had nuclear weapons, urging people to \"face reality\". The US Forces Joint Command also listed North Korea as one of Asia's nuclear powers in a report late last year, although the US government said this did not reflect official policy. An American expert who visited Pyongyang this year said officials told him they had \"weaponised\" about 30kg of plutonium \u2013 enough to make four or five warheads \u2013 although he added that he had no way of establishing the truth of the claim. The country has hundreds of short- and medium-range missiles. A rocket launch in early April \u2013 which North Korea claimed was a satellite launch \u2013 suggests that its long-range missile technology has improved considerably in recent years, but is still wanting. In theory, the Taepodong-2 is capable of reaching Alaska; in practice, there is no sign it can go that far.Pyongyang has stepped up both its rhetoric and its actions in recent months, with many believing its aim has been to force the Obama administration to prioritise the relationship. Some observers hoped that April's rocket launch \u2013 despite repeated warnings from foreign governments \u2013 might be the culmination of these efforts. But when the UN security council criticised the launch, North Korea vowed to restart its nuclear programme, test a nuclear device and carry out long-range missile tests. Being recognised as a nuclear weapons state would give the country more leverage in international negotiations. On a practical note, it is also keen to develop its technology further. In a statement released by the official news agency KCNA, Pyongyang said the test was \"part of the measures to bolster its nuclear deterrent for self-defence in every way as requested by its scientists and technicians\".\"North Korea's strategic objective has not changed. That objective is to win the attention of the Obama administration, to push the North Korea issue up the agenda,\" said Xu Guangyu, a researcher at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association. Professor Han Seung Joo, a former South Korean foreign minister, added: \"It's one way of breaking in the new US administration to the North Korean way of doing things. They want to change the game \u2026 If and when negotiations take place with the US, they want to make it into disarmament or arms control talks between nuclear weapons states, which assumes the US recognises or at least reckons North Korea as a weapons state.\"There are already demands for an emergency meeting of the UN security council. \"This time we will likely get a stronger response than [to the] rocket launch since there is no ambiguity \u2026 but whether the council will have any tools to use is another question. Against North Korea, it seems highly unlikely,\" Tim Savage, deputy director of the Nautilus Institute, told Reuters.Analysts suggest a meeting is likely to result in the further toughening of existing sanctions rather than the introduction of new ones, particularly because Russia and China are unlikely to accept new measures. China is deeply concerned about maintaining the stability of its troubled neighbour and pushing ahead on stalled aid-for-disarmament discussions.\"China's goal is to ensure that the six-party talks process does not fall apart,\" said Xu Guangyu. \"Stricter sanctions are not going to achieve that objective.\"One year after the last nuclear test, the then US president, George Bush, agreed to ease sanctions in exchange for the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear facility (now reopened).Shunji Hiraiwa, of Shizuoka Prefectural University in Japan, told Reuters: \"The last time the United States changed its stance after North Korea conducted a nuclear test, so the North probably thought that unless they did so again, the United States wouldn't change.

China in particular remains suspicious of the PSI and has previously pledged only to \"inspect\" rather than \"interdict\" cargo destined for the North.The legality of vessel interdiction in international law is also still a point of contention. Under security council resolution 1718 two suspect vessels were boarded and searched in Hong Kong and India in 2006, although no prohibited technology or equipment was discovered. However, the resolution does not allow the use of force to intercept suspect cargo and President Obama may now seek this in a more robustly worded UN decision.So-called \"soft\" proliferation (the transfer of technical drawings, blueprints, data, intellectual property, knowledge and expertise and financial transactions) provides another challenge. Transferred electronically or through direct person-to-person contact this type of activity is much less easily identified, tracked and intercepted. And as more legitimate supply routes are closed down, and procurement efforts move from legal to grey or illicit markets the task becomes even harder.Solid working partnerships under the rubric of the PSI also appear thin on the ground and outside of Nato's Shipping Centre (which does not have a specific counter-proliferation remit) there is little evidence of the diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement and military force components being integrated to good effect. Moreover, the PSI cannot \"turn back the clock\" and eliminate the nuclear facilities and missile systems already constructed, or North Korea's indigenous WMD developmental capability.North Korea also has the capability to raise the political and economic costs of PSI interdiction, possibly to levels that many participating states will consider outweigh the benefits. Ultimately, it will take a political settlement to resolve the underlying conflict over North Korea's nuclear programme.

The Japan Meteorological Agency measured activity at magnitude 5.3. The previous test measured magnitude 3.6, an official at the Korea Meteorological Administration in Seoul told the Associated Press. Russian estimates suggest the underground blast could have been 20 times as great as in 2006.Analysts had previously concluded that North Korea could not miniaturise its nuclear devices to mount on to a missile \u2013 but some are changing their views. Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said last month that it was a \"matter of fact\" that the country had nuclear weapons, urging people to \"face reality\". The US Forces Joint Command also listed North Korea as one of Asia's nuclear powers in a report late last year, although the US government said this did not reflect official policy. An American expert who visited Pyongyang this year said officials told him they had \"weaponised\" about 30kg of plutonium \u2013 enough to make four or five warheads \u2013 although he added that he had no way of establishing the truth of the claim. The country has hundreds of short- and medium-range missiles. A rocket launch in early April \u2013 which North Korea claimed was a satellite launch \u2013 suggests that its long-range missile technology has improved considerably in recent years, but is still wanting. In theory, the Taepodong-2 is capable of reaching Alaska; in practice, there is no sign it can go that far.Pyongyang has stepped up both its rhetoric and its actions in recent months, with many believing its aim has been to force the Obama administration to prioritise the relationship. Some observers hoped that April's rocket launch \u2013 despite repeated warnings from foreign governments \u2013 might be the culmination of these efforts. But when the UN security council criticised the launch, North Korea vowed to restart its nuclear programme, test a nuclear device and carry out long-range missile tests. Being recognised as a nuclear weapons state would give the country more leverage in international negotiations. On a practical note, it is also keen to develop its technology further. In a statement released by the official news agency KCNA, Pyongyang said the test was \"part of the measures to bolster its nuclear deterrent for self-defence in every way as requested by its scientists and technicians\".\"North Korea's strategic objective has not changed. That objective is to win the attention of the Obama administration, to push the North Korea issue up the agenda,\" said Xu Guangyu, a researcher at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association. Professor Han Seung Joo, a former South Korean foreign minister, added: \"It's one way of breaking in the new US administration to the North Korean way of doing things. They want to change the game \u2026 If and when negotiations take place with the US, they want to make it into disarmament or arms control talks between nuclear weapons states, which assumes the US recognises or at least reckons North Korea as a weapons state.\"There are already demands for an emergency meeting of the UN security council. \"This time we will likely get a stronger response than [to the] rocket launch since there is no ambiguity \u2026 but whether the council will have any tools to use is another question. Against North Korea, it seems highly unlikely,\" Tim Savage, deputy director of the Nautilus Institute, told Reuters.Analysts suggest a meeting is likely to result in the further toughening of existing sanctions rather than the introduction of new ones, particularly because Russia and China are unlikely to accept new measures. China is deeply concerned about maintaining the stability of its troubled neighbour and pushing ahead on stalled aid-for-disarmament discussions.\"China's goal is to ensure that the six-party talks process does not fall apart,\" said Xu Guangyu. \"Stricter sanctions are not going to achieve that objective.\"One year after the last nuclear test, the then US president, George Bush, agreed to ease sanctions in exchange for the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear facility (now reopened).Shunji Hiraiwa, of Shizuoka Prefectural University in Japan, told Reuters: \"The last time the United States changed its stance after North Korea conducted a nuclear test, so the North probably thought that unless they did so again, the United States wouldn't change.

The country's Yonhap news agency quoted a government source as saying that the North had test fired a short-range missile immediately after the nuclear test.The UN security council will hold an emergency meeting in New York later today to discuss its response to the latest escalation in the North Korean nuclear crisis.President Barack Obama called the test a matter of grave concern to all nations. \"North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community,\" Obama said in a statement. \"North Korea's behaviour increases tensions and undermines stability in north-east Asia.\"Gordon Brown described the test as \"erroneous, misguided and a danger to the world.\" The prime minister added: \"This act will undermine prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula and will do nothing for North Korea's security.The North Korean news agency said the test had been \"safely conducted on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control.

That test prompted the UN security to pass a resolution banning Pyongyang from activities related to its ballistic missile programme.The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, convened a session of the country's security council after seismologists reported earthquakes in the Kilju region, site of the North's first nuclear test.In Tokyo, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Takeo Kawamura, said the test was \"a clear violation of the UN security council resolution and can not be tolerated\".North Korea had warned of a second nuclear test after the UN condemned its test-launch of a ballistic missile on 5 April and agreed to tighten sanctions put in place in 2006.Pyongyang insisted it had put a peaceful communications satellite in orbit, but experts said the technology and methods were identical to those used to launch a long-range Taepodong-2 missile.After the UN refused to apologise for condemning the launch, North Korea expelled international inspectors, threatened to restart its Yongbyon nuclear reactor \u2013 which it had agreed to start dismantling in 2007 \u2013 and walked away from six-party nuclear talks.Today's test will add to fears that the North is moving closer to possessing the ability to mount a nuclear warhead on long-range missiles that are capable, in theory, of reaching Hawaii and Alaska.\"This test, if confirmed, could indicate North Korea's decision to work at securing actual nuclear capabilities,\" Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongkuk University in Seoul, told Reuters.\"North Korea had been expecting the new US administration to mark a shift from the previous administration's stance, but is realising that there are no changes. It may have decided that a second test was necessary. [It] seems to be reacting to the US and South Korean administrations' policies.\"Analysts believe the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, hoped to use the test to shore up support from the military amid mounting speculation that he is about to name one of his three sons as his successor.Kim, 67, appears to be re-establishing his grip on power since reportedly suffering a stroke last August.Today's test is a direct challenge to attempts by Obama to engage the North and stem the spread of nuclear weapons.Despite promising a fresh start to bilateral relations, Obama, who denounced last month's missile launch as \"a provocation,\" has so far failed to persuade North Korean to enter into negotiations.Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace in Tokyo, who is close to Pyongyang, said the test was a reminder that North Korea \"is going it alone as a nuclear power\".\"North Korea doesn't need any talks with America. America is tricky and undesirable,\" he said. \"It does not implement its own agreements.\"We are not going to worry about sanctions. If they sanction us, we will become more powerful.

Russian estimates suggest the underground blast could have been 20 times as great as in 2006.Analysts had previously concluded that North Korea could not miniaturise its nuclear devices to mount on to a missile \u2013 but some are changing their views. Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said last month that it was a \"matter of fact\" that the country had nuclear weapons, urging people to \"face reality\". The US Forces Joint Command also listed North Korea as one of Asia's nuclear powers in a report late last year, although the US government said this did not reflect official policy. An American expert who visited Pyongyang this year said officials told him they had \"weaponised\" about 30kg of plutonium \u2013 enough to make four or five warheads \u2013 although he added that he had no way of establishing the truth of the claim. The country has hundreds of short- and medium-range missiles. A rocket launch in early April \u2013 which North Korea claimed was a satellite launch \u2013 suggests that its long-range missile technology has improved considerably in recent years, but is still wanting. In theory, the Taepodong-2 is capable of reaching Alaska; in practice, there is no sign it can go that far.Pyongyang has stepped up both its rhetoric and its actions in recent months, with many believing its aim has been to force the Obama administration to prioritise the relationship. Some observers hoped that April's rocket launch \u2013 despite repeated warnings from foreign governments \u2013 might be the culmination of these efforts. But when the UN security council criticised the launch, North Korea vowed to restart its nuclear programme, test a nuclear device and carry out long-range missile tests. Being recognised as a nuclear weapons state would give the country more leverage in international negotiations. On a practical note, it is also keen to develop its technology further. In a statement released by the official news agency KCNA, Pyongyang said the test was \"part of the measures to bolster its nuclear deterrent for self-defence in every way as requested by its scientists and technicians\".\"North Korea's strategic objective has not changed. That objective is to win the attention of the Obama administration, to push the North Korea issue up the agenda,\" said Xu Guangyu, a researcher at the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association. Professor Han Seung Joo, a former South Korean foreign minister, added: \"It's one way of breaking in the new US administration to the North Korean way of doing things. They want to change the game \u2026 If and when negotiations take place with the US, they want to make it into disarmament or arms control talks between nuclear weapons states, which assumes the US recognises or at least reckons North Korea as a weapons state.\"There are already demands for an emergency meeting of the UN security council. \"This time we will likely get a stronger response than [to the] rocket launch since there is no ambiguity \u2026 but whether the council will have any tools to use is another question. Against North Korea, it seems highly unlikely,\" Tim Savage, deputy director of the Nautilus Institute, told Reuters.Analysts suggest a meeting is likely to result in the further toughening of existing sanctions rather than the introduction of new ones, particularly because Russia and China are unlikely to accept new measures. China is deeply concerned about maintaining the stability of its troubled neighbour and pushing ahead on stalled aid-for-disarmament discussions.\"China's goal is to ensure that the six-party talks process does not fall apart,\" said Xu Guangyu. \"Stricter sanctions are not going to achieve that objective.\"One year after the last nuclear test, the then US president, George Bush, agreed to ease sanctions in exchange for the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear facility (now reopened).Shunji Hiraiwa, of Shizuoka Prefectural University in Japan, told Reuters: \"The last time the United States changed its stance after North Korea conducted a nuclear test, so the North probably thought that unless they did so again, the United States wouldn't change.

It came from a country which can neither feed nor heat itself, and whose leader is thought to be recovering from a stroke. North Korea yesterday sent a rocket hurtling over the Pacific and, if the state-run Korean Central News Agency is to be believed, an experimental satellite is at this moment transmitting the immortal revolutionary songs of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il.This singing circling loudspeaker probably only exists in Pyongyang's mind. South Korea and the US said that the first stage of the rocket fell into the waters between Korea and Japan, while the other two stages and its payload landed in the Pacific. If true, this would be the second time the Taepodong-2 missile has failed.Nevertheless, it is the thought that counts. The launch was a violation of two UN security council resolutions, a provocation to Japan over whose airspace it travelled and a slap in the face to President Barack Obama, who, only hours later in Prague, preached the virtues of disarmament. It is hard to know which is sicker - the country or its 67-year-old leader - but from Pyongyang's point of view this game of rocket brinkmanship will almost certainly work, as it did three years ago. Mr Kim jerked George Bush into life by testing a nuclear device in 2006. As a result, the US lurched from a policy of isolating the reclusive regime to one in which it successfully engaged with it. The device this time is different, but its purpose is similar. It is to make Mr Obama sit up and pay attention on his first international tour as president, and put North Korea higher up his to-do list. Which he will almost certainly now do.The military significance of the launch is more debatable. The rocket fired yesterday could reach Alaska - in theory. In practice it failed. North Korea has already got a tried-and-tested platform with which to deliver its nuclear payloads - both short- and medium-range rockets, one of which can reach Guam. So yesterday's launch does not change the balance of forces or extend North Korea's range. Nor does the launch make it more likely that Iran or Syria, two past purchasers of North Korean rockets, will be rushing to buy this rocket.The political boost it gives North Korea's leadership is clearer to see. The Dear Leader is due on Thursday to make his first public appearance for nearly a year, having suffered a stroke so serious it prevented him appearing at a parade celebrating the regime's 60th anniversary. Mr Kim now has more cards to play in the stalled six-party talks over its nuclear disarmament.Progress over denuclearisation has been slow. North Korea eventually produced a 60-page document in English saying it had developed 30.8 kilos of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for between five and seven bombs - in which it addressed US \"concerns\" over uranium enrichment. Last October Mr Bush took the country off its terrorism list. But progress since then has stalled over US demands for verification. Nor has it been helped by the election of a president in South Korea who has torn up the sunshine policy of his predecessors and demanded to see tangible signs of progress before his country spends more on aid for the north. Shooting a missile raises the price of a settlement. It is vital that Mr Obama stays cool and focuses on the need to keep China onside. Beijing, which reacted coolly to the launch, remains the key to making North Korea's military dictatorship see sense. When the six-party talks restart, as indeed they must, each side will be tempted to demand goodies up front. This must be resisted. For the talks to succeed, they must create a more balanced and sequenced set of actions which allow Pyongyang to surrender its plutonium.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "World news"], "title": "Editorial: North Korea - Making a splash"},{"date": "2009-05-29T20:19:26Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "1993 North Korea pulls out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty1994 Pyongyang freezes nuclear programme in return for western aid2000 Korean summit in Pyongyang sees \"sunshine policy\" created2002 George Bush names North Korea in \"axis of evil\"; North Korea expels nuclear inspectors and restarts nuclear programme2005 North Korea says it has a nuclear weapon2006 North Korea carries out nuclear test; UN responds with sanctions2007 North Korea shuts down Yongbyon reactor as new deal is reached2008 US removes North Korea from list of states sponsoring terrorism5 April 2009 North Korea launches long-range rocket from north-east coast13 April UN security council condemns launch14 April North Korea announces \u00adwithdrawal from disarmament talks and says it will restore nuclear facilities25 April North Korea announces start of reprocessing of spent fuel rods from its nuclear plant.

The UN security council is reportedly considering adding to the sanctions agreed after the regime detonated its first nuclear weapon in October 2006. One of the options may be to authorise military interdictions under the US-led Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), a loose \"coalition of the willing\" created in 2003 during the Bush administration.PSI participants co-operate to try to intercept cargoes of suspected banned weapons, their means of delivery and other related materials. They also enact laws to facilitate seizure of such materials and take part in interdiction exercises and actual operations. With the addition of South Korea, which was previously an observer nation in interdiction drills, 95 countries on six continents are now PSI participants. Pyongyang has responded by warning of an \"immediate, strong military measures\" if South Korea stops and searches any of its ships.Could the PSI be utilised to enforce a blockade of North Korea? Blockades have been used in nuclear diplomacy before, with President John F Kennedy imposing one around Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. In this contemporary crisis, a blockade is no easy task given that Pyongyang has a history of procurement and proliferation via a variety of land, sea and air routes. Uranium enrichment equipment from the AQ Khan network, for example, was supplied along the Karakoram highway, which runs across northern China from Pakistan in the west to North Korea in the east. Pakistan has received missile-related shipments from the North via the same highway and through air shipments.North Korea's maritime trading routes are the most vulnerable to interdiction and several cargo vessels have been tracked and intercepted in the last decade, including So San (2002), BBC China (2003) and Ville de Virgo (2003). However, these either pre-date PSI or were part of existing law enforcement practices and it remains unclear whether the initiative has resulted in the boarding of a single North Korean ship since it was launched. US officials claim that dozens of interdictions have taken place slowing nuclear and missile programs in Asia and the Middle East, but provide few specifics.The political and operational obstacles to mounting a blockade against North Korea remain formidable. The support or permission of the surrounding countries would be required to intercept all suspicious cargo travelling by road or rail and successfully divert air traffic entering or leaving North Korean territory or airspace. China in particular remains suspicious of the PSI and has previously pledged only to \"inspect\" rather than \"interdict\" cargo destined for the North.The legality of vessel interdiction in international law is also still a point of contention. Under security council resolution 1718 two suspect vessels were boarded and searched in Hong Kong and India in 2006, although no prohibited technology or equipment was discovered. However, the resolution does not allow the use of force to intercept suspect cargo and President Obama may now seek this in a more robustly worded UN decision.So-called \"soft\" proliferation (the transfer of technical drawings, blueprints, data, intellectual property, knowledge and expertise and financial transactions) provides another challenge. Transferred electronically or through direct person-to-person contact this type of activity is much less easily identified, tracked and intercepted. And as more legitimate supply routes are closed down, and procurement efforts move from legal to grey or illicit markets the task becomes even harder.Solid working partnerships under the rubric of the PSI also appear thin on the ground and outside of Nato's Shipping Centre (which does not have a specific counter-proliferation remit) there is little evidence of the diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement and military force components being integrated to good effect. Moreover, the PSI cannot \"turn back the clock\" and eliminate the nuclear facilities and missile systems already constructed, or North Korea's indigenous WMD developmental capability.North Korea also has the capability to raise the political and economic costs of PSI interdiction, possibly to levels that many participating states will consider outweigh the benefits. Ultimately, it will take a political settlement to resolve the underlying conflict over North Korea's nuclear programme. The PSI will at best only be partially effective in intercepting shipments of nuclear and missile hardware and does not offer a permanent solution to the crisis. However, if implemented successfully as part of an effective multilateral containment strategy, it could be used to buy that much needed commodity: time.", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "United Nations", "Nuclear weapons", "US foreign policy"], "title": "Containing nuclear North Korea | Ian Davis"},{"date": "2009-05-25T09:07:39Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Yes, in October 2006, prompting international condemnation and stiff sanctions from the UN security council, which demanded that North Korea eliminate its nuclear weapons and banned the import and export of material for weapons of mass destruction or ballistic missiles.

It is hard to know which is sicker - the country or its 67-year-old leader - but from Pyongyang's point of view this game of rocket brinkmanship will almost certainly work, as it did three years ago. Mr Kim jerked George Bush into life by testing a nuclear device in 2006. As a result, the US lurched from a policy of isolating the reclusive regime to one in which it successfully engaged with it. The device this time is different, but its purpose is similar. It is to make Mr Obama sit up and pay attention on his first international tour as president, and put North Korea higher up his to-do list. Which he will almost certainly now do.The military significance of the launch is more debatable. The rocket fired yesterday could reach Alaska - in theory. In practice it failed. North Korea has already got a tried-and-tested platform with which to deliver its nuclear payloads - both short- and medium-range rockets, one of which can reach Guam. So yesterday's launch does not change the balance of forces or extend North Korea's range. Nor does the launch make it more likely that Iran or Syria, two past purchasers of North Korean rockets, will be rushing to buy this rocket.The political boost it gives North Korea's leadership is clearer to see. The Dear Leader is due on Thursday to make his first public appearance for nearly a year, having suffered a stroke so serious it prevented him appearing at a parade celebrating the regime's 60th anniversary. Mr Kim now has more cards to play in the stalled six-party talks over its nuclear disarmament.Progress over denuclearisation has been slow. North Korea eventually produced a 60-page document in English saying it had developed 30.8 kilos of weapons-grade plutonium - enough for between five and seven bombs - in which it addressed US \"concerns\" over uranium enrichment. Last October Mr Bush took the country off its terrorism list. But progress since then has stalled over US demands for verification. Nor has it been helped by the election of a president in South Korea who has torn up the sunshine policy of his predecessors and demanded to see tangible signs of progress before his country spends more on aid for the north. Shooting a missile raises the price of a settlement. It is vital that Mr Obama stays cool and focuses on the need to keep China onside. Beijing, which reacted coolly to the launch, remains the key to making North Korea's military dictatorship see sense. When the six-party talks restart, as indeed they must, each side will be tempted to demand goodies up front. This must be resisted. For the talks to succeed, they must create a more balanced and sequenced set of actions which allow Pyongyang to surrender its plutonium.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "World news"], "title": "Editorial: North Korea - Making a splash"},{"date": "2009-04-05T12:07:41Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea today defied mounting international pressure when it launched a long-range rocket, with the move triggering an emergency meeting of the UN security council.The state's official news agency said it had successfully put a satellite into orbit and said the satellite was transmitting revolutionary songs as it circled the Earth.However, both the US military and South Korea said the satellite had failed to orbit, with the payload dropping into the sea.The US president, Barack Obama, led international condemnation of the launch, which Washington and others see as a test of weapons technology.The US had initially feared that Pyongyang planned to launch a Taepodong-2 missile, theoretically capable of reaching Alaska, in breach of a UN ban.\"Now is the time for a strong international response, and North Korea must know that the path to security and respect will never come through illegal weapons,\" Obama said in speech in Prague.\"Rules must be binding, violations must be punished, words must mean something.\"The multi-stage rocket lifted off at 11.30am (2.30am GMT) from the Musudan-ri site in north-eastern North Korea.The US northern command said stage one of the missile fell into the Sea of Japan and the remaining stages along with the payload landed in the Pacific ocean. No debris fell on Japan.The South Korean defence minister, Lee Sang-hee, said the satellite had failed to orbit, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported.\"Based on our judgment made so far, all first, second and third [stage] rockets fell into the ocean, and thus nothing has been put into orbit,\" Lee reportedly said at a parliamentary session in Seoul.Three years ago, a Taepodong-2 test failed within seconds.Details remain unclear, but the foreign secretary, David Miliband, described this morning's North Korean move as a \"satellite launch\".He accused Pyongyang of a \"hostile policy\" towards the rest of the world, adding: \"This action contributes directly to their ballistic missile programme.\"The US, Japan and South Korea argue that the launch technology for a missile is the same as that for a satellite, but will find it harder to press their case than if a Taepodong-2 had been fired.China and Russia called for calm and restraint on all sides.The White House described the launch as a clear breach of UN resolution 1718, passed after long-range missile and nuclear tests in 2006, which demanded that North Korea suspend \"all activities related to its ballistic missile programme\".Japan's chief cabinet spokesman, Takeo Kawamura, said: \"Even if a satellite was launched, we see this as a ballistic missile test ... we are highly concerned by this matter.\"South Korea called it a \"reckless\" act that threatened regional stability.The EU \"strongly condemned\" Pyongyang's step.Tokyo had deployed warships and Patriot missile interceptors off its northern coast to shoot down any debris which might hit its territory.But, like the US, it had already said it would not intercept the device after Pyongyang warned that shooting it down would be an \"act of war\" and would prompt retaliation.US and South Korean warships, equipped with missile interceptors, plied the waters between the Korean peninsula and Japan, while Russia reportedly scrambled fighter jets to its far east in case of debris.Japan and the US requested an emergency meeting of the security council, which will take place in New York tonight.UN diplomats, speaking anonymously, told Reuters no country was considering imposing new sanctions on Pyongyang \u2013 they would be almost certain to be blocked by Russia and China \u2013 but the starting point could be discussing a resolution for the stricter enforcement of earlier sanctions.China has occasionally criticised its neighbour in the past, notably when Pyongyang tested a nuclear device in 2006, but has usually preferred to use its leverage as the North's main ally in private.Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University, in Beijing, said China had learned that tough measures did not work and cost it \"crucial influence with Pyongyang at even more sensitive moments\".China will probably decide that bringing its neighbour back to the table to resume the stalled six-party talks on aid for nuclear disarmament is a greater priority.The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, today called on the North to return to the talks as he warned that the launch was not conducive to peace and stability.Many believe that Pyongyang was aiming to grab US attention as well as test and improve its missile-related technology and advertise it to potential purchasers such as Iran.\"The test represents both a calling card for North Korea to the [Obama] administration and at the same time strengthens its bargaining position,\" Professor Han Sung-joo, a former South Korean foreign minister, said.He pointed out that the nuclear test in 2006 had been a hostile act but led to bilateral negotiations with the US.Pyongyang had warned the world that it would launch the rocket between 4 and 8 April and notified agencies such as the International Maritime Organisation, which it has not done on previous occasions.The launch will boost morale at home, particularly because South Korea has yet to put a satellite into space.It will bolster the position of the country's leader, Kim Jong-il, who is believed to have suffered a stroke last year but is thought to be back in charge of major decisions.The state KCNA news agency said in a report: \"Our scientists and engineers have succeeded in sending satellite Kwangmyongsong-2 into orbit by way of carrier rocket Unha-2.\"[It] was developed by our wisdom and technology, and is a proud achievement made out of our battle to upgrade our country's space scientific technology\".It added that the satellite was transmitting the Song of General Kim Il-sung and Song of General Kim Jong-il.Kim Il-Sung, the father of the current leader, is still feted as the North's \"eternal president\".", "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "United Nations", "Obama

They had already interviewed North Korean defectors living in China illicitly and said they wanted to document the smuggling route across the Tumen River which divides China and North Korea.In a 2,000 word statement posted on the Current TV website, the journalists said they followed their guide because he seemed \"cautious and responsible\", but added: \"We still don't know if we were lured into a trap.\"They said he had tried to arrange an interview with North Korean associates by telephone the previous night.\"When we set out, we had no intention of leaving China, but when our guide beckoned for us to follow him beyond the middle of the river, we did, eventually arriving \u2026 on the North Korean side.

They say they did not film anyone's face, except for a woman who allowed them to shoot her profile.They said they were \"surprised\" that the Rev Chun Ki-won \u2013 who leads the mission for which Lee works and has helped hundreds of North Koreans to reach countries such as the US \u2013 spoke to the media after their arrest. They said they had carefully followed his instructions in contacting his associates in China.Chun, the reporters' main contact, told the New York Times that two of their interviewees fled China after learning of the arrests.A PR representative for the reporters' families did not respond to the newspaper's queries, but a Current TV spokesman told it that \"many of the details\" in the pastors' accounts were \"not correct\".Separately, a senior North Korean official has arrived in China for talks, increasing hopes that progress can be made towards the resumption of talks on the country's nuclear programme.Kim Yong-il, the north's vice foreign minister, met officials in Beijing to discuss bilateral relations, the regional situation and issues of mutual concern, said the Chinese foreign ministry's spokeswoman Jiang Yu. Kim's trip comes a fortnight after the Chinese nuclear envoy Wu Dawei visited Pyongyang, although Jiang said the trip was to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties.A senior South Korean official said conciliatory gestures from the north in recent weeks did not reflect fundamental changes in its approach because it had shown no signs of ending its nuclear weapons programme.The south's unification minister Hyun In-taek said Pyongyang's olive branches were \"just tactical changes because the north has neither declared its return to the six-nation talks nor changed its position\" on disarmament.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Media", "World news", "China", "Refugees", "Human rights", "Bill Clinton", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Freed journalists regret entering North Korea"},{"date": "2009-08-04T09:52:10Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Bill Clinton arrived in North Korea today on a surprise visit to seek the release of two American journalists serving 12 years for \"grave crimes\", in the highest profile visit to the country by an American for nearly a decade.The highly unusual trip comes amid increased tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over the stalled aid-for-disarmament talks and the latter's recent nuclear test and missile launches.The former US president was greeted by the North's chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan, and a high-ranking parliamentary official after landing in an unmarked jet this morning.

But Pyongyang's state news agency said the country's chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan, was among those greeting Clinton at the airport.\"He is coming with [Barack] Obama's message that he wants to improve relations,\" said Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace, who is close to Pyongyang. \"If it was just over the two journalists, North Korea would not accept him.\"The US wants the release of the journalists and a commitment from North Korea that it will resume its disarmament process.

At one point in his presidency, he had seriously considered bombing North Korea's nuclear reactor, until another former president Jimmy Carter flew into Pyongyang and produced the face-saver \u2013 an agreement to freeze nuclear development and allow inspectors back in.At the time, administration officials called Mr Carter's private visit unhelpful and accused him of undermining their position. Although Barack Obama hardly had time to put his feet under table before North Korea test-fired a long-range rocket and conducted a second nuclear test in the latest sudden plunge of this rollercoaster ride, history is repeating itself.Then, as now, the White House was at pains to stress the private nature of the former president's visit. Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, denied that Mr Clinton was carrying a message from Mr Obama for the ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, although South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that he had. But whether it is private or not, it is clear that this visit is not just about the release of two San Francisco-based journalists who walked across a shallow river dividing China and North Korea while researching a story about trafficking women. Contrition has been expressed at the highest levels for their actions. The administration has stopped pressing for their humanitarian release and called instead for an amnesty, a word that implies recognition that North Korean law was broken. Their release should be relatively straightforward to negotiate.Of greater significance is the opportunity afforded by these talks to break the diplomatic logjam. If North Korea uses Mr Clinton's visit to stop snarling and start talking, Mr Obama should be prepared to react in kind, releasing the noose of sanctions in return for a resumption of denuclearisation. The US should learn from the mistakes of the past, when it asked for too much too quickly, such as intrusive verification. The exchange of concession for reward should be more carefully planned and sequenced. The nuclear card is the only one North Korea has, and with enough fissile material for a number of bombs, the country should be expected to play a long game.The US, China and other members of the six-party talks should be prepared to play an equally long game, in the knowledge that negotiation, however frustrating, is better than its alternative.

Yet most people know little about the \"hermit kingdom\"; a title first applied to ancient Korea, but since judged perfectly suited to the modern North. It is successful not only at limiting its citizens' access to information \u2013 only senior officials can use the internet, for example \u2013 but also foreigners'. Intelligence agencies around the world are reduced to poring over photos of Kim to ascertain his\u00a0state of health and therefore the country's stability. Much of what we know about him comes from the memoirs of his former sushi chef.But over the years, more information has emerged. The border with China has become porous, with people moving back and forth and some in the area using Chinese mobile phone networks with smuggled handsets.Until 1987 no visitors from \"non-aligned\" countries were allowed; by 1993, around 50 western tourists a year were visiting. Now just under 2,000 a year go there, along with up to 30,000 Chinese tourists, accompanied by guides at all times. Photographs are inspected \u2013 and often deleted \u2013 before tourists leave. And it is still relatively rare for journalists to win access.And then there are the defectors, who paint an alarming picture of widespread human rights abuses, although many of their accounts date back to the 90s. According to a report from the UN High Commission for Human Rights this year: \"The UN General Assembly has recognised and condemned severe Democratic People's Republic of Korea human rights violations including the use of torture, public executions, extrajudicial and arbitrary detention, and forced labour; the absence of due process and the rule of law; death sentences for political offenses; and a large number of prison camps.\"The government operates a semi-hereditary system of social discrimination whereby all citizens are classified into 53 subgroups under overall security ratings \u2013 'core', 'wavering', and 'hostile' \u2013 based on their family's perceived loyalty to the regime. This rating determines virtually every facet of a person's life, including employment and educational opportunities, place of residence, access to medical facilities, and even access to stores.\"North Korea is the world's only communist dynasty: Kim Jong-il inherited power on the death of his father Kim Il-sung in 1994, although the latter remains eternal president and his son is instead Dear Leader.Official biographers say that the 67-year-old was born in a military camp on Baekdu Mountain, his birth foretold by a swallow and heralded by the appearance of a double rainbow over the mountain and a new star in the heavens. According to Soviet records, however, he was born in a Siberian village.In addition to his celestial endorsement, Kim is a three-time elected member of the country's rubber-stamp parliament. The country goes to the poll once every five years and there is one candidate per seat; turnout in 2003 was 99.9%.Kim is said to have a fear of flying; his state visits to Russia and China have been made by armoured train. Only once is his voice thought to have been broadcast: in 1992, during a military parade, he told the crowd: \"Glory to the heroic soldiers of the People's Army!\"While many have portrayed him as a clownish and eccentric figure \u2013 an image no doubt reinforced by his characterisation in Team America: World Police \u2013 others say he is smart and even witty. Shin Sang-ok \u2013 a South Korean film director who was kidnapped with his actor wife in 1978 so that he could build a North Korean film industry \u2013 has described a man naive in some ways but shrewd in others. He said Kim, a huge film buff, tended to regard Rambo and James Bond films as records of reality. Yet at one party, when band members rapturously applauded their leader, Kim turned to Shin and told him: \"That's all fake.\"His former sushi chef described a man with a violent temper and a love for large quantities of Hennessy VSOP cognac. Banquets used to last up to four days; his Pleasure Brigade, handpicked young women, provided the entertainment, sometimes ordered to dance naked.And that's about it. Although, according to North Korean media, Kim's accomplishments are legion. His official biography says he has composed six operas and according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap, he has described himself as an internet\u00a0expert.He is thought to have finally annointed the youngest of his three sons Kim Jong-un as his heir and \"Brilliant Comrade\", following his reported stroke last year. Even less is known about this leader-in-waiting. Educated in Bern, Switzerland, the 25-year-old is said to be a basketball fan. His former classmates say he also spoke highly of Jean-Claude Van Damme.The Dear Leader's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, is believed to have fallen from favour after Japanese authorities caught him trying to enter their country on a fake passport in 2001, apparently seeking to visit Tokyo Disneyland.But most analysts suggest that whoever takes over will be essentially a figurehead or arbitrator rather than a sole ruler. They suggest the elite is composed of three broad interest groups rather than factions \u2013 the Kim family, the military and other officials \u2013 who know that their fates are intertwined and who all wish to maintain the status quo. Whether their planning for life after the Dear Leader works in practice will be another matter; some believe factionalism or a military takeover could lead to the collapse of the state.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was\u00a0formally established in 1948. Korea had been divided at the 38th parallel following the defeat of its occupier Japan in the second world war; the Soviet Union administered the North and the United States the South. When they were unable to reach a deal, separate governments were established \u2013 both maintaining they were the legitimate rulers of the whole peninsula. Kim Il-sung, an anti-Japanese resistance fighter, took the reins in the North.In 1950, following a series of clashes along the border zone, the North invaded the South with the approval of the Soviet Union, but only limited military support. Despite initial successes, UN forces led by the US pushed the troops back and captured Pyongyang. China's entry into the war led to a bloody stalemate; around 2.5 million people are believed to have died. A ceasefire was eventually agreed in 1953, but a peace treaty has never been signed and the Demilitarised Zone is one of the most heavily militarised places in the world.Relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated rapidly in the 60s , leaving the country more reliant on China, but Kim developed an ideology known as juche or self-reliance \u2013 as well as a personality cult \u2013 which thrives to this day under his son.North Korea is famed for its Arirang mass gymnastic display \u2013 particularly the moments when thousands of perfectly choreographed performers hold up coloured cards to create huge and rapidly changing mosaic images. \"The mass events are mindblowing \u2013 it's like nothing else,\" says Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours in Beijing, which has been running trips to the country since 1993. \"The Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing was great, but it was a one-off. North Korea pulls that stuff out of the hat six weeks every year. A full scale mass games has 100,000 performers and God knows how many in logistical support.\"Football is extremely popular and the national team has just qualified for the World Cup, for the first time since 1966. They will be hoping to surpass that notable event; to much surprise, that team beat Italy 1-0 at a match in Middlesbrough, gaining a spot in the quarter-finals where they lost to Portugal. North Koreans also like volleyball and there's a flying-saucer shaped baseball stadium in Pyongyang.Other landmarks include the 105-floor pyramid-shaped Ryugyong Hotel, which has been under construction since 1987, several revolving restaurants and two huge boulevards \u2013 110m wide \u2013 in the city. Crossroads are overseen by female traffic police, reportedly hand-picked by Kim Jong-il for their beauty \u2013 although men manage the roundabouts. Traffic lights are in place, but rarely used.Pyongyang's eight cinemas are said to be frequently closed due to lack of power; when open, they screen domestic propaganda movies with inspiring titles such as The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man.The state news agency KCNA runs a curious combination of brief news items such as its coverage of Clinton's visit, angry denunciations of the treachery of \"puppet authorities\" in South Korea and long tales of the leadership's care for ordinary people. Tuesday, for example, saw the publication of a story about Kim Jong-il inspecting the cabbage harvest in autumn 1979. \"The meticulous care shown by the leader for winter kimchi [pickled cabbage, a dietary staple] is still conveyed as an epic of great love,\" it concluded.In the 60s, North Korea was one of the most industrialised of East Asian nations. But there is no clearer way to see its stagnation than to compare it to its neighbour, China \u2013 once a poor relation, now a capitalist powerhouse. Travel down the river which marks the two countries' border and the disparity is striking. On one side, neon blazes at night; on the other, there is almost complete darkness.\"The scarcity of cars, the early nights, the almost total absence of entertainment places, combined with the electricity shortages, means that by midnight Pyongyang is effectively a ghost city until six the next morning,\" writes Paul French in his book North Korea: The Paranoid Peninsula. Fuel shortages, exacerbated by sanctions, mean that heating can be problematic in a country where temperatures can fall to \u201310C or lower in winter. Possessions are limited; only around half of households have bicycles, leaving most to walk to work.From 2002, the country has experimented with economic reforms, such as opening markets \u2013 although stock is usually very limited. Higher-ranked citizens can enter the department stores for foreigners and senior officials, although foreign currency is often required. Although Chinese goods are now available, most products are unique to North Korea \u2013 such as Vinalon, a widely used synthetic textile made from limestone.But many analysts suggest that the North has now virtually given up on such reforms. And in May, as tensions on the peninsula escalated, it announced that it was tearing up the contracts for the Kaesong joint industrial complex it established with the South \u2013 a rare source of much-needed income, which employed 30,000 North Koreans.In the countryside, the situation is more pressing than in the towns. A crippling famine in the mid-1990s killed hundreds of thousands of people and although the situation has improved, the country remains highly dependent on food aid \u2013 the World Food Programme estimates that 8.7 million of its 23 million inhabitants need assistance. The range of food items is extremely limited and meat is a luxury.Because of the strict controls on where tourists can go, and what they can see, it is hard to assess the true state of affairs. \"Pyongyang itself outwardly presents quite a smart image to the world \u2013 there were people with SLR cameras,\" said one recent visitor. \"But we entered by train and when we were travelling through the countryside we did see some people in rags. We kept having power cuts and a guesthouse we stayed in \u2013 even though it is for foreigners \u2013 asked us what time we would like to have hot water.\"North Korea has a long history of tense relations with other regional powers and the west \u2013 particularly since it began its nuclear programme. China is regarded as almost its sole ally; even so, relations are fraught, based as much as anything on China's fear that the collapse of the current regime could lead to a flood of refugees and growing US influence on its border.Although North Korea is thought to have begun seeking nuclear weapons as early as the 60s, because it feared attack, the issue first began making waves in 1993, when it said that it planned to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused to allow inspectors access to its nuclear sites. As relations deteriorated, the US braced itself for war \u2013 averted when a visit by Jimmy Carter helped to pave the way for a breakthrough deal.Despite ups and downs in the relationship, Madeleine Albright \u2013 then secretary of state \u2013 visited Pyongyang in 2000 and an arms control treaty was agreed. With the arrival of George Bush \u2013 who deemed the North the third member of the \"axis of evil\", alongside Iraq and Iran \u2013 all bets were off. In 2006 the North's first nuclear test brought international condemnation. But not long afterwards, six-party aid for disarmament talks began.Those hit a wall last year after Washington and Pyongyang clashed over how to verify disagreement. Tensions were also rising on the peninsula thanks to the South's election of Lee Myung-bak, who ended his predecessor's \"sunshine policy\" of free-flowing aid.Since then, the North has ratcheted up its rhetoric, tested another nuclear device and launched a Taepodong 2 long-range rocket (the international reaction being neatly summarised in the Sun's headline, \"It's All Gone Pete Tong: Kim Jong in Taepodong Ding-dong\"). Though the rocket flew rather further than on its first test three years ago, when it disintegrated within seconds, it was far from successful. Experts believe North Korea has not yet been able to miniaturise an atomic weapon to place on a missile, but it may not be far off. The main fear is not that it will use such weapons itself, but that it will sell them to other states.On the plus side, most experts regarded its escalating actions this year as a bid for attention from Barack Obama's administration \u2013 a\u00a0bid that appears to have been successful, given Bill Clinton's visit. While primarily concerned with the fate of the two US reporters, and billed by the White House as \"solely private\", analysts believe it will in time lead to renewed talks.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Bill Clinton", "Kim Jong-il", "World news"], "title": "What we know about North Korea"},{"date": "2009-08-04T23:05:11Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "It is ironic that Bill Clinton should be the envoy chosen to seek the release of two American journalists imprisoned in North Korea. At one point in his presidency, he had seriously considered bombing North Korea's nuclear reactor, until another former president Jimmy Carter flew into Pyongyang and produced the face-saver \u2013 an agreement to freeze nuclear development and allow inspectors back in.At the time, administration officials called Mr Carter's private visit unhelpful and accused him of undermining their position. Although Barack Obama hardly had time to put his feet under table before North Korea test-fired a long-range rocket and conducted a second nuclear test in the latest sudden plunge of this rollercoaster ride, history is repeating itself.Then, as now, the White House was at pains to stress the private nature of the former president's visit. Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, denied that Mr Clinton was carrying a message from Mr Obama for the ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, although South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that he had. But whether it is private or not, it is clear that this visit is not just about the release of two San Francisco-based journalists who walked across a shallow river dividing China and North Korea while researching a story about trafficking women. Contrition has been expressed at the highest levels for their actions. The administration has stopped pressing for their humanitarian release and called instead for an amnesty, a word that implies recognition that North Korean law was broken. Their release should be relatively straightforward to negotiate.Of greater significance is the opportunity afforded by these talks to break the diplomatic logjam. If North Korea uses Mr Clinton's visit to stop snarling and start talking, Mr Obama should be prepared to react in kind, releasing the noose of sanctions in return for a resumption of denuclearisation. The US should learn from the mistakes of the past, when it asked for too much too quickly, such as intrusive verification. The exchange of concession for reward should be more carefully planned and sequenced. The nuclear card is the only one North Korea has, and with enough fissile material for a number of bombs, the country should be expected to play a long game.The US, China and other members of the six-party talks should be prepared to play an equally long game, in the knowledge that negotiation, however frustrating, is better than its alternative. Above all, Mr Obama should be wary of drawing too many parallels between North Korea and Iran. They have different motives for pursuing the same end.", "tags": ["Bill Clinton", "World news", "Nuclear weapons", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "China", "US news", "Barack Obama", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea: Clinton flies in"},{"date": "2009-09-02T06:49:21Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Two American journalists who were detained in North Korea from March to August have said they \"deeply regret\" entering the country, as they described how guards dragged them back across the border and into captivity.In their first full account of events leading up to their captivity, which ended when the former US president Bill Clinton mounted a surprise visit to Pyongyang, Laura Ling and Euna Lee said they crossed the border for less than a minute.The reporters, who have been criticised for endangering refugees they interviewed, admit they knew they were entering North Korea.The two women, who work for Current TV \u2013 co-founded by the former US vice-president Al Gore \u2013 were covering a story on human trafficking. They had already interviewed North Korean defectors living in China illicitly and said they wanted to document the smuggling route across the Tumen River which divides China and North Korea.In a 2,000 word statement posted on the Current TV website, the journalists said they followed their guide because he seemed \"cautious and responsible\", but added: \"We still don't know if we were lured into a trap.\"They said he had tried to arrange an interview with North Korean associates by telephone the previous night.\"When we set out, we had no intention of leaving China, but when our guide beckoned for us to follow him beyond the middle of the river, we did, eventually arriving \u2026 on the North Korean side. He pointed out a small village in the distance where he told us that North Koreans waited in safehouses to be smuggled into China,\" they wrote.They turned back, but midway across the frozen river they heard yelling.\"We looked back and saw two North Korean soldiers with rifles running towards us. Instinctively, we ran.\"We were firmly back inside China when the soldiers apprehended us \u2026 We tried with all our might to cling to bushes, ground, anything that would keep us on Chinese soil, but \u2026 they violently dragged us back across the ice to North Korea and marched us to a nearby army base \u2026 Over the next 140 days we were moved to Pyongyang, isolated from one another, repeatedly interrogated and eventually put on trial and sentenced to 12\u00a0years of hard labour.\"Their producer, Mitch Koss, and their guide outran the border guards, they said, adding that they believed it had been their journalistic responsibility to cover the harsh lives of North Korean refugees.However, they acknowledge aid groups are now finding it harder to operate along the border and that defectors are going deeper underground. \"We regret if any of our actions, including the high-profile nature of our confinement, has led to increased scrutiny of activists and North Koreans living along the border. The activists' work is inspiring, courageous and crucial.\"Describing their shock at their release \u2013 one moment thinking they would be sent to a labour camp, the next ushered into a room to meet Clinton \u2013 the pair said they were experiencing \"tremendous mental and emotional anguish\" but felt incredibly fortunate to be free.They said that they would not say more about their time in captivity, adding: \"We do not want our story to overshadow the critical plight of these desperate defectors.\"The journalists say they exercised \"extreme caution\" to protect sources and that once captured they tried to shield interviewees by \"swallowing notes and damaging videotapes\".There is a large North Korean refugee population in China but they remain underground for fear of being repatriated and sent to labour camps.A South Korean pastor who assisted the reporters' interviews in China told the New York Times last week that he was deported and his five secret homes for refugees shut down after their capture.The Rev Lee Chan-woo said police raided his home in China on 19 March, two days after the journalists were seized.\"The Chinese cited scenes from films confiscated from the journalists when they interrogated me,\" he said.He claimed that children at one home told him the crew asked them to face the cameras and speak to their mothers.The journalists refer to the visit in their account but do not address Lee's claims. They say they did not film anyone's face, except for a woman who allowed them to shoot her profile.They said they were \"surprised\" that the Rev Chun Ki-won \u2013 who leads the mission for which Lee works and has helped hundreds of North Koreans to reach countries such as the US \u2013 spoke to the media after their arrest. They said they had carefully followed his instructions in contacting his associates in China.Chun, the reporters' main contact, told the New York Times that two of their interviewees fled China after learning of the arrests.A PR representative for the reporters' families did not respond to the newspaper's queries, but a Current TV spokesman told it that \"many of the details\" in the pastors' accounts were \"not correct\".Separately, a senior North Korean official has arrived in China for talks, increasing hopes that progress can be made towards the resumption of talks on the country's nuclear programme.Kim Yong-il, the north's vice foreign minister, met officials in Beijing to discuss bilateral relations, the regional situation and issues of mutual concern, said the Chinese foreign ministry's spokeswoman Jiang Yu. Kim's trip comes a fortnight after the Chinese nuclear envoy Wu Dawei visited Pyongyang, although Jiang said the trip was to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties.A senior South Korean official said conciliatory gestures from the north in recent weeks did not reflect fundamental changes in its approach because it had shown no signs of ending its nuclear weapons programme.The south's unification minister Hyun In-taek said Pyongyang's olive branches were \"just tactical changes because the north has neither declared its return to the six-nation talks nor changed its position\" on disarmament.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Media", "World news", "China", "Refugees", "Human rights", "Bill Clinton", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Freed journalists regret entering North Korea"},{"date": "2009-08-04T09:52:10Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Bill Clinton arrived in North Korea today on a surprise visit to seek the release of two American journalists serving 12 years for \"grave crimes\", in the highest profile visit to the country by an American for nearly a decade.The highly unusual trip comes amid increased tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over the stalled aid-for-disarmament talks and the latter's recent nuclear test and missile launches.The former US president was greeted by the North's chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan, and a high-ranking parliamentary official after landing in an unmarked jet this morning. A young girl presented him with a bouquet.US officials have confirmed Clinton will negotiate for the freedom of Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who were arrested in March on the border with China.The journalists were detained while on a reporting trip for California-based Current TV \u2013 co-founded by Al Gore, Clinton's former vice-president. They were sentenced in June to 12 years of hard labour for entering the country illegally and engaging in \"hostile acts\".North Korea and the US do not have diplomatic relations, but Washington is believed to be working behind the scenes to negotiate their release. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, has said \"everyone is very sorry\" about the incident and urged Pyongyang to grant them amnesty.Kim Yong-hyun, a professor at Seoul's Dongguk University, said Bill Clinton's visit could serve two purposes: securing the women's release and improving ties between the two countries.\"I think it's not just about journalists. It will serve as a turning point in the US-North Korea relations,\" he said.It is not yet clear whether Clinton will meet the North's \"Dear Leader\", Kim Jong-il.Pyongyang has increased tensions in recent months, but many analysts suggested its primary goal was to push the Obama administration into engaging with it. Last week it said it was open to talks on its nuclear programme \u2013 an apparent call for direct discussions with the US.Washington has said it could talk bilaterally with the North, but only on the sidelines of six party talks \u2013 also involving China, Japan, South Korea and Russia \u2013 which Pyongyang has denounced.Clinton is the second former US president to visit North Korea. Jimmy Carter visited in 1994, when Clinton was in office, and met the then-leader Kim Il-sung, the late father of the current leader. The visit came amid escalating nuclear tensions and led to a breakthrough deal months later.Six years later, Clinton's secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, visited Pyongyang for talks with Kim Jong-il. But after George Bush took office he declared the North to be part of an \"axis of evil\" with Iran and Iraq.Asked about Clinton's visit, South Korean foreign ministry officials said any announcement would come from Washington or Pyongyang.There was no immediate response from Clinton's New York foundation, and Gore's spokeswoman, Kalee Kreider, said she could not comment.A senior US official travelling to Africa with Hillary Clinton told reporters : \"While the mission is in progress, we will have no comment ... Our interest is the successful completion of the mission and the safe return of the journalists.\"North Korea is also holding a South Korean worker accused of insulting the North's political system and the four-man crew of a South Korean fishing boat that strayed north of a maritime border last week after experiencing navigational problems.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Bill Clinton", "US foreign policy", "Kim Jong-il", "US news", "World news", "US politics"], "title": "Bill Clinton arrives in North Korea"},{"date": "2009-08-04T08:51:31Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Very \u2013 Pyongyang and Washington have no diplomatic ties. It is only the second time a former US president has visited the country: Jimmy Carter flew there 15 years ago, when tensions were running high over the North's nuclear weapons programme. Madeleine Albright visited six years later as Clinton's secretary of state.South Korean media say the two sides will discuss the fate of two US reporters jailed for \"grave crimes\" after they were arrested on the Chinese-North Korean border. But Pyongyang's state news agency said the country's chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan, was among those greeting Clinton at the airport.\"He is coming with [Barack] Obama's message that he wants to improve relations,\" said Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace, who is close to Pyongyang. \"If it was just over the two journalists, North Korea would not accept him.\"The US wants the release of the journalists and a commitment from North Korea that it will resume its disarmament process. North Korea wants an end to sanctions and more economic support. In the short term it is pressing for direct negotiations with the US. But Washington says bilateral talks can only take place in the context of the six-nation discussions rejected by South Korea.The US will also hope to get a better picture of the current situation in North Korea \u2013 particularly if Clinton has the chance to meet its leader, Kim Jong-il. Intelligence from the country has always been very limited and there has been widespread speculation about Kim's health and to what extent he is running affairs since he reportedly suffered a stroke last year.Carter's visit \u2013 at a time when the US was bracing for war with the North \u2013 led to a breakthrough deal that saw Pyongyang suspend its nuclear work. Clinton was president at the time.\"Clinton reached an agreement with North Korea before. He is businesslike and effective,\" said Kim Myong-chol.\"There is the possibility of a dramatic turnaround by North Korea that could lead to a new phase of negotiations,\" Yun Duk-min, of the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul, told Reuters.But others warn that in the long term the visit could backfire \u2013 Pyongyang could take it as proof that increasing tensions on the peninsula is effective.\"It's just what they [North Korea's leaders] need ... It sends all the wrong signals,\" said BR Myers, an expert on the North's state ideology at Dongseo University in South Korea.He said it allowed the government to show its citizens that the nuclear weapons programme was making the world take it more seriously.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Bill Clinton", "Kim Jong-il", "US news", "World news", "US politics"], "title": "Q&A: Bill Clinton in North Korea"},{"date": "2009-08-05T23:05:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Thanks to his trademark Mao suit and Elvis-style sunglasses, and to North Korea's nuclear programme, Kim Jong-il has become an instantly recognisable figure and his country a regular feature in news headlines. Yet most people know little about the \"hermit kingdom\"; a title first applied to ancient Korea, but since judged perfectly suited to the modern North. It is successful not only at limiting its citizens' access to information \u2013 only senior officials can use the internet, for example \u2013 but also foreigners'. Intelligence agencies around the world are reduced to poring over photos of Kim to ascertain his\u00a0state of health and therefore the country's stability. Much of what we know about him comes from the memoirs of his former sushi chef.But over the years, more information has emerged. The border with China has become porous, with people moving back and forth and some in the area using Chinese mobile phone networks with smuggled handsets.Until 1987 no visitors from \"non-aligned\" countries were allowed; by 1993, around 50 western tourists a year were visiting. Now just under 2,000 a year go there, along with up to 30,000 Chinese tourists, accompanied by guides at all times. Photographs are inspected \u2013 and often deleted \u2013 before tourists leave. And it is still relatively rare for journalists to win access.And then there are the defectors, who paint an alarming picture of widespread human rights abuses, although many of their accounts date back to the 90s. According to a report from the UN High Commission for Human Rights this year: \"The UN General Assembly has recognised and condemned severe Democratic People's Republic of Korea human rights violations including the use of torture, public executions, extrajudicial and arbitrary detention, and forced labour; the absence of due process and the rule of law; death sentences for political offenses; and a large number of prison camps.\"The government operates a semi-hereditary system of social discrimination whereby all citizens are classified into 53 subgroups under overall security ratings \u2013 'core', 'wavering', and 'hostile' \u2013 based on their family's perceived loyalty to the regime. This rating determines virtually every facet of a person's life, including employment and educational opportunities, place of residence, access to medical facilities, and even access to stores.\"North Korea is the world's only communist dynasty: Kim Jong-il inherited power on the death of his father Kim Il-sung in 1994, although the latter remains eternal president and his son is instead Dear Leader.Official biographers say that the 67-year-old was born in a military camp on Baekdu Mountain, his birth foretold by a swallow and heralded by the appearance of a double rainbow over the mountain and a new star in the heavens. According to Soviet records, however, he was born in a Siberian village.In addition to his celestial endorsement, Kim is a three-time elected member of the country's rubber-stamp parliament. The country goes to the poll once every five years and there is one candidate per seat; turnout in 2003 was 99.9%.Kim is said to have a fear of flying; his state visits to Russia and China have been made by armoured train. Only once is his voice thought to have been broadcast: in 1992, during a military parade, he told the crowd: \"Glory to the heroic soldiers of the People's Army!\"While many have portrayed him as a clownish and eccentric figure \u2013 an image no doubt reinforced by his characterisation in Team America: World Police \u2013 others say he is smart and even witty. Shin Sang-ok \u2013 a South Korean film director who was kidnapped with his actor wife in 1978 so that he could build a North Korean film industry \u2013 has described a man naive in some ways but shrewd in others. He said Kim, a huge film buff, tended to regard Rambo and James Bond films as records of reality. Yet at one party, when band members rapturously applauded their leader, Kim turned to Shin and told him: \"That's all fake.\"His former sushi chef described a man with a violent temper and a love for large quantities of Hennessy VSOP cognac. Banquets used to last up to four days; his Pleasure Brigade, handpicked young women, provided the entertainment, sometimes ordered to dance naked.And that's about it. Although, according to North Korean media, Kim's accomplishments are legion. His official biography says he has composed six operas and according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap, he has described himself as an internet\u00a0expert.He is thought to have finally annointed the youngest of his three sons Kim Jong-un as his heir and \"Brilliant Comrade\", following his reported stroke last year. Even less is known about this leader-in-waiting. Educated in Bern, Switzerland, the 25-year-old is said to be a basketball fan. His former classmates say he also spoke highly of Jean-Claude Van Damme.The Dear Leader's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, is believed to have fallen from favour after Japanese authorities caught him trying to enter their country on a fake passport in 2001, apparently seeking to visit Tokyo Disneyland.But most analysts suggest that whoever takes over will be essentially a figurehead or arbitrator rather than a sole ruler. They suggest the elite is composed of three broad interest groups rather than factions \u2013 the Kim family, the military and other officials \u2013 who know that their fates are intertwined and who all wish to maintain the status quo. Whether their planning for life after the Dear Leader works in practice will be another matter; some believe factionalism or a military takeover could lead to the collapse of the state.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was\u00a0formally established in 1948. Korea had been divided at the 38th parallel following the defeat of its occupier Japan in the second world war; the Soviet Union administered the North and the United States the South. When they were unable to reach a deal, separate governments were established \u2013 both maintaining they were the legitimate rulers of the whole peninsula. Kim Il-sung, an anti-Japanese resistance fighter, took the reins in the North.In 1950, following a series of clashes along the border zone, the North invaded the South with the approval of the Soviet Union, but only limited military support. Despite initial successes, UN forces led by the US pushed the troops back and captured Pyongyang. China's entry into the war led to a bloody stalemate; around 2.5 million people are believed to have died. A ceasefire was eventually agreed in 1953, but a peace treaty has never been signed and the Demilitarised Zone is one of the most heavily militarised places in the world.Relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated rapidly in the 60s , leaving the country more reliant on China, but Kim developed an ideology known as juche or self-reliance \u2013 as well as a personality cult \u2013 which thrives to this day under his son.North Korea is famed for its Arirang mass gymnastic display \u2013 particularly the moments when thousands of perfectly choreographed performers hold up coloured cards to create huge and rapidly changing mosaic images. \"The mass events are mindblowing \u2013 it's like nothing else,\" says Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours in Beijing, which has been running trips to the country since 1993. \"The Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing was great, but it was a one-off.

China is regarded as almost its sole ally; even so, relations are fraught, based as much as anything on China's fear that the collapse of the current regime could lead to a flood of refugees and growing US influence on its border.Although North Korea is thought to have begun seeking nuclear weapons as early as the 60s, because it feared attack, the issue first began making waves in 1993, when it said that it planned to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused to allow inspectors access to its nuclear sites. As relations deteriorated, the US braced itself for war \u2013 averted when a visit by Jimmy Carter helped to pave the way for a breakthrough deal.Despite ups and downs in the relationship, Madeleine Albright \u2013 then secretary of state \u2013 visited Pyongyang in 2000 and an arms control treaty was agreed. With the arrival of George Bush \u2013 who deemed the North the third member of the \"axis of evil\", alongside Iraq and Iran \u2013 all bets were off. In 2006 the North's first nuclear test brought international condemnation. But not long afterwards, six-party aid for disarmament talks began.Those hit a wall last year after Washington and Pyongyang clashed over how to verify disagreement. Tensions were also rising on the peninsula thanks to the South's election of Lee Myung-bak, who ended his predecessor's \"sunshine policy\" of free-flowing aid.Since then, the North has ratcheted up its rhetoric, tested another nuclear device and launched a Taepodong 2 long-range rocket (the international reaction being neatly summarised in the Sun's headline, \"It's All Gone Pete Tong: Kim Jong in Taepodong Ding-dong\"). Though the rocket flew rather further than on its first test three years ago, when it disintegrated within seconds, it was far from successful. Experts believe North Korea has not yet been able to miniaturise an atomic weapon to place on a missile, but it may not be far off. The main fear is not that it will use such weapons itself, but that it will sell them to other states.On the plus side, most experts regarded its escalating actions this year as a bid for attention from Barack Obama's administration \u2013 a\u00a0bid that appears to have been successful, given Bill Clinton's visit.

Clinton waved, put his hand over his heart and then saluted.North Korean officials waved as the plane took off. McKenna said the flight was bound for Los Angeles, where the journalists would be reunited with their families. The White House had no comment.US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said she had spoken with her husband who told her the two journalists were \"extremely excited\" to be on their way back to the US. Mrs Clinton, in Nairobi at the start of a tour of Africa, said she was \"very happy and relieved\" that the women were on their way home.According to the New York Times, Mrs Clinton was deeply involved in the case. The paper said she proposed sending various people to Pyongyang \u2013 including the former vice-president, Al Gore \u2013 to lobby for the release of the women, before her husband emerged as the preferred choice of the North Koreans.The message from Pyongyang was relayed through the reporters families, who asked Clinton to travel to North Korea to seek their release. They were joined in their request by Gore.The newspaper quoted a senior official as saying the administration did \"due diligence\" to ensure that if Clinton went, he would return with the journalists.An administration offical told the Associated Press that the former president's mission did not include any discussions about issues beyond the release of Lee, 36, and Ling, 32, both journalists with Gore's Current TV media venture. The official rejected an official report by the North Korean news agency that Clinton had delivered an apology about the incident to Kim.Their departure marked and end to a more than four-month ordeal for the women, who were arrested near the North Korean-Chinese border in March while on a reporting trip for Current TV. They were sentenced in June to 12 years of hard labour for illegal entry and engaging in \"hostile acts\".North Korean media characterised the women's release as proof of \"humanitarian and peace-loving policy.\"The Lee and Ling families thanked the president, Barack Obama, the secretary of state and the state department. \"We especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission and Vice-President Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home,\" it said. \"We are counting the seconds to hold Laura and Euna in our arms.\"", "tags": ["World news", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Bill Clinton", "Obama administration", "Barack Obama", "US foreign policy", "US news", "US politics"], "title": "Freed US reporters leave North Korea"},{"date": "2009-08-04T23:05:11Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "It is ironic that Bill Clinton should be the envoy chosen to seek the release of two American journalists imprisoned in North Korea. At one point in his presidency, he had seriously considered bombing North Korea's nuclear reactor, until another former president Jimmy Carter flew into Pyongyang and produced the face-saver \u2013 an agreement to freeze nuclear development and allow inspectors back in.At the time, administration officials called Mr Carter's private visit unhelpful and accused him of undermining their position. Although Barack Obama hardly had time to put his feet under table before North Korea test-fired a long-range rocket and conducted a second nuclear test in the latest sudden plunge of this rollercoaster ride, history is repeating itself.Then, as now, the White House was at pains to stress the private nature of the former president's visit. Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, denied that Mr Clinton was carrying a message from Mr Obama for the ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, although South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that he had. But whether it is private or not, it is clear that this visit is not just about the release of two San Francisco-based journalists who walked across a shallow river dividing China and North Korea while researching a story about trafficking women. Contrition has been expressed at the highest levels for their actions. The administration has stopped pressing for their humanitarian release and called instead for an amnesty, a word that implies recognition that North Korean law was broken. Their release should be relatively straightforward to negotiate.Of greater significance is the opportunity afforded by these talks to break the diplomatic logjam. If North Korea uses Mr Clinton's visit to stop snarling and start talking, Mr Obama should be prepared to react in kind, releasing the noose of sanctions in return for a resumption of denuclearisation. The US should learn from the mistakes of the past, when it asked for too much too quickly, such as intrusive verification. The exchange of concession for reward should be more carefully planned and sequenced. The nuclear card is the only one North Korea has, and with enough fissile material for a number of bombs, the country should be expected to play a long game.The US, China and other members of the six-party talks should be prepared to play an equally long game, in the knowledge that negotiation, however frustrating, is better than its alternative. Above all, Mr Obama should be wary of drawing too many parallels between North Korea and Iran. They have different motives for pursuing the same end.", "tags": ["Bill Clinton", "World news", "Nuclear weapons", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "China", "US news", "Barack Obama", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea: Clinton flies in"},{"date": "2009-09-02T06:49:21Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Two American journalists who were detained in North Korea from March to August have said they \"deeply regret\" entering the country, as they described how guards dragged them back across the border and into captivity.In their first full account of events leading up to their captivity, which ended when the former US president Bill Clinton mounted a surprise visit to Pyongyang, Laura Ling and Euna Lee said they crossed the border for less than a minute.The reporters, who have been criticised for endangering refugees they interviewed, admit they knew they were entering North Korea.The two women, who work for Current TV \u2013 co-founded by the former US vice-president Al Gore \u2013 were covering a story on human trafficking. They had already interviewed North Korean defectors living in China illicitly and said they wanted to document the smuggling route across the Tumen River which divides China and North Korea.In a 2,000 word statement posted on the Current TV website, the journalists said they followed their guide because he seemed \"cautious and responsible\", but added: \"We still don't know if we were lured into a trap.\"They said he had tried to arrange an interview with North Korean associates by telephone the previous night.\"When we set out, we had no intention of leaving China, but when our guide beckoned for us to follow him beyond the middle of the river, we did, eventually arriving \u2026 on the North Korean side. He pointed out a small village in the distance where he told us that North Koreans waited in safehouses to be smuggled into China,\" they wrote.They turned back, but midway across the frozen river they heard yelling.\"We looked back and saw two North Korean soldiers with rifles running towards us. Instinctively, we ran.\"We were firmly back inside China when the soldiers apprehended us \u2026 We tried with all our might to cling to bushes, ground, anything that would keep us on Chinese soil, but \u2026 they violently dragged us back across the ice to North Korea and marched us to a nearby army base \u2026 Over the next 140 days we were moved to Pyongyang, isolated from one another, repeatedly interrogated and eventually put on trial and sentenced to 12\u00a0years of hard labour.\"Their producer, Mitch Koss, and their guide outran the border guards, they said, adding that they believed it had been their journalistic responsibility to cover the harsh lives of North Korean refugees.However, they acknowledge aid groups are now finding it harder to operate along the border and that defectors are going deeper underground. \"We regret if any of our actions, including the high-profile nature of our confinement, has led to increased scrutiny of activists and North Koreans living along the border. The activists' work is inspiring, courageous and crucial.\"Describing their shock at their release \u2013 one moment thinking they would be sent to a labour camp, the next ushered into a room to meet Clinton \u2013 the pair said they were experiencing \"tremendous mental and emotional anguish\" but felt incredibly fortunate to be free.They said that they would not say more about their time in captivity, adding: \"We do not want our story to overshadow the critical plight of these desperate defectors.\"The journalists say they exercised \"extreme caution\" to protect sources and that once captured they tried to shield interviewees by \"swallowing notes and damaging videotapes\".There is a large North Korean refugee population in China but they remain underground for fear of being repatriated and sent to labour camps.A South Korean pastor who assisted the reporters' interviews in China told the New York Times last week that he was deported and his five secret homes for refugees shut down after their capture.The Rev Lee Chan-woo said police raided his home in China on 19 March, two days after the journalists were seized.\"The Chinese cited scenes from films confiscated from the journalists when they interrogated me,\" he said.He claimed that children at one home told him the crew asked them to face the cameras and speak to their mothers.The journalists refer to the visit in their account but do not address Lee's claims. They say they did not film anyone's face, except for a woman who allowed them to shoot her profile.They said they were \"surprised\" that the Rev Chun Ki-won \u2013 who leads the mission for which Lee works and has helped hundreds of North Koreans to reach countries such as the US \u2013 spoke to the media after their arrest. They said they had carefully followed his instructions in contacting his associates in China.Chun, the reporters' main contact, told the New York Times that two of their interviewees fled China after learning of the arrests.A PR representative for the reporters' families did not respond to the newspaper's queries, but a Current TV spokesman told it that \"many of the details\" in the pastors' accounts were \"not correct\".Separately, a senior North Korean official has arrived in China for talks, increasing hopes that progress can be made towards the resumption of talks on the country's nuclear programme.Kim Yong-il, the north's vice foreign minister, met officials in Beijing to discuss bilateral relations, the regional situation and issues of mutual concern, said the Chinese foreign ministry's spokeswoman Jiang Yu. Kim's trip comes a fortnight after the Chinese nuclear envoy Wu Dawei visited Pyongyang, although Jiang said the trip was to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties.A senior South Korean official said conciliatory gestures from the north in recent weeks did not reflect fundamental changes in its approach because it had shown no signs of ending its nuclear weapons programme.The south's unification minister Hyun In-taek said Pyongyang's olive branches were \"just tactical changes because the north has neither declared its return to the six-nation talks nor changed its position\" on disarmament.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Media", "World news", "China", "Refugees", "Human rights", "Bill Clinton", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Freed journalists regret entering North Korea"},{"date": "2009-08-04T09:52:10Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Bill Clinton arrived in North Korea today on a surprise visit to seek the release of two American journalists serving 12 years for \"grave crimes\", in the highest profile visit to the country by an American for nearly a decade.The highly unusual trip comes amid increased tensions between Washington and Pyongyang over the stalled aid-for-disarmament talks and the latter's recent nuclear test and missile launches.The former US president was greeted by the North's chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan, and a high-ranking parliamentary official after landing in an unmarked jet this morning. A young girl presented him with a bouquet.US officials have confirmed Clinton will negotiate for the freedom of Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who were arrested in March on the border with China.The journalists were detained while on a reporting trip for California-based Current TV \u2013 co-founded by Al Gore, Clinton's former vice-president. They were sentenced in June to 12 years of hard labour for entering the country illegally and engaging in \"hostile acts\".North Korea and the US do not have diplomatic relations, but Washington is believed to be working behind the scenes to negotiate their release. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, has said \"everyone is very sorry\" about the incident and urged Pyongyang to grant them amnesty.Kim Yong-hyun, a professor at Seoul's Dongguk University, said Bill Clinton's visit could serve two purposes: securing the women's release and improving ties between the two countries.\"I think it's not just about journalists. It will serve as a turning point in the US-North Korea relations,\" he said.It is not yet clear whether Clinton will meet the North's \"Dear Leader\", Kim Jong-il.Pyongyang has increased tensions in recent months, but many analysts suggested its primary goal was to push the Obama administration into engaging with it. Last week it said it was open to talks on its nuclear programme \u2013 an apparent call for direct discussions with the US.Washington has said it could talk bilaterally with the North, but only on the sidelines of six party talks \u2013 also involving China, Japan, South Korea and Russia \u2013 which Pyongyang has denounced.Clinton is the second former US president to visit North Korea. Jimmy Carter visited in 1994, when Clinton was in office, and met the then-leader Kim Il-sung, the late father of the current leader. The visit came amid escalating nuclear tensions and led to a breakthrough deal months later.Six years later, Clinton's secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, visited Pyongyang for talks with Kim Jong-il. But after George Bush took office he declared the North to be part of an \"axis of evil\" with Iran and Iraq.Asked about Clinton's visit, South Korean foreign ministry officials said any announcement would come from Washington or Pyongyang.There was no immediate response from Clinton's New York foundation, and Gore's spokeswoman, Kalee Kreider, said she could not comment.A senior US official travelling to Africa with Hillary Clinton told reporters : \"While the mission is in progress, we will have no comment ...

It is only the second time a former US president has visited the country: Jimmy Carter flew there 15 years ago, when tensions were running high over the North's nuclear weapons programme. Madeleine Albright visited six years later as Clinton's secretary of state.South Korean media say the two sides will discuss the fate of two US reporters jailed for \"grave crimes\" after they were arrested on the Chinese-North Korean border. But Pyongyang's state news agency said the country's chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Kye-gwan, was among those greeting Clinton at the airport.\"He is coming with [Barack] Obama's message that he wants to improve relations,\" said Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace, who is close to Pyongyang. \"If it was just over the two journalists, North Korea would not accept him.\"The US wants the release of the journalists and a commitment from North Korea that it will resume its disarmament process. North Korea wants an end to sanctions and more economic support. In the short term it is pressing for direct negotiations with the US. But Washington says bilateral talks can only take place in the context of the six-nation discussions rejected by South Korea.The US will also hope to get a better picture of the current situation in North Korea \u2013 particularly if Clinton has the chance to meet its leader, Kim Jong-il. Intelligence from the country has always been very limited and there has been widespread speculation about Kim's health and to what extent he is running affairs since he reportedly suffered a stroke last year.Carter's visit \u2013 at a time when the US was bracing for war with the North \u2013 led to a breakthrough deal that saw Pyongyang suspend its nuclear work. Clinton was president at the time.\"Clinton reached an agreement with North Korea before. He is businesslike and effective,\" said Kim Myong-chol.\"There is the possibility of a dramatic turnaround by North Korea that could lead to a new phase of negotiations,\" Yun Duk-min, of the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul, told Reuters.But others warn that in the long term the visit could backfire \u2013 Pyongyang could take it as proof that increasing tensions on the peninsula is effective.\"It's just what they [North Korea's leaders] need ... It sends all the wrong signals,\" said BR Myers, an expert on the North's state ideology at Dongseo University in South Korea.He said it allowed the government to show its citizens that the nuclear weapons programme was making the world take it more seriously.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Bill Clinton", "Kim Jong-il", "US news", "World news", "US politics"], "title": "Q&A: Bill Clinton in North Korea"},{"date": "2009-08-05T23:05:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Thanks to his trademark Mao suit and Elvis-style sunglasses, and to North Korea's nuclear programme, Kim Jong-il has become an instantly recognisable figure and his country a regular feature in news headlines. Yet most people know little about the \"hermit kingdom\"; a title first applied to ancient Korea, but since judged perfectly suited to the modern North. It is successful not only at limiting its citizens' access to information \u2013 only senior officials can use the internet, for example \u2013 but also foreigners'. Intelligence agencies around the world are reduced to poring over photos of Kim to ascertain his\u00a0state of health and therefore the country's stability. Much of what we know about him comes from the memoirs of his former sushi chef.But over the years, more information has emerged. The border with China has become porous, with people moving back and forth and some in the area using Chinese mobile phone networks with smuggled handsets.Until 1987 no visitors from \"non-aligned\" countries were allowed; by 1993, around 50 western tourists a year were visiting. Now just under 2,000 a year go there, along with up to 30,000 Chinese tourists, accompanied by guides at all times. Photographs are inspected \u2013 and often deleted \u2013 before tourists leave. And it is still relatively rare for journalists to win access.And then there are the defectors, who paint an alarming picture of widespread human rights abuses, although many of their accounts date back to the 90s. According to a report from the UN High Commission for Human Rights this year: \"The UN General Assembly has recognised and condemned severe Democratic People's Republic of Korea human rights violations including the use of torture, public executions, extrajudicial and arbitrary detention, and forced labour; the absence of due process and the rule of law; death sentences for political offenses; and a large number of prison camps.\"The government operates a semi-hereditary system of social discrimination whereby all citizens are classified into 53 subgroups under overall security ratings \u2013 'core', 'wavering', and 'hostile' \u2013 based on their family's perceived loyalty to the regime. This rating determines virtually every facet of a person's life, including employment and educational opportunities, place of residence, access to medical facilities, and even access to stores.\"North Korea is the world's only communist dynasty: Kim Jong-il inherited power on the death of his father Kim Il-sung in 1994, although the latter remains eternal president and his son is instead Dear Leader.Official biographers say that the 67-year-old was born in a military camp on Baekdu Mountain, his birth foretold by a swallow and heralded by the appearance of a double rainbow over the mountain and a new star in the heavens. According to Soviet records, however, he was born in a Siberian village.In addition to his celestial endorsement, Kim is a three-time elected member of the country's rubber-stamp parliament. The country goes to the poll once every five years and there is one candidate per seat; turnout in 2003 was 99.9%.Kim is said to have a fear of flying; his state visits to Russia and China have been made by armoured train. Only once is his voice thought to have been broadcast: in 1992, during a military parade, he told the crowd: \"Glory to the heroic soldiers of the People's Army!\"While many have portrayed him as a clownish and eccentric figure \u2013 an image no doubt reinforced by his characterisation in Team America: World Police \u2013 others say he is smart and even witty. Shin Sang-ok \u2013 a South Korean film director who was kidnapped with his actor wife in 1978 so that he could build a North Korean film industry \u2013 has described a man naive in some ways but shrewd in others. He said Kim, a huge film buff, tended to regard Rambo and James Bond films as records of reality. Yet at one party, when band members rapturously applauded their leader, Kim turned to Shin and told him: \"That's all fake.\"His former sushi chef described a man with a violent temper and a love for large quantities of Hennessy VSOP cognac. Banquets used to last up to four days; his Pleasure Brigade, handpicked young women, provided the entertainment, sometimes ordered to dance naked.And that's about it. Although, according to North Korean media, Kim's accomplishments are legion. His official biography says he has composed six operas and according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap, he has described himself as an internet\u00a0expert.He is thought to have finally annointed the youngest of his three sons Kim Jong-un as his heir and \"Brilliant Comrade\", following his reported stroke last year. Even less is known about this leader-in-waiting. Educated in Bern, Switzerland, the 25-year-old is said to be a basketball fan. His former classmates say he also spoke highly of Jean-Claude Van Damme.The Dear Leader's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, is believed to have fallen from favour after Japanese authorities caught him trying to enter their country on a fake passport in 2001, apparently seeking to visit Tokyo Disneyland.But most analysts suggest that whoever takes over will be essentially a figurehead or arbitrator rather than a sole ruler. They suggest the elite is composed of three broad interest groups rather than factions \u2013 the Kim family, the military and other officials \u2013 who know that their fates are intertwined and who all wish to maintain the status quo. Whether their planning for life after the Dear Leader works in practice will be another matter; some believe factionalism or a military takeover could lead to the collapse of the state.The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was\u00a0formally established in 1948. Korea had been divided at the 38th parallel following the defeat of its occupier Japan in the second world war; the Soviet Union administered the North and the United States the South. When they were unable to reach a deal, separate governments were established \u2013 both maintaining they were the legitimate rulers of the whole peninsula. Kim Il-sung, an anti-Japanese resistance fighter, took the reins in the North.In 1950, following a series of clashes along the border zone, the North invaded the South with the approval of the Soviet Union, but only limited military support. Despite initial successes, UN forces led by the US pushed the troops back and captured Pyongyang. China's entry into the war led to a bloody stalemate; around 2.5 million people are believed to have died. A ceasefire was eventually agreed in 1953, but a peace treaty has never been signed and the Demilitarised Zone is one of the most heavily militarised places in the world.Relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated rapidly in the 60s , leaving the country more reliant on China, but Kim developed an ideology known as juche or self-reliance \u2013 as well as a personality cult \u2013 which thrives to this day under his son.North Korea is famed for its Arirang mass gymnastic display \u2013 particularly the moments when thousands of perfectly choreographed performers hold up coloured cards to create huge and rapidly changing mosaic images. \"The mass events are mindblowing \u2013 it's like nothing else,\" says Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours in Beijing, which has been running trips to the country since 1993. \"The Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing was great, but it was a one-off. North Korea pulls that stuff out of the hat six weeks every year. A full scale mass games has 100,000 performers and God knows how many in logistical support.\"Football is extremely popular and the national team has just qualified for the World Cup, for the first time since 1966. They will be hoping to surpass that notable event; to much surprise, that team beat Italy 1-0 at a match in Middlesbrough, gaining a spot in the quarter-finals where they lost to Portugal. North Koreans also like volleyball and there's a flying-saucer shaped baseball stadium in Pyongyang.Other landmarks include the 105-floor pyramid-shaped Ryugyong Hotel, which has been under construction since 1987, several revolving restaurants and two huge boulevards \u2013 110m wide \u2013 in the city. Crossroads are overseen by female traffic police, reportedly hand-picked by Kim Jong-il for their beauty \u2013 although men manage the roundabouts. Traffic lights are in place, but rarely used.Pyongyang's eight cinemas are said to be frequently closed due to lack of power; when open, they screen domestic propaganda movies with inspiring titles such as The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man.The state news agency KCNA runs a curious combination of brief news items such as its coverage of Clinton's visit, angry denunciations of the treachery of \"puppet authorities\" in South Korea and long tales of the leadership's care for ordinary people. Tuesday, for example, saw the publication of a story about Kim Jong-il inspecting the cabbage harvest in autumn 1979. \"The meticulous care shown by the leader for winter kimchi [pickled cabbage, a dietary staple] is still conveyed as an epic of great love,\" it concluded.In the 60s, North Korea was one of the most industrialised of East Asian nations. But there is no clearer way to see its stagnation than to compare it to its neighbour, China \u2013 once a poor relation, now a capitalist powerhouse. Travel down the river which marks the two countries' border and the disparity is striking. On one side, neon blazes at night; on the other, there is almost complete darkness.\"The scarcity of cars, the early nights, the almost total absence of entertainment places, combined with the electricity shortages, means that by midnight Pyongyang is effectively a ghost city until six the next morning,\" writes Paul French in his book North Korea: The Paranoid Peninsula. Fuel shortages, exacerbated by sanctions, mean that heating can be problematic in a country where temperatures can fall to \u201310C or lower in winter. Possessions are limited; only around half of households have bicycles, leaving most to walk to work.From 2002, the country has experimented with economic reforms, such as opening markets \u2013 although stock is usually very limited. Higher-ranked citizens can enter the department stores for foreigners and senior officials, although foreign currency is often required. Although Chinese goods are now available, most products are unique to North Korea \u2013 such as Vinalon, a widely used synthetic textile made from limestone.But many analysts suggest that the North has now virtually given up on such reforms. And in May, as tensions on the peninsula escalated, it announced that it was tearing up the contracts for the Kaesong joint industrial complex it established with the South \u2013 a rare source of much-needed income, which employed 30,000 North Koreans.In the countryside, the situation is more pressing than in the towns. A crippling famine in the mid-1990s killed hundreds of thousands of people and although the situation has improved, the country remains highly dependent on food aid \u2013 the World Food Programme estimates that 8.7 million of its 23 million inhabitants need assistance. The range of food items is extremely limited and meat is a luxury.Because of the strict controls on where tourists can go, and what they can see, it is hard to assess the true state of affairs. \"Pyongyang itself outwardly presents quite a smart image to the world \u2013 there were people with SLR cameras,\" said one recent visitor. \"But we entered by train and when we were travelling through the countryside we did see some people in rags. We kept having power cuts and a guesthouse we stayed in \u2013 even though it is for foreigners \u2013 asked us what time we would like to have hot water.\"North Korea has a long history of tense relations with other regional powers and the west \u2013 particularly since it began its nuclear programme. China is regarded as almost its sole ally; even so, relations are fraught, based as much as anything on China's fear that the collapse of the current regime could lead to a flood of refugees and growing US influence on its border.Although North Korea is thought to have begun seeking nuclear weapons as early as the 60s, because it feared attack, the issue first began making waves in 1993, when it said that it planned to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused to allow inspectors access to its nuclear sites. As relations deteriorated, the US braced itself for war \u2013 averted when a visit by Jimmy Carter helped to pave the way for a breakthrough deal.Despite ups and downs in the relationship, Madeleine Albright \u2013 then secretary of state \u2013 visited Pyongyang in 2000 and an arms control treaty was agreed. With the arrival of George Bush \u2013 who deemed the North the third member of the \"axis of evil\", alongside Iraq and Iran \u2013 all bets were off. In 2006 the North's first nuclear test brought international condemnation. But not long afterwards, six-party aid for disarmament talks began.Those hit a wall last year after Washington and Pyongyang clashed over how to verify disagreement. Tensions were also rising on the peninsula thanks to the South's election of Lee Myung-bak, who ended his predecessor's \"sunshine policy\" of free-flowing aid.Since then, the North has ratcheted up its rhetoric, tested another nuclear device and launched a Taepodong 2 long-range rocket (the international reaction being neatly summarised in the Sun's headline, \"It's All Gone Pete Tong: Kim Jong in Taepodong Ding-dong\"). Though the rocket flew rather further than on its first test three years ago, when it disintegrated within seconds, it was far from successful. Experts believe North Korea has not yet been able to miniaturise an atomic weapon to place on a missile, but it may not be far off. The main fear is not that it will use such weapons itself, but that it will sell them to other states.On the plus side, most experts regarded its escalating actions this year as a bid for attention from Barack Obama's administration \u2013 a\u00a0bid that appears to have been successful, given Bill Clinton's visit.

Clinton waved, put his hand over his heart and then saluted.North Korean officials waved as the plane took off. McKenna said the flight was bound for Los Angeles, where the journalists would be reunited with their families. The White House had no comment.US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said she had spoken with her husband who told her the two journalists were \"extremely excited\" to be on their way back to the US. Mrs Clinton, in Nairobi at the start of a tour of Africa, said she was \"very happy and relieved\" that the women were on their way home.According to the New York Times, Mrs Clinton was deeply involved in the case. The paper said she proposed sending various people to Pyongyang \u2013 including the former vice-president, Al Gore \u2013 to lobby for the release of the women, before her husband emerged as the preferred choice of the North Koreans.The message from Pyongyang was relayed through the reporters families, who asked Clinton to travel to North Korea to seek their release. They were joined in their request by Gore.The newspaper quoted a senior official as saying the administration did \"due diligence\" to ensure that if Clinton went, he would return with the journalists.An administration offical told the Associated Press that the former president's mission did not include any discussions about issues beyond the release of Lee, 36, and Ling, 32, both journalists with Gore's Current TV media venture. The official rejected an official report by the North Korean news agency that Clinton had delivered an apology about the incident to Kim.Their departure marked and end to a more than four-month ordeal for the women, who were arrested near the North Korean-Chinese border in March while on a reporting trip for Current TV. They were sentenced in June to 12 years of hard labour for illegal entry and engaging in \"hostile acts\".North Korean media characterised the women's release as proof of \"humanitarian and peace-loving policy.\"The Lee and Ling families thanked the president, Barack Obama, the secretary of state and the state department. \"We especially want to thank President Bill Clinton for taking on such an arduous mission and Vice-President Al Gore for his tireless efforts to bring Laura and Euna home,\" it said. \"We are counting the seconds to hold Laura and Euna in our arms.\"", "tags": ["World news", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Bill Clinton", "Obama administration", "Barack Obama", "US foreign policy", "US news", "US politics"], "title": "Freed US reporters leave North Korea"},{"date": "2009-09-18T11:09:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has said he is willing to engage in multilateral talks, Chinese state media reported today, in what appeared to be a conciliatory shift that could pave the way for the reopening of disarmament negotiations.But sceptics have warned that the North may be seeking the relaxation of UN sanctions \u2013 which were toughened after its nuclear and missile tests earlier this year \u2013 without being willing to make significant concessions.\"North Korea would like to solve relevant issues through bilateral and multilateral talks,\" Kim told Chinese president Hu Jintao's special envoy, according to China's official Xinhua news agency.

Chinese premier Wen Jiabao is expected to visit the North in October to mark the anniversary of the two countries' alliance.Pyongyang is heavily dependent on Beijing's support but the two have an uneasy relationship \u2013 one reason the North is so keen to hold direct talks with Washington.The US has said that bilateral discussions with the North could be worthwhile to bring the state back into the six-party negotiations, which also involve China, Russia, South Korea and Japan.The South's president, Lee Myung-bak, said earlier this week that the North showed no signs of giving up nuclear weapons and was adopting a \"conciliatory strategy\" because it was feeling the pain of sanctions.Despite proffering olive branches to Washington and Seoul recently \u2013 via the release of two imprisoned US journalists and the lifting of border restrictions with the South \u2013 Pyongyang has continued to develop its nuclear programme. Earlier this month it claimed to be in the final stages of enriching uranium, which would give it a second way to make nuclear devices.\"North Korea will be keeping up the pressure on its part in order to raise the stakes,\" Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korea Studies told Reuters. \"But, especially now that Kim Jong-il has pledged to talk, the prospects are not too bad.\"However, Kenneth Boutin of Deakin University in Australia said: \"There is a growing body of thought that the North Korean leadership has no intention of abandoning its nuclear weapons programme, and it may well turn out to be the case that their understanding of 'denuclearisation' is far different from ours.\"", "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "China", "Kim Jong-il", "US news", "South Korea", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea willing to re-enter nuclear disarmament talks"},{"date": "2009-12-14T17:28:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The intended destination of a plane carrying 35 tonnes of arms from North Korea and impounded in Thailand was tonightstill unclear, with none of the governments apparently linked to the seized flight admitting any responsibility for its cargo.Ukraine today said it had launched an investigation into the Ilyushin-76 aircraft, amid speculation that it may have been transporting arms to Iran as part of a North Korean smuggling network used to fund North Korea's banned nuclear weapons programme.Ukrainian sources indicated the plane had originally set off from Belarus.

The waters were placid, and the couple were excited about their wedding in November.They were not alone. Agents from North Korea were on the hillside. They overpowered the couple, took them to a waiting boat on Wakasa Bay and transported them nearly 500 miles to the Communist country where they were to spend the next quarter of a century.The disappearance of the couple was a local mystery and might well have remained so had it not been for a seemingly unrelated event thousands of miles away in the Middle East.Nearly a decade after the Chimura abduction, two North Korean agents stepped on to a Korean Air flight in Baghdad bound for Bangkok. In Bahrain the agents disembarked, leaving a bomb on board. The Boeing 707 took off again, exploded in flight, and 104 passengers and 11 crew were killed. The agents were subsequently arrested while trying to leave the country. One, a 70-year-old, killed himself with a poison capsule. The other, 26-year-old Kim Hyon Hui, attempted suicide in the same fashion but was stopped.Kim was later flown to Seoul where a trial revealed a fact that would cause diplomatic reverberations: North Korea had been regularly abducting Japanese citizens to help train special agents. Those agents would then pass themselves off as citizens from Japan, take part in terrorist plots and blacken the name of that nation.North Korea's antipathy towards Japan was ingrained after years of, at times, brutal colonisation from the 1900s to the end of the second world war.For Japan the news was the piece of a jigsaw that went towards solving the puzzle of numerous unexplained disappearances.Concrete confirmation came in July 2002 when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted that \"over-zealous\" special forces had abducted a least a dozen Japanese citizens \u2013 men, women and children between the ages of 13 and 46. Eight had since died.\"It was regretful and I want to frankly apologise,\" said Kim.Chimura was one of those who survived, along with Fukie. They returned to Japan three months after Kim's admission, and after diplomatic wranglings were joined by their three children, who had been born in Pyongyang.Today, the family lives in Obama. But beyond these lives hopefully returning to normal, the anger of the Japanese government is plain to see. Last week Yukio Hatoyama's recently-elected government said it was launching an investigation into the abductions, an inquiry that would potentially identify scores more victims.Officially, 17 Japanese have been identified as abductees, although private groups put the number in the scores. Five have returned but the Japanese government contends that Pyongyang holds the remaining 12. Accounts of the eight deaths tell of some dying, remarkably young, from heart attacks, others suffering gas incidents, another killed in a road accident.Hiroshi Nakai, a cabinet member and minister of state for the abduction issue, said previous administrations had not been bold enough in their efforts. \"We are trying to start a new investigation with a new perspective on this issue. We think if we make further thorough investigations there would be more people who could be confirmed as abductees.\"At stake is not just the concern of the families but the delicate balance of diplomacy. Since North Korea carried out its first nuclear test the international community has been desperate to contain its proliferation.Six-party talks, including Japan, the US and China, have made arguably little progress. But in the latter days of the Bush administration and at the start of the Obama tenure, the US signalled a willingness to deal with Kim Jong-il directly. In August Bill Clinton became the highest-profile US visitor to Pyongyang when he secured the release of two American journalists captured while in a border area. There have also been face-to-face talks between diplomats as recently as last week in New York.Japan has viewed a thawing of relations between Kim Jong-il and the US with some concern and is determined the abduction issue will not be sidelined. \"Japan will never work on the normalisation of relations with North Korea without the resolution of the abduction issue,\" said Nakai. \"It doesn't matter to Japan if the US normalises the relationship. The abduction issue is a roadblock \u2026 to normalisation for Japan.\"Meanwhile the Japanese government explores other avenues to keep the issue alive. It invites the media to visit the abduction sites \u2013 the Guardian took part in one for this article \u2013 and produces comic books and DVDs.

In June 1978, Yaeko Taguchi, who was 22 and a bar worker, dropped her two children, aged one and two, at a daycare centre before going to work at the Hollywood cabaret in Tokyo's Ikebukuro district. She never arrived.Iizuke filed a report with the police and waited. Months turned to years. He and his wife adopted Taguchi's son, one-year-old Koichiro. Another sister took on the responsibility of raising the other child. Nothing was heard of Taguchi until the court testimony from Kim Hyon Hui, the Korean airline bomber. She confessed to being trained by a Japanese abductee for nearly two years prior to her terror mission. Subsequent investigations by Japanese authorities confirmed the teacher had been Taguchi.It also confirmed one of the key motives of the abductions. North Korea, sealed off from the world in a hermit-like state, needed its agents trained in the ways of foreign societies to be able to assimilate with those societies and pass unnoticed.\"My sister was a perfect candidate,\" says Iizuke. \"She had experienced married life, and children, was knowledgeable about fashions and trends and songs of young Japanese women. She was quite suitable to be a teacher of life to North Koreans.\"Now 71, with thinning, swept back hair, Iizuke clutches a picture of Taguchi, a laminated image of a woman with eyes closed in laughter, a broad smile spreading across a grainy face. He says he knows she is not dead, despite the insistence of North Korea. He has also since garnered more information about her desperate struggle against her abduction.\"It seems she was deceived and taken somewhere, maybe under the influence of a sleeping pill,\" said Iizuke. \"She was taken to a beach and although her route is sill not clear \u2026 she was taken to North Korea that way.

Belarus's foreign ministry denied the report, but confirmed that one of its citizens \u2013 Mikhail Petukov \u2013 had been on board, working as a flight engineer.According to Ukrainian officials, the plane travelled via Ukrainian airspace and refuelled at an airport near Kiev. It set off again on 8 December without a cargo to North Korea. The plane picked up a shipment of portable grenade launchers, an anti-aircraft missile system and other weapons from Pyongyang, North Korea's capital.Thai officers seized the aircraft on Saturday at Bangkok's Don Muang airport, acting on tip-offs from US and other intelligence agencies that the plane had been carrying North Korean weapons in contravention of a UN security council ban on arms exports.Today Bangkok's criminal court extended the detention of the plane's five-man crew, four of whom come from Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan tonight denied any knowledge of the illegal arms shipment. It said the plane was registered in Georgia on 7 October and had been leased to a New Zealand company.The crew has been charged with possession of heavy weapons and misstating the nature of the cargo, officially described as \"oil-drilling equipment\". Crew members claim they had no idea they were carrying weapons.\"They thought it was a civilian freight flight carrying oil drilling pipes and other equipment for oil drilling,\" defence lawyer Somsak Saithong said, according to Reuters. Saithong said the crew had delivered such equipment \"a few times\" in the past, adding that three of the crew were trained pilots. According to military sources, the cargo also included missile tubes, spare parts and other heavy weaponry. Experts are now examining the contents at a secluded military airport.Today, government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn said the aircraft was supposed to be flying to the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo. But he said the authorities were investigating whether the flight plan was misleading, and the final destination was in the Middle East, noting the aircraft had recently stopped in the United Arab Emirates.\"We believe after Colombo there may have been another destination,\" he said, adding that, according to the crew, the plane had planned to refuel in the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan before flying to its \"final destination\" in the Ukraine.\"We are taking all of this with a pinch of salt. We will have to verify all the claims, including whether the passports are real,\" Panitan said, adding police still had little information about who the crew members were, where they have been trained and whether they were linked to a terrorist organisation.North Korea was hit in June with fresh UN sanctions to punish it for a nuclear test in May.

North Korea walked out of the aid-for-disarmament discussions a year ago, saying they infringed its sovereignty and vowing never to return. It subsequently tested a nuclear device and several ballistic missiles \u2013 prompting widespread criticism and tightened sanctions.The latest comments suggest a step forward but fall far short of a commitment to return to the table.The state department spokesman PJ Crowley told reporters: \"They have to make the fundamental decision and we did not leave the meeting today believing that they had crossed the threshold that we want to see them cross.\"Bosworth said after his visit that the two sides had reached a \"common understanding\" on the need to restart the negotiations, while in Washington the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said that for a \"preliminary meeting it was quite positive\".North Korea's foreign ministry said exhaustive and frank discussions had \"deepened the mutual understanding, narrowed their differences and found not a few common points\".In a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, it added: \"Both sides agreed to continue to co-operate with each other in the future to narrow down the remaining differences.\"It added that the issues discussed had included drawing up a peace treaty, improving ties, aid and denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.Lee Sang-hyun of the Sejong Institute, a South Korean private security thinktank, said: \"North Korea will only return to the talks after the US offers it a face-saving move or substantial rewards.\"Speaking to Reuters, Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul said: \"For the situation to move forward North Korea needs to take irreversible steps in denuclearisation. For this to happen actions must be taken on both sides simultaneously.\"Some analysts see North Korea's more congenial tone as evidence that sanctions are taking their toll on the country's already battered economy, while others suggest the missile and nuclear tests were always intended to push the US into direct talks.Bosworth met the regime's foreign policy chief, Kang Sok Ju, and its chief nuclear envoy, Kim Kye Gwan. It marked the Obama administration's first high-level talks with Pyongyang.North Korea says it needs a sizable arsenal to defend itself against attacks from the US and others, but at the same time has long sought diplomatic relations with Washington. Bosworth said he had passed on the US president's message that improved ties were dependent on progress on the disarmament deal.In his Nobel peace prize acceptance speech, Barack Obama called for international support to ensure that Iran and North Korea forgo their nuclear ambitions. \"It is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system.\"Bosworth is visiting the region to brief the other members of the six-party talks \u2013 South Korea, China, Russia and Japan \u2013 before returning to Washington.", "tags": ["North Korea", "US foreign policy", "South Korea", "World news"], "title": "North Korea warms to resumption of nuclear talks"},{"date": "2009-12-04T16:13:55Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "It is a single party nation so suspicious of the outside world that it is nicknamed the hermit state.But there may be signs of glasnost in North Korea after the totalitarian country agreed to export designer jeans to Sweden.The jeans go on sale tomorrow in the upmarket PUB department store in Stockholm under the label Noko.Each pair will cost 1,500 kronor (\u00a3131) \u2013 more than two years' wages for an average North Korean.The jeans come in two styles, the slim-fit Kara and loose-fit Oke, and are made in black rather than blue denim.Blue denim is a \"symbol of American imperialism\" to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, Jacob \u00c5str\u00f6m, one of the Swedish importers, said.The denim diplomacy took place over two years of negotiation, and the Swedes said the deal was sealed over a shot of Swedish vodka.\u00c5str\u00f6m and his colleagues, all under the age of 25, said the jeans were made in North Korea by the textile offshoot of a mining company.They have posted a video on their website, nokojeans.com, charting the manufacturing process.Two officials at the North Korean embassy in Stockholm confirmed that the business was legitimate.The Swedish entrepreneurs hope to help break North Korea's isolation by joining the handful of foreign manufacturers operating in the communist nation.The North's regime, built on a philosophy of \"self-reliance\" and national pride, largely sees foreigners and foreign goods as a threat.Most countries refuse to trade with Pyongyang because of its poor human rights record, and \u00c5str\u00f6m said he knew of no other European trading partner.He defended Noko's venture, saying: \"We believe that increased contact with the outside world is good for North Koreans.\"I'm not going to defend North Korea as a country \u2013 that's not the point.\"But we have made sure that the jeans were made under humane conditions. We were in the factory during the whole manufacturing process.\"Jean-Jacques Grauhar, the secretary general of the Seoul-based EU chamber of commerce in Korea, said the new jeans would help boost North Korea's image.\"Already, I'm sure that people have been surprised to find in the same sentence 'designer' and 'North Korea,'\" he added.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Sweden", "World news", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Europe"], "title": "Denim diplomacy: North Korea exports jeans to Sweden"},{"date": "2009-11-19T08:30:16Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart Lee Myung-bak pressed North Korea to end provocation and return to dormant nuclear talks, as the US president wrapped up his Asian tour with a brief visit to Seoul today.Lee said the two countries were offering a \"grand bargain\" of political and economic incentives in exchange for Pyongyang's irreversible de-nuclearisation.Obama added that his special envoy, Stephen Bosworth, would travel to North Korea early next month for bilateral talks aimed at reviving the stalled six-nation discussions.The north has been pushing for direct negotiations, but Washington says it is only holding them in the hope of resuming the multi-party talks. Pyongyang claims those discussions, which also included South Korea, Japan, China and Russia, infringed its sovereignty.Speaking at a joint press conference with Lee, Obama told reporters: \"The thing I want to emphasise is that President Lee and I both agree we want to break the pattern that existed in the past, in which North Korea behaves in a provocative fashion, and then is willing to return to talk ... and then that leads to seeking further concessions.\"North Korea conducted its second nuclear test earlier this year as well as test-firing a series of missiles. Neighbours also regarded a rocket launch as a test of its long-range missile technology, although Pyongyang said it was merely launching a satellite.Earlier this month it said it had produced more weapons-grade plutonium. Its navy also exchanged fire with the south's for the first time in seven years, with each side accusing the other of violating a disputed sea border.Relations on the peninsula deteriorated sharply after Lee took power last year and ended his predecessor's policy of free-flowing aid to the north, angering Pyongyang. At one time, aid from the south equated to around 5% of the north's estimated $17bn (\u00a310bn) a year economy.This morning he stressed that his government was willing to provide substantial amounts in aid if the North renounced its nuclear ambitions.\"I hope that by accepting our proposal, the north will secure safety for itself, improve the quality of life for its people, and open the path to a new future,\" he said.Thousands of cheering South Koreans lined the streets of the capital to watch Obama's motorcade drive by \u2013 giving him the warmest welcome of his four-nation tour of Asia.Obama and Lee also agreed to push for progress on a stalled free trade deal, which analysts say could increase their bilateral trade by about $20bn.

Belarus's foreign ministry denied the report, but confirmed that one of its citizens \u2013 Mikhail Petukov \u2013 had been on board, working as a flight engineer.According to Ukrainian officials, the plane travelled via Ukrainian airspace and refuelled at an airport near Kiev. It set off again on 8 December without a cargo to North Korea. The plane picked up a shipment of portable grenade launchers, an anti-aircraft missile system and other weapons from Pyongyang, North Korea's capital.Thai officers seized the aircraft on Saturday at Bangkok's Don Muang airport, acting on tip-offs from US and other intelligence agencies that the plane had been carrying North Korean weapons in contravention of a UN security council ban on arms exports.Today Bangkok's criminal court extended the detention of the plane's five-man crew, four of whom come from Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan tonight denied any knowledge of the illegal arms shipment. It said the plane was registered in Georgia on 7 October and had been leased to a New Zealand company.The crew has been charged with possession of heavy weapons and misstating the nature of the cargo, officially described as \"oil-drilling equipment\". Crew members claim they had no idea they were carrying weapons.\"They thought it was a civilian freight flight carrying oil drilling pipes and other equipment for oil drilling,\" defence lawyer Somsak Saithong said, according to Reuters. Saithong said the crew had delivered such equipment \"a few times\" in the past, adding that three of the crew were trained pilots. According to military sources, the cargo also included missile tubes, spare parts and other heavy weaponry. Experts are now examining the contents at a secluded military airport.Today, government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn said the aircraft was supposed to be flying to the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo. But he said the authorities were investigating whether the flight plan was misleading, and the final destination was in the Middle East, noting the aircraft had recently stopped in the United Arab Emirates.\"We believe after Colombo there may have been another destination,\" he said, adding that, according to the crew, the plane had planned to refuel in the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan before flying to its \"final destination\" in the Ukraine.\"We are taking all of this with a pinch of salt. We will have to verify all the claims, including whether the passports are real,\" Panitan said, adding police still had little information about who the crew members were, where they have been trained and whether they were linked to a terrorist organisation.North Korea was hit in June with fresh UN sanctions to punish it for a nuclear test in May.

North Korea walked out of the aid-for-disarmament discussions a year ago, saying they infringed its sovereignty and vowing never to return. It subsequently tested a nuclear device and several ballistic missiles \u2013 prompting widespread criticism and tightened sanctions.The latest comments suggest a step forward but fall far short of a commitment to return to the table.The state department spokesman PJ Crowley told reporters: \"They have to make the fundamental decision and we did not leave the meeting today believing that they had crossed the threshold that we want to see them cross.\"Bosworth said after his visit that the two sides had reached a \"common understanding\" on the need to restart the negotiations, while in Washington the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, said that for a \"preliminary meeting it was quite positive\".North Korea's foreign ministry said exhaustive and frank discussions had \"deepened the mutual understanding, narrowed their differences and found not a few common points\".In a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, it added: \"Both sides agreed to continue to co-operate with each other in the future to narrow down the remaining differences.\"It added that the issues discussed had included drawing up a peace treaty, improving ties, aid and denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.Lee Sang-hyun of the Sejong Institute, a South Korean private security thinktank, said: \"North Korea will only return to the talks after the US offers it a face-saving move or substantial rewards.\"Speaking to Reuters, Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul said: \"For the situation to move forward North Korea needs to take irreversible steps in denuclearisation. For this to happen actions must be taken on both sides simultaneously.\"Some analysts see North Korea's more congenial tone as evidence that sanctions are taking their toll on the country's already battered economy, while others suggest the missile and nuclear tests were always intended to push the US into direct talks.Bosworth met the regime's foreign policy chief, Kang Sok Ju, and its chief nuclear envoy, Kim Kye Gwan. It marked the Obama administration's first high-level talks with Pyongyang.North Korea says it needs a sizable arsenal to defend itself against attacks from the US and others, but at the same time has long sought diplomatic relations with Washington. Bosworth said he had passed on the US president's message that improved ties were dependent on progress on the disarmament deal.In his Nobel peace prize acceptance speech, Barack Obama called for international support to ensure that Iran and North Korea forgo their nuclear ambitions. \"It is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system.\"Bosworth is visiting the region to brief the other members of the six-party talks \u2013 South Korea, China, Russia and Japan \u2013 before returning to Washington.", "tags": ["North Korea", "US foreign policy", "South Korea", "World news"], "title": "North Korea warms to resumption of nuclear talks"},{"date": "2009-12-04T16:13:55Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "It is a single party nation so suspicious of the outside world that it is nicknamed the hermit state.But there may be signs of glasnost in North Korea after the totalitarian country agreed to export designer jeans to Sweden.The jeans go on sale tomorrow in the upmarket PUB department store in Stockholm under the label Noko.Each pair will cost 1,500 kronor (\u00a3131) \u2013 more than two years' wages for an average North Korean.The jeans come in two styles, the slim-fit Kara and loose-fit Oke, and are made in black rather than blue denim.Blue denim is a \"symbol of American imperialism\" to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, Jacob \u00c5str\u00f6m, one of the Swedish importers, said.The denim diplomacy took place over two years of negotiation, and the Swedes said the deal was sealed over a shot of Swedish vodka.\u00c5str\u00f6m and his colleagues, all under the age of 25, said the jeans were made in North Korea by the textile offshoot of a mining company.They have posted a video on their website, nokojeans.com, charting the manufacturing process.Two officials at the North Korean embassy in Stockholm confirmed that the business was legitimate.The Swedish entrepreneurs hope to help break North Korea's isolation by joining the handful of foreign manufacturers operating in the communist nation.The North's regime, built on a philosophy of \"self-reliance\" and national pride, largely sees foreigners and foreign goods as a threat.Most countries refuse to trade with Pyongyang because of its poor human rights record, and \u00c5str\u00f6m said he knew of no other European trading partner.He defended Noko's venture, saying: \"We believe that increased contact with the outside world is good for North Koreans.\"I'm not going to defend North Korea as a country \u2013 that's not the point.\"But we have made sure that the jeans were made under humane conditions. We were in the factory during the whole manufacturing process.\"Jean-Jacques Grauhar, the secretary general of the Seoul-based EU chamber of commerce in Korea, said the new jeans would help boost North Korea's image.\"Already, I'm sure that people have been surprised to find in the same sentence 'designer' and 'North Korea,'\" he added.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Sweden", "World news", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Europe"], "title": "Denim diplomacy: North Korea exports jeans to Sweden"},{"date": "2009-11-19T08:30:16Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart Lee Myung-bak pressed North Korea to end provocation and return to dormant nuclear talks, as the US president wrapped up his Asian tour with a brief visit to Seoul today.Lee said the two countries were offering a \"grand bargain\" of political and economic incentives in exchange for Pyongyang's irreversible de-nuclearisation.Obama added that his special envoy, Stephen Bosworth, would travel to North Korea early next month for bilateral talks aimed at reviving the stalled six-nation discussions.The north has been pushing for direct negotiations, but Washington says it is only holding them in the hope of resuming the multi-party talks. Pyongyang claims those discussions, which also included South Korea, Japan, China and Russia, infringed its sovereignty.Speaking at a joint press conference with Lee, Obama told reporters: \"The thing I want to emphasise is that President Lee and I both agree we want to break the pattern that existed in the past, in which North Korea behaves in a provocative fashion, and then is willing to return to talk ... and then that leads to seeking further concessions.\"North Korea conducted its second nuclear test earlier this year as well as test-firing a series of missiles. Neighbours also regarded a rocket launch as a test of its long-range missile technology, although Pyongyang said it was merely launching a satellite.Earlier this month it said it had produced more weapons-grade plutonium. Its navy also exchanged fire with the south's for the first time in seven years, with each side accusing the other of violating a disputed sea border.Relations on the peninsula deteriorated sharply after Lee took power last year and ended his predecessor's policy of free-flowing aid to the north, angering Pyongyang. At one time, aid from the south equated to around 5% of the north's estimated $17bn (\u00a310bn) a year economy.This morning he stressed that his government was willing to provide substantial amounts in aid if the North renounced its nuclear ambitions.\"I hope that by accepting our proposal, the north will secure safety for itself, improve the quality of life for its people, and open the path to a new future,\" he said.Thousands of cheering South Koreans lined the streets of the capital to watch Obama's motorcade drive by \u2013 giving him the warmest welcome of his four-nation tour of Asia.Obama and Lee also agreed to push for progress on a stalled free trade deal, which analysts say could increase their bilateral trade by about $20bn.

The announcement is seen as a fresh attempt to put pressure on the US for direct talks.North Korea's foreign ministry said yesterday the country would \"go its own way\" unless the US agreed to its longstanding goal of bilateral talks.Analysts say despite a recent thaw in its relations with the outside world, the latest move served to underline North Korea's threat to stay away from six-party talks on its nuclear programme, and to carry out more tests of long-range missiles, as well as nuclear devices, despite sanctions imposed after the last nuclear test on 25 May.Earlier this month, Pyongyang expressed willingness to return to the six-party nuclear disarmament talks which it quit in April, on condition it first makes progress in a bilateral meeting with the US.North Korea's latest announcement came amid speculation that the US special envoy to Korea, Stephen Bosworth, might go to Pyongyang late this month or next month for talks to persuade North Korea to return to the six-party forum that brings together the two Koreas, Japan, China, Russia and the US.Ri Gun, the second highest-ranking North Korean nuclear negotiator, and Sung Kim, the US nuclear negotiator, held inconclusive talks last month.After months of sabre-rattling, North Korea has sent more ambivalent signals since August. It has made peace overtures to Seoul and Washington, but it also test-fired short-range missiles and warned South Korea of a potential naval clash on their disputed border.US and South Korean officials believe that North Korea will eventually come back to the negotiating table because of its weak economy and heavy dependence on international food aid.

The waters were placid, and the couple were excited about their wedding in November.They were not alone. Agents from North Korea were on the hillside. They overpowered the couple, took them to a waiting boat on Wakasa Bay and transported them nearly 500 miles to the Communist country where they were to spend the next quarter of a century.The disappearance of the couple was a local mystery and might well have remained so had it not been for a seemingly unrelated event thousands of miles away in the Middle East.Nearly a decade after the Chimura abduction, two North Korean agents stepped on to a Korean Air flight in Baghdad bound for Bangkok. In Bahrain the agents disembarked, leaving a bomb on board. The Boeing 707 took off again, exploded in flight, and 104 passengers and 11 crew were killed. The agents were subsequently arrested while trying to leave the country. One, a 70-year-old, killed himself with a poison capsule. The other, 26-year-old Kim Hyon Hui, attempted suicide in the same fashion but was stopped.Kim was later flown to Seoul where a trial revealed a fact that would cause diplomatic reverberations: North Korea had been regularly abducting Japanese citizens to help train special agents. Those agents would then pass themselves off as citizens from Japan, take part in terrorist plots and blacken the name of that nation.North Korea's antipathy towards Japan was ingrained after years of, at times, brutal colonisation from the 1900s to the end of the second world war.For Japan the news was the piece of a jigsaw that went towards solving the puzzle of numerous unexplained disappearances.Concrete confirmation came in July 2002 when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted that \"over-zealous\" special forces had abducted a least a dozen Japanese citizens \u2013 men, women and children between the ages of 13 and 46. Eight had since died.\"It was regretful and I want to frankly apologise,\" said Kim.Chimura was one of those who survived, along with Fukie. They returned to Japan three months after Kim's admission, and after diplomatic wranglings were joined by their three children, who had been born in Pyongyang.Today, the family lives in Obama. But beyond these lives hopefully returning to normal, the anger of the Japanese government is plain to see. Last week Yukio Hatoyama's recently-elected government said it was launching an investigation into the abductions, an inquiry that would potentially identify scores more victims.Officially, 17 Japanese have been identified as abductees, although private groups put the number in the scores. Five have returned but the Japanese government contends that Pyongyang holds the remaining 12. Accounts of the eight deaths tell of some dying, remarkably young, from heart attacks, others suffering gas incidents, another killed in a road accident.Hiroshi Nakai, a cabinet member and minister of state for the abduction issue, said previous administrations had not been bold enough in their efforts. \"We are trying to start a new investigation with a new perspective on this issue. We think if we make further thorough investigations there would be more people who could be confirmed as abductees.\"At stake is not just the concern of the families but the delicate balance of diplomacy. Since North Korea carried out its first nuclear test the international community has been desperate to contain its proliferation.Six-party talks, including Japan, the US and China, have made arguably little progress. But in the latter days of the Bush administration and at the start of the Obama tenure, the US signalled a willingness to deal with Kim Jong-il directly. In August Bill Clinton became the highest-profile US visitor to Pyongyang when he secured the release of two American journalists captured while in a border area. There have also been face-to-face talks between diplomats as recently as last week in New York.Japan has viewed a thawing of relations between Kim Jong-il and the US with some concern and is determined the abduction issue will not be sidelined. \"Japan will never work on the normalisation of relations with North Korea without the resolution of the abduction issue,\" said Nakai. \"It doesn't matter to Japan if the US normalises the relationship. The abduction issue is a roadblock \u2026 to normalisation for Japan.\"Meanwhile the Japanese government explores other avenues to keep the issue alive. It invites the media to visit the abduction sites \u2013 the Guardian took part in one for this article \u2013 and produces comic books and DVDs. It also broadcasts a daily three-hour shortwave radio programme to North Korea with taped messages from relatives and news from the homeland.Shigeo Iizuke has taken advantage of this to try to reach his missing sister, who vanished more than 30 years ago. In June 1978, Yaeko Taguchi, who was 22 and a bar worker, dropped her two children, aged one and two, at a daycare centre before going to work at the Hollywood cabaret in Tokyo's Ikebukuro district. She never arrived.Iizuke filed a report with the police and waited. Months turned to years. He and his wife adopted Taguchi's son, one-year-old Koichiro. Another sister took on the responsibility of raising the other child. Nothing was heard of Taguchi until the court testimony from Kim Hyon Hui, the Korean airline bomber. She confessed to being trained by a Japanese abductee for nearly two years prior to her terror mission. Subsequent investigations by Japanese authorities confirmed the teacher had been Taguchi.It also confirmed one of the key motives of the abductions. North Korea, sealed off from the world in a hermit-like state, needed its agents trained in the ways of foreign societies to be able to assimilate with those societies and pass unnoticed.\"My sister was a perfect candidate,\" says Iizuke. \"She had experienced married life, and children, was knowledgeable about fashions and trends and songs of young Japanese women. She was quite suitable to be a teacher of life to North Koreans.\"Now 71, with thinning, swept back hair, Iizuke clutches a picture of Taguchi, a laminated image of a woman with eyes closed in laughter, a broad smile spreading across a grainy face. He says he knows she is not dead, despite the insistence of North Korea. He has also since garnered more information about her desperate struggle against her abduction.\"It seems she was deceived and taken somewhere, maybe under the influence of a sleeping pill,\" said Iizuke. \"She was taken to a beach and although her route is sill not clear \u2026 she was taken to North Korea that way. When she came to, she was wrapped in a black bag. She begged the agent; she had left two small children behind.\"Iizuke, founding member of the Association of the Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea, firmly believes Japan now has to press harder for his sister's return.And he points to his adopted son as evidence for that. \"The boy my sister left behind in Japan was one year old. He's now 31. He does not remember anything about his mother. He does not remember her voice, he does not remember the warmth of her skin. Her son desperately wants to know of the reality of his mother.\"Megumi Yokota The youngest, she was just 13 when taken in November 1977.

It is also similar to the missiles the US has controversially agreed to sell to Taiwan, to help counter the growing threat from China.Under Article 9 of its postwar constitution, Japan renounced \"forever\" the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. But the 1960 US-Japan security treaty made clear that Tokyo has a right to self-defence.Since then, and with accelerating speed since the 9/11 attacks, Japan's defence and security activities have expanded. While still essentially defensive in nature, they include international peacekeeping operations, logistical and financial support in Afghanistan, emphasis on strengthened bilateral and multilateral regional alliances, overseas disaster relief, anti-piracy and coastguard operations, and a pro-active overseas development programme.Defence ministry officials and analysts in Tokyo suggest three factors are driving this evolution. One is a host of regional threats and potential flashpoints. They include territorial disputes with China, Russia and South Korea; China's rapid military build-up (its defence spending is rising in double digits each year); its aggressive oil exploration activities in the East China Sea; and North Korea's unpredictable behaviour.\"The environment that we face is harsh and difficult and this is making us feel that we may have to be more self-reliant,\" said a senior defence ministry official. \"On the other hand, this makes it all the more important to solidify our alliance with the US.\"The second factor fuelling Japanese insecurity, however, is growing doubt about that very alliance. A simmering row over relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base in Okinawa, US troop drawdowns in east Asia, revived concerns about the dependability of the US \"nuclear umbrella\" and the general perception that US global predominance is weakening in the new \"Chinese century\" all suggest Japan must do more to look after itself.This thinking is reflected, thirdly, in Japan's domestic politics, which remain in flux after last autumn's watershed defeat of the conservative Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the war, by the centre-left Democratic party.Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's emphasis on east Asian communal \"fraternity\" and a \"more equal\", balanced relationship with the US has put noses out of joint in Washington but appears to have struck a chord with Japanese voters. Upper House elections in July could further embolden the Democrats. Meanwhile, entrenched economic difficulties are also spurring un-Japanese talk of radical solutions.Such problems are for the politicians to sort out. At Iruma air base, Major Taniguchi sticks to the basics, and he draws an unexpected parallel. When it comes to air defence, the RAF's triumph in the Battle of Britain in 1940 is his inspiration, he says.

One is a host of regional threats and potential flashpoints. They include territorial disputes with China, Russia and South Korea; China's rapid military build-up (its defence spending is rising in double digits each year); its aggressive oil exploration activities in the East China Sea; and North Korea's unpredictable behaviour.\"The environment that we face is harsh and difficult and this is making us feel that we may have to be more self-reliant,\" said a senior defence ministry official. \"On the other hand, this makes it all the more important to solidify our alliance with the US.\"The second factor fuelling Japanese insecurity, however, is growing doubt about that very alliance.

As commander of the 4th air defence missile unit, Taniguchi is on the front line of Japan's much downplayed but scarily real, ongoing stand-off with North Korea, one of several potential conflicts in a rough neighbourhood.Japanese politicians and their US military allies tend to soft-pedal problems with Pyongyang, stressing the need to resume the diplomatic process broken off last year. But no one at Iruma has forgotten the moment last April when North Korea lofted a TaepoDong-2 long range ballistic missile over Japan, sending it crashing into the Pacific \u2013 or the North's second nuclear test explosion the following month.\"If an enemy dares to attack us, that's lucky for us,\" an unsmiling Taniguchi said. \"Once they are within range, it is our opportunity, not theirs.\"Taniguchi's confidence in Japan's ability to defend itself rests on the weapons under his command \u2013 an American designed, Japanese built Patriot PAC-3 missile battery, attached to one of the six ballistic missile defence (BMD) groups girdling the country since 2007.The innocuous-looking, green-painted oblong canisters contain four Patriot missiles each.

Or at least, not as hard as it somehow ought to be. I'd always thought that it was only marginally less difficult than going to the moon or, say, Eton, but my amazing revelation is this: type \"North Korea\" and \"tourism\" into Google, and you'll find Koryo Tours, a British-run, Beijing-based travel firm. A couple of clicks and a certain amount of cash later, and you, too, could find yourself on a vintage Russian jetliner heading towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It's impossibly exciting. And when Paul, the Australian sitting next to me, remarks, casually, that Air Koryo is considered unairworthy by the EU, it becomes, perhaps, just a little too exciting. But then some rousing martial music strikes up over a crackling intercom, and air stewardesses wearing what looks like jet-age vintage \u2013 white gloves, natty hats, red lipstick \u2013 bring around the in-flight reading material: the Pyongyang Times. The highlight of a recent firework spectacular, I learn, was a sky-writing display that read \"Down With Imperialism\", although the top story concerns a visit by Kim Jong Il to the new September 26 Breeding Pig Farm. \"The country's economy is growing remarkably through a series of big events in the flame of the new revolutionary upsurge,\" he notes.But then the flame of revolutionary upsurge is burning strongly among us, too. There are 21 of us, from all parts of the globe, most of us reasonably well-travelled, with the exception of Dan, a twentysomething Canadian, who has selected North Korea for his first ever trip abroad. (\"No, Dan,\" I hear someone say, possibly myself. \"In other countries, you are allowed to leave your hotel without being officially accompanied by a government guide.\"). And we're all as excited as puppies.Because barely 1,500 people a year visit North Korea. Or, to put this in context, several thousand fewer than make it to the British Lawnmower Museum. Collectively, we know more about a strimmer once owned by Joe Pasquale than we do about the nation that last May announced it had carried out a second successful underground nuclear test. And as we land on an empty runway, and walk into an empty terminal, it feels like not unlike entering a fold in the space-time continuum. Not least because our mobile phones are immediately confiscated. The investment bankers in the group (we have three of them, two of whom have been recently made redundant \u2013 there's obviously something about having experienced the distintegrating edge of capitalism that makes North Korea an attractive holiday destination) look like they might cry.And yet, for what the West calls a rogue state, and George Bush the most easterly point on the axis of evil, it doesn't seem very evil. It takes a while to clear customs, not because our belongings are searched or we're interrogated about the purpose of our visit, but because, as becomes clear when we see the luggage carousel, we're the only passengers who've failed to pack at least two flat-screen TVs. And when we finally meet our guides by the departures board (there are none until three days' time), they're smiling expansively: an older man, Mr Lee, and a pretty young woman in a fashionable coat, Miss Kim.We trundle along empty roads towards Pyongyang, a \"model\" city of Soviet-style blocks and grandiose boulevards where only citizens with special permits can live or even visit. Miss Kim tells us the name means \"flat land\", and \"the weather is neither too hot nor too cold with adequate precipitation\". It's just getting dark when we reach our hotel, the 47-storey, 1,001 room, Yanggakdo, built on an island in the middle of the Taedong river. There are perhaps three or four rooms with lights on. But then this is more than in most of the apartment blocks we pass because, of all the things that North Korea is short of, it's most short of electricity. There's a famous satellite shot of the Korean peninsula at night, a dark puddle in a sea of light. Our hotel has electricity, but by 10pm, from the magnificent revolving restaurant, the city simply vanishes from view. Poof! Like a cheap trick in a pantomime. Now you see it, now you don't, although it's there again next morning, shimmering in the crisp winter light.The upside of having no electricity is that because there's very little industry, there's very little pollution, and as we travel south out of Pyongyang, towards the Demilitarised Zone, almost no traffic. It's a four-lane highway, the key route south. With no cars. We stop at a roadside service station and are mesmerised by the lack of traffic: a bicycle passes. And some time after that, a unit of soldiers marches past in what was meant to be the fast lane. Because if you want to go somewhere in the DPRK, you walk. Everywhere, criss-crossing the countryside, across fields and dirt roads, people are walking. Who knows where they're going? I scrape the ice off the inside of the bus window and peer out but the North Korean hinterland is an unknown, mysterious place. We know almost as little about North Korea as the North Koreans know of us.This state of affairs isn't helped by the fact that journalists are banned. The last two to enter the country illegally were imprisoned until Bill Clinton intervened last year and negotiated their release. I have special, rare dispensation as a travel writer because Nick Bonner, the founder of Koryo Tours, believes that the more the world engages with North Korea, the more North Korea will engage with the world. And because I've agreed in advance that I shan't write about North Korea's human rights record or in any way insult the Dear Leader. It's strongly impressed on all of us before we leave that if we misbehave, it's not us but our guides who'll bear the brunt of any \"repercussions\".I've been allowed in as \"a travel consultant\" and in this capacity I'm happy to report that visiting North Korea is surely one of the greatest holidays on earth. You will see only what everyone else who goes to North Korea sees: which is what the North Korean government wants you to see. In this, it reminds me of Hello! magazine. I've always marvelled at how celebrities, given editorial control, choose to portray themselves. And so it is with North Korea. You may not get to see the \"real\" North Korea, but this \"unreal\" North Korea is a fascinating thing in and of itself. Because this is tourism at its most perfected. It's like a cruise ship. Every minute of every day has been pre-formulated and it's beautifully worked out: from the \u20ac5 charge if you want to try the national speciality, dog soup, to the man with a video camera who follows our every move, and at the end of the tour produces a DVD of our visit set to martial victory music, and sells it back to us for \u20ac40 a pop.What you get a sense of, most acutely, is the country's extreme isolation and paranoia, although after a few days in the country, it doesn't seem as paranoid as all that. \"After President Bush named us as the axis of evil, he attacked first Afghanistan, then Iraq. Are we next?\"The relationship with the US affects everything: it fuels juche, the ideology of self-reliance, and its strategy of songun, putting the military first, and explains everything from the lack of electricity to the \"Arduous March\", the famine in the late 90s when up to two million people died. It's not as bad as then, but the World Food Programme estimates a third of the population will go hungry this year without emergency aid. Our food, on the other hand, is plentiful and not bad. Even the dog soup is pretty good (half of us reckon it tastes like lamb; the other half, beef).The highlight of the trip is a visit to Kim Il-sung's mausoleum, an encounter that must qualify as the greatest touristic experience on earth. (The \"International Friendship Exhibition\" in Mount Myohyang-san runs a close second. It displays the 223,579 gifts given to Kim Il-sung, including a stuffed crocodile in bow tie and waistcoat serving drinks, presented by the Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua, and a Tolpuddle Martyrs plate from the British parliamentary Labour party.)We're in our smartest clothes. Miss Kim lines us up in rows of four and we march solemnly through a security scanner and on to a travelator that spans an endless marble corridor until we reach the inner sanctum, where we form two perfect rows, take three steps forward on Miss Kim's command, and bow to a statue of Kim Il-sung, march down more marble corridors, through a wind tunnel (to shake the dust from our clothes), and into a darkened room holding the embalmed body of Kim Il-sung himself. Here we form six rows and step forward three steps at a time, to bow solemnly, not once, but three times, from three different directions.Even then it's not over: in another marble chamber is an audio guide to the nation's reaction when the Great Leader died. \"All people were rending their hearts! And weeping scalding tears that as they hit the ground fossilised and became glittering pieces of stone! It was as if the earth itself had died!\"Outside afterwards, groups of Korean women line up to have their photographs taken in front of the palace, and we watch as more than one brushes tears from her eyes. Kim Il-sung was the father of the nation; in fact, he still is, described in the constitution as the \"eternal president\", and this emotion isn't faked.The trouble with North Korea, says Hannah, one of our English guides, is that people tend to see what they want to see. The Chinese see China; the Russians, Russia; Ferenc, a Hungarian in our group, sees a little bit of Hungary \u2013 like the pupils in the June 9 Middle School we visit, he wore the red scarf of the Young Pioneers when he was a boy. \"My parents couldn't believe I was coming here,\" he says. \"They were horrified.\"Dan, the Canadian, sees \"Abroad\". (And it scares the shit out of him. I'm not sure he'll ever leave Winnipeg again.) And Peter, the 74-year-old Australian in our group, sees a battleground. I'm standing next to him when he lifts his trouser leg to show Miss Kim his bullet wounds: \"That's where you buggers tried to kill me,\" he says. \"Although, in fairness, I was trying to kill you lot at the time.\" He's the first Korean War veteran from \"the other side\" that Miss Kim and Mr Lee have met, and it's genuinely touching what a fuss they make of him. They pay out of their own money to upgrade him on the train on the return trip so that he's more comfortable.It's a remarkable journey: like travelling through a Constable painting. There are oxen pulling carts, farmers unloading a haywain, children playing with a wooden hoop. It's so strangely innocent: a landscape that could be from any time within the last three centuries. It's four hours before I see the first car, and some time after that, we approach the border, where a charmless customs officer systematically goes through my camera and deletes half my photos. Beyond the Yalu river we see the towers of Dandong, a small provincial Chinese city that looks like a crazy modern metropolis. How can buildings be so tall and shiny, I wonder.But then if there's one thing that going to North Korea teaches you, it's that everything, all of life, is just perspective.Koryo Tours (koryogroup.com) is the leading operator of tours of North Korea and runs trips starting from \u00a3868, including return travel to Beijing, visa support and all meals.

And when we finally meet our guides by the departures board (there are none until three days' time), they're smiling expansively: an older man, Mr Lee, and a pretty young woman in a fashionable coat, Miss Kim.We trundle along empty roads towards Pyongyang, a \"model\" city of Soviet-style blocks and grandiose boulevards where only citizens with special permits can live or even visit. Miss Kim tells us the name means \"flat land\", and \"the weather is neither too hot nor too cold with adequate precipitation\". It's just getting dark when we reach our hotel, the 47-storey, 1,001 room, Yanggakdo, built on an island in the middle of the Taedong river. There are perhaps three or four rooms with lights on. But then this is more than in most of the apartment blocks we pass because, of all the things that North Korea is short of, it's most short of electricity. There's a famous satellite shot of the Korean peninsula at night, a dark puddle in a sea of light. Our hotel has electricity, but by 10pm, from the magnificent revolving restaurant, the city simply vanishes from view. Poof! Like a cheap trick in a pantomime. Now you see it, now you don't, although it's there again next morning, shimmering in the crisp winter light.The upside of having no electricity is that because there's very little industry, there's very little pollution, and as we travel south out of Pyongyang, towards the Demilitarised Zone, almost no traffic. It's a four-lane highway, the key route south. With no cars. We stop at a roadside service station and are mesmerised by the lack of traffic: a bicycle passes. And some time after that, a unit of soldiers marches past in what was meant to be the fast lane. Because if you want to go somewhere in the DPRK, you walk. Everywhere, criss-crossing the countryside, across fields and dirt roads, people are walking. Who knows where they're going? I scrape the ice off the inside of the bus window and peer out but the North Korean hinterland is an unknown, mysterious place. We know almost as little about North Korea as the North Koreans know of us.This state of affairs isn't helped by the fact that journalists are banned. The last two to enter the country illegally were imprisoned until Bill Clinton intervened last year and negotiated their release. I have special, rare dispensation as a travel writer because Nick Bonner, the founder of Koryo Tours, believes that the more the world engages with North Korea, the more North Korea will engage with the world. And because I've agreed in advance that I shan't write about North Korea's human rights record or in any way insult the Dear Leader. It's strongly impressed on all of us before we leave that if we misbehave, it's not us but our guides who'll bear the brunt of any \"repercussions\".I've been allowed in as \"a travel consultant\" and in this capacity I'm happy to report that visiting North Korea is surely one of the greatest holidays on earth. You will see only what everyone else who goes to North Korea sees: which is what the North Korean government wants you to see. In this, it reminds me of Hello! magazine. I've always marvelled at how celebrities, given editorial control, choose to portray themselves. And so it is with North Korea. You may not get to see the \"real\" North Korea, but this \"unreal\" North Korea is a fascinating thing in and of itself. Because this is tourism at its most perfected. It's like a cruise ship. Every minute of every day has been pre-formulated and it's beautifully worked out: from the \u20ac5 charge if you want to try the national speciality, dog soup, to the man with a video camera who follows our every move, and at the end of the tour produces a DVD of our visit set to martial victory music, and sells it back to us for \u20ac40 a pop.What you get a sense of, most acutely, is the country's extreme isolation and paranoia, although after a few days in the country, it doesn't seem as paranoid as all that. \"After President Bush named us as the axis of evil, he attacked first Afghanistan, then Iraq. Are we next?\"The relationship with the US affects everything: it fuels juche, the ideology of self-reliance, and its strategy of songun, putting the military first, and explains everything from the lack of electricity to the \"Arduous March\", the famine in the late 90s when up to two million people died. It's not as bad as then, but the World Food Programme estimates a third of the population will go hungry this year without emergency aid. Our food, on the other hand, is plentiful and not bad. Even the dog soup is pretty good (half of us reckon it tastes like lamb; the other half, beef).The highlight of the trip is a visit to Kim Il-sung's mausoleum, an encounter that must qualify as the greatest touristic experience on earth. (The \"International Friendship Exhibition\" in Mount Myohyang-san runs a close second. It displays the 223,579 gifts given to Kim Il-sung, including a stuffed crocodile in bow tie and waistcoat serving drinks, presented by the Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua, and a Tolpuddle Martyrs plate from the British parliamentary Labour party.)We're in our smartest clothes. Miss Kim lines us up in rows of four and we march solemnly through a security scanner and on to a travelator that spans an endless marble corridor until we reach the inner sanctum, where we form two perfect rows, take three steps forward on Miss Kim's command, and bow to a statue of Kim Il-sung, march down more marble corridors, through a wind tunnel (to shake the dust from our clothes), and into a darkened room holding the embalmed body of Kim Il-sung himself. Here we form six rows and step forward three steps at a time, to bow solemnly, not once, but three times, from three different directions.Even then it's not over: in another marble chamber is an audio guide to the nation's reaction when the Great Leader died. \"All people were rending their hearts! And weeping scalding tears that as they hit the ground fossilised and became glittering pieces of stone! It was as if the earth itself had died!\"Outside afterwards, groups of Korean women line up to have their photographs taken in front of the palace, and we watch as more than one brushes tears from her eyes. Kim Il-sung was the father of the nation; in fact, he still is, described in the constitution as the \"eternal president\", and this emotion isn't faked.The trouble with North Korea, says Hannah, one of our English guides, is that people tend to see what they want to see. The Chinese see China; the Russians, Russia; Ferenc, a Hungarian in our group, sees a little bit of Hungary \u2013 like the pupils in the June 9 Middle School we visit, he wore the red scarf of the Young Pioneers when he was a boy. \"My parents couldn't believe I was coming here,\" he says. \"They were horrified.\"Dan, the Canadian, sees \"Abroad\". (And it scares the shit out of him. I'm not sure he'll ever leave Winnipeg again.) And Peter, the 74-year-old Australian in our group, sees a battleground. I'm standing next to him when he lifts his trouser leg to show Miss Kim his bullet wounds: \"That's where you buggers tried to kill me,\" he says. \"Although, in fairness, I was trying to kill you lot at the time.\" He's the first Korean War veteran from \"the other side\" that Miss Kim and Mr Lee have met, and it's genuinely touching what a fuss they make of him. They pay out of their own money to upgrade him on the train on the return trip so that he's more comfortable.It's a remarkable journey: like travelling through a Constable painting. There are oxen pulling carts, farmers unloading a haywain, children playing with a wooden hoop. It's so strangely innocent: a landscape that could be from any time within the last three centuries. It's four hours before I see the first car, and some time after that, we approach the border, where a charmless customs officer systematically goes through my camera and deletes half my photos. Beyond the Yalu river we see the towers of Dandong, a small provincial Chinese city that looks like a crazy modern metropolis. How can buildings be so tall and shiny, I wonder.But then if there's one thing that going to North Korea teaches you, it's that everything, all of life, is just perspective.Koryo Tours (koryogroup.com) is the leading operator of tours of North Korea and runs trips starting from \u00a3868, including return travel to Beijing, visa support and all meals.

Pyongyang's state media have made no mention of the incident.\"North Korea may have intentionally floated underwater mines to inflict damage on us,\" the minister, Kim Tae-young, said, according to Associated Press.The Seoul-based news agency Yonhap said he told MPs that a device \"could have drifted into our area\", pointing out that the north planted 3,000 Soviet-made mines in the sea during the 1950-53 Korean war.\"Though many sea mines were removed, it must have been impossible to retrieve them 100% ... One was found in 1959, and another was removed in 1984,\" he said.Kim added: \"Neither the government nor the defence ministry has ever said that there was no possibility of North Korea's involvement.\"Others had suggested one of the south's own mines could be responsible, but the minister said there were none near the Yellow Sea.Officials also ruled out the possibility of a torpedo attack, citing evidence from the ship's radar operators.

Yoon Yeon, a former commander of naval operations, said an internal explosion could not have caused the disaster, saying that fuses and explosive material would be stored separately in facilities with double or triple locks.But Baek Seung-joo of the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses disagreed, saying: \"If a single torpedo or a floating mine caused a naval patrol vessel to split in half and sink, we will have to rewrite our military doctrine.\"One expert suggested the shock from an external explosion could have triggered a second blast inside the ship.Fifty-eight sailors were rescued, but military officials fear the others were trapped within the rear segment of the ship, now resting 40 metres under water.Officials said that divers rapped on the stern with hammers yesterday but heard no response.President Lee Myung-bak said rescuers should not give up hope of finding more survivors, according to a statement released by the presidential Blue House.Divers were unable to gain access to the rear half of the 88-metre vessel until yesterday due to rough seas at the weekend. South Korean rescuers were joined by US navy vessels and divers.The North Korean military warned the US and the south against engaging in \"psychological warfare\" by letting journalists into the demilitarised zone dividing the peninsula. Pyongyang often issues such warnings. The comments, carried in state media, were the military's first remarks since the naval disaster.", "tags": ["South Korea", "North Korea", "World news"], "title": "South Korea fears mine from north sank ship"},{"date": "2010-03-01T13:25:19Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "At Iruma military base in Saitama prefecture, north of Tokyo, Air Force Major Hiroshi Taniguchi is ready for anything. As commander of the 4th air defence missile unit, Taniguchi is on the front line of Japan's much downplayed but scarily real, ongoing stand-off with North Korea, one of several potential conflicts in a rough neighbourhood.Japanese politicians and their US military allies tend to soft-pedal problems with Pyongyang, stressing the need to resume the diplomatic process broken off last year. But no one at Iruma has forgotten the moment last April when North Korea lofted a TaepoDong-2 long range ballistic missile over Japan, sending it crashing into the Pacific \u2013 or the North's second nuclear test explosion the following month.\"If an enemy dares to attack us, that's lucky for us,\" an unsmiling Taniguchi said. \"Once they are within range, it is our opportunity, not theirs.\"Taniguchi's confidence in Japan's ability to defend itself rests on the weapons under his command \u2013 an American designed, Japanese built Patriot PAC-3 missile battery, attached to one of the six ballistic missile defence (BMD) groups girdling the country since 2007.The innocuous-looking, green-painted oblong canisters contain four Patriot missiles each. Mounted on trucks, pointing skywards, and electronically linked to six naval destroyers equipped with Aegis phased array radar, they mark the Japan Self-Defence Force's first foray into BMD. The full deployment will be completed this year.This is the type of defensive missile system the Obama administration plans to introduce in eastern Europe. It is also similar to the missiles the US has controversially agreed to sell to Taiwan, to help counter the growing threat from China.Under Article 9 of its postwar constitution, Japan renounced \"forever\" the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. But the 1960 US-Japan security treaty made clear that Tokyo has a right to self-defence.Since then, and with accelerating speed since the 9/11 attacks, Japan's defence and security activities have expanded. While still essentially defensive in nature, they include international peacekeeping operations, logistical and financial support in Afghanistan, emphasis on strengthened bilateral and multilateral regional alliances, overseas disaster relief, anti-piracy and coastguard operations, and a pro-active overseas development programme.Defence ministry officials and analysts in Tokyo suggest three factors are driving this evolution. One is a host of regional threats and potential flashpoints. They include territorial disputes with China, Russia and South Korea; China's rapid military build-up (its defence spending is rising in double digits each year); its aggressive oil exploration activities in the East China Sea; and North Korea's unpredictable behaviour.\"The environment that we face is harsh and difficult and this is making us feel that we may have to be more self-reliant,\" said a senior defence ministry official. \"On the other hand, this makes it all the more important to solidify our alliance with the US.\"The second factor fuelling Japanese insecurity, however, is growing doubt about that very alliance. A simmering row over relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base in Okinawa, US troop drawdowns in east Asia, revived concerns about the dependability of the US \"nuclear umbrella\" and the general perception that US global predominance is weakening in the new \"Chinese century\" all suggest Japan must do more to look after itself.This thinking is reflected, thirdly, in Japan's domestic politics, which remain in flux after last autumn's watershed defeat of the conservative Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the war, by the centre-left Democratic party.Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's emphasis on east Asian communal \"fraternity\" and a \"more equal\", balanced relationship with the US has put noses out of joint in Washington but appears to have struck a chord with Japanese voters. Upper House elections in July could further embolden the Democrats. Meanwhile, entrenched economic difficulties are also spurring un-Japanese talk of radical solutions.Such problems are for the politicians to sort out. At Iruma air base, Major Taniguchi sticks to the basics, and he draws an unexpected parallel. When it comes to air defence, the RAF's triumph in the Battle of Britain in 1940 is his inspiration, he says. Japan was devastated in the second world war because it could not defend itself in the air.By the look on his face, it is clear that if Taniguchi has any say in the matter, it won't happen again.", "tags": ["World news", "Japan", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "China", "Politics", "Defence policy", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan is ready for North Korea | Simon Tisdall"},{"date": "2010-02-22T14:21:19Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Life expectancy in North Korea has fallen, with increases in infant and maternal mortality, according to a census offering a rare glimpse into conditions in the country.The survey, which is the first in 15 years, also suggests that the country's military has far fewer than its reputed 1 \u200amillion-plus soldiers.While it is impossible to know how reliable the data is, it is unusual for North Korea to issue official statistics. The \u00adfigures have been published by the United Nations' statistical division, but were compiled by the North Korean government, said the UN's PopulationFund, which helped with the survey and sent five teams to monitor the work.In the 15 years since the previous census, life expectancy dropped by 3.4 years, with men living to only 65.6 and women to only 72.7 years on average.Infant mortality rose, from 14 deaths in 1,000 live births to 19, while maternal mortality rose by about 30%, to 77 maternal deaths in 100,000 live births.The period between the two studies included the devastating mid-90s famine estimated to have killed at least 600,000 North Koreans. Some believe the death toll was more than 1 million, and even now the country remains heavily dependent on food aid.The North Korean media reported that the census showed a population increase of almost 3 million over 15 years, taking the total to just over 24 million.According to the US state department, the country's army has been estimated to comprise 1.2 million. But the study puts the number of people working for the government or military at about 700,000.Agriculture, forestry and fishing employ 36% of the workforce \u2013 with slightly more than half of those in the sector being women \u2013 while manufacturing employs another 24% despite struggles to maintain the country's once-thriving industrial base.One in every seven men over 16 had finished a university education, according to the census, while only one in 12 women enjoyed the same advantage.The document was first highlighted in the North Korean Economy Watch blog.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Population", "World news", "Infant and child mortality", "Global development"], "title": "North Korea life expectancy falls, census reveals"},{"date": "2010-02-14T00:05:40Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The strangest of all the very strange things about the strangest place on earth, North Korea, is that it's surprisingly easy to go there. Or at least, not as hard as it somehow ought to be. I'd always thought that it was only marginally less difficult than going to the moon or, say, Eton, but my amazing revelation is this: type \"North Korea\" and \"tourism\" into Google, and you'll find Koryo Tours, a British-run, Beijing-based travel firm. A couple of clicks and a certain amount of cash later, and you, too, could find yourself on a vintage Russian jetliner heading towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It's impossibly exciting. And when Paul, the Australian sitting next to me, remarks, casually, that Air Koryo is considered unairworthy by the EU, it becomes, perhaps, just a little too exciting. But then some rousing martial music strikes up over a crackling intercom, and air stewardesses wearing what looks like jet-age vintage \u2013 white gloves, natty hats, red lipstick \u2013 bring around the in-flight reading material: the Pyongyang Times.

(\"No, Dan,\" I hear someone say, possibly myself. \"In other countries, you are allowed to leave your hotel without being officially accompanied by a government guide.\"). And we're all as excited as puppies.Because barely 1,500 people a year visit North Korea. Or, to put this in context, several thousand fewer than make it to the British Lawnmower Museum. Collectively, we know more about a strimmer once owned by Joe Pasquale than we do about the nation that last May announced it had carried out a second successful underground nuclear test.

The full deployment will be completed this year.This is the type of defensive missile system the Obama administration plans to introduce in eastern Europe. It is also similar to the missiles the US has controversially agreed to sell to Taiwan, to help counter the growing threat from China.Under Article 9 of its postwar constitution, Japan renounced \"forever\" the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. But the 1960 US-Japan security treaty made clear that Tokyo has a right to self-defence.Since then, and with accelerating speed since the 9/11 attacks, Japan's defence and security activities have expanded. While still essentially defensive in nature, they include international peacekeeping operations, logistical and financial support in Afghanistan, emphasis on strengthened bilateral and multilateral regional alliances, overseas disaster relief, anti-piracy and coastguard operations, and a pro-active overseas development programme.Defence ministry officials and analysts in Tokyo suggest three factors are driving this evolution. One is a host of regional threats and potential flashpoints. They include territorial disputes with China, Russia and South Korea; China's rapid military build-up (its defence spending is rising in double digits each year); its aggressive oil exploration activities in the East China Sea; and North Korea's unpredictable behaviour.\"The environment that we face is harsh and difficult and this is making us feel that we may have to be more self-reliant,\" said a senior defence ministry official. \"On the other hand, this makes it all the more important to solidify our alliance with the US.\"The second factor fuelling Japanese insecurity, however, is growing doubt about that very alliance. A simmering row over relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base in Okinawa, US troop drawdowns in east Asia, revived concerns about the dependability of the US \"nuclear umbrella\" and the general perception that US global predominance is weakening in the new \"Chinese century\" all suggest Japan must do more to look after itself.This thinking is reflected, thirdly, in Japan's domestic politics, which remain in flux after last autumn's watershed defeat of the conservative Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the war, by the centre-left Democratic party.Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's emphasis on east Asian communal \"fraternity\" and a \"more equal\", balanced relationship with the US has put noses out of joint in Washington but appears to have struck a chord with Japanese voters. Upper House elections in July could further embolden the Democrats. Meanwhile, entrenched economic difficulties are also spurring un-Japanese talk of radical solutions.Such problems are for the politicians to sort out. At Iruma air base, Major Taniguchi sticks to the basics, and he draws an unexpected parallel. When it comes to air defence, the RAF's triumph in the Battle of Britain in 1940 is his inspiration, he says. Japan was devastated in the second world war because it could not defend itself in the air.By the look on his face, it is clear that if Taniguchi has any say in the matter, it won't happen again.", "tags": ["World news", "Japan", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "China", "Politics", "Defence policy", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan is ready for North Korea | Simon Tisdall"},{"date": "2010-02-22T14:21:19Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Life expectancy in North Korea has fallen, with increases in infant and maternal mortality, according to a census offering a rare glimpse into conditions in the country.The survey, which is the first in 15 years, also suggests that the country's military has far fewer than its reputed 1 \u200amillion-plus soldiers.While it is impossible to know how reliable the data is, it is unusual for North Korea to issue official statistics. The \u00adfigures have been published by the United Nations' statistical division, but were compiled by the North Korean government, said the UN's PopulationFund, which helped with the survey and sent five teams to monitor the work.In the 15 years since the previous census, life expectancy dropped by 3.4 years, with men living to only 65.6 and women to only 72.7 years on average.Infant mortality rose, from 14 deaths in 1,000 live births to 19, while maternal mortality rose by about 30%, to 77 maternal deaths in 100,000 live births.The period between the two studies included the devastating mid-90s famine estimated to have killed at least 600,000 North Koreans. Some believe the death toll was more than 1 million, and even now the country remains heavily dependent on food aid.The North Korean media reported that the census showed a population increase of almost 3 million over 15 years, taking the total to just over 24 million.According to the US state department, the country's army has been estimated to comprise 1.2 million. But the study puts the number of people working for the government or military at about 700,000.Agriculture, forestry and fishing employ 36% of the workforce \u2013 with slightly more than half of those in the sector being women \u2013 while manufacturing employs another 24% despite struggles to maintain the country's once-thriving industrial base.One in every seven men over 16 had finished a university education, according to the census, while only one in 12 women enjoyed the same advantage.The document was first highlighted in the North Korean Economy Watch blog.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Population", "World news", "Infant and child mortality", "Global development"], "title": "North Korea life expectancy falls, census reveals"},{"date": "2010-02-14T00:05:40Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The strangest of all the very strange things about the strangest place on earth, North Korea, is that it's surprisingly easy to go there. Or at least, not as hard as it somehow ought to be. I'd always thought that it was only marginally less difficult than going to the moon or, say, Eton, but my amazing revelation is this: type \"North Korea\" and \"tourism\" into Google, and you'll find Koryo Tours, a British-run, Beijing-based travel firm. A couple of clicks and a certain amount of cash later, and you, too, could find yourself on a vintage Russian jetliner heading towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It's impossibly exciting. And when Paul, the Australian sitting next to me, remarks, casually, that Air Koryo is considered unairworthy by the EU, it becomes, perhaps, just a little too exciting. But then some rousing martial music strikes up over a crackling intercom, and air stewardesses wearing what looks like jet-age vintage \u2013 white gloves, natty hats, red lipstick \u2013 bring around the in-flight reading material: the Pyongyang Times. The highlight of a recent firework spectacular, I learn, was a sky-writing display that read \"Down With Imperialism\", although the top story concerns a visit by Kim Jong Il to the new September 26 Breeding Pig Farm. \"The country's economy is growing remarkably through a series of big events in the flame of the new revolutionary upsurge,\" he notes.But then the flame of revolutionary upsurge is burning strongly among us, too. There are 21 of us, from all parts of the globe, most of us reasonably well-travelled, with the exception of Dan, a twentysomething Canadian, who has selected North Korea for his first ever trip abroad. (\"No, Dan,\" I hear someone say, possibly myself. \"In other countries, you are allowed to leave your hotel without being officially accompanied by a government guide.\"). And we're all as excited as puppies.Because barely 1,500 people a year visit North Korea. Or, to put this in context, several thousand fewer than make it to the British Lawnmower Museum. Collectively, we know more about a strimmer once owned by Joe Pasquale than we do about the nation that last May announced it had carried out a second successful underground nuclear test. And as we land on an empty runway, and walk into an empty terminal, it feels like not unlike entering a fold in the space-time continuum. Not least because our mobile phones are immediately confiscated. The investment bankers in the group (we have three of them, two of whom have been recently made redundant \u2013 there's obviously something about having experienced the distintegrating edge of capitalism that makes North Korea an attractive holiday destination) look like they might cry.And yet, for what the West calls a rogue state, and George Bush the most easterly point on the axis of evil, it doesn't seem very evil. It takes a while to clear customs, not because our belongings are searched or we're interrogated about the purpose of our visit, but because, as becomes clear when we see the luggage carousel, we're the only passengers who've failed to pack at least two flat-screen TVs. And when we finally meet our guides by the departures board (there are none until three days' time), they're smiling expansively: an older man, Mr Lee, and a pretty young woman in a fashionable coat, Miss Kim.We trundle along empty roads towards Pyongyang, a \"model\" city of Soviet-style blocks and grandiose boulevards where only citizens with special permits can live or even visit. Miss Kim tells us the name means \"flat land\", and \"the weather is neither too hot nor too cold with adequate precipitation\". It's just getting dark when we reach our hotel, the 47-storey, 1,001 room, Yanggakdo, built on an island in the middle of the Taedong river. There are perhaps three or four rooms with lights on. But then this is more than in most of the apartment blocks we pass because, of all the things that North Korea is short of, it's most short of electricity. There's a famous satellite shot of the Korean peninsula at night, a dark puddle in a sea of light. Our hotel has electricity, but by 10pm, from the magnificent revolving restaurant, the city simply vanishes from view. Poof! Like a cheap trick in a pantomime. Now you see it, now you don't, although it's there again next morning, shimmering in the crisp winter light.The upside of having no electricity is that because there's very little industry, there's very little pollution, and as we travel south out of Pyongyang, towards the Demilitarised Zone, almost no traffic. It's a four-lane highway, the key route south. With no cars. We stop at a roadside service station and are mesmerised by the lack of traffic: a bicycle passes. And some time after that, a unit of soldiers marches past in what was meant to be the fast lane. Because if you want to go somewhere in the DPRK, you walk. Everywhere, criss-crossing the countryside, across fields and dirt roads, people are walking. Who knows where they're going? I scrape the ice off the inside of the bus window and peer out but the North Korean hinterland is an unknown, mysterious place. We know almost as little about North Korea as the North Koreans know of us.This state of affairs isn't helped by the fact that journalists are banned. The last two to enter the country illegally were imprisoned until Bill Clinton intervened last year and negotiated their release. I have special, rare dispensation as a travel writer because Nick Bonner, the founder of Koryo Tours, believes that the more the world engages with North Korea, the more North Korea will engage with the world. And because I've agreed in advance that I shan't write about North Korea's human rights record or in any way insult the Dear Leader. It's strongly impressed on all of us before we leave that if we misbehave, it's not us but our guides who'll bear the brunt of any \"repercussions\".I've been allowed in as \"a travel consultant\" and in this capacity I'm happy to report that visiting North Korea is surely one of the greatest holidays on earth. You will see only what everyone else who goes to North Korea sees: which is what the North Korean government wants you to see. In this, it reminds me of Hello! magazine. I've always marvelled at how celebrities, given editorial control, choose to portray themselves. And so it is with North Korea. You may not get to see the \"real\" North Korea, but this \"unreal\" North Korea is a fascinating thing in and of itself. Because this is tourism at its most perfected. It's like a cruise ship. Every minute of every day has been pre-formulated and it's beautifully worked out: from the \u20ac5 charge if you want to try the national speciality, dog soup, to the man with a video camera who follows our every move, and at the end of the tour produces a DVD of our visit set to martial victory music, and sells it back to us for \u20ac40 a pop.What you get a sense of, most acutely, is the country's extreme isolation and paranoia, although after a few days in the country, it doesn't seem as paranoid as all that. \"After President Bush named us as the axis of evil, he attacked first Afghanistan, then Iraq. Are we next?\"The relationship with the US affects everything: it fuels juche, the ideology of self-reliance, and its strategy of songun, putting the military first, and explains everything from the lack of electricity to the \"Arduous March\", the famine in the late 90s when up to two million people died. It's not as bad as then, but the World Food Programme estimates a third of the population will go hungry this year without emergency aid. Our food, on the other hand, is plentiful and not bad. Even the dog soup is pretty good (half of us reckon it tastes like lamb; the other half, beef).The highlight of the trip is a visit to Kim Il-sung's mausoleum, an encounter that must qualify as the greatest touristic experience on earth. (The \"International Friendship Exhibition\" in Mount Myohyang-san runs a close second. It displays the 223,579 gifts given to Kim Il-sung, including a stuffed crocodile in bow tie and waistcoat serving drinks, presented by the Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua, and a Tolpuddle Martyrs plate from the British parliamentary Labour party.)We're in our smartest clothes. Miss Kim lines us up in rows of four and we march solemnly through a security scanner and on to a travelator that spans an endless marble corridor until we reach the inner sanctum, where we form two perfect rows, take three steps forward on Miss Kim's command, and bow to a statue of Kim Il-sung, march down more marble corridors, through a wind tunnel (to shake the dust from our clothes), and into a darkened room holding the embalmed body of Kim Il-sung himself. Here we form six rows and step forward three steps at a time, to bow solemnly, not once, but three times, from three different directions.Even then it's not over: in another marble chamber is an audio guide to the nation's reaction when the Great Leader died. \"All people were rending their hearts! And weeping scalding tears that as they hit the ground fossilised and became glittering pieces of stone! It was as if the earth itself had died!\"Outside afterwards, groups of Korean women line up to have their photographs taken in front of the palace, and we watch as more than one brushes tears from her eyes. Kim Il-sung was the father of the nation; in fact, he still is, described in the constitution as the \"eternal president\", and this emotion isn't faked.The trouble with North Korea, says Hannah, one of our English guides, is that people tend to see what they want to see. The Chinese see China; the Russians, Russia; Ferenc, a Hungarian in our group, sees a little bit of Hungary \u2013 like the pupils in the June 9 Middle School we visit, he wore the red scarf of the Young Pioneers when he was a boy. \"My parents couldn't believe I was coming here,\" he says. \"They were horrified.\"Dan, the Canadian, sees \"Abroad\". (And it scares the shit out of him. I'm not sure he'll ever leave Winnipeg again.) And Peter, the 74-year-old Australian in our group, sees a battleground. I'm standing next to him when he lifts his trouser leg to show Miss Kim his bullet wounds: \"That's where you buggers tried to kill me,\" he says. \"Although, in fairness, I was trying to kill you lot at the time.\" He's the first Korean War veteran from \"the other side\" that Miss Kim and Mr Lee have met, and it's genuinely touching what a fuss they make of him. They pay out of their own money to upgrade him on the train on the return trip so that he's more comfortable.It's a remarkable journey: like travelling through a Constable painting. There are oxen pulling carts, farmers unloading a haywain, children playing with a wooden hoop. It's so strangely innocent: a landscape that could be from any time within the last three centuries. It's four hours before I see the first car, and some time after that, we approach the border, where a charmless customs officer systematically goes through my camera and deletes half my photos. Beyond the Yalu river we see the towers of Dandong, a small provincial Chinese city that looks like a crazy modern metropolis. How can buildings be so tall and shiny, I wonder.But then if there's one thing that going to North Korea teaches you, it's that everything, all of life, is just perspective.Koryo Tours (koryogroup.com) is the leading operator of tours of North Korea and runs trips starting from \u00a3868, including return travel to Beijing, visa support and all meals.

A simmering row over relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base in Okinawa, US troop drawdowns in east Asia, revived concerns about the dependability of the US \"nuclear umbrella\" and the general perception that US global predominance is weakening in the new \"Chinese century\" all suggest Japan must do more to look after itself.This thinking is reflected, thirdly, in Japan's domestic politics, which remain in flux after last autumn's watershed defeat of the conservative Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the war, by the centre-left Democratic party.Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's emphasis on east Asian communal \"fraternity\" and a \"more equal\", balanced relationship with the US has put noses out of joint in Washington but appears to have struck a chord with Japanese voters. Upper House elections in July could further embolden the Democrats. Meanwhile, entrenched economic difficulties are also spurring un-Japanese talk of radical solutions.Such problems are for the politicians to sort out. At Iruma air base, Major Taniguchi sticks to the basics, and he draws an unexpected parallel. When it comes to air defence, the RAF's triumph in the Battle of Britain in 1940 is his inspiration, he says. Japan was devastated in the second world war because it could not defend itself in the air.By the look on his face, it is clear that if Taniguchi has any say in the matter, it won't happen again.", "tags": ["World news", "Japan", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "China", "Politics", "Defence policy", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan is ready for North Korea | Simon Tisdall"},{"date": "2010-02-22T14:21:19Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Life expectancy in North Korea has fallen, with increases in infant and maternal mortality, according to a census offering a rare glimpse into conditions in the country.The survey, which is the first in 15 years, also suggests that the country's military has far fewer than its reputed 1 \u200amillion-plus soldiers.While it is impossible to know how reliable the data is, it is unusual for North Korea to issue official statistics. The \u00adfigures have been published by the United Nations' statistical division, but were compiled by the North Korean government, said the UN's PopulationFund, which helped with the survey and sent five teams to monitor the work.In the 15 years since the previous census, life expectancy dropped by 3.4 years, with men living to only 65.6 and women to only 72.7 years on average.Infant mortality rose, from 14 deaths in 1,000 live births to 19, while maternal mortality rose by about 30%, to 77 maternal deaths in 100,000 live births.The period between the two studies included the devastating mid-90s famine estimated to have killed at least 600,000 North Koreans. Some believe the death toll was more than 1 million, and even now the country remains heavily dependent on food aid.The North Korean media reported that the census showed a population increase of almost 3 million over 15 years, taking the total to just over 24 million.According to the US state department, the country's army has been estimated to comprise 1.2 million. But the study puts the number of people working for the government or military at about 700,000.Agriculture, forestry and fishing employ 36% of the workforce \u2013 with slightly more than half of those in the sector being women \u2013 while manufacturing employs another 24% despite struggles to maintain the country's once-thriving industrial base.One in every seven men over 16 had finished a university education, according to the census, while only one in 12 women enjoyed the same advantage.The document was first highlighted in the North Korean Economy Watch blog.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Population", "World news", "Infant and child mortality", "Global development"], "title": "North Korea life expectancy falls, census reveals"},{"date": "2010-02-14T00:05:40Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The strangest of all the very strange things about the strangest place on earth, North Korea, is that it's surprisingly easy to go there. Or at least, not as hard as it somehow ought to be. I'd always thought that it was only marginally less difficult than going to the moon or, say, Eton, but my amazing revelation is this: type \"North Korea\" and \"tourism\" into Google, and you'll find Koryo Tours, a British-run, Beijing-based travel firm. A couple of clicks and a certain amount of cash later, and you, too, could find yourself on a vintage Russian jetliner heading towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It's impossibly exciting. And when Paul, the Australian sitting next to me, remarks, casually, that Air Koryo is considered unairworthy by the EU, it becomes, perhaps, just a little too exciting. But then some rousing martial music strikes up over a crackling intercom, and air stewardesses wearing what looks like jet-age vintage \u2013 white gloves, natty hats, red lipstick \u2013 bring around the in-flight reading material: the Pyongyang Times. The highlight of a recent firework spectacular, I learn, was a sky-writing display that read \"Down With Imperialism\", although the top story concerns a visit by Kim Jong Il to the new September 26 Breeding Pig Farm. \"The country's economy is growing remarkably through a series of big events in the flame of the new revolutionary upsurge,\" he notes.But then the flame of revolutionary upsurge is burning strongly among us, too. There are 21 of us, from all parts of the globe, most of us reasonably well-travelled, with the exception of Dan, a twentysomething Canadian, who has selected North Korea for his first ever trip abroad. (\"No, Dan,\" I hear someone say, possibly myself. \"In other countries, you are allowed to leave your hotel without being officially accompanied by a government guide.\"). And we're all as excited as puppies.Because barely 1,500 people a year visit North Korea. Or, to put this in context, several thousand fewer than make it to the British Lawnmower Museum. Collectively, we know more about a strimmer once owned by Joe Pasquale than we do about the nation that last May announced it had carried out a second successful underground nuclear test. And as we land on an empty runway, and walk into an empty terminal, it feels like not unlike entering a fold in the space-time continuum. Not least because our mobile phones are immediately confiscated. The investment bankers in the group (we have three of them, two of whom have been recently made redundant \u2013 there's obviously something about having experienced the distintegrating edge of capitalism that makes North Korea an attractive holiday destination) look like they might cry.And yet, for what the West calls a rogue state, and George Bush the most easterly point on the axis of evil, it doesn't seem very evil. It takes a while to clear customs, not because our belongings are searched or we're interrogated about the purpose of our visit, but because, as becomes clear when we see the luggage carousel, we're the only passengers who've failed to pack at least two flat-screen TVs. And when we finally meet our guides by the departures board (there are none until three days' time), they're smiling expansively: an older man, Mr Lee, and a pretty young woman in a fashionable coat, Miss Kim.We trundle along empty roads towards Pyongyang, a \"model\" city of Soviet-style blocks and grandiose boulevards where only citizens with special permits can live or even visit. Miss Kim tells us the name means \"flat land\", and \"the weather is neither too hot nor too cold with adequate precipitation\". It's just getting dark when we reach our hotel, the 47-storey, 1,001 room, Yanggakdo, built on an island in the middle of the Taedong river. There are perhaps three or four rooms with lights on. But then this is more than in most of the apartment blocks we pass because, of all the things that North Korea is short of, it's most short of electricity. There's a famous satellite shot of the Korean peninsula at night, a dark puddle in a sea of light. Our hotel has electricity, but by 10pm, from the magnificent revolving restaurant, the city simply vanishes from view. Poof! Like a cheap trick in a pantomime. Now you see it, now you don't, although it's there again next morning, shimmering in the crisp winter light.The upside of having no electricity is that because there's very little industry, there's very little pollution, and as we travel south out of Pyongyang, towards the Demilitarised Zone, almost no traffic. It's a four-lane highway, the key route south. With no cars. We stop at a roadside service station and are mesmerised by the lack of traffic: a bicycle passes. And some time after that, a unit of soldiers marches past in what was meant to be the fast lane. Because if you want to go somewhere in the DPRK, you walk. Everywhere, criss-crossing the countryside, across fields and dirt roads, people are walking. Who knows where they're going? I scrape the ice off the inside of the bus window and peer out but the North Korean hinterland is an unknown, mysterious place. We know almost as little about North Korea as the North Koreans know of us.This state of affairs isn't helped by the fact that journalists are banned. The last two to enter the country illegally were imprisoned until Bill Clinton intervened last year and negotiated their release. I have special, rare dispensation as a travel writer because Nick Bonner, the founder of Koryo Tours, believes that the more the world engages with North Korea, the more North Korea will engage with the world. And because I've agreed in advance that I shan't write about North Korea's human rights record or in any way insult the Dear Leader. It's strongly impressed on all of us before we leave that if we misbehave, it's not us but our guides who'll bear the brunt of any \"repercussions\".I've been allowed in as \"a travel consultant\" and in this capacity I'm happy to report that visiting North Korea is surely one of the greatest holidays on earth. You will see only what everyone else who goes to North Korea sees: which is what the North Korean government wants you to see. In this, it reminds me of Hello! magazine. I've always marvelled at how celebrities, given editorial control, choose to portray themselves. And so it is with North Korea. You may not get to see the \"real\" North Korea, but this \"unreal\" North Korea is a fascinating thing in and of itself. Because this is tourism at its most perfected. It's like a cruise ship. Every minute of every day has been pre-formulated and it's beautifully worked out: from the \u20ac5 charge if you want to try the national speciality, dog soup, to the man with a video camera who follows our every move, and at the end of the tour produces a DVD of our visit set to martial victory music, and sells it back to us for \u20ac40 a pop.What you get a sense of, most acutely, is the country's extreme isolation and paranoia, although after a few days in the country, it doesn't seem as paranoid as all that. \"After President Bush named us as the axis of evil, he attacked first Afghanistan, then Iraq. Are we next?\"The relationship with the US affects everything: it fuels juche, the ideology of self-reliance, and its strategy of songun, putting the military first, and explains everything from the lack of electricity to the \"Arduous March\", the famine in the late 90s when up to two million people died. It's not as bad as then, but the World Food Programme estimates a third of the population will go hungry this year without emergency aid. Our food, on the other hand, is plentiful and not bad. Even the dog soup is pretty good (half of us reckon it tastes like lamb; the other half, beef).The highlight of the trip is a visit to Kim Il-sung's mausoleum, an encounter that must qualify as the greatest touristic experience on earth. (The \"International Friendship Exhibition\" in Mount Myohyang-san runs a close second. It displays the 223,579 gifts given to Kim Il-sung, including a stuffed crocodile in bow tie and waistcoat serving drinks, presented by the Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua, and a Tolpuddle Martyrs plate from the British parliamentary Labour party.)We're in our smartest clothes. Miss Kim lines us up in rows of four and we march solemnly through a security scanner and on to a travelator that spans an endless marble corridor until we reach the inner sanctum, where we form two perfect rows, take three steps forward on Miss Kim's command, and bow to a statue of Kim Il-sung, march down more marble corridors, through a wind tunnel (to shake the dust from our clothes), and into a darkened room holding the embalmed body of Kim Il-sung himself. Here we form six rows and step forward three steps at a time, to bow solemnly, not once, but three times, from three different directions.Even then it's not over: in another marble chamber is an audio guide to the nation's reaction when the Great Leader died. \"All people were rending their hearts! And weeping scalding tears that as they hit the ground fossilised and became glittering pieces of stone! It was as if the earth itself had died!\"Outside afterwards, groups of Korean women line up to have their photographs taken in front of the palace, and we watch as more than one brushes tears from her eyes. Kim Il-sung was the father of the nation; in fact, he still is, described in the constitution as the \"eternal president\", and this emotion isn't faked.The trouble with North Korea, says Hannah, one of our English guides, is that people tend to see what they want to see. The Chinese see China; the Russians, Russia; Ferenc, a Hungarian in our group, sees a little bit of Hungary \u2013 like the pupils in the June 9 Middle School we visit, he wore the red scarf of the Young Pioneers when he was a boy. \"My parents couldn't believe I was coming here,\" he says. \"They were horrified.\"Dan, the Canadian, sees \"Abroad\". (And it scares the shit out of him. I'm not sure he'll ever leave Winnipeg again.) And Peter, the 74-year-old Australian in our group, sees a battleground. I'm standing next to him when he lifts his trouser leg to show Miss Kim his bullet wounds: \"That's where you buggers tried to kill me,\" he says. \"Although, in fairness, I was trying to kill you lot at the time.\" He's the first Korean War veteran from \"the other side\" that Miss Kim and Mr Lee have met, and it's genuinely touching what a fuss they make of him. They pay out of their own money to upgrade him on the train on the return trip so that he's more comfortable.It's a remarkable journey: like travelling through a Constable painting. There are oxen pulling carts, farmers unloading a haywain, children playing with a wooden hoop. It's so strangely innocent: a landscape that could be from any time within the last three centuries. It's four hours before I see the first car, and some time after that, we approach the border, where a charmless customs officer systematically goes through my camera and deletes half my photos. Beyond the Yalu river we see the towers of Dandong, a small provincial Chinese city that looks like a crazy modern metropolis. How can buildings be so tall and shiny, I wonder.But then if there's one thing that going to North Korea teaches you, it's that everything, all of life, is just perspective.Koryo Tours (koryogroup.com) is the leading operator of tours of North Korea and runs trips starting from \u00a3868, including return travel to Beijing, visa support and all meals.

Pyongyang's state media have made no mention of the incident.\"North Korea may have intentionally floated underwater mines to inflict damage on us,\" the minister, Kim Tae-young, said, according to Associated Press.The Seoul-based news agency Yonhap said he told MPs that a device \"could have drifted into our area\", pointing out that the north planted 3,000 Soviet-made mines in the sea during the 1950-53 Korean war.\"Though many sea mines were removed, it must have been impossible to retrieve them 100% ... One was found in 1959, and another was removed in 1984,\" he said.Kim added: \"Neither the government nor the defence ministry has ever said that there was no possibility of North Korea's involvement.\"Others had suggested one of the south's own mines could be responsible, but the minister said there were none near the Yellow Sea.Officials also ruled out the possibility of a torpedo attack, citing evidence from the ship's radar operators. They had earlier said that there was no evidence of North Korean military activity in the area at the time of the explosion.The 1,200-tonne Cheonan split in two within minutes of a blast in the rear hull. It was patrolling the Yellow Sea near Baengnyeong, where several gun battles have taken place between North and South Korean vessels in recent years. But an attack of this kind would be a major escalation of tensions on the peninsula and would anger the US and China.The South Korean paper Chosun Ilbo quoted experts who cited a range of possible causes. Yoon Yeon, a former commander of naval operations, said an internal explosion could not have caused the disaster, saying that fuses and explosive material would be stored separately in facilities with double or triple locks.But Baek Seung-joo of the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses disagreed, saying: \"If a single torpedo or a floating mine caused a naval patrol vessel to split in half and sink, we will have to rewrite our military doctrine.\"One expert suggested the shock from an external explosion could have triggered a second blast inside the ship.Fifty-eight sailors were rescued, but military officials fear the others were trapped within the rear segment of the ship, now resting 40 metres under water.Officials said that divers rapped on the stern with hammers yesterday but heard no response.President Lee Myung-bak said rescuers should not give up hope of finding more survivors, according to a statement released by the presidential Blue House.Divers were unable to gain access to the rear half of the 88-metre vessel until yesterday due to rough seas at the weekend. South Korean rescuers were joined by US navy vessels and divers.The North Korean military warned the US and the south against engaging in \"psychological warfare\" by letting journalists into the demilitarised zone dividing the peninsula.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency said Kim Dong-un was dismissed because he had been blacklisted by so many foreign governments, including the EU in December, leaving him unable to travel on behalf of Room 39's legal companies. He has been replaced by his deputy, Jon Il-chun, Yonhap said, citing an unidentified source.Housed in an unremarkable government compound in Pyongyang, Room 39 oversees 120 companies and mines, accounting for a quarter of all North Korean trade and employing 50,000 people, according to Lim Soo-ho, a research fellow at the Samsung Economic Research Institute. He said Kim's dismissal may be part of attempts to get around international sanctions.While its inner workings remain a mystery to all but its occupants and the family they serve, Room 39's role in enabling the regime to survive even in times of widespread famine and international pressure, has come under greater scrutiny since the imposition last year of tough UN sanctions over its nuclear programme.At the time Lim Eul-chul, an expert on North Korea at Kyungnam University in Seoul, told the Associated Press that new UN sanctions would be \"very, very effective and have a big impact on North Korea's secret funds.\"He said money generated by the bureau was \"a very useful tool to control high-ranking officials in the party, the cabinet and the military,\" whose loyalty had been secured with gifts such as luxury cars.Some of the money generated by Room 39 is used to buy the loyalty of senior party officials, a role that may take on greater prominence as Kim Jong-il, who suffered a stroke in 2008, prepares to hand over power to his third son, Kim Jong-un. Analysts have estimated that illegal activities account for up to 40% of all North Korean trade and an even higher share of total cash earnings.Bruce Klingner, a former Korea analyst for the CIA who is currently at the Heritage Foundation, said: \"North Korea is is heavily isolated so it uses whatever means necessary to make money.

As commander of the 4th air defence missile unit, Taniguchi is on the front line of Japan's much downplayed but scarily real, ongoing stand-off with North Korea, one of several potential conflicts in a rough neighbourhood.Japanese politicians and their US military allies tend to soft-pedal problems with Pyongyang, stressing the need to resume the diplomatic process broken off last year. But no one at Iruma has forgotten the moment last April when North Korea lofted a TaepoDong-2 long range ballistic missile over Japan, sending it crashing into the Pacific \u2013 or the North's second nuclear test explosion the following month.\"If an enemy dares to attack us, that's lucky for us,\" an unsmiling Taniguchi said. \"Once they are within range, it is our opportunity, not theirs.\"Taniguchi's confidence in Japan's ability to defend itself rests on the weapons under his command \u2013 an American designed, Japanese built Patriot PAC-3 missile battery, attached to one of the six ballistic missile defence (BMD) groups girdling the country since 2007.The innocuous-looking, green-painted oblong canisters contain four Patriot missiles each. Mounted on trucks, pointing skywards, and electronically linked to six naval destroyers equipped with Aegis phased array radar, they mark the Japan Self-Defence Force's first foray into BMD. The full deployment will be completed this year.This is the type of defensive missile system the Obama administration plans to introduce in eastern Europe. It is also similar to the missiles the US has controversially agreed to sell to Taiwan, to help counter the growing threat from China.Under Article 9 of its postwar constitution, Japan renounced \"forever\" the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. But the 1960 US-Japan security treaty made clear that Tokyo has a right to self-defence.Since then, and with accelerating speed since the 9/11 attacks, Japan's defence and security activities have expanded. While still essentially defensive in nature, they include international peacekeeping operations, logistical and financial support in Afghanistan, emphasis on strengthened bilateral and multilateral regional alliances, overseas disaster relief, anti-piracy and coastguard operations, and a pro-active overseas development programme.Defence ministry officials and analysts in Tokyo suggest three factors are driving this evolution. One is a host of regional threats and potential flashpoints. They include territorial disputes with China, Russia and South Korea; China's rapid military build-up (its defence spending is rising in double digits each year); its aggressive oil exploration activities in the East China Sea; and North Korea's unpredictable behaviour.\"The environment that we face is harsh and difficult and this is making us feel that we may have to be more self-reliant,\" said a senior defence ministry official. \"On the other hand, this makes it all the more important to solidify our alliance with the US.\"The second factor fuelling Japanese insecurity, however, is growing doubt about that very alliance. A simmering row over relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base in Okinawa, US troop drawdowns in east Asia, revived concerns about the dependability of the US \"nuclear umbrella\" and the general perception that US global predominance is weakening in the new \"Chinese century\" all suggest Japan must do more to look after itself.This thinking is reflected, thirdly, in Japan's domestic politics, which remain in flux after last autumn's watershed defeat of the conservative Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the war, by the centre-left Democratic party.Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's emphasis on east Asian communal \"fraternity\" and a \"more equal\", balanced relationship with the US has put noses out of joint in Washington but appears to have struck a chord with Japanese voters. Upper House elections in July could further embolden the Democrats. Meanwhile, entrenched economic difficulties are also spurring un-Japanese talk of radical solutions.Such problems are for the politicians to sort out. At Iruma air base, Major Taniguchi sticks to the basics, and he draws an unexpected parallel. When it comes to air defence, the RAF's triumph in the Battle of Britain in 1940 is his inspiration, he says.

Some believe the death toll was more than 1 million, and even now the country remains heavily dependent on food aid.The North Korean media reported that the census showed a population increase of almost 3 million over 15 years, taking the total to just over 24 million.According to the US state department, the country's army has been estimated to comprise 1.2 million. But the study puts the number of people working for the government or military at about 700,000.Agriculture, forestry and fishing employ 36% of the workforce \u2013 with slightly more than half of those in the sector being women \u2013 while manufacturing employs another 24% despite struggles to maintain the country's once-thriving industrial base.One in every seven men over 16 had finished a university education, according to the census, while only one in 12 women enjoyed the same advantage.The document was first highlighted in the North Korean Economy Watch blog.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Population", "World news", "Infant and child mortality", "Global development"], "title": "North Korea life expectancy falls, census reveals"},{"date": "2010-02-14T00:05:40Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The strangest of all the very strange things about the strangest place on earth, North Korea, is that it's surprisingly easy to go there. Or at least, not as hard as it somehow ought to be. I'd always thought that it was only marginally less difficult than going to the moon or, say, Eton, but my amazing revelation is this: type \"North Korea\" and \"tourism\" into Google, and you'll find Koryo Tours, a British-run, Beijing-based travel firm. A couple of clicks and a certain amount of cash later, and you, too, could find yourself on a vintage Russian jetliner heading towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It's impossibly exciting. And when Paul, the Australian sitting next to me, remarks, casually, that Air Koryo is considered unairworthy by the EU, it becomes, perhaps, just a little too exciting. But then some rousing martial music strikes up over a crackling intercom, and air stewardesses wearing what looks like jet-age vintage \u2013 white gloves, natty hats, red lipstick \u2013 bring around the in-flight reading material: the Pyongyang Times. The highlight of a recent firework spectacular, I learn, was a sky-writing display that read \"Down With Imperialism\", although the top story concerns a visit by Kim Jong Il to the new September 26 Breeding Pig Farm. \"The country's economy is growing remarkably through a series of big events in the flame of the new revolutionary upsurge,\" he notes.But then the flame of revolutionary upsurge is burning strongly among us, too. There are 21 of us, from all parts of the globe, most of us reasonably well-travelled, with the exception of Dan, a twentysomething Canadian, who has selected North Korea for his first ever trip abroad. (\"No, Dan,\" I hear someone say, possibly myself. \"In other countries, you are allowed to leave your hotel without being officially accompanied by a government guide.\"). And we're all as excited as puppies.Because barely 1,500 people a year visit North Korea. Or, to put this in context, several thousand fewer than make it to the British Lawnmower Museum. Collectively, we know more about a strimmer once owned by Joe Pasquale than we do about the nation that last May announced it had carried out a second successful underground nuclear test. And as we land on an empty runway, and walk into an empty terminal, it feels like not unlike entering a fold in the space-time continuum. Not least because our mobile phones are immediately confiscated. The investment bankers in the group (we have three of them, two of whom have been recently made redundant \u2013 there's obviously something about having experienced the distintegrating edge of capitalism that makes North Korea an attractive holiday destination) look like they might cry.And yet, for what the West calls a rogue state, and George Bush the most easterly point on the axis of evil, it doesn't seem very evil. It takes a while to clear customs, not because our belongings are searched or we're interrogated about the purpose of our visit, but because, as becomes clear when we see the luggage carousel, we're the only passengers who've failed to pack at least two flat-screen TVs. And when we finally meet our guides by the departures board (there are none until three days' time), they're smiling expansively: an older man, Mr Lee, and a pretty young woman in a fashionable coat, Miss Kim.We trundle along empty roads towards Pyongyang, a \"model\" city of Soviet-style blocks and grandiose boulevards where only citizens with special permits can live or even visit. Miss Kim tells us the name means \"flat land\", and \"the weather is neither too hot nor too cold with adequate precipitation\". It's just getting dark when we reach our hotel, the 47-storey, 1,001 room, Yanggakdo, built on an island in the middle of the Taedong river. There are perhaps three or four rooms with lights on. But then this is more than in most of the apartment blocks we pass because, of all the things that North Korea is short of, it's most short of electricity. There's a famous satellite shot of the Korean peninsula at night, a dark puddle in a sea of light. Our hotel has electricity, but by 10pm, from the magnificent revolving restaurant, the city simply vanishes from view. Poof! Like a cheap trick in a pantomime. Now you see it, now you don't, although it's there again next morning, shimmering in the crisp winter light.The upside of having no electricity is that because there's very little industry, there's very little pollution, and as we travel south out of Pyongyang, towards the Demilitarised Zone, almost no traffic. It's a four-lane highway, the key route south. With no cars. We stop at a roadside service station and are mesmerised by the lack of traffic: a bicycle passes. And some time after that, a unit of soldiers marches past in what was meant to be the fast lane. Because if you want to go somewhere in the DPRK, you walk. Everywhere, criss-crossing the countryside, across fields and dirt roads, people are walking. Who knows where they're going? I scrape the ice off the inside of the bus window and peer out but the North Korean hinterland is an unknown, mysterious place. We know almost as little about North Korea as the North Koreans know of us.This state of affairs isn't helped by the fact that journalists are banned. The last two to enter the country illegally were imprisoned until Bill Clinton intervened last year and negotiated their release. I have special, rare dispensation as a travel writer because Nick Bonner, the founder of Koryo Tours, believes that the more the world engages with North Korea, the more North Korea will engage with the world. And because I've agreed in advance that I shan't write about North Korea's human rights record or in any way insult the Dear Leader. It's strongly impressed on all of us before we leave that if we misbehave, it's not us but our guides who'll bear the brunt of any \"repercussions\".I've been allowed in as \"a travel consultant\" and in this capacity I'm happy to report that visiting North Korea is surely one of the greatest holidays on earth. You will see only what everyone else who goes to North Korea sees: which is what the North Korean government wants you to see. In this, it reminds me of Hello! magazine. I've always marvelled at how celebrities, given editorial control, choose to portray themselves. And so it is with North Korea. You may not get to see the \"real\" North Korea, but this \"unreal\" North Korea is a fascinating thing in and of itself. Because this is tourism at its most perfected. It's like a cruise ship. Every minute of every day has been pre-formulated and it's beautifully worked out: from the \u20ac5 charge if you want to try the national speciality, dog soup, to the man with a video camera who follows our every move, and at the end of the tour produces a DVD of our visit set to martial victory music, and sells it back to us for \u20ac40 a pop.What you get a sense of, most acutely, is the country's extreme isolation and paranoia, although after a few days in the country, it doesn't seem as paranoid as all that. \"After President Bush named us as the axis of evil, he attacked first Afghanistan, then Iraq. Are we next?\"The relationship with the US affects everything: it fuels juche, the ideology of self-reliance, and its strategy of songun, putting the military first, and explains everything from the lack of electricity to the \"Arduous March\", the famine in the late 90s when up to two million people died. It's not as bad as then, but the World Food Programme estimates a third of the population will go hungry this year without emergency aid. Our food, on the other hand, is plentiful and not bad. Even the dog soup is pretty good (half of us reckon it tastes like lamb; the other half, beef).The highlight of the trip is a visit to Kim Il-sung's mausoleum, an encounter that must qualify as the greatest touristic experience on earth. (The \"International Friendship Exhibition\" in Mount Myohyang-san runs a close second. It displays the 223,579 gifts given to Kim Il-sung, including a stuffed crocodile in bow tie and waistcoat serving drinks, presented by the Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua, and a Tolpuddle Martyrs plate from the British parliamentary Labour party.)We're in our smartest clothes. Miss Kim lines us up in rows of four and we march solemnly through a security scanner and on to a travelator that spans an endless marble corridor until we reach the inner sanctum, where we form two perfect rows, take three steps forward on Miss Kim's command, and bow to a statue of Kim Il-sung, march down more marble corridors, through a wind tunnel (to shake the dust from our clothes), and into a darkened room holding the embalmed body of Kim Il-sung himself. Here we form six rows and step forward three steps at a time, to bow solemnly, not once, but three times, from three different directions.Even then it's not over: in another marble chamber is an audio guide to the nation's reaction when the Great Leader died. \"All people were rending their hearts! And weeping scalding tears that as they hit the ground fossilised and became glittering pieces of stone! It was as if the earth itself had died!\"Outside afterwards, groups of Korean women line up to have their photographs taken in front of the palace, and we watch as more than one brushes tears from her eyes. Kim Il-sung was the father of the nation; in fact, he still is, described in the constitution as the \"eternal president\", and this emotion isn't faked.The trouble with North Korea, says Hannah, one of our English guides, is that people tend to see what they want to see. The Chinese see China; the Russians, Russia; Ferenc, a Hungarian in our group, sees a little bit of Hungary \u2013 like the pupils in the June 9 Middle School we visit, he wore the red scarf of the Young Pioneers when he was a boy. \"My parents couldn't believe I was coming here,\" he says. \"They were horrified.\"Dan, the Canadian, sees \"Abroad\". (And it scares the shit out of him. I'm not sure he'll ever leave Winnipeg again.) And Peter, the 74-year-old Australian in our group, sees a battleground. I'm standing next to him when he lifts his trouser leg to show Miss Kim his bullet wounds: \"That's where you buggers tried to kill me,\" he says. \"Although, in fairness, I was trying to kill you lot at the time.\" He's the first Korean War veteran from \"the other side\" that Miss Kim and Mr Lee have met, and it's genuinely touching what a fuss they make of him. They pay out of their own money to upgrade him on the train on the return trip so that he's more comfortable.It's a remarkable journey: like travelling through a Constable painting. There are oxen pulling carts, farmers unloading a haywain, children playing with a wooden hoop. It's so strangely innocent: a landscape that could be from any time within the last three centuries. It's four hours before I see the first car, and some time after that, we approach the border, where a charmless customs officer systematically goes through my camera and deletes half my photos. Beyond the Yalu river we see the towers of Dandong, a small provincial Chinese city that looks like a crazy modern metropolis. How can buildings be so tall and shiny, I wonder.But then if there's one thing that going to North Korea teaches you, it's that everything, all of life, is just perspective.Koryo Tours (koryogroup.com) is the leading operator of tours of North Korea and runs trips starting from \u00a3868, including return travel to Beijing, visa support and all meals.

Pyongyang's state media have made no mention of the incident.\"North Korea may have intentionally floated underwater mines to inflict damage on us,\" the minister, Kim Tae-young, said, according to Associated Press.The Seoul-based news agency Yonhap said he told MPs that a device \"could have drifted into our area\", pointing out that the north planted 3,000 Soviet-made mines in the sea during the 1950-53 Korean war.\"Though many sea mines were removed, it must have been impossible to retrieve them 100% ... One was found in 1959, and another was removed in 1984,\" he said.Kim added: \"Neither the government nor the defence ministry has ever said that there was no possibility of North Korea's involvement.\"Others had suggested one of the south's own mines could be responsible, but the minister said there were none near the Yellow Sea.Officials also ruled out the possibility of a torpedo attack, citing evidence from the ship's radar operators. They had earlier said that there was no evidence of North Korean military activity in the area at the time of the explosion.The 1,200-tonne Cheonan split in two within minutes of a blast in the rear hull. It was patrolling the Yellow Sea near Baengnyeong, where several gun battles have taken place between North and South Korean vessels in recent years. But an attack of this kind would be a major escalation of tensions on the peninsula and would anger the US and China.The South Korean paper Chosun Ilbo quoted experts who cited a range of possible causes. Yoon Yeon, a former commander of naval operations, said an internal explosion could not have caused the disaster, saying that fuses and explosive material would be stored separately in facilities with double or triple locks.But Baek Seung-joo of the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses disagreed, saying: \"If a single torpedo or a floating mine caused a naval patrol vessel to split in half and sink, we will have to rewrite our military doctrine.\"One expert suggested the shock from an external explosion could have triggered a second blast inside the ship.Fifty-eight sailors were rescued, but military officials fear the others were trapped within the rear segment of the ship, now resting 40 metres under water.Officials said that divers rapped on the stern with hammers yesterday but heard no response.President Lee Myung-bak said rescuers should not give up hope of finding more survivors, according to a statement released by the presidential Blue House.Divers were unable to gain access to the rear half of the 88-metre vessel until yesterday due to rough seas at the weekend. South Korean rescuers were joined by US navy vessels and divers.The North Korean military warned the US and the south against engaging in \"psychological warfare\" by letting journalists into the demilitarised zone dividing the peninsula.

But according to defectors, most of its energy goes into drug-trafficking, sales of weapons and missile technology, and the production of counterfeit US dollar bills.Today, it was reported the department's head \u2013 Kim Jong-il's personal finance manager \u2013 has been sacked, possibly in response to international action against the alleged illegal moneymaking. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said Kim Dong-un was dismissed because he had been blacklisted by so many foreign governments, including the EU in December, leaving him unable to travel on behalf of Room 39's legal companies. He has been replaced by his deputy, Jon Il-chun, Yonhap said, citing an unidentified source.Housed in an unremarkable government compound in Pyongyang, Room 39 oversees 120 companies and mines, accounting for a quarter of all North Korean trade and employing 50,000 people, according to Lim Soo-ho, a research fellow at the Samsung Economic Research Institute. He said Kim's dismissal may be part of attempts to get around international sanctions.While its inner workings remain a mystery to all but its occupants and the family they serve, Room 39's role in enabling the regime to survive even in times of widespread famine and international pressure, has come under greater scrutiny since the imposition last year of tough UN sanctions over its nuclear programme.At the time Lim Eul-chul, an expert on North Korea at Kyungnam University in Seoul, told the Associated Press that new UN sanctions would be \"very, very effective and have a big impact on North Korea's secret funds.\"He said money generated by the bureau was \"a very useful tool to control high-ranking officials in the party, the cabinet and the military,\" whose loyalty had been secured with gifts such as luxury cars.Some of the money generated by Room 39 is used to buy the loyalty of senior party officials, a role that may take on greater prominence as Kim Jong-il, who suffered a stroke in 2008, prepares to hand over power to his third son, Kim Jong-un. Analysts have estimated that illegal activities account for up to 40% of all North Korean trade and an even higher share of total cash earnings.Bruce Klingner, a former Korea analyst for the CIA who is currently at the Heritage Foundation, said: \"North Korea is is heavily isolated so it uses whatever means necessary to make money. Room 39 is Kim Jong il's personal banker. It has bank accounts overseas, it is involved in money laundering and other nefarious activities.\"The UN sanctions ban North Korea from exporting arms, call for the freezing of assets, and forbid travel abroad for companies and individuals involved in nuclear and weapons programmes.North Korea is under mounting pressure to end its boycott of nuclear disarmament talks.North Korea wants the US to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War and lift sanctions, as preconditions to returning to the six-party talks it abandoned last year.But the assistant US secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, said this week that sanctions would only be eased if the North returned to the talks and honoured promises to dismantle its nuclear programme.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Nuclear weapons", "United Nations", "Arms trade", "Drugs trade", "World news", "South Korea"], "title": "North Korea sacks Kim Jong-il's financier after sanctions"},{"date": "2010-01-27T07:35:58Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea has confirmed it fired artillery near its disputed sea border with South Korea this morning and said it would continue with its military exercises.It had earlier designated no-sail zones in the zone, off its western coast. The statement from the general staff of the Korean People's Army said that such drills \"will go on in the same waters in the future, too\".Earlier, Seoul's joint chiefs of staff said the north had fired approximately 30 rounds of land-based artillery, prompting the south to fire around 100 warning shots from a base on an island nearby. An officer said the north's shots landed on its own side of the border, while the south fired into the air. No casualties or damage were reported.A brief skirmish along the line in November is believed to have left one North Korean sailor dead and three others wounded.

Incidents such as this are a way for it to show that it can control how and when there is any progress.\"Pyongyang has said a precondition for returning to the talks would be discussions on a peace deal with the United States to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war, which concluded with an armistice, but not a treaty.

As commander of the 4th air defence missile unit, Taniguchi is on the front line of Japan's much downplayed but scarily real, ongoing stand-off with North Korea, one of several potential conflicts in a rough neighbourhood.Japanese politicians and their US military allies tend to soft-pedal problems with Pyongyang, stressing the need to resume the diplomatic process broken off last year. But no one at Iruma has forgotten the moment last April when North Korea lofted a TaepoDong-2 long range ballistic missile over Japan, sending it crashing into the Pacific \u2013 or the North's second nuclear test explosion the following month.\"If an enemy dares to attack us, that's lucky for us,\" an unsmiling Taniguchi said. \"Once they are within range, it is our opportunity, not theirs.\"Taniguchi's confidence in Japan's ability to defend itself rests on the weapons under his command \u2013 an American designed, Japanese built Patriot PAC-3 missile battery, attached to one of the six ballistic missile defence (BMD) groups girdling the country since 2007.The innocuous-looking, green-painted oblong canisters contain four Patriot missiles each. Mounted on trucks, pointing skywards, and electronically linked to six naval destroyers equipped with Aegis phased array radar, they mark the Japan Self-Defence Force's first foray into BMD. The full deployment will be completed this year.This is the type of defensive missile system the Obama administration plans to introduce in eastern Europe. It is also similar to the missiles the US has controversially agreed to sell to Taiwan, to help counter the growing threat from China.Under Article 9 of its postwar constitution, Japan renounced \"forever\" the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. But the 1960 US-Japan security treaty made clear that Tokyo has a right to self-defence.Since then, and with accelerating speed since the 9/11 attacks, Japan's defence and security activities have expanded. While still essentially defensive in nature, they include international peacekeeping operations, logistical and financial support in Afghanistan, emphasis on strengthened bilateral and multilateral regional alliances, overseas disaster relief, anti-piracy and coastguard operations, and a pro-active overseas development programme.Defence ministry officials and analysts in Tokyo suggest three factors are driving this evolution. One is a host of regional threats and potential flashpoints. They include territorial disputes with China, Russia and South Korea; China's rapid military build-up (its defence spending is rising in double digits each year); its aggressive oil exploration activities in the East China Sea; and North Korea's unpredictable behaviour.\"The environment that we face is harsh and difficult and this is making us feel that we may have to be more self-reliant,\" said a senior defence ministry official. \"On the other hand, this makes it all the more important to solidify our alliance with the US.\"The second factor fuelling Japanese insecurity, however, is growing doubt about that very alliance. A simmering row over relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base in Okinawa, US troop drawdowns in east Asia, revived concerns about the dependability of the US \"nuclear umbrella\" and the general perception that US global predominance is weakening in the new \"Chinese century\" all suggest Japan must do more to look after itself.This thinking is reflected, thirdly, in Japan's domestic politics, which remain in flux after last autumn's watershed defeat of the conservative Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the war, by the centre-left Democratic party.Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's emphasis on east Asian communal \"fraternity\" and a \"more equal\", balanced relationship with the US has put noses out of joint in Washington but appears to have struck a chord with Japanese voters. Upper House elections in July could further embolden the Democrats. Meanwhile, entrenched economic difficulties are also spurring un-Japanese talk of radical solutions.Such problems are for the politicians to sort out. At Iruma air base, Major Taniguchi sticks to the basics, and he draws an unexpected parallel.

The \u00adfigures have been published by the United Nations' statistical division, but were compiled by the North Korean government, said the UN's PopulationFund, which helped with the survey and sent five teams to monitor the work.In the 15 years since the previous census, life expectancy dropped by 3.4 years, with men living to only 65.6 and women to only 72.7 years on average.Infant mortality rose, from 14 deaths in 1,000 live births to 19, while maternal mortality rose by about 30%, to 77 maternal deaths in 100,000 live births.The period between the two studies included the devastating mid-90s famine estimated to have killed at least 600,000 North Koreans. Some believe the death toll was more than 1 million, and even now the country remains heavily dependent on food aid.The North Korean media reported that the census showed a population increase of almost 3 million over 15 years, taking the total to just over 24 million.According to the US state department, the country's army has been estimated to comprise 1.2 million. But the study puts the number of people working for the government or military at about 700,000.Agriculture, forestry and fishing employ 36% of the workforce \u2013 with slightly more than half of those in the sector being women \u2013 while manufacturing employs another 24% despite struggles to maintain the country's once-thriving industrial base.One in every seven men over 16 had finished a university education, according to the census, while only one in 12 women enjoyed the same advantage.The document was first highlighted in the North Korean Economy Watch blog.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Population", "World news", "Infant and child mortality", "Global development"], "title": "North Korea life expectancy falls, census reveals"},{"date": "2010-02-14T00:05:40Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The strangest of all the very strange things about the strangest place on earth, North Korea, is that it's surprisingly easy to go there. Or at least, not as hard as it somehow ought to be. I'd always thought that it was only marginally less difficult than going to the moon or, say, Eton, but my amazing revelation is this: type \"North Korea\" and \"tourism\" into Google, and you'll find Koryo Tours, a British-run, Beijing-based travel firm. A couple of clicks and a certain amount of cash later, and you, too, could find yourself on a vintage Russian jetliner heading towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.It's impossibly exciting. And when Paul, the Australian sitting next to me, remarks, casually, that Air Koryo is considered unairworthy by the EU, it becomes, perhaps, just a little too exciting. But then some rousing martial music strikes up over a crackling intercom, and air stewardesses wearing what looks like jet-age vintage \u2013 white gloves, natty hats, red lipstick \u2013 bring around the in-flight reading material: the Pyongyang Times. The highlight of a recent firework spectacular, I learn, was a sky-writing display that read \"Down With Imperialism\", although the top story concerns a visit by Kim Jong Il to the new September 26 Breeding Pig Farm. \"The country's economy is growing remarkably through a series of big events in the flame of the new revolutionary upsurge,\" he notes.But then the flame of revolutionary upsurge is burning strongly among us, too. There are 21 of us, from all parts of the globe, most of us reasonably well-travelled, with the exception of Dan, a twentysomething Canadian, who has selected North Korea for his first ever trip abroad. (\"No, Dan,\" I hear someone say, possibly myself. \"In other countries, you are allowed to leave your hotel without being officially accompanied by a government guide.\"). And we're all as excited as puppies.Because barely 1,500 people a year visit North Korea. Or, to put this in context, several thousand fewer than make it to the British Lawnmower Museum. Collectively, we know more about a strimmer once owned by Joe Pasquale than we do about the nation that last May announced it had carried out a second successful underground nuclear test. And as we land on an empty runway, and walk into an empty terminal, it feels like not unlike entering a fold in the space-time continuum. Not least because our mobile phones are immediately confiscated. The investment bankers in the group (we have three of them, two of whom have been recently made redundant \u2013 there's obviously something about having experienced the distintegrating edge of capitalism that makes North Korea an attractive holiday destination) look like they might cry.And yet, for what the West calls a rogue state, and George Bush the most easterly point on the axis of evil, it doesn't seem very evil. It takes a while to clear customs, not because our belongings are searched or we're interrogated about the purpose of our visit, but because, as becomes clear when we see the luggage carousel, we're the only passengers who've failed to pack at least two flat-screen TVs. And when we finally meet our guides by the departures board (there are none until three days' time), they're smiling expansively: an older man, Mr Lee, and a pretty young woman in a fashionable coat, Miss Kim.We trundle along empty roads towards Pyongyang, a \"model\" city of Soviet-style blocks and grandiose boulevards where only citizens with special permits can live or even visit. Miss Kim tells us the name means \"flat land\", and \"the weather is neither too hot nor too cold with adequate precipitation\". It's just getting dark when we reach our hotel, the 47-storey, 1,001 room, Yanggakdo, built on an island in the middle of the Taedong river. There are perhaps three or four rooms with lights on. But then this is more than in most of the apartment blocks we pass because, of all the things that North Korea is short of, it's most short of electricity. There's a famous satellite shot of the Korean peninsula at night, a dark puddle in a sea of light. Our hotel has electricity, but by 10pm, from the magnificent revolving restaurant, the city simply vanishes from view. Poof! Like a cheap trick in a pantomime. Now you see it, now you don't, although it's there again next morning, shimmering in the crisp winter light.The upside of having no electricity is that because there's very little industry, there's very little pollution, and as we travel south out of Pyongyang, towards the Demilitarised Zone, almost no traffic. It's a four-lane highway, the key route south. With no cars. We stop at a roadside service station and are mesmerised by the lack of traffic: a bicycle passes. And some time after that, a unit of soldiers marches past in what was meant to be the fast lane. Because if you want to go somewhere in the DPRK, you walk. Everywhere, criss-crossing the countryside, across fields and dirt roads, people are walking. Who knows where they're going? I scrape the ice off the inside of the bus window and peer out but the North Korean hinterland is an unknown, mysterious place. We know almost as little about North Korea as the North Koreans know of us.This state of affairs isn't helped by the fact that journalists are banned. The last two to enter the country illegally were imprisoned until Bill Clinton intervened last year and negotiated their release. I have special, rare dispensation as a travel writer because Nick Bonner, the founder of Koryo Tours, believes that the more the world engages with North Korea, the more North Korea will engage with the world. And because I've agreed in advance that I shan't write about North Korea's human rights record or in any way insult the Dear Leader. It's strongly impressed on all of us before we leave that if we misbehave, it's not us but our guides who'll bear the brunt of any \"repercussions\".I've been allowed in as \"a travel consultant\" and in this capacity I'm happy to report that visiting North Korea is surely one of the greatest holidays on earth. You will see only what everyone else who goes to North Korea sees: which is what the North Korean government wants you to see. In this, it reminds me of Hello! magazine. I've always marvelled at how celebrities, given editorial control, choose to portray themselves. And so it is with North Korea. You may not get to see the \"real\" North Korea, but this \"unreal\" North Korea is a fascinating thing in and of itself. Because this is tourism at its most perfected. It's like a cruise ship. Every minute of every day has been pre-formulated and it's beautifully worked out: from the \u20ac5 charge if you want to try the national speciality, dog soup, to the man with a video camera who follows our every move, and at the end of the tour produces a DVD of our visit set to martial victory music, and sells it back to us for \u20ac40 a pop.What you get a sense of, most acutely, is the country's extreme isolation and paranoia, although after a few days in the country, it doesn't seem as paranoid as all that. \"After President Bush named us as the axis of evil, he attacked first Afghanistan, then Iraq. Are we next?\"The relationship with the US affects everything: it fuels juche, the ideology of self-reliance, and its strategy of songun, putting the military first, and explains everything from the lack of electricity to the \"Arduous March\", the famine in the late 90s when up to two million people died. It's not as bad as then, but the World Food Programme estimates a third of the population will go hungry this year without emergency aid. Our food, on the other hand, is plentiful and not bad. Even the dog soup is pretty good (half of us reckon it tastes like lamb; the other half, beef).The highlight of the trip is a visit to Kim Il-sung's mausoleum, an encounter that must qualify as the greatest touristic experience on earth. (The \"International Friendship Exhibition\" in Mount Myohyang-san runs a close second. It displays the 223,579 gifts given to Kim Il-sung, including a stuffed crocodile in bow tie and waistcoat serving drinks, presented by the Sandinista National Liberation Front of Nicaragua, and a Tolpuddle Martyrs plate from the British parliamentary Labour party.)We're in our smartest clothes. Miss Kim lines us up in rows of four and we march solemnly through a security scanner and on to a travelator that spans an endless marble corridor until we reach the inner sanctum, where we form two perfect rows, take three steps forward on Miss Kim's command, and bow to a statue of Kim Il-sung, march down more marble corridors, through a wind tunnel (to shake the dust from our clothes), and into a darkened room holding the embalmed body of Kim Il-sung himself. Here we form six rows and step forward three steps at a time, to bow solemnly, not once, but three times, from three different directions.Even then it's not over: in another marble chamber is an audio guide to the nation's reaction when the Great Leader died. \"All people were rending their hearts! And weeping scalding tears that as they hit the ground fossilised and became glittering pieces of stone! It was as if the earth itself had died!\"Outside afterwards, groups of Korean women line up to have their photographs taken in front of the palace, and we watch as more than one brushes tears from her eyes. Kim Il-sung was the father of the nation; in fact, he still is, described in the constitution as the \"eternal president\", and this emotion isn't faked.The trouble with North Korea, says Hannah, one of our English guides, is that people tend to see what they want to see. The Chinese see China; the Russians, Russia; Ferenc, a Hungarian in our group, sees a little bit of Hungary \u2013 like the pupils in the June 9 Middle School we visit, he wore the red scarf of the Young Pioneers when he was a boy. \"My parents couldn't believe I was coming here,\" he says. \"They were horrified.\"Dan, the Canadian, sees \"Abroad\". (And it scares the shit out of him. I'm not sure he'll ever leave Winnipeg again.) And Peter, the 74-year-old Australian in our group, sees a battleground. I'm standing next to him when he lifts his trouser leg to show Miss Kim his bullet wounds: \"That's where you buggers tried to kill me,\" he says. \"Although, in fairness, I was trying to kill you lot at the time.\" He's the first Korean War veteran from \"the other side\" that Miss Kim and Mr Lee have met, and it's genuinely touching what a fuss they make of him. They pay out of their own money to upgrade him on the train on the return trip so that he's more comfortable.It's a remarkable journey: like travelling through a Constable painting. There are oxen pulling carts, farmers unloading a haywain, children playing with a wooden hoop. It's so strangely innocent: a landscape that could be from any time within the last three centuries. It's four hours before I see the first car, and some time after that, we approach the border, where a charmless customs officer systematically goes through my camera and deletes half my photos. Beyond the Yalu river we see the towers of Dandong, a small provincial Chinese city that looks like a crazy modern metropolis. How can buildings be so tall and shiny, I wonder.But then if there's one thing that going to North Korea teaches you, it's that everything, all of life, is just perspective.Koryo Tours (koryogroup.com) is the leading operator of tours of North Korea and runs trips starting from \u00a3868, including return travel to Beijing, visa support and all meals.

Pyongyang's state media have made no mention of the incident.\"North Korea may have intentionally floated underwater mines to inflict damage on us,\" the minister, Kim Tae-young, said, according to Associated Press.The Seoul-based news agency Yonhap said he told MPs that a device \"could have drifted into our area\", pointing out that the north planted 3,000 Soviet-made mines in the sea during the 1950-53 Korean war.\"Though many sea mines were removed, it must have been impossible to retrieve them 100% ... One was found in 1959, and another was removed in 1984,\" he said.Kim added: \"Neither the government nor the defence ministry has ever said that there was no possibility of North Korea's involvement.\"Others had suggested one of the south's own mines could be responsible, but the minister said there were none near the Yellow Sea.Officials also ruled out the possibility of a torpedo attack, citing evidence from the ship's radar operators. They had earlier said that there was no evidence of North Korean military activity in the area at the time of the explosion.The 1,200-tonne Cheonan split in two within minutes of a blast in the rear hull. It was patrolling the Yellow Sea near Baengnyeong, where several gun battles have taken place between North and South Korean vessels in recent years. But an attack of this kind would be a major escalation of tensions on the peninsula and would anger the US and China.The South Korean paper Chosun Ilbo quoted experts who cited a range of possible causes. Yoon Yeon, a former commander of naval operations, said an internal explosion could not have caused the disaster, saying that fuses and explosive material would be stored separately in facilities with double or triple locks.But Baek Seung-joo of the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses disagreed, saying: \"If a single torpedo or a floating mine caused a naval patrol vessel to split in half and sink, we will have to rewrite our military doctrine.\"One expert suggested the shock from an external explosion could have triggered a second blast inside the ship.Fifty-eight sailors were rescued, but military officials fear the others were trapped within the rear segment of the ship, now resting 40 metres under water.Officials said that divers rapped on the stern with hammers yesterday but heard no response.President Lee Myung-bak said rescuers should not give up hope of finding more survivors, according to a statement released by the presidential Blue House.Divers were unable to gain access to the rear half of the 88-metre vessel until yesterday due to rough seas at the weekend. South Korean rescuers were joined by US navy vessels and divers.The North Korean military warned the US and the south against engaging in \"psychological warfare\" by letting journalists into the demilitarised zone dividing the peninsula.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency said Kim Dong-un was dismissed because he had been blacklisted by so many foreign governments, including the EU in December, leaving him unable to travel on behalf of Room 39's legal companies. He has been replaced by his deputy, Jon Il-chun, Yonhap said, citing an unidentified source.Housed in an unremarkable government compound in Pyongyang, Room 39 oversees 120 companies and mines, accounting for a quarter of all North Korean trade and employing 50,000 people, according to Lim Soo-ho, a research fellow at the Samsung Economic Research Institute. He said Kim's dismissal may be part of attempts to get around international sanctions.While its inner workings remain a mystery to all but its occupants and the family they serve, Room 39's role in enabling the regime to survive even in times of widespread famine and international pressure, has come under greater scrutiny since the imposition last year of tough UN sanctions over its nuclear programme.At the time Lim Eul-chul, an expert on North Korea at Kyungnam University in Seoul, told the Associated Press that new UN sanctions would be \"very, very effective and have a big impact on North Korea's secret funds.\"He said money generated by the bureau was \"a very useful tool to control high-ranking officials in the party, the cabinet and the military,\" whose loyalty had been secured with gifts such as luxury cars.Some of the money generated by Room 39 is used to buy the loyalty of senior party officials, a role that may take on greater prominence as Kim Jong-il, who suffered a stroke in 2008, prepares to hand over power to his third son, Kim Jong-un. Analysts have estimated that illegal activities account for up to 40% of all North Korean trade and an even higher share of total cash earnings.Bruce Klingner, a former Korea analyst for the CIA who is currently at the Heritage Foundation, said: \"North Korea is is heavily isolated so it uses whatever means necessary to make money.

An officer said the north's shots landed on its own side of the border, while the south fired into the air.

This would be a means for the North to re-enter six-party nuclear discussions involving the two Koreas, the US, China, Japan and Russia.\"If confidence is to be built between [North Korea] and the US, it is essential to conclude a peace treaty for terminating the state of war, a root cause of the hostile relations, to begin with,\" the official Korean Central News Agency quoted the foreign ministry as saying.\"The removal of the barrier of such discrimination and distrust as sanctions may soon lead to the opening of the six-party talks.\"North Korea has boycotted the talks since April last year, shortly before it prompted grave international concern by announcing it had carried out a nuclear test. Before this, Pyongyang had begun to disable nuclear facilities in return for overseas aid.There will be widespread mistrust in the US and elsewhere about North Korea's motives for making this offer.

Yesterday's report by a team of international investigators said the evidence pointed overwhelmingly to the conclusion that a torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine. But the question of why Seoul's corvette was sunk is harder to answer. Shooting a tourist or loosing off a few rounds counts as one order of incident on the world's most trigger-happy border. But sinking a warship is an act of war in anyone's book, and South Korea is no different.Why do it? North Korea had achieved its immediate objectives last year by conducting a second nuclear test and firing off a round of missiles. No less a figure than Bill Clinton arrived in Pyongyang to collect two detained US journalists, who were duly pardoned and released. What the White House styled as a private humanitarian mission soon opened the door to more official contacts. A US special envoy, Stephen Bosworth, was next to arrive with a private letter from Barack Obama to Kim Jong-il. The US has insisted that North Korea return to the six-nation talks and has refused to lift sanctions (the most punitive available) merely as a reward for coming back to the negotiating table. Nonetheless, the regime's mouthpiece, the Korean Central News Agency, had rare warm words for the Washington envoy's visit, a sign that it values letters from US presidents, whatever their contents. The two sides deepened the mutual understanding, the KCNA said, and found \"not a few\" common points.Pyongyang had got its nemesis to talk directly to it. This is quite some achievement for a poor and struggling country. America is seen in Pyongyang not just as the root of all evil but as the raison d'etre for everything the reclusive regime does \u2013 from its ideology of self-reliance to its strategy of militarisation.

No peace treaty was signed after their three-year conflict which ended in an armistice in 1953. The border dividing the peninsula is one of the most heavily militarised in the world.North Korea has a million-strong army and enough plutonium for six to eight nuclear weapons, according to US experts. It says it is now enriching uranium, an alternative ingredient for nuclear bombs.However, it has yet to develop the technology to place a nuclear weapon on a missile and, so far, its nuclear programme and missile tests are motivated by a policy of intimidation and defiance, analysts believe. North Korea last year test-fired a series of at least four surface-to-ship cruise missiles and Scud-type ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan.They were also seen as a response to the international community, including a UN resolution that any nation can inspect a North Korean vessel that the investigating nation believes is carrying weapons.On a more conventional level, in addition to its army of some million personnel, North Korea has nearly 190,000 \"security troops\", including border guards, and 3.5m \"worker/peasant red guard reservists\", according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) annual Military Balance.The army and air force has 620 combat aircraft, many of them old and of Soviet design. More significantly perhaps, in light of the sinking of the South Korean corvette, the Cheonan, North Korea is listed as having 43 submarines which are armed with torpedoes. It has only eight principal main naval surface boats.South Korea has an army of some 690,000 but 4.5m reservists, according to the IISS. It has 13 submarines, 10 destroyers and 490 combat aircraft, mainly of US design and more capable than North Korea's aircraft.

Yesterday's report by a team of international investigators said the evidence pointed overwhelmingly to the conclusion that a torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine. But the question of why Seoul's corvette was sunk is harder to answer. Shooting a tourist or loosing off a few rounds counts as one order of incident on the world's most trigger-happy border. But sinking a warship is an act of war in anyone's book, and South Korea is no different.Why do it? North Korea had achieved its immediate objectives last year by conducting a second nuclear test and firing off a round of missiles. No less a figure than Bill Clinton arrived in Pyongyang to collect two detained US journalists, who were duly pardoned and released. What the White House styled as a private humanitarian mission soon opened the door to more official contacts. A US special envoy, Stephen Bosworth, was next to arrive with a private letter from Barack Obama to Kim Jong-il. The US has insisted that North Korea return to the six-nation talks and has refused to lift sanctions (the most punitive available) merely as a reward for coming back to the negotiating table. Nonetheless, the regime's mouthpiece, the Korean Central News Agency, had rare warm words for the Washington envoy's visit, a sign that it values letters from US presidents, whatever their contents. The two sides deepened the mutual understanding, the KCNA said, and found \"not a few\" common points.Pyongyang had got its nemesis to talk directly to it. This is quite some achievement for a poor and struggling country. America is seen in Pyongyang not just as the root of all evil but as the raison d'etre for everything the reclusive regime does \u2013 from its ideology of self-reliance to its strategy of militarisation. What advantage lay in torpedoing what were bilateral talks in all but name, just as they had got underway? There are no obvious answers to that. Of the two possibilities \u2013 that the ship was sunk on the direct orders of Kim Jong-il, or that it was an act of insubordination by a rogue or rival commander \u2013 the second is a more worrying possibility.Initial reaction has been muted. On the eve of the departure of one of the largest groups of cabinet officials the US state department has ever taken to China, the last thing Hillary Clinton wants is an open split with Beijing over North Korea.

Now that Kim Jong-il is finally getting the international attention he has craved, the enigmatic leader is rolling the drums of war as Washington steps into the fray.But President Obama could be walking into the very minefield he has warned against in the past. The same Obama who railed against his predecessor George Bush's \"unwise\" war in Iraq for wasting US military resources and distracting troops from catching Osama bin Laden, is now helping escalate tensions against North Korea. With Iraq nowhere near a done deal and the war in Afghanistan gaining steam, the president is nonetheless backing moves that could lead to the type of \"dumb war\" he foreshadowed in 2002, with undetermined length, cost and consequences.The grim prospect of nuclear war is rearing its ugly head amid growing outrage over the North's alleged sinking of a South Korean naval ship two months ago. Obama threw his full, \"unequivocal\" support behind Seoul, directing military commanders to link up closely with South Korean counterparts to \"ensure readiness and to deter future aggression\".Just as top US diplomat Hillary Clinton toured the region and spoke of a \"highly precarious\" situation, the Pentagon and South Korea announced plans for joint naval exercises to take place soon in a powerful show of force that would include anti-submarine drills in the Yellow Sea.Ratcheting up the pressure further, South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, is redesignating the North as his country's \"principal enemy\" for the first time since their detente in 2004, cutting off trade ties, denying the North's access to shipping lanes and urging punitive UN measures for the sinking of the Cheonan that killed 46 sailors on March 26.

The loss of 46 sailors when the ship sank in South Korean waters in the West (or Yellow) Sea caused much distress in South Korea, and immediately there were claims that Pyongyang was behind the attack. The government urged caution, reserving judgment until the remaining 58 crew members could be interviewed, the vessel had been raised, and the exact cause of the explosion that tore it apart had been established.This took time, especially as the government brought in foreign experts to take part in the investigation. During the investigation, the government indicated that there might have been a number of reasons for the explosion, such as an internal malfunction, that did not involve North Korea. A But as the end of the investigation drew near, such explanations slipped away, and leaks and hints pointed to a deliberate North Korean strike.The North kept silent at first, but as charges that it was involved grew louder, it issued a denial. Indeed, one of its regular apologists published an article in the Asia Times claiming that North Korea lacked the technology to mount such an attack and that the Cheonan was victim of a joint US-South Korean military exercise being conducted at the time. It was a scenario that was counter-productive, increasing the suspicion in many minds that the North was behind the attack. The North has now repeated its denial, insisting any attempt at retaliation would be an act of war. Since North Korea regularly rejects accusations and threatens to regard any action to restrict it as an act of war, this need not necessarily be taken at face value.Of course, tension could lead to some form of limited conflict. In the past, the demilitarised zone set up between North and South in the 1953 armistice agreement has seen deadly artillery duels between the two sides. The North over the years has mounted infiltration attempts against the South that have resulted in loss of life. In October 1983, 16 South Korean ministers and officials and one reporter died in Rangoon (Yangon) in a bomb attack on the then ROK president; three North Korean military officers were held responsible for the attack. In 1987, a Korean airliner exploded over the Andaman Sea, killing all 118 passengers and crew; again the attack was traced to North Korean agents. This incident led to the United States listing North Korea as a terrorist-sponsoring state.Neither are naval clashes in the West Sea between the two Koreas are no new development. Not only is there a disputed maritime boundary, dating back to the end of the Korean war in 1953, which the North has sometimes respected and sometimes ignored, but the area where the Cheonan sank has seen regular clashes between crab fishing fleets from the two countries. Chinese boats also fish these waters, and are regularly pursued by both Korean navies for illegal fishing. In exchanges of fire, the two navies have inflicted damage and a small number of sailors have been killed, but the attack on the Cheonan did not take place in a naval clash and it is hard to see what benefit it has for the North.Relations between the two Koreas have sharply deteriorated since South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's election in 2007. Lee rejected the \"engagement policies\" pursued by his predecessors, arguing that they had been expensive and brought no benefit to South Korea. This has led to a reduction in aid and restrictions on North-South contacts. Lee has also pursued a tougher line on the nuclear issue and human rights. While these may be galling for the North Koreans, killing 46 sailors does not seem the obvious way to effect a change of heart in Seoul.The dilemma is what to do next. Lee has promised \"resolute countermeasures\". Other international leaders have condemned the North and there is much talk of sanctions. But there is a need for care, and the options available are limited. North Korea is already subject to a sanctions regime and there are few options to add to it. China, the North's main international supporter, has been less than firm in its application of current sanctions and cautious in its response to the Cheonan report.Despite grievous provocations in the past, successive South Korean governments have ruled out military responses. Seoul is vulnerable to North Korean artillery, and there is always a risk that an attempted limited retaliation could get out of hand. Given that the signs are that North Korea is in the middle of some form of political upheaval arising from the illness that its leader, Kim Jong-il, suffered in 2008 and the related question of the succession, this might not be the best time to add to instability. International concern about the North's nuclear programmes remains high. In the end, one suspects that, after a period of international grandstanding, there will be little option but to seek to re-engage with North Korea as the only hope of modifying its behaviour.", "tags": ["World news", "South Korea", "North Korea"], "title": "Jim Hoare | Acts of war in North Korea"},{"date": "2010-05-20T23:05:09Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "There is little doubt about what sank a South Korean military ship with the loss of 46 lives in March, and still less about who did it.

But it conceded the North had found ways to circumvent sanctions using companies and individuals who are not subject to asset freezes and travel bans.The 47-page report contains a long list of sanctions violations reported by UN member states, including four cases of arms exports.Pyongyang, the panel said, had used \"a number of masking techniques,\" including falsely labelling the contents of shipping containers and giving inaccurate information about their origin and destination.North Korea was using \"multiple layers of intermediaries, shell companies and financial institutions\" to get around sanctions, it added.An unnamed western diplomat based at the UN said: \"The details in the report are not entirely surprising. Basically it suggests that North Korea has exported nuclear and missile technology with the aid of front companies, middlemen and other ruses.\"The report said the regime had tried to conceal arms exports by sending items in kit form to be built at their destination, and called on recipient countries of North Korean cargo to act with \"extra vigilance\".Pyongyang is also suspected of using overseas criminal groups to transport and distribute \"illicit and smuggled cargoes\", possibly including parts for weapons of mass destruction.In response to the sinking, South Korea froze trade with the North, resumed propaganda broadcasts across the border and announced joint naval exercises with the US.The North retaliated by severing ties with its neighbour, expelling South Korean officials from a joint industrial venture and banning the country's aircraft from its airspace. It also ditched an agreement designed to prevent naval clashes and threatened to attack any South Korean vessel entering its waters.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "South Korea", "China", "Japan", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea 'is exporting nuclear technology'"},{"date": "2010-05-20T20:30:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The report is in, and the evidence points overwhelmingly to an attack by a North Korean torpedo as the cause of the massive explosion that sunk the South\u00a0Korean vessel Cheonan on 26\u00a0March. The loss of 46 sailors when the ship sank in South Korean waters in the West (or Yellow) Sea caused much distress in South Korea, and immediately there were claims that Pyongyang was behind the attack. The government urged caution, reserving judgment until the remaining 58 crew members could be interviewed, the vessel had been raised, and the exact cause of the explosion that tore it apart had been established.This took time, especially as the government brought in foreign experts to take part in the investigation. During the investigation, the government indicated that there might have been a number of reasons for the explosion, such as an internal malfunction, that did not involve North Korea. A But as the end of the investigation drew near, such explanations slipped away, and leaks and hints pointed to a deliberate North Korean strike.The North kept silent at first, but as charges that it was involved grew louder, it issued a denial. Indeed, one of its regular apologists published an article in the Asia Times claiming that North Korea lacked the technology to mount such an attack and that the Cheonan was victim of a joint US-South Korean military exercise being conducted at the time. It was a scenario that was counter-productive, increasing the suspicion in many minds that the North was behind the attack. The North has now repeated its denial, insisting any attempt at retaliation would be an act of war. Since North Korea regularly rejects accusations and threatens to regard any action to restrict it as an act of war, this need not necessarily be taken at face value.Of course, tension could lead to some form of limited conflict. In the past, the demilitarised zone set up between North and South in the 1953 armistice agreement has seen deadly artillery duels between the two sides. The North over the years has mounted infiltration attempts against the South that have resulted in loss of life. In October 1983, 16 South Korean ministers and officials and one reporter died in Rangoon (Yangon) in a bomb attack on the then ROK president; three North Korean military officers were held responsible for the attack. In 1987, a Korean airliner exploded over the Andaman Sea, killing all 118 passengers and crew; again the attack was traced to North Korean agents. This incident led to the United States listing North Korea as a terrorist-sponsoring state.Neither are naval clashes in the West Sea between the two Koreas are no new development. Not only is there a disputed maritime boundary, dating back to the end of the Korean war in 1953, which the North has sometimes respected and sometimes ignored, but the area where the Cheonan sank has seen regular clashes between crab fishing fleets from the two countries. Chinese boats also fish these waters, and are regularly pursued by both Korean navies for illegal fishing. In exchanges of fire, the two navies have inflicted damage and a small number of sailors have been killed, but the attack on the Cheonan did not take place in a naval clash and it is hard to see what benefit it has for the North.Relations between the two Koreas have sharply deteriorated since South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's election in 2007. Lee rejected the \"engagement policies\" pursued by his predecessors, arguing that they had been expensive and brought no benefit to South Korea. This has led to a reduction in aid and restrictions on North-South contacts. Lee has also pursued a tougher line on the nuclear issue and human rights. While these may be galling for the North Koreans, killing 46 sailors does not seem the obvious way to effect a change of heart in Seoul.The dilemma is what to do next. Lee has promised \"resolute countermeasures\". Other international leaders have condemned the North and there is much talk of sanctions. But there is a need for care, and the options available are limited. North Korea is already subject to a sanctions regime and there are few options to add to it. China, the North's main international supporter, has been less than firm in its application of current sanctions and cautious in its response to the Cheonan report.Despite grievous provocations in the past, successive South Korean governments have ruled out military responses. Seoul is vulnerable to North Korean artillery, and there is always a risk that an attempted limited retaliation could get out of hand. Given that the signs are that North Korea is in the middle of some form of political upheaval arising from the illness that its leader, Kim Jong-il, suffered in 2008 and the related question of the succession, this might not be the best time to add to instability. International concern about the North's nuclear programmes remains high. In the end, one suspects that, after a period of international grandstanding, there will be little option but to seek to re-engage with North Korea as the only hope of modifying its behaviour.", "tags": ["World news", "South Korea", "North Korea"], "title": "Jim Hoare | Acts of war in North Korea"},{"date": "2010-05-12T18:28:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "It is the holy grail of clean energy: harnessing nuclear fusion to create unlimited power without also generating greenhouse gases and radioactive waste.For decades the dream has eluded the world's scientists, but today, North Korea claimed it had succeeded where many have failed, creating a successful nuclear fusion reaction.The official Korean Central News Agency said: \"The successful nuclear fusion by our scientists has made a definite breakthrough towards the development of new energy and opened up a new phase in the nation's development of the latest science and technology.\"But the extraordinary assertion, which would put the regime well ahead of its nuclear rivals in the west, was dismissed by scientists in South Korea.\"Nuclear fusion reaction is not something that can be done so simply,\" said Hyeon Park, a physics professor at Postech science and technology university.He said he believed North Korea had merely produced plasma, a preliminary step on the way to nuclear fusion.The KCNA said scientists had \"solved a great many scientific and technological problems entirely by their own efforts \u2026 thus succeeding in nuclear fusion reaction at last.\" Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the \"ingeniously\" developed technology \"represents a field of the latest science and technology for the development of new energy desired by humankind\".

Yesterday's report by a team of international investigators said the evidence pointed overwhelmingly to the conclusion that a torpedo was fired by a North Korean submarine. But the question of why Seoul's corvette was sunk is harder to answer. Shooting a tourist or loosing off a few rounds counts as one order of incident on the world's most trigger-happy border. But sinking a warship is an act of war in anyone's book, and South Korea is no different.Why do it? North Korea had achieved its immediate objectives last year by conducting a second nuclear test and firing off a round of missiles. No less a figure than Bill Clinton arrived in Pyongyang to collect two detained US journalists, who were duly pardoned and released. What the White House styled as a private humanitarian mission soon opened the door to more official contacts. A US special envoy, Stephen Bosworth, was next to arrive with a private letter from Barack Obama to Kim Jong-il. The US has insisted that North Korea return to the six-nation talks and has refused to lift sanctions (the most punitive available) merely as a reward for coming back to the negotiating table. Nonetheless, the regime's mouthpiece, the Korean Central News Agency, had rare warm words for the Washington envoy's visit, a sign that it values letters from US presidents, whatever their contents. The two sides deepened the mutual understanding, the KCNA said, and found \"not a few\" common points.Pyongyang had got its nemesis to talk directly to it. This is quite some achievement for a poor and struggling country. America is seen in Pyongyang not just as the root of all evil but as the raison d'etre for everything the reclusive regime does \u2013 from its ideology of self-reliance to its strategy of militarisation. What advantage lay in torpedoing what were bilateral talks in all but name, just as they had got underway? There are no obvious answers to that. Of the two possibilities \u2013 that the ship was sunk on the direct orders of Kim Jong-il, or that it was an act of insubordination by a rogue or rival commander \u2013 the second is a more worrying possibility.Initial reaction has been muted. On the eve of the departure of one of the largest groups of cabinet officials the US state department has ever taken to China, the last thing Hillary Clinton wants is an open split with Beijing over North Korea. The White House, in its statement, failed to address the issue of what further actions would be taken. Seoul talked of diplomatic rather than military action.

But it conceded the North had found ways to circumvent sanctions using companies and individuals who are not subject to asset freezes and travel bans.The 47-page report contains a long list of sanctions violations reported by UN member states, including four cases of arms exports.Pyongyang, the panel said, had used \"a number of masking techniques,\" including falsely labelling the contents of shipping containers and giving inaccurate information about their origin and destination.North Korea was using \"multiple layers of intermediaries, shell companies and financial institutions\" to get around sanctions, it added.An unnamed western diplomat based at the UN said: \"The details in the report are not entirely surprising. Basically it suggests that North Korea has exported nuclear and missile technology with the aid of front companies, middlemen and other ruses.\"The report said the regime had tried to conceal arms exports by sending items in kit form to be built at their destination, and called on recipient countries of North Korean cargo to act with \"extra vigilance\".Pyongyang is also suspected of using overseas criminal groups to transport and distribute \"illicit and smuggled cargoes\", possibly including parts for weapons of mass destruction.In response to the sinking, South Korea froze trade with the North, resumed propaganda broadcasts across the border and announced joint naval exercises with the US.The North retaliated by severing ties with its neighbour, expelling South Korean officials from a joint industrial venture and banning the country's aircraft from its airspace. It also ditched an agreement designed to prevent naval clashes and threatened to attack any South Korean vessel entering its waters.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "South Korea", "China", "Japan", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea 'is exporting nuclear technology'"},{"date": "2010-05-20T20:30:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The report is in, and the evidence points overwhelmingly to an attack by a North Korean torpedo as the cause of the massive explosion that sunk the South\u00a0Korean vessel Cheonan on 26\u00a0March. The loss of 46 sailors when the ship sank in South Korean waters in the West (or Yellow) Sea caused much distress in South Korea, and immediately there were claims that Pyongyang was behind the attack. The government urged caution, reserving judgment until the remaining 58 crew members could be interviewed, the vessel had been raised, and the exact cause of the explosion that tore it apart had been established.This took time, especially as the government brought in foreign experts to take part in the investigation. During the investigation, the government indicated that there might have been a number of reasons for the explosion, such as an internal malfunction, that did not involve North Korea. A But as the end of the investigation drew near, such explanations slipped away, and leaks and hints pointed to a deliberate North Korean strike.The North kept silent at first, but as charges that it was involved grew louder, it issued a denial. Indeed, one of its regular apologists published an article in the Asia Times claiming that North Korea lacked the technology to mount such an attack and that the Cheonan was victim of a joint US-South Korean military exercise being conducted at the time. It was a scenario that was counter-productive, increasing the suspicion in many minds that the North was behind the attack. The North has now repeated its denial, insisting any attempt at retaliation would be an act of war. Since North Korea regularly rejects accusations and threatens to regard any action to restrict it as an act of war, this need not necessarily be taken at face value.Of course, tension could lead to some form of limited conflict. In the past, the demilitarised zone set up between North and South in the 1953 armistice agreement has seen deadly artillery duels between the two sides. The North over the years has mounted infiltration attempts against the South that have resulted in loss of life. In October 1983, 16 South Korean ministers and officials and one reporter died in Rangoon (Yangon) in a bomb attack on the then ROK president; three North Korean military officers were held responsible for the attack. In 1987, a Korean airliner exploded over the Andaman Sea, killing all 118 passengers and crew; again the attack was traced to North Korean agents. This incident led to the United States listing North Korea as a terrorist-sponsoring state.Neither are naval clashes in the West Sea between the two Koreas are no new development. Not only is there a disputed maritime boundary, dating back to the end of the Korean war in 1953, which the North has sometimes respected and sometimes ignored, but the area where the Cheonan sank has seen regular clashes between crab fishing fleets from the two countries. Chinese boats also fish these waters, and are regularly pursued by both Korean navies for illegal fishing. In exchanges of fire, the two navies have inflicted damage and a small number of sailors have been killed, but the attack on the Cheonan did not take place in a naval clash and it is hard to see what benefit it has for the North.Relations between the two Koreas have sharply deteriorated since South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's election in 2007. Lee rejected the \"engagement policies\" pursued by his predecessors, arguing that they had been expensive and brought no benefit to South Korea. This has led to a reduction in aid and restrictions on North-South contacts. Lee has also pursued a tougher line on the nuclear issue and human rights. While these may be galling for the North Koreans, killing 46 sailors does not seem the obvious way to effect a change of heart in Seoul.The dilemma is what to do next. Lee has promised \"resolute countermeasures\". Other international leaders have condemned the North and there is much talk of sanctions. But there is a need for care, and the options available are limited. North Korea is already subject to a sanctions regime and there are few options to add to it. China, the North's main international supporter, has been less than firm in its application of current sanctions and cautious in its response to the Cheonan report.Despite grievous provocations in the past, successive South Korean governments have ruled out military responses. Seoul is vulnerable to North Korean artillery, and there is always a risk that an attempted limited retaliation could get out of hand. Given that the signs are that North Korea is in the middle of some form of political upheaval arising from the illness that its leader, Kim Jong-il, suffered in 2008 and the related question of the succession, this might not be the best time to add to instability. International concern about the North's nuclear programmes remains high. In the end, one suspects that, after a period of international grandstanding, there will be little option but to seek to re-engage with North Korea as the only hope of modifying its behaviour.", "tags": ["World news", "South Korea", "North Korea"], "title": "Jim Hoare | Acts of war in North Korea"},{"date": "2010-05-12T18:28:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "It is the holy grail of clean energy: harnessing nuclear fusion to create unlimited power without also generating greenhouse gases and radioactive waste.For decades the dream has eluded the world's scientists, but today, North Korea claimed it had succeeded where many have failed, creating a successful nuclear fusion reaction.The official Korean Central News Agency said: \"The successful nuclear fusion by our scientists has made a definite breakthrough towards the development of new energy and opened up a new phase in the nation's development of the latest science and technology.\"But the extraordinary assertion, which would put the regime well ahead of its nuclear rivals in the west, was dismissed by scientists in South Korea.\"Nuclear fusion reaction is not something that can be done so simply,\" said Hyeon Park, a physics professor at Postech science and technology university.He said he believed North Korea had merely produced plasma, a preliminary step on the way to nuclear fusion.The KCNA said scientists had \"solved a great many scientific and technological problems entirely by their own efforts \u2026 thus succeeding in nuclear fusion reaction at last.\" Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the \"ingeniously\" developed technology \"represents a field of the latest science and technology for the development of new energy desired by humankind\".

Efforts to defuse the nuclear crisis with North Korea have swung wildly in the last two decades from periods of sunshine diplomacy and nuclear decommissioning to nuclear tests, the firing of long-range missiles, and the torpedoing of South Korean warships. The theory that Pyongyang does this to get noticed is starting to pall. So hints yesterday that North Korea wanted to talk again after a prolonged period of belligerence, which culminated in the sinking of a South Korean corvette, the Cheonan, come as little surprise.The hints came in many forms. Jimmy Carter, writing in the New York Times, said there were clear signs that Pyongyang wanted to resume negotiations on abandoning its nuclear weapons programme. The former US president has just returned from North Korea after negotiating the release of an American who had entered the country illegally. The North has also proposed holding military talks with the South on the disputed sea border off their west coast; it released the crew of a South Korean fishing boat which it claimed had strayed into its waters and suggested a resumption of reunions of families separated at the end of the Korean war \u2013 a gesture calculated to appeal to the south.There is, as ever, little clarity as to why these signals are being sent. Problems of succession continue to plague the leadership, and a meeting of the ruling party which was supposed to have taken place this month may have been postponed by a power struggle. The North's leader, Kim Jong-il, is finding it harder than he thought to anoint his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, and may have to settle for a prince regent. Another factor may be purely economic. After a botched currency reform last year which triggered a further round of inflation, and after a period when trade with the South through the Kaesong special economic zone has been reduced, the North is finding it more difficult than ever to get hard currency. Executing the officials in charge of economic planning and railroad transportation will not solve the basic problem. Nor will selling fishing rights to China put much of a dent in the trade deficit with Beijing. The only way out for Pyongyang is to trade with Seoul \u2013 hence the apparent thaw.The real question is whether the opportunity can be seized to make a deal stick. One was agreed in 2005 to end the nuclear weapons programme in return for economic and energy assistance. Washington refuses to return to talks unless the North vows to abide by that agreement and apologises for the attack on the Cheonan, which claimed 46 lives. This will not happen, but talks, in the end, must.", "tags": ["North Korea", "World news", "Nuclear weapons"], "title": "North Korea: Jaw-jaw | Editorial"},{"date": "2010-09-28T23:05:14Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea generates reams of comment, but few hard facts. We learn from the propaganda machine, which has begun extolling his qualities in poetry and song, that Kim Jong-un, the ailing leader's youngest son, is being groomed as successor. Five others were promoted to the rank of general, according to the Korean Central News Agency, including Kim Jong-il's elder sister Kim Kyong-hui.So the latest theory is that she and her husband, the vice-chairman of the national defence commission Jang Song-thaek, could mentor her nephew in the event of her brother's sudden death. Kim Jong-il had 14 years to prepare for power after being rolled out at the last party congress in 1980, and he is mindful that his son has only had two years to complete the same transformation from obscurity to Dear Leader. A succession is clearly under way. What no one yet knows is how much further it has to go.What can be said is that for a famine-prone country, dwarfed by the economies of its neighbours, China, Japan and South Korea, the regime is remarkably resilient. It has an ideology \u2013 xenophobic nationalism. It has enemies that give it legitimacy. And it is ruthless in its use of force as a lever of power. It executes officials scapegoated for policies that don't work and it is prepared to punish three generations of one family. It has extracted at least $6bn of aid since it first promised to denuclearise, and there is every hope that there are billions to come if it treads the same path.Analysts are hard put to come up with policies that work. The only effective sanction that targets the leadership rather than its brutalised people is to cut off its supplies of hard currency and luxury goods, but as some experts have pointed out, neither Washington nor Seoul are interested in an outcome that is too successful too quickly. The collapse of the regime could trigger millions of refugees pouring across the borders of China and South Korea. The economic gap between the two parts of the peninsula was already 100 times larger than that which existed between East and West Germany at the time the Berlin Wall fell.North Korea could gradually liberalise under its Swiss-educated ruler-in-waiting, in the knowledge that this is the only path that ensures the stability of the regime and of the\u00a0country. But there is as little evidence for a North Korean perestroika as there is for any other benign outcome. Everything points to a continuation of the tyranny. A stroke has forced Kim Jong-il to confront his own mortality, but despite famines and floods that dispatched millions, the same has yet to happen to the world's most reclusive regime.", "tags": ["North Korea", "World news"], "title": "North Korea: Next of Kim | Editorial"},{"date": "2010-09-30T07:00:02Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "On some nights, one news bulletin will include footage of another, like Magritte's receding images. Generally it's archive material, so the contemporary coverage of an official inquiry into a massacre, train crash or shooting will be introduced along with a snippet of the news as it was broken long ago. And there's often a poignancy in this, because we're seeing the same presenter looking impossibly young, or a semi-forgotten colleague.On other occasions, the footage is only hours or minutes old, showing how the death of Michael Jackson or the plight of Chilean miners is being reported in the story's home location or around the world. But, in one instance, which happened again this week, the sampling of another broadcast has a different, almost subliminal function: to make viewers feel grateful and relieved for the bulletin we're watching.John Simpson's report on the political reshuffle in North Korea in Tuesday night's BBC1 News featured \u2013 as did several US reports \u2013 a screen grab of the nation's state TV announcing the changes. Ri Chun Hee, North Korea's Fiona Bruce, sat in a pink kimono before an orange and brown backdrop and beamed the news with the pride of a parent announcing a birth.In western democracies, the news services are obsessed with projecting authority \u2013 quasi-presidential anchors \u2013 but North Korean TV has authority to spare and so seeks to lessen it. The vivid colour schemes make us think of children's telly \u2013 appropriately, because this is current affairs with the bad news left out \u2013 while the absence of a video screen behind the anchor, reminds us that North Korea's television service is unusual in proceeding largely without pictures, for security reasons.We are being invited to laugh and to contrast. And yet, seeing these clips embedded within Fox News, with its hysterical host screeching that \"the fate of the whole planet\" could hinge on the family gavotte, reminds us that free news has its own idiocies.

It's extremely poor but by no means the image portrayed as totally isolated,\" Smith added. \"For at least the last 30 years they've been investing in IT-related training, so it's not really a very big development for them to do this.\"The problem for North Korea in communicating, Smith said, is not the means but the message. \"They clearly realise that they're not good at PR and so they're looking at ways to get the message out from different sorts of media and they're aware of the impact different forms of media can have, because they [government agencies] go abroad as well.\"The problem for them is not so much the use, it's the content because they're still politically stuck in a timewarp where they're going to \u2013 at a propaganda level \u2013 give out a stock, old-fashioned almost farcical interpretation of the reality.\"It's not the technology, it's how to make them compete with each other in terms of content.

We drove to downtown Pyongyang, an unattractive showcase for the school of brutalist communist architecture \u2013 huge open spaces surrounded by imposing monuments, cold statues and ugly tower blocks all designed to make you, as an individual, feel very insignificant. What I felt was total disorientation along with, I have to admit, no small tinge of excitement.In one of the empty spaces, under a forbidding mural of the Great Leader Kim Il-sung, were assembled about 3,000 schoolgirls, performing a mass synchronized dance with the encouragement of two men sitting in a van with loudspeakers on the roof.Our bus turned another corner and started trundling along the river. We passed another open space \u2013 this one filled with about 2,000 soldiers doing an aggressive, synchronized taekwondo routine under two large portraits of Marx and Lenin.

The US, UN and Japan have all imposed waves of sanctions against North Korea in the past. As a result, the country's economy is now believed to be in a wretched state, while the leadership shows few signs of acquiescence.\"These measures are not directed at the people of North Korea, who have suffered too long due to the misguided and malign priorities of their government,\" Clinton told reporters during a visit to Seoul. \"They are directed at the destabilising, illicit, and provocative policies pursued by that government.\"North Korea has been subject to international sanctions since it defied world opinion by conducting two nuclear tests and test-firing ballistic missiles in 2006. The regime is believed to be turning to illegal ventures, including the sale of weapons technology, to raise cash to fund its nuclear programme.Efforts to negotiate a nuclear-free Korean peninsula collapsed last year and tensions surged when a North Korean torpedo sank the Cheonan, a South Korean vessel, in March, killing 46 sailors. Pyongyang has denied attacking the ship and said any retaliation could trigger an all-out war.Clinton said she expected North Korea to \"take certain steps that would acknowledge their responsibility\" for the incident and end its nuclear programme.\"They know very well that they made commitments over the last year to the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula which they have reneged on and which we expect them to once again adhere to,\" she said.\"We are looking for irreversible denuclearisation.\"The new sanctions were announced as Clinton visited the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that has separated the two Koreas for almost six decades. She urged North Korea to end the isolation and suffering of its people.Clinton, accompanied by the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, arrived at the DMZ - the world's most heavily fortified border - to show solidarity with Washington's ally, South Korea, four months after the Cheonan sinking.\"Although it may be a thin line, these two places are worlds apart,\" Clinton said, as she stood near the demarcation line, drawn up after the Korean war ended in a truce in July 1953.The war, in which as many as 3 million soldiers and civilians died, ended in a truce, maintained to this day by almost 2 million soldiers either side of the border.As intrigued North Korean border guards looked on from just a few metres away, Clinton contrasted the countries' post-war fortunes.While South Korea, a democracy since 1987, has prospered to become the world's 15th biggest economy, by contrast, \"the north has not only stagnated in isolation, but the people of the north have suffered for so many years.\"Clinton thanked troops from the US, South Korea and other UN nations who patrol the border, and pledged unwavering political and military support for South Korea, which hosts 28,500 US troops.\"We continue to send a message to the north: there is another way,\" she said. \"There is a way that can benefit the north.\"But until they change direction, the United States stands firmly on behalf of the people and government of [South Korea], where we provide a stalwart defence along with our allies and partners.\"Although senior US officials have toured the Korean peninsula's \"no-man's land\" before, today marked the first time the secretaries of state and defence have visited together.Gates said South Korea's robust economy contrasted starkly with the desperate poverty of the north, whose economy has been wrecked by famine, international sanctions, the demise of its former ally the Soviet Union, and gross mismanagement.\"It is stunning how little has changed up there and yet how much South Korea continues to grow and prosper,\" Gates said. \"The north, by contrast, stagnates in isolation and deprivation.\"And, as we saw with the sinking of the Cheonan, it continues its history of unpredictable and, at times, provocative behaviour.\"Gates and Clinton later visited the Korean war memorial 30 miles away in Seoul where they laid wreaths in memory of the Cheonan dead. They also held security talks with their South Korean counterparts.North Korea has so far escaped meaningful international censure for the torpedo attack. The UN security council issued a presidential statement condemning the sinking, but did not blame North Korea by name.Seoul and Washington have warned, however, that they will not allow the incident to go unpunished, despite threats from the north that any punitive measures could trigger a conflict that would see its neighbour downed in a \"sea of fire\".The US and South Korea have said they will hold four days of large-scale military exercises from Sunday in the Sea of Japan. The show of force is expected to anger North Korean leaders.\"The warmongers would be well advised to behave themselves, bearing deep in mind the consequences to be entailed by the above-said war moves,\" the north's government-run Minju Joson newspaper said in a commentary reported by the official Korean Central News Agency.China, North Korea's only ally and biggest aid donor, condemned the exercises as \"provocative\".Operation Invincible Spirit will involve about 8,000 US and South Korean troops, 200 aircraft and 18 ships including aircraft carrier the USS George Washington.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Hillary Clinton", "South Korea", "US news", "US politics", "World news"], "title": "US increases sanctions against North Korea"},{"date": "2010-12-01T13:05:06Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is highly likely to attack again, South Korea's intelligence chief has told MPs, according to Seoul-based media.His remarks come a week after an artillery bombardment killed two civilians and two soldiers on Yeonpyeong island \u2013 and hours after the South announced fresh military manoeuvres.Won Sei-hoon, director of the National Intelligence Service, warned: \"There is a high possibility that the North will make another attack.\"He said the shelling had come amid domestic pressure in Pyongyang, telling a closed session of a parliamentary committee that \"internal complaints are growing about the North's succession for a third generation, and its economic situation is worsening\".Won also said a wire tap in August had indicated an attack in the West Sea, according to Yonhap news agency.Pyongyang said last week's bombardment was a response to the South's live-fire drill.Yonhap reported that South Korea planned to hold further artillery training exercises next week, including some in an area close to its disputed maritime border with the North.

Rodong Sinmun, the main party organ, declared enhanced US-South Korean military co-operation to be \"nothing but treachery, escalating the tension \u2026 and bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean peninsula\".And today's disclosure by South Korea that the North may have built up to four additional facilities for nuclear weapons-related uranium enrichment is unlikely to calm the febrile atmosphere. The intelligence suggests the regime is hell-bent on maximising its nuclear capabilities, notwithstanding any future disarmament talks.In this tense game of diplomatic-military poker, South Korea is not even the North's principal adversary. Kim Jong-il is now blithely defying all the major regional actors \u2013 the US, China, Russia and Japan \u2013 while actively exploiting differences between them. It makes little difference whether his aim is recognition and security guarantees; economic and financial assistance; or the succession of his son. Kim is playing off the great powers against each other, to see what he can get out of them. The result is virtual diplomatic meltdown.Just look at what has happened since last month's bombardment of Yeonpyeong island. China, the North's only influential ally, has come under strong US pressure to pull its supposed client into line. China's perceived failure to do so is straining relations with Washington. James Steinberg, the US deputy secretary of state, visited Beijing today carrying the message: China must do more, fast.Resentful of such criticism, but simultaneously alarmed at the North's unruly behaviour (which it says it cannot ultimately control), China sent a top envoy, Dai Bingguo, to Pyongyang last week. In a bland statement bordering on meaninglessness, the foreign ministry claimed today the visit achieved consensus: \"The two sides believe that parties should keep calm and exercise restraint, take a responsible attitude to avoid further escalation of tensions, and play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability on the peninsula.\"China insists a resumption of the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programme is the best way forward. Pyongyang would probably support this if the negotiations, broken off last year, restarted without preconditions. The US, Japan and South Korea, on the other hand, oppose rewarding Kim's \"bad behaviour\", and are demanding a range of prior assurances. So the impasse persists \u2013 and the North has no incentive to change its ways.Russia, a party to the talks, is hardly doing any better. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told his North Korean counterpart, Pak Ui-chun, yesterday that Moscow was deeply concerned by recent events. Last month's attack \"deserves condemnation\", he said. But then Lavrov grew placatory, agreeing that US-South Korean military exercises were inflaming tensions, a view shared by China.For his part, Pak, unfazed by this mild reprimand, told the Russian news agency Interfax that the \"hostile and confrontational policy\" of the US and South Korea justified \"strengthening our defence potential with a focus on nuclear deterrent forces\".Evidently worried by the North's defiant insouciance, Russia announced today it had raised the alert status of its forces in the country's far east. \"Without a doubt, we have taken measures to increase the combat-readiness of our forces,\" a military spokesman said, adding the army was \"continuing to monitor\" the situation.Differences of approach are also evident between Japan and South Korea, suspicious old enemies yet to be fully united in a common cause. In South Korea itself, the fallout from last month's attack has been damaging, prompting financial market jitters, the resignation of the army chief and the defence minister, and severe criticism of President Lee Myung-bak. If the North's aim was to sow confusion, it has succeeded \u2013 and not only in Seoul.Two things seem clear from all of this: first, that the various parties to this crisis need to form a united front if they are to have any chance of inducing the North to behave more responsibly. Second, that at present they are incapable of doing so.Maybe it's time for a fresh approach. Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico and an experienced freelance mediator who specialised in rogue regimes under Bill Clinton, is due in Pyongyang on Thursday. In his time Richardson has dealt face-to-face with the likes of Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, Sudan's Omar al-Bashir and the North Koreans.

It warned that the attack was a violation of the armistice that ended the Korean war in 1953.The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, who convened an emergency security meeting shortly after the initial bombardment, said an \"indiscriminate attack on civilians\" could never be tolerated.\"Enormous retaliation should be made, to the extent that [North Korea] cannot make provocations again,\" he said.The assault is one of the most serious in the decades since the war, given the involvement of civilians, although previous firefights around the disputed maritime border have resulted in a higher number of casualties.In a short statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, the North said the South had fired first \u2013 presumably in reference to a live-fire drill being carried out as part of annual military exercises. It said it had repeatedly warned the South not to go ahead with the drill.... Read more here.2.40pm: The President of South Korea has said he believes \"enormous retaliation is going to be necessary to make North Korea incapable of provoking us again\".Quoted by Yonhap news agency, Lee Myung-bak said: \"Reckless attacks on South Korean civilians are not tolerable, especially when South Korea is providing North Korea with humanitarian aid.\"\"As for such attacks on civilians, a response beyond the rule of engagement is necessary. \"Our military should show this through action rather than an administrative response,\" he added.Lee did not rule out the possibility of follow-up attacks.\"Given that North Korea maintains an offensive posture, I think the Army, the Navy and the Air Force should unite and retaliate against [the North's] provocation with multiple-fold firepower,\" Lee said. \"I think enormous retaliation is going to be necessary to make North Korea incapable of provoking us again.\"2.00pm: My colleague Simon Rogers has used a 2007 report by the Congressional Research Service, to map out the 150 incidents which have occurred between North and South Korea since the Korea War in 1950.You can read more on the Guardian's Datablog and see the incidents across North and South Korea here:1.38pm: Justin McCurry reports from Osaka on Japan's reaction to this morning's developments \u2013 Japan being one of the countries involved in the stalled six-party talks.The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, has instructed government colleagues to be prepared \"for any contingency\" in the wake of North Korea's attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong earlier today.Kan said he had told his cabinet to \"put all efforts into gathering information and ... to prepare to be able to respond firmly to any eventuality.\"Japan's efforts will, for the time being, be limited to information gathering \u2013 in any case its \"pacifist\" constitution forbids it from mobilizing forces in response to an attack on an ally.An escalation in hostilities on the Korean peninsula would, however, force Tokyo to make contingencies for a potential flood of refugees across the Sea of Japan.Nevertheless Japan, which is still trying to establish the whereabouts of several of its nationals abducted by Pyongyang agents at the height of the cold war, considers itself near the top of North Korea's list of potential targets.A foreign ministry official in Tokyo quoted by the Kyodo news agency described the shellings as \"dangerous\" and \"provocative\".1.16pm: News of the exchange of fire has sent the South Korean currency tumbling, with the won currently down 3.5% on the US dollar.The South Korean central bank, after an emergency meeting, says it planned to co-operate with the government to take measures to stabilise markets if necessary. Many traders expect South Korea's financial markets to fall further when trading opens tomorrow.However the drop against the dollar should be seen in the context of the dollar spiking in reaction to the news of the shelling \u2013 as my colleague Graeme Wearden, who knows much more about such matters, reported in our 11.02am post.12.22pm: Mark Tran, Guardian colleague specialising in international news, has been mulling over the events of this morning. He says the key to rehabilitating North Korea into the international community lies with the US:North Korea is a case of what Richard Nixon used to describe as the madman theory of politics, designed to keep opponents off balance. This is how Nixon described his approach \u2013 when he was trying to extricate the US from Vietnam \u2013 to his chief of staff Bob Hadelman.Nixon said: \"I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, 'for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry -- and he has his hand on the nuclear button' -- and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.\"This time it's not Nixon acting crazy, it's the North Korean leadership. Yet there is some method behind the madness for North Korea. As Simon Tisdall wrote below, North Korea has consistently pursued a fundamental objective \u2013 a non-aggression pact with the US. But as far as the US is concerned, it has no intention with rewarding North Korea's \"bad behaviour\" with a peace treaty. Bill Clinton tried the carrot approach in the 1990s when he agreed to provide aid to Pyongyang in exchange for North Korea's commitment to stop its nuclear programme under the 1994 \"agreed framework\". That deal eventually broke down with both sides blaming each other. When George Bush became president, his administration dismissed the Clinton approach as appeasement. But eventually he adopted a less confrontational approach not so different from Clinton's, only to see the North Koreans testing its first nuclear weapon in 2006. Since then it's been a roller-coaster, with signs of progress interspersed setbacks. Meanwhile, South Korea under Lee Myung-bak, who became president in 2008, ditched his predecessor's conciliatory \"sunshine policy\" for a more hard-headed approach, reinforcing North Korea's sense of isolation. The key lies with the US, which can offer only what North Korea wants. But it's difficult for Barack Obama to show flexibility when the North Koreans behave so provocatively.11.50am: Time for a bit of a recap after a tumultuous morning.\u2022 Two South Korean marines have died after North Korea fired shells at on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong. South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff said 16 others were injured during the bombardment of the island, which is located near the countries' disputed western border.\u2022 South Korea returned fire and scrambled fighter jets in response to the attack. North Korea has not confirmed whether it suffered any losses. South Korea has accused its neighbour of an \"intentional and planned attack\", and said North Korea's action violated the 1953 armistice between the two countries.\u2022 North Korea has issued a robust response, accusing South Korea of firing first and saying it was provoked into taking action. South Korea was undertaking an annual military drill before North Korea fired. \"Despite our repeated warnings, South Korea fired dozens of shells from 1pm ... and we've taken strong military action immediately,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said.\u2022 The international community has criticised North Korea, with the White House describing the attack as \"belligerent\". In the UK, foreign secretary William Hague said the attack was \"unprovoked\" and said the country \"strongly condemns\" it. A senior Russian Foreign Ministry official said North Korea's action was \"absolutely unacceptable\".\u2022 China, North Korea's only major ally, expressed \"concern\" over the initial reports, but called on both Koreas to \"do more to contribute to peace\". A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was now \"imperative to resume six-party talks\". North Korea quit talks with South Korea, the US, China, Russia and Japan in April last year.11.23am: William Hague, the foreign secretary, has put out a statement condemning the attack on South Korea.The UK strongly condemns North Korea's unprovoked attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong Island. Such unprovoked attacks will only lead to further tensions on the Korean Peninsula. We strongly urge North Korea to refrain from such attacks and adhere to the Korean Armistice agreement. I welcome President Lee Myung-bak's call for restraint.11.02am: My colleague Graeme Wearden reports that the military action alarmed the stockmarkets this morning:With markets already nervous following the political crisis in Ireland, news of the shelling helped to send shares falling sharply when trading began. The FTSE fell by 66 points at one stage to 5614, down 1.1%, and there were similar falls in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The dollar also spiked (traders typically run to the [perceived] safety of the greenback when bombs start to fall).The South Korean Won was hit hard, falling 3.75% against the dollar, and other Asian currencies also fell.There was also a significant leap in the cost of insuring South Korean government debt -- with its five-year credit default swap jumping by 18 basis points to 102bp. That still makes South Korean debt a very safe bet, though (the Irish CDS is more than five times higher).A rumour travelled around the City this morning that North Korea's attack had been prompted by the death of Kim Jong-il \u2013 perhaps to prove to the world that the country was still in firm hands.Neil Hume, the editor of FT Alphaville, tweeted the speculation: \"@humenm: Warning broker RAW: Unconfirmed chat that kim jung-il has died. Prompts the shelling from north korea as being reported by newswires.\"Most raw gossip from stockbrokers should treated extremely cautiously, of course.10.43am: Tania Branigan has more on the events that preceded shells being fired \u2013\u00a0when South Korea was undertaking military drills close to Yeonpyeong.The North Korean artillery attack followed a live-fire exercise by the South as part of its annual Hoguk military drills.The Korea Herald reported that the North faxed a message to the South this morning saying it would not \"just sit back\" while the South carried out the exercise, citing military officials.The Korea Times reported last week that the US had pulled out of the joint drill citing scheduling conflicts, but had said it would seek to rearrange the exercise.10.36am: North Korea has accused South Korea of firing first, saying it was provoked into the military action, which has killed two soldiers in the South and set dozens of houses ablaze. \"Despite our repeated warnings, South Korea fired dozens of shells from 1pm ... and we've taken strong military action immediately,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said in a brief statement. It did not elaborate whether North Korea had suffered any losses from the exchange of fire.10.25am: South Korea's defence ministry has said North Korea's firing of artillery shells voilated the armistice between the two countries.\"This is an intentional and planned attack... and it is clearly in violation of the armistice,\" Lee Hong-ki, South Korea's defence ministry official, told reporters.10.03am: This map shows just how close the island of Yeonpyeon is to North and South Korea's disputed border.9.58am: Reuters news agency is now also reporting that two South Korean marines have been killed.Quoting South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, it says four more soldiers have been seriously injured on Yeonpyeong island.9.50am: The White House has issued a statement describing North Korea's action as \"belligerent\" and reinforcing US support for South Korea:The United States strongly condemns this attack and calls on North Korea to halt its belligerent action and to fully abide by the terms of the Armistice Agreement.The United States is firmly committed to the defense of our ally, the Republic of Korea, and to the maintenance of regional peace and stability.9.38am: Tweet from Yonhap News, the publicly funded South Korean news agency, on South Korea's initial diplomatic response: (URGENT) South Korea indefinitely postpones Red Cross talks with North Korea slated for Thursday: official9.34am: Another marine has died following North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong island, taking the number of soldiers killed to two, Yonhap news agency is reporting. More shortly.9.31am: Potentially awkward moment in Guangzhou, China, this morning, where two South and North Korean archers stood side-by-side on the Asian Games podium as their countries fired shells at one another.South Korea's Yun Ok-hee won gold in the women's individual archery competition, while Kwon Un Sil from North Korea took bronze, and stood beside Yun when they received their medals.\"Kwon, wearing a red team jacket, and Yun, with a multicolored team top, both stood with their hands behind their backs before the medals were presented,\" AP reports.\"Yun waved her national flag to a crowd of South Korean fans and held it up as all three medalists stood for photos.\"9.23am: China, North Korea's only major ally, has expressed \"concern\" over the reports that North Korea has shelled a South Korean island, and called for six party talks on its nuclear aspirations to resume.A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hong Lei, told a news conference both sides of the divided Korean peninsula should \"do more to contribute to peace\", and said it was imperative to return to six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.\"We have heard reports and express our concern. The situation still needs to be confirmed,\" said Hong, responding to a question about the North Korean artillery attack.\"China hopes that the relevant parties will do more to contribute to peace and stability in the region,\" he added.\"It is imperative now to resume the six-party talks.\"China is North Korea's only major ally, and its economic and diplomatic support have been important to shoring up its otherwise isolated neighbour, whose leader Kim Jong-il visited China twice this year to strengthen ties. North Korea quit six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the US in April last year. The country has indicated it would return to talks on the condition it first gets face to face talks with the US. The Obama administration has so largely resisted.9.09am: This footage from CNN appears to show smoke rising from the Yeonpyeong, and buildings ablaze on the island: .9.02am: Tania Branigan emails from Beijing:The artillery attacks are a \"totally justifiable act of self-defence\" in response to the South's sea drills, an unofficial spokesman for North Korea has said, warning that nuclear war could follow \"at any point\" unless the exercises stop. Pyongyang has repeatedly issued such threats in the past.\"We repeatedly warned South Korea to stop its dangerous war games. If the South continues its dangerous behaviour, Seoul will be the next target. It will be a sea of fire. Nuclear war could start at any point,\" said Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace. He said it was fair to describe him as speaking on behalf of the North's government.He added: \"We have repeatedly warned the South to avoid endangering our territory on sea or air.\"8.56am: In the comments below, seoulman writes expressively of the mood in South Korea:I'm posting this from Seoul. Everyone is watching the news closely but there isn't any signs of panic. A few people, my girlfriend included have a sense of seeing this all before. I'm not trying to play it down, my arse went a bit when I heard the news but people are still going about there normal business.8.47am: Reports are suggesting the shelling has now ceased, but fires are still burning on Yeonpyeong.South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered officials to \"sternly respond\" to North Korea's action, but also called on officials to make sure that the \"situation would not escalate,\" a presidential official told Associated Press. Lee is holding a security meeting in a presidential situation room, the official said.North Korea's actions \"are illegal and a violation of the 1953 armistice agreement\" that ended the Korean War, a Joint Chiefs of Staff official said.He said South Korea responded to the shelling by firing a K-9 155mm self-propelled howitzer. However the JCS official declined to say whether North Korean territory was hit by the South Korean artillery.The official said island residents are escaping to about 20 shelters in the island.8.34am: Simon Tisdall, assistant editor of the Guardian and foreign affairs columnist, writes that North Korea is seeking \"acceptance by the great powers\":The sudden flareup in hostilities will be attributed to several factors. But as far as North Korea is concerned, one motive above all guides its behaviour: it desire for international attention.This has been largely lacking over the past year following the stalling of the six party talks, involving the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and China, on the regime's rogue nuclear and missile programmes.Pyongyang wants to hold face to face negotiations with the US alone but so far the Obama administration has largely resisted. The main difference is the agenda for any resumed talks, with Washington insistent that the aim must be the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.Today's violence follows the sinking earlier this year of a South Korean naval vessel, which was blamed on the North - though it denies involvement. This too was seen by analysts as a bid by the regime to get the world's attention.The North badly needs more international economic, development and food aid to bolster its chronically mismanaged economy. Its maverick leadership also seems to crave acceptance by the great powers. At present, paranoia reigns, amid constant claims tha the US is seeking regime change. This instability has been exacerbated by an apparent succession process in which the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il, is seeking to gradually transfer power to his youngest son.But regional analysts suggest that notwithstanding any steps he takes now, a fight for power could erupt when the ailing Kim dies. That struggle may already be underway and could involve members of the powerful military involved in triggering today's fighting.China, the North's only influential ally, has been urging the US to engage with the regime in order to defuse tensions. It has also held two summits with Kim this year. Chinese diplomats maintain Beijing has limited influence and are privately critical and alarmed, in equal measure, at the North's aggressive behaviour.8.24am: This footage from YTN television, based in South Korea, appears to show images of of the impact of the shells on Yeonpyeong island:.8.19am: More from Tania:Yonhap has also reported that the government is considering pulling South Korean nationals out of the North following the exchange of fire.We will decide whether we should evacuate them or not after looking into the safety of those at the Mount Kumgang resort and the Kaesong industrial park,\" the Unification Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Mount Kumgang is a tourist resort, while Kaesong is a joint enterprise zone. But both have experienced their share of trouble in the past \u2013 in 2008, a Northern soldier shot dead a Southern tourist after she wandered into a restricted zone at the beauty spot, while the Kaesong complex has struggled amid increasing friction on the peninsula. The official said officials would also reconsider plans to hold Red Cross talks with North Korea on Thursday in the South Korean border town of Munsan. Until last week, many had hoped that relations were thawing again after a long period of deterioration. The North was angered when President Lee took office in Seoul and adopted a tougher stance towards it than his predecessor, cutting off free-flowing aid.8.10am: Dr Park Young-Ho, from the Korea Institute for National Unification, has said he believes the shelling is an attempt by North Korea to \"turn this region into a conflict zone\".Although I can't be certain of the rationale behind North Korea's attacks yet, I see it as North Korea's intention to turn this region into a conflict zone so that it can bring the concerned parties to the discussion table.By showing that it has nuclear capacity and by firing artillery shells today, I think it is trying to make a point that it is militarily capable and thus should not be lightly regarded. Ultimately, I think it is strategically seeking to tilt talks concerning the contested Northern Limit Line and the peace treaty towards its advantage.7.54am: The Guardian's Tania Branigan reports:Seoul is examining whether the artillery attack is related to its drills near the western sea border, a spokeswoman for the presidential Blue House said today, according to Yonhap.Kim Hee-jung told reporters that officials were looking into the North's motive, adding: \"Our Navy was conducting a maritime exercise near the western sea border today. North Korea has sent a letter of protest over the drill. We're examining a possible link between the protest and the artillery attack.\"South Korea's president Lee Myung-bak has told senior officials that the government must \"carefully manage the situation to prevent the escalation of the clash,\" another spokesperson said.He is due to hold an emergency meeting of ministers at an underground bunker in Seoul shortly, his aide Park Jung-ha added.7.44am: North Korea started firing on South Korean waters off the island of Yeonpyeong at around 2.34pm local time, some of them landing directly on the island, Yonhap news agency is reporting.Col Lee Bung-woo, spokesman for South Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff told Yonhap the South had fired back some 80 rounds.The military is on its highest peacetime alert, he said, adding that the South Korean air force has deployed fighter jets to the island.7.36am: Yonhap News, the South Korean publicly funded news agency, is reporting that one South Korean soldier has been killed in the shelling. Yonhap quotes an unnamed official. We'll hopefully have more information soon.7.30am: North Korea has fired dozens of rounds of artillery onto a populated South Korean island near their disputed western border, military officials have said.The shells have set several buildings on fire, reportedly injuring two people, and have prompted South Korea to return fire and scramble fighter jets.The skirmish came amid tension over North Korea's claim that it has a new uranium enrichment facility and just over a month after North Korean leader Kim Jong Il unveiled his youngest son Kim Jong Un as his heir apparent.South Korea's YTN television has said two people were injured, several houses were on fire and shells are still falling on Yeonpyeong island. The station is broadcasting pictures of thick columns of black smoke rising from the island.Yonhap news agency, quoting a military official, says four soldiers have been wounded. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered officials to make sure that the firing wouldn't escalate, according to Yonhap, quoting a presidential official. YTN said between 1,200 and 1,300 people live on the island.A South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff official said dozens of rounds of artillery landed on the island and in the sea. The official says South Korea fired back. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of JCS rules, said South Korea's military is on alert. He had no other details, and could not confirm the reports of casualties.Tensions between the two Koreas also remain tense after the sinking in March of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died. Seoul has blamed a North Korean torpedo, while Pyongyang has denied any responsibility. The countries' western maritime boundary has long been a flash point between the two Koreas. The North does not recognize the border that was unilaterally drawn by the United Nations at the close of the 1950-53 Korean War.North and South Korea have fought three bloody skirmishes near the maritime border in recent years, most recently in November 2009.", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea fires on South Korea \u2013 live coverage"},{"date": "2010-12-01T13:05:06Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is highly likely to attack again, South Korea's intelligence chief has told MPs, according to Seoul-based media.His remarks come a week after an artillery bombardment killed two civilians and two soldiers on Yeonpyeong island \u2013 and hours after the South announced fresh military manoeuvres.Won Sei-hoon, director of the National Intelligence Service, warned: \"There is a high possibility that the North will make another attack.\"He said the shelling had come amid domestic pressure in Pyongyang, telling a closed session of a parliamentary committee that \"internal complaints are growing about the North's succession for a third generation, and its economic situation is worsening\".Won also said a wire tap in August had indicated an attack in the West Sea, according to Yonhap news agency.Pyongyang said last week's bombardment was a response to the South's live-fire drill.Yonhap reported that South Korea planned to hold further artillery training exercises next week, including some in an area close to its disputed maritime border with the North. Analysts warned that could increase tensions.China's foreign minister called for restraint and said all parties should avoid any actions that could \"inflame the situation\".\"Our general goal is for all sides to exercise calm and restraint and to make every effort to avoid such incidents recurring,\" Yang Jiechi said.He said that China, North Korea's main ally, did not seek to \"protect any side\" and would not \"pour oil on the flames\", according to the country's official Xinhua news agency.Yonhap said the military had issued an advisory notice to local vessels for a six-day period from next Monday. Daecheong island \u2013 just south of the disputed Yellow Sea border \u2013 is included, although Yeonpyeong is not, according to officials from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Administration.The news agency cited government sources as saying separate artillery drills would take place in waters off Yeonpyeong soon. Reuters said the defence ministry would not comment.A South Korean joint chiefs of staff officer said Seoul and Washington were discussing whether to conduct more joint military drills this month or early next month.Analysts believe the most likely outcome of the current standoff is further negotiations, and that North Korea's actions are in part intended to push Seoul and Washington back towards talks based on giving the North aid in exchange for a pledge on scaling back its nuclear capabilities.The US has described its participation in this week's manoeuvres as a deterrent, while the South's defence minister warned there was an \"ample possibility\" of a provocation by the North following the departure of US warships.But some analysts warned that more military drills could escalate a delicate situation.\"The overall situation might be intensified and a new crisis might be brought by doing this,\" said Professor Chu Shulong, an expert on international security at Beijing's Tsinghua University.He added: \"Because of the Cheonan incident in March and the shelling in Yeonpyeong, [South Korean] people are angry and their anger has not been addressed yet. They are not happy with the reaction of the government.\"At the same time, South Korea cannot attack North Korea. They can only express their anger through military drills; it is their only way to show the determination to defend their country and to warn the North.\"Dr Leonid Petrov, an expert on the North at the University of Sydney, added: \"Conservatives in Pyongyang and Seoul are driving the situation to a new extreme.\"He added that the \"responsible\" course for the US would be to talk to the North.Beijing \u2013 under pressure to rein in its ally \u2013 threw the ball back into Washington's court by calling for an emergency meeting of the six nations involved in the stalled aid-for-denuclearisation talks.But the US, South Korea and Japan have snubbed that proposal, instead planning to hold trilateral talks next week.Japan sent its envoy to the nuclear talks to China today. The senior North Korean leader Choe Thae Bok is currently in Beijing and China's state councillor Dai Bingguo is expected to travel to Pyongyang shortly.A Russian nuclear envoy, Grigory Logvinov, will meet officials in Seoul to discuss the attack, the six-party talks and other issues, said South Korea's foreign ministry.", "tags": ["North Korea", "World news", "South Korea", "China", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea highly likely to attack again, South Korea warns"},{"date": "2010-11-29T01:55:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "South Korea's president said early this morning he felt responsibility for failing to protect citizens from North Korea's shelling last week and warned the North against further provocations.Lee Myung-bak described Tuesday's shelling of a tiny South Korean island, which killed four people, as an \"inhumane crime\".As Lee spoke, a nuclear-powered US supercarrier and a South Korean destroyer held joint military exercises. The show of force came almost a week after the attack on Yeonpyeong Island killed four, including two civilians, and sent tensions soaring in the region.China has called for a meeting of the six nations involved in the stalled North Korean denuclearisation talks.South Korea and Japan gave a tepid response to the proposal today. Analysts believe negotiations are the most plausible outcome of the conflict, but predict it will take time for the parties to come to the table. The North Korean artillery attack was the most serious incident since the sinking of a warship by what was found to be a North Korean torpedo.Media in Seoul reported today that the North had placed missiles on launch pads in the Yellow Sea, as the South and the US mounted a show of force with joint military drills in the area.Beijing, which objected to the exercises, sought a return to diplomacy, with its nuclear envoy calling for an urgent meeting with the nuclear negotiators from North and South Korea, Japan, the US and Russia. Wu Dawei said it would not be a resumption of the six-party talks but might \"help create the conditions\" for them to restart.Seoul said it would \"carefully consider\" China's suggestion, a remark read by many as in effect a rejection. President Lee Myung-bak's office said earlier that he had told a visiting Chinese delegation Beijing should contribute to peace in a \"more objective and responsible\" manner.China, the North's main ally, has not criticised Pyongyang over Tuesday's attack, merely urging all those involved to show restraint. Critics say it should be pushing harder, given the North's dependence on Chinese food and energy.\"I can see why China is doing this: 'We don't want war; we don't want to put pressure on North Korea',\" said James Hoare, former British charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Pyongyang. \"It would be a good thing if they did start talking, but I think it will take a little bit more time before anything will happen.\"I suspect in the end it won't quite blow over, but it will calm down and the two sides will find some formula to back away from the immediate confrontation.\"Andrei Lankov, an expert on the region at Kookmin University in Seoul, believed the six-party talks would resume \"sooner or later\" but suggested they were largely irrelevant to the current crisis, because the real question was whether and when South Korea and the US would provide more aid to the North. \"This is a protection racket \u2013 you pay the local toughs, and if you don't your windows are going to be broken,\" he said.Relations on the peninsula deteriorated sharply when Lee took office in 2008 and cut off free-flowing aid to the North. But Tuesday's attack marked a new level of hostility. The North said that civilian deaths \"if true \u2026 [are] very regrettable\", but blamed the South for using its citizens as human shields. It also accused the US of setting up Tuesday's incident to justify today's drills.The drills are the largest of their kind yet, according to the South's Yonhap news agency, involving an aircraft carrier carrying 75 planes and at least four other warships. But US military officials said the training was routine and no live-fire exercises were planned. According to South Korean media they are taking place far south of the disputed maritime border.Pyongyang's National Peace Committee said in a statement that the manoeuvres were creating \"a state of ultra-emergency\". It also renewed its threat of \"merciless counter-military strikes\", although it often makes similar warnings ahead of such exercises.Yonhap said North Korea had moved surface-to-surface missiles to frontline areas, but military and government officials said they could not comment.\"It is impossible to confirm the report as it is classified as a military secret,\" one told Reuters.An unidentified government source also told Yonhap that the North had deployed surface-to-air missiles along its western coastline, apparently targeting fighting jets near the disputed Yellow Sea border.Yesterday, South Korea's marine commander vowed \"thousand-fold\" revenge if the North attacked again.Earlier today the South Korean government ordered journalists to leave Yeonpyeong for safety reasons, but bad weather forced it to abort an attempted evacuation, leaving about 400 people there.", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "China", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "South Korea warns North Korea against further provocation"},{"date": "2010-12-14T17:00:01Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Having gained the world's attention by briefly waging war on South Korean territory last month, North Korea has reverted, for now, to a more familiar tactic \u2013 a war of nerves fed by vitriolic propaganda, threats and tantrums, underpinned by a policy of studied unpredictability.Pyongyang maintained its confrontational drumbeat this week. Rodong Sinmun, the main party organ, declared enhanced US-South Korean military co-operation to be \"nothing but treachery, escalating the tension \u2026 and bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean peninsula\".And today's disclosure by South Korea that the North may have built up to four additional facilities for nuclear weapons-related uranium enrichment is unlikely to calm the febrile atmosphere. The intelligence suggests the regime is hell-bent on maximising its nuclear capabilities, notwithstanding any future disarmament talks.In this tense game of diplomatic-military poker, South Korea is not even the North's principal adversary. Kim Jong-il is now blithely defying all the major regional actors \u2013 the US, China, Russia and Japan \u2013 while actively exploiting differences between them. It makes little difference whether his aim is recognition and security guarantees; economic and financial assistance; or the succession of his son. Kim is playing off the great powers against each other, to see what he can get out of them. The result is virtual diplomatic meltdown.Just look at what has happened since last month's bombardment of Yeonpyeong island. China, the North's only influential ally, has come under strong US pressure to pull its supposed client into line. China's perceived failure to do so is straining relations with Washington. James Steinberg, the US deputy secretary of state, visited Beijing today carrying the message: China must do more, fast.Resentful of such criticism, but simultaneously alarmed at the North's unruly behaviour (which it says it cannot ultimately control), China sent a top envoy, Dai Bingguo, to Pyongyang last week. In a bland statement bordering on meaninglessness, the foreign ministry claimed today the visit achieved consensus: \"The two sides believe that parties should keep calm and exercise restraint, take a responsible attitude to avoid further escalation of tensions, and play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability on the peninsula.\"China insists a resumption of the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programme is the best way forward. Pyongyang would probably support this if the negotiations, broken off last year, restarted without preconditions. The US, Japan and South Korea, on the other hand, oppose rewarding Kim's \"bad behaviour\", and are demanding a range of prior assurances. So the impasse persists \u2013 and the North has no incentive to change its ways.Russia, a party to the talks, is hardly doing any better. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told his North Korean counterpart, Pak Ui-chun, yesterday that Moscow was deeply concerned by recent events. Last month's attack \"deserves condemnation\", he said. But then Lavrov grew placatory, agreeing that US-South Korean military exercises were inflaming tensions, a view shared by China.For his part, Pak, unfazed by this mild reprimand, told the Russian news agency Interfax that the \"hostile and confrontational policy\" of the US and South Korea justified \"strengthening our defence potential with a focus on nuclear deterrent forces\".Evidently worried by the North's defiant insouciance, Russia announced today it had raised the alert status of its forces in the country's far east. \"Without a doubt, we have taken measures to increase the combat-readiness of our forces,\" a military spokesman said, adding the army was \"continuing to monitor\" the situation.Differences of approach are also evident between Japan and South Korea, suspicious old enemies yet to be fully united in a common cause. In South Korea itself, the fallout from last month's attack has been damaging, prompting financial market jitters, the resignation of the army chief and the defence minister, and severe criticism of President Lee Myung-bak. If the North's aim was to sow confusion, it has succeeded \u2013 and not only in Seoul.Two things seem clear from all of this: first, that the various parties to this crisis need to form a united front if they are to have any chance of inducing the North to behave more responsibly. Second, that at present they are incapable of doing so.Maybe it's time for a fresh approach. Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico and an experienced freelance mediator who specialised in rogue regimes under Bill Clinton, is due in Pyongyang on Thursday. In his time Richardson has dealt face-to-face with the likes of Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, Sudan's Omar al-Bashir and the North Koreans. Perhaps he will have more luck than the diplomats in bringing order to chaos.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "South Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "China", "Japan", "Russia", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Now North Korea defies even China | Simon Tisdall"},{"date": "2010-11-23T07:36:20Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "4.30pm: That's it for today, thanks for reading and for the comments. Tania has just filed a story on today's events:South Korea warned today that it will unleash \"enormous retaliation\" if North Korea launches fresh attacks against its territory.North Korean troops bombarded Yeonpyeong, an island in disputed waters, with dozens of rounds of artillery earlier today, reportedly killing two South Korean soldiers and injuring around 20 people.Seoul placed its military on its highest non-wartime alert level, scrambling F-16 fighter jets to the western sea and returning fire, officials said. It warned that the attack was a violation of the armistice that ended the Korean war in 1953.The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, who convened an emergency security meeting shortly after the initial bombardment, said an \"indiscriminate attack on civilians\" could never be tolerated.\"Enormous retaliation should be made, to the extent that [North Korea] cannot make provocations again,\" he said.The assault is one of the most serious in the decades since the war, given the involvement of civilians, although previous firefights around the disputed maritime border have resulted in a higher number of casualties.In a short statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, the North said the South had fired first \u2013 presumably in reference to a live-fire drill being carried out as part of annual military exercises. It said it had repeatedly warned the South not to go ahead with the drill.... Read more here.2.40pm: The President of South Korea has said he believes \"enormous retaliation is going to be necessary to make North Korea incapable of provoking us again\".Quoted by Yonhap news agency, Lee Myung-bak said: \"Reckless attacks on South Korean civilians are not tolerable, especially when South Korea is providing North Korea with humanitarian aid.\"\"As for such attacks on civilians, a response beyond the rule of engagement is necessary. \"Our military should show this through action rather than an administrative response,\" he added.Lee did not rule out the possibility of follow-up attacks.\"Given that North Korea maintains an offensive posture, I think the Army, the Navy and the Air Force should unite and retaliate against [the North's] provocation with multiple-fold firepower,\" Lee said. \"I think enormous retaliation is going to be necessary to make North Korea incapable of provoking us again.\"2.00pm: My colleague Simon Rogers has used a 2007 report by the Congressional Research Service, to map out the 150 incidents which have occurred between North and South Korea since the Korea War in 1950.You can read more on the Guardian's Datablog and see the incidents across North and South Korea here:1.38pm: Justin McCurry reports from Osaka on Japan's reaction to this morning's developments \u2013 Japan being one of the countries involved in the stalled six-party talks.The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, has instructed government colleagues to be prepared \"for any contingency\" in the wake of North Korea's attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong earlier today.Kan said he had told his cabinet to \"put all efforts into gathering information and ... to prepare to be able to respond firmly to any eventuality.\"Japan's efforts will, for the time being, be limited to information gathering \u2013 in any case its \"pacifist\" constitution forbids it from mobilizing forces in response to an attack on an ally.An escalation in hostilities on the Korean peninsula would, however, force Tokyo to make contingencies for a potential flood of refugees across the Sea of Japan.Nevertheless Japan, which is still trying to establish the whereabouts of several of its nationals abducted by Pyongyang agents at the height of the cold war, considers itself near the top of North Korea's list of potential targets.A foreign ministry official in Tokyo quoted by the Kyodo news agency described the shellings as \"dangerous\" and \"provocative\".1.16pm: News of the exchange of fire has sent the South Korean currency tumbling, with the won currently down 3.5% on the US dollar.The South Korean central bank, after an emergency meeting, says it planned to co-operate with the government to take measures to stabilise markets if necessary. Many traders expect South Korea's financial markets to fall further when trading opens tomorrow.However the drop against the dollar should be seen in the context of the dollar spiking in reaction to the news of the shelling \u2013 as my colleague Graeme Wearden, who knows much more about such matters, reported in our 11.02am post.12.22pm: Mark Tran, Guardian colleague specialising in international news, has been mulling over the events of this morning. He says the key to rehabilitating North Korea into the international community lies with the US:North Korea is a case of what Richard Nixon used to describe as the madman theory of politics, designed to keep opponents off balance. This is how Nixon described his approach \u2013 when he was trying to extricate the US from Vietnam \u2013 to his chief of staff Bob Hadelman.Nixon said: \"I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, 'for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry -- and he has his hand on the nuclear button' -- and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.\"This time it's not Nixon acting crazy, it's the North Korean leadership. Yet there is some method behind the madness for North Korea. As Simon Tisdall wrote below, North Korea has consistently pursued a fundamental objective \u2013 a non-aggression pact with the US. But as far as the US is concerned, it has no intention with rewarding North Korea's \"bad behaviour\" with a peace treaty. Bill Clinton tried the carrot approach in the 1990s when he agreed to provide aid to Pyongyang in exchange for North Korea's commitment to stop its nuclear programme under the 1994 \"agreed framework\". That deal eventually broke down with both sides blaming each other. When George Bush became president, his administration dismissed the Clinton approach as appeasement. But eventually he adopted a less confrontational approach not so different from Clinton's, only to see the North Koreans testing its first nuclear weapon in 2006. Since then it's been a roller-coaster, with signs of progress interspersed setbacks. Meanwhile, South Korea under Lee Myung-bak, who became president in 2008, ditched his predecessor's conciliatory \"sunshine policy\" for a more hard-headed approach, reinforcing North Korea's sense of isolation. The key lies with the US, which can offer only what North Korea wants. But it's difficult for Barack Obama to show flexibility when the North Koreans behave so provocatively.11.50am: Time for a bit of a recap after a tumultuous morning.\u2022 Two South Korean marines have died after North Korea fired shells at on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong. South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff said 16 others were injured during the bombardment of the island, which is located near the countries' disputed western border.\u2022 South Korea returned fire and scrambled fighter jets in response to the attack. North Korea has not confirmed whether it suffered any losses. South Korea has accused its neighbour of an \"intentional and planned attack\", and said North Korea's action violated the 1953 armistice between the two countries.\u2022 North Korea has issued a robust response, accusing South Korea of firing first and saying it was provoked into taking action. South Korea was undertaking an annual military drill before North Korea fired. \"Despite our repeated warnings, South Korea fired dozens of shells from 1pm ... and we've taken strong military action immediately,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said.\u2022 The international community has criticised North Korea, with the White House describing the attack as \"belligerent\". In the UK, foreign secretary William Hague said the attack was \"unprovoked\" and said the country \"strongly condemns\" it. A senior Russian Foreign Ministry official said North Korea's action was \"absolutely unacceptable\".\u2022 China, North Korea's only major ally, expressed \"concern\" over the initial reports, but called on both Koreas to \"do more to contribute to peace\". A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was now \"imperative to resume six-party talks\". North Korea quit talks with South Korea, the US, China, Russia and Japan in April last year.11.23am: William Hague, the foreign secretary, has put out a statement condemning the attack on South Korea.The UK strongly condemns North Korea's unprovoked attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong Island. Such unprovoked attacks will only lead to further tensions on the Korean Peninsula. We strongly urge North Korea to refrain from such attacks and adhere to the Korean Armistice agreement. I welcome President Lee Myung-bak's call for restraint.11.02am: My colleague Graeme Wearden reports that the military action alarmed the stockmarkets this morning:With markets already nervous following the political crisis in Ireland, news of the shelling helped to send shares falling sharply when trading began. The FTSE fell by 66 points at one stage to 5614, down 1.1%, and there were similar falls in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The dollar also spiked (traders typically run to the [perceived] safety of the greenback when bombs start to fall).The South Korean Won was hit hard, falling 3.75% against the dollar, and other Asian currencies also fell.There was also a significant leap in the cost of insuring South Korean government debt -- with its five-year credit default swap jumping by 18 basis points to 102bp. That still makes South Korean debt a very safe bet, though (the Irish CDS is more than five times higher).A rumour travelled around the City this morning that North Korea's attack had been prompted by the death of Kim Jong-il \u2013 perhaps to prove to the world that the country was still in firm hands.Neil Hume, the editor of FT Alphaville, tweeted the speculation: \"@humenm: Warning broker RAW: Unconfirmed chat that kim jung-il has died. Prompts the shelling from north korea as being reported by newswires.\"Most raw gossip from stockbrokers should treated extremely cautiously, of course.10.43am: Tania Branigan has more on the events that preceded shells being fired \u2013\u00a0when South Korea was undertaking military drills close to Yeonpyeong.The North Korean artillery attack followed a live-fire exercise by the South as part of its annual Hoguk military drills.The Korea Herald reported that the North faxed a message to the South this morning saying it would not \"just sit back\" while the South carried out the exercise, citing military officials.The Korea Times reported last week that the US had pulled out of the joint drill citing scheduling conflicts, but had said it would seek to rearrange the exercise.10.36am: North Korea has accused South Korea of firing first, saying it was provoked into the military action, which has killed two soldiers in the South and set dozens of houses ablaze. \"Despite our repeated warnings, South Korea fired dozens of shells from 1pm ... and we've taken strong military action immediately,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said in a brief statement. It did not elaborate whether North Korea had suffered any losses from the exchange of fire.10.25am: South Korea's defence ministry has said North Korea's firing of artillery shells voilated the armistice between the two countries.\"This is an intentional and planned attack... and it is clearly in violation of the armistice,\" Lee Hong-ki, South Korea's defence ministry official, told reporters.10.03am: This map shows just how close the island of Yeonpyeon is to North and South Korea's disputed border.9.58am: Reuters news agency is now also reporting that two South Korean marines have been killed.Quoting South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, it says four more soldiers have been seriously injured on Yeonpyeong island.9.50am: The White House has issued a statement describing North Korea's action as \"belligerent\" and reinforcing US support for South Korea:The United States strongly condemns this attack and calls on North Korea to halt its belligerent action and to fully abide by the terms of the Armistice Agreement.The United States is firmly committed to the defense of our ally, the Republic of Korea, and to the maintenance of regional peace and stability.9.38am: Tweet from Yonhap News, the publicly funded South Korean news agency, on South Korea's initial diplomatic response: (URGENT) South Korea indefinitely postpones Red Cross talks with North Korea slated for Thursday: official9.34am: Another marine has died following North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong island, taking the number of soldiers killed to two, Yonhap news agency is reporting. More shortly.9.31am: Potentially awkward moment in Guangzhou, China, this morning, where two South and North Korean archers stood side-by-side on the Asian Games podium as their countries fired shells at one another.South Korea's Yun Ok-hee won gold in the women's individual archery competition, while Kwon Un Sil from North Korea took bronze, and stood beside Yun when they received their medals.\"Kwon, wearing a red team jacket, and Yun, with a multicolored team top, both stood with their hands behind their backs before the medals were presented,\" AP reports.\"Yun waved her national flag to a crowd of South Korean fans and held it up as all three medalists stood for photos.\"9.23am: China, North Korea's only major ally, has expressed \"concern\" over the reports that North Korea has shelled a South Korean island, and called for six party talks on its nuclear aspirations to resume.A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hong Lei, told a news conference both sides of the divided Korean peninsula should \"do more to contribute to peace\", and said it was imperative to return to six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.\"We have heard reports and express our concern. The situation still needs to be confirmed,\" said Hong, responding to a question about the North Korean artillery attack.\"China hopes that the relevant parties will do more to contribute to peace and stability in the region,\" he added.\"It is imperative now to resume the six-party talks.\"China is North Korea's only major ally, and its economic and diplomatic support have been important to shoring up its otherwise isolated neighbour, whose leader Kim Jong-il visited China twice this year to strengthen ties. North Korea quit six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the US in April last year. The country has indicated it would return to talks on the condition it first gets face to face talks with the US. The Obama administration has so largely resisted.9.09am: This footage from CNN appears to show smoke rising from the Yeonpyeong, and buildings ablaze on the island: .9.02am: Tania Branigan emails from Beijing:The artillery attacks are a \"totally justifiable act of self-defence\" in response to the South's sea drills, an unofficial spokesman for North Korea has said, warning that nuclear war could follow \"at any point\" unless the exercises stop. Pyongyang has repeatedly issued such threats in the past.\"We repeatedly warned South Korea to stop its dangerous war games. If the South continues its dangerous behaviour, Seoul will be the next target. It will be a sea of fire. Nuclear war could start at any point,\" said Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace. He said it was fair to describe him as speaking on behalf of the North's government.He added: \"We have repeatedly warned the South to avoid endangering our territory on sea or air.\"8.56am: In the comments below, seoulman writes expressively of the mood in South Korea:I'm posting this from Seoul. Everyone is watching the news closely but there isn't any signs of panic. A few people, my girlfriend included have a sense of seeing this all before. I'm not trying to play it down, my arse went a bit when I heard the news but people are still going about there normal business.8.47am: Reports are suggesting the shelling has now ceased, but fires are still burning on Yeonpyeong.South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered officials to \"sternly respond\" to North Korea's action, but also called on officials to make sure that the \"situation would not escalate,\" a presidential official told Associated Press. Lee is holding a security meeting in a presidential situation room, the official said.North Korea's actions \"are illegal and a violation of the 1953 armistice agreement\" that ended the Korean War, a Joint Chiefs of Staff official said.He said South Korea responded to the shelling by firing a K-9 155mm self-propelled howitzer. However the JCS official declined to say whether North Korean territory was hit by the South Korean artillery.The official said island residents are escaping to about 20 shelters in the island.8.34am: Simon Tisdall, assistant editor of the Guardian and foreign affairs columnist, writes that North Korea is seeking \"acceptance by the great powers\":The sudden flareup in hostilities will be attributed to several factors. But as far as North Korea is concerned, one motive above all guides its behaviour: it desire for international attention.This has been largely lacking over the past year following the stalling of the six party talks, involving the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and China, on the regime's rogue nuclear and missile programmes.Pyongyang wants to hold face to face negotiations with the US alone but so far the Obama administration has largely resisted. The main difference is the agenda for any resumed talks, with Washington insistent that the aim must be the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.Today's violence follows the sinking earlier this year of a South Korean naval vessel, which was blamed on the North - though it denies involvement. This too was seen by analysts as a bid by the regime to get the world's attention.The North badly needs more international economic, development and food aid to bolster its chronically mismanaged economy. Its maverick leadership also seems to crave acceptance by the great powers. At present, paranoia reigns, amid constant claims tha the US is seeking regime change. This instability has been exacerbated by an apparent succession process in which the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il, is seeking to gradually transfer power to his youngest son.But regional analysts suggest that notwithstanding any steps he takes now, a fight for power could erupt when the ailing Kim dies. That struggle may already be underway and could involve members of the powerful military involved in triggering today's fighting.China, the North's only influential ally, has been urging the US to engage with the regime in order to defuse tensions. It has also held two summits with Kim this year. Chinese diplomats maintain Beijing has limited influence and are privately critical and alarmed, in equal measure, at the North's aggressive behaviour.8.24am: This footage from YTN television, based in South Korea, appears to show images of of the impact of the shells on Yeonpyeong island:.8.19am: More from Tania:Yonhap has also reported that the government is considering pulling South Korean nationals out of the North following the exchange of fire.We will decide whether we should evacuate them or not after looking into the safety of those at the Mount Kumgang resort and the Kaesong industrial park,\" the Unification Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Mount Kumgang is a tourist resort, while Kaesong is a joint enterprise zone. But both have experienced their share of trouble in the past \u2013 in 2008, a Northern soldier shot dead a Southern tourist after she wandered into a restricted zone at the beauty spot, while the Kaesong complex has struggled amid increasing friction on the peninsula. The official said officials would also reconsider plans to hold Red Cross talks with North Korea on Thursday in the South Korean border town of Munsan. Until last week, many had hoped that relations were thawing again after a long period of deterioration. The North was angered when President Lee took office in Seoul and adopted a tougher stance towards it than his predecessor, cutting off free-flowing aid.8.10am: Dr Park Young-Ho, from the Korea Institute for National Unification, has said he believes the shelling is an attempt by North Korea to \"turn this region into a conflict zone\".Although I can't be certain of the rationale behind North Korea's attacks yet, I see it as North Korea's intention to turn this region into a conflict zone so that it can bring the concerned parties to the discussion table.By showing that it has nuclear capacity and by firing artillery shells today, I think it is trying to make a point that it is militarily capable and thus should not be lightly regarded. Ultimately, I think it is strategically seeking to tilt talks concerning the contested Northern Limit Line and the peace treaty towards its advantage.7.54am: The Guardian's Tania Branigan reports:Seoul is examining whether the artillery attack is related to its drills near the western sea border, a spokeswoman for the presidential Blue House said today, according to Yonhap.Kim Hee-jung told reporters that officials were looking into the North's motive, adding: \"Our Navy was conducting a maritime exercise near the western sea border today. North Korea has sent a letter of protest over the drill. We're examining a possible link between the protest and the artillery attack.\"South Korea's president Lee Myung-bak has told senior officials that the government must \"carefully manage the situation to prevent the escalation of the clash,\" another spokesperson said.He is due to hold an emergency meeting of ministers at an underground bunker in Seoul shortly, his aide Park Jung-ha added.7.44am: North Korea started firing on South Korean waters off the island of Yeonpyeong at around 2.34pm local time, some of them landing directly on the island, Yonhap news agency is reporting.Col Lee Bung-woo, spokesman for South Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff told Yonhap the South had fired back some 80 rounds.The military is on its highest peacetime alert, he said, adding that the South Korean air force has deployed fighter jets to the island.7.36am: Yonhap News, the South Korean publicly funded news agency, is reporting that one South Korean soldier has been killed in the shelling. Yonhap quotes an unnamed official. We'll hopefully have more information soon.7.30am: North Korea has fired dozens of rounds of artillery onto a populated South Korean island near their disputed western border, military officials have said.The shells have set several buildings on fire, reportedly injuring two people, and have prompted South Korea to return fire and scramble fighter jets.The skirmish came amid tension over North Korea's claim that it has a new uranium enrichment facility and just over a month after North Korean leader Kim Jong Il unveiled his youngest son Kim Jong Un as his heir apparent.South Korea's YTN television has said two people were injured, several houses were on fire and shells are still falling on Yeonpyeong island. The station is broadcasting pictures of thick columns of black smoke rising from the island.Yonhap news agency, quoting a military official, says four soldiers have been wounded. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered officials to make sure that the firing wouldn't escalate, according to Yonhap, quoting a presidential official. YTN said between 1,200 and 1,300 people live on the island.A South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff official said dozens of rounds of artillery landed on the island and in the sea. The official says South Korea fired back. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of JCS rules, said South Korea's military is on alert. He had no other details, and could not confirm the reports of casualties.Tensions between the two Koreas also remain tense after the sinking in March of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died. Seoul has blamed a North Korean torpedo, while Pyongyang has denied any responsibility. The countries' western maritime boundary has long been a flash point between the two Koreas. The North does not recognize the border that was unilaterally drawn by the United Nations at the close of the 1950-53 Korean War.North and South Korea have fought three bloody skirmishes near the maritime border in recent years, most recently in November 2009.", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea fires on South Korea \u2013 live coverage"},{"date": "2010-11-30T10:40:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The US has snubbed Chinese proposals to ease the Korean confrontation through emergency multiparty talks including the North, with a White House spokesman dismissing the suggestion as a \"PR activity\".Beijing had called for the talks by the six parties involved in the stalled North Korean aid-for-denuclearisation discussions after a Northern artillery barrage killed four people, including two civilians, on a Southern island of Yeonpyeong. Tensions on the peninsula are at their highest for years, with joint military drills by the US and the South under way in the Yellow Sea today.The White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, told reporters: \"The United States and a host of others, I don't think, are not interested in stabilising the region through a series of PR activities.\"According to the New York Times, he added that talks \"without an understanding and agreement from the North Koreans to both end their behaviour as they exhibited last week, but also to come to the table with a seriousness of purpose on the denuclearisation issue \u2013 without that seriousness of purpose, they're just a PR activity\".Seoul has indicated its lack of interest, and Japan's foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, said last night that such talks were \"impossible\" after the Yeonpyeong shelling.South Korea said today its officials would meet counterparts from Japan and the US in Washington early next month to discuss the North's expanded nuclear programme, the attack on Yeonpyeong and a Chinese proposal for emergency talks.China repeated its call for dialogue, with the foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, telling a regular press briefing: \"Bringing the issue back to dialogue and consultation at an early date is in the common interest of all parties and is the common aspiration of the international community. Ensuring the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula is the shared responsibility of all sides.\"Hong said China had made the proposal \"to ease the situation\" and to provide a platform for dialogue.Beijing has come under intense pressure to rein in its neighbour and ally over the attack, near the disputed maritime border of the two Koreas. It has refrained from criticising Pyongyang \u2013 which says it acted in response to the South's live-fire exercise \u2013 instead urging both sides to show restraint.US diplomatic cables revealed today by the Guardian and other WikiLeaks partners show China's frustration with the North. According to the documents, a south Korean official \"claimed [high-level Chinese officials] believed Korea should be unified under ROK [South Korean] control\". Another told the US Pyongyang was acting like a \"spoiled child\" to get Washington's attention.China does not want instability and a flood of refugees, and analysts believe it would be deeply unhappy to see a US-dominated Korea on its doorstep.South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that president Lee Myung-bak had rebuked his cabinet members for not having the \"right sense of crisis\".The government has been heavily criticised at home, with some commentators saying it mishandled the initial response to the artillery bombardment. The defence minister resigned last week.According to a spokeswoman for his office, Lee told his colleagues: \"We should recognise that (South Korea) is confronting the world's most belligerent group.\"He added that there seemed to be a perception that dealing with a national crisis was a task only for the defence ministry, when it should be a matter for all of them.The high stakes in the confrontation were underscored when North Korea detailed its increased nuclear programme for the first time today, saying it had thousands of centrifuges. It added that these were for peaceful purposes. It announced the expansion in an article in the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, carried by state news agency KCNA.Officials in Pyongyang had sought to send a message to the US by showing an American scientist a new uranium enrichment plant this month. He said the \"stunning\" facility had 2,000 centrifuges.Enriching uranium gives the North a second source to make nuclear bombs. It has twice tested devices, to international anger.A senior North Korean official arrived in Beijing this morning for a five-day visit.

Analysts warned that could increase tensions.China's foreign minister called for restraint and said all parties should avoid any actions that could \"inflame the situation\".\"Our general goal is for all sides to exercise calm and restraint and to make every effort to avoid such incidents recurring,\" Yang Jiechi said.He said that China, North Korea's main ally, did not seek to \"protect any side\" and would not \"pour oil on the flames\", according to the country's official Xinhua news agency.Yonhap said the military had issued an advisory notice to local vessels for a six-day period from next Monday. Daecheong island \u2013 just south of the disputed Yellow Sea border \u2013 is included, although Yeonpyeong is not, according to officials from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Administration.The news agency cited government sources as saying separate artillery drills would take place in waters off Yeonpyeong soon. Reuters said the defence ministry would not comment.A South Korean joint chiefs of staff officer said Seoul and Washington were discussing whether to conduct more joint military drills this month or early next month.Analysts believe the most likely outcome of the current standoff is further negotiations, and that North Korea's actions are in part intended to push Seoul and Washington back towards talks based on giving the North aid in exchange for a pledge on scaling back its nuclear capabilities.The US has described its participation in this week's manoeuvres as a deterrent, while the South's defence minister warned there was an \"ample possibility\" of a provocation by the North following the departure of US warships.But some analysts warned that more military drills could escalate a delicate situation.\"The overall situation might be intensified and a new crisis might be brought by doing this,\" said Professor Chu Shulong, an expert on international security at Beijing's Tsinghua University.He added: \"Because of the Cheonan incident in March and the shelling in Yeonpyeong, [South Korean] people are angry and their anger has not been addressed yet. They are not happy with the reaction of the government.\"At the same time, South Korea cannot attack North Korea. They can only express their anger through military drills; it is their only way to show the determination to defend their country and to warn the North.\"Dr Leonid Petrov, an expert on the North at the University of Sydney, added: \"Conservatives in Pyongyang and Seoul are driving the situation to a new extreme.\"He added that the \"responsible\" course for the US would be to talk to the North.Beijing \u2013 under pressure to rein in its ally \u2013 threw the ball back into Washington's court by calling for an emergency meeting of the six nations involved in the stalled aid-for-denuclearisation talks.But the US, South Korea and Japan have snubbed that proposal, instead planning to hold trilateral talks next week.Japan sent its envoy to the nuclear talks to China today. The senior North Korean leader Choe Thae Bok is currently in Beijing and China's state councillor Dai Bingguo is expected to travel to Pyongyang shortly.A Russian nuclear envoy, Grigory Logvinov, will meet officials in Seoul to discuss the attack, the six-party talks and other issues, said South Korea's foreign ministry.", "tags": ["North Korea", "World news", "South Korea", "China", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea highly likely to attack again, South Korea warns"},{"date": "2010-11-29T01:55:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "South Korea's president said early this morning he felt responsibility for failing to protect citizens from North Korea's shelling last week and warned the North against further provocations.Lee Myung-bak described Tuesday's shelling of a tiny South Korean island, which killed four people, as an \"inhumane crime\".As Lee spoke, a nuclear-powered US supercarrier and a South Korean destroyer held joint military exercises. The show of force came almost a week after the attack on Yeonpyeong Island killed four, including two civilians, and sent tensions soaring in the region.China has called for a meeting of the six nations involved in the stalled North Korean denuclearisation talks.South Korea and Japan gave a tepid response to the proposal today. Analysts believe negotiations are the most plausible outcome of the conflict, but predict it will take time for the parties to come to the table. The North Korean artillery attack was the most serious incident since the sinking of a warship by what was found to be a North Korean torpedo.Media in Seoul reported today that the North had placed missiles on launch pads in the Yellow Sea, as the South and the US mounted a show of force with joint military drills in the area.Beijing, which objected to the exercises, sought a return to diplomacy, with its nuclear envoy calling for an urgent meeting with the nuclear negotiators from North and South Korea, Japan, the US and Russia. Wu Dawei said it would not be a resumption of the six-party talks but might \"help create the conditions\" for them to restart.Seoul said it would \"carefully consider\" China's suggestion, a remark read by many as in effect a rejection. President Lee Myung-bak's office said earlier that he had told a visiting Chinese delegation Beijing should contribute to peace in a \"more objective and responsible\" manner.China, the North's main ally, has not criticised Pyongyang over Tuesday's attack, merely urging all those involved to show restraint. Critics say it should be pushing harder, given the North's dependence on Chinese food and energy.\"I can see why China is doing this: 'We don't want war; we don't want to put pressure on North Korea',\" said James Hoare, former British charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Pyongyang. \"It would be a good thing if they did start talking, but I think it will take a little bit more time before anything will happen.\"I suspect in the end it won't quite blow over, but it will calm down and the two sides will find some formula to back away from the immediate confrontation.\"Andrei Lankov, an expert on the region at Kookmin University in Seoul, believed the six-party talks would resume \"sooner or later\" but suggested they were largely irrelevant to the current crisis, because the real question was whether and when South Korea and the US would provide more aid to the North. \"This is a protection racket \u2013 you pay the local toughs, and if you don't your windows are going to be broken,\" he said.Relations on the peninsula deteriorated sharply when Lee took office in 2008 and cut off free-flowing aid to the North. But Tuesday's attack marked a new level of hostility. The North said that civilian deaths \"if true \u2026 [are] very regrettable\", but blamed the South for using its citizens as human shields. It also accused the US of setting up Tuesday's incident to justify today's drills.The drills are the largest of their kind yet, according to the South's Yonhap news agency, involving an aircraft carrier carrying 75 planes and at least four other warships. But US military officials said the training was routine and no live-fire exercises were planned. According to South Korean media they are taking place far south of the disputed maritime border.Pyongyang's National Peace Committee said in a statement that the manoeuvres were creating \"a state of ultra-emergency\". It also renewed its threat of \"merciless counter-military strikes\", although it often makes similar warnings ahead of such exercises.Yonhap said North Korea had moved surface-to-surface missiles to frontline areas, but military and government officials said they could not comment.\"It is impossible to confirm the report as it is classified as a military secret,\" one told Reuters.An unidentified government source also told Yonhap that the North had deployed surface-to-air missiles along its western coastline, apparently targeting fighting jets near the disputed Yellow Sea border.Yesterday, South Korea's marine commander vowed \"thousand-fold\" revenge if the North attacked again.Earlier today the South Korean government ordered journalists to leave Yeonpyeong for safety reasons, but bad weather forced it to abort an attempted evacuation, leaving about 400 people there.", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "China", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "South Korea warns North Korea against further provocation"},{"date": "2010-12-14T17:00:01Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Having gained the world's attention by briefly waging war on South Korean territory last month, North Korea has reverted, for now, to a more familiar tactic \u2013 a war of nerves fed by vitriolic propaganda, threats and tantrums, underpinned by a policy of studied unpredictability.Pyongyang maintained its confrontational drumbeat this week. Rodong Sinmun, the main party organ, declared enhanced US-South Korean military co-operation to be \"nothing but treachery, escalating the tension \u2026 and bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean peninsula\".And today's disclosure by South Korea that the North may have built up to four additional facilities for nuclear weapons-related uranium enrichment is unlikely to calm the febrile atmosphere. The intelligence suggests the regime is hell-bent on maximising its nuclear capabilities, notwithstanding any future disarmament talks.In this tense game of diplomatic-military poker, South Korea is not even the North's principal adversary. Kim Jong-il is now blithely defying all the major regional actors \u2013 the US, China, Russia and Japan \u2013 while actively exploiting differences between them. It makes little difference whether his aim is recognition and security guarantees; economic and financial assistance; or the succession of his son. Kim is playing off the great powers against each other, to see what he can get out of them. The result is virtual diplomatic meltdown.Just look at what has happened since last month's bombardment of Yeonpyeong island. China, the North's only influential ally, has come under strong US pressure to pull its supposed client into line. China's perceived failure to do so is straining relations with Washington. James Steinberg, the US deputy secretary of state, visited Beijing today carrying the message: China must do more, fast.Resentful of such criticism, but simultaneously alarmed at the North's unruly behaviour (which it says it cannot ultimately control), China sent a top envoy, Dai Bingguo, to Pyongyang last week. In a bland statement bordering on meaninglessness, the foreign ministry claimed today the visit achieved consensus: \"The two sides believe that parties should keep calm and exercise restraint, take a responsible attitude to avoid further escalation of tensions, and play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability on the peninsula.\"China insists a resumption of the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programme is the best way forward. Pyongyang would probably support this if the negotiations, broken off last year, restarted without preconditions. The US, Japan and South Korea, on the other hand, oppose rewarding Kim's \"bad behaviour\", and are demanding a range of prior assurances. So the impasse persists \u2013 and the North has no incentive to change its ways.Russia, a party to the talks, is hardly doing any better. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told his North Korean counterpart, Pak Ui-chun, yesterday that Moscow was deeply concerned by recent events. Last month's attack \"deserves condemnation\", he said. But then Lavrov grew placatory, agreeing that US-South Korean military exercises were inflaming tensions, a view shared by China.For his part, Pak, unfazed by this mild reprimand, told the Russian news agency Interfax that the \"hostile and confrontational policy\" of the US and South Korea justified \"strengthening our defence potential with a focus on nuclear deterrent forces\".Evidently worried by the North's defiant insouciance, Russia announced today it had raised the alert status of its forces in the country's far east. \"Without a doubt, we have taken measures to increase the combat-readiness of our forces,\" a military spokesman said, adding the army was \"continuing to monitor\" the situation.Differences of approach are also evident between Japan and South Korea, suspicious old enemies yet to be fully united in a common cause. In South Korea itself, the fallout from last month's attack has been damaging, prompting financial market jitters, the resignation of the army chief and the defence minister, and severe criticism of President Lee Myung-bak. If the North's aim was to sow confusion, it has succeeded \u2013 and not only in Seoul.Two things seem clear from all of this: first, that the various parties to this crisis need to form a united front if they are to have any chance of inducing the North to behave more responsibly. Second, that at present they are incapable of doing so.Maybe it's time for a fresh approach. Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico and an experienced freelance mediator who specialised in rogue regimes under Bill Clinton, is due in Pyongyang on Thursday. In his time Richardson has dealt face-to-face with the likes of Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, Sudan's Omar al-Bashir and the North Koreans. Perhaps he will have more luck than the diplomats in bringing order to chaos.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "South Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "China", "Japan", "Russia", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Now North Korea defies even China | Simon Tisdall"},{"date": "2010-11-23T07:36:20Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "4.30pm: That's it for today, thanks for reading and for the comments. Tania has just filed a story on today's events:South Korea warned today that it will unleash \"enormous retaliation\" if North Korea launches fresh attacks against its territory.North Korean troops bombarded Yeonpyeong, an island in disputed waters, with dozens of rounds of artillery earlier today, reportedly killing two South Korean soldiers and injuring around 20 people.Seoul placed its military on its highest non-wartime alert level, scrambling F-16 fighter jets to the western sea and returning fire, officials said. It warned that the attack was a violation of the armistice that ended the Korean war in 1953.The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, who convened an emergency security meeting shortly after the initial bombardment, said an \"indiscriminate attack on civilians\" could never be tolerated.\"Enormous retaliation should be made, to the extent that [North Korea] cannot make provocations again,\" he said.The assault is one of the most serious in the decades since the war, given the involvement of civilians, although previous firefights around the disputed maritime border have resulted in a higher number of casualties.In a short statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, the North said the South had fired first \u2013 presumably in reference to a live-fire drill being carried out as part of annual military exercises. It said it had repeatedly warned the South not to go ahead with the drill.... Read more here.2.40pm: The President of South Korea has said he believes \"enormous retaliation is going to be necessary to make North Korea incapable of provoking us again\".Quoted by Yonhap news agency, Lee Myung-bak said: \"Reckless attacks on South Korean civilians are not tolerable, especially when South Korea is providing North Korea with humanitarian aid.\"\"As for such attacks on civilians, a response beyond the rule of engagement is necessary. \"Our military should show this through action rather than an administrative response,\" he added.Lee did not rule out the possibility of follow-up attacks.\"Given that North Korea maintains an offensive posture, I think the Army, the Navy and the Air Force should unite and retaliate against [the North's] provocation with multiple-fold firepower,\" Lee said. \"I think enormous retaliation is going to be necessary to make North Korea incapable of provoking us again.\"2.00pm: My colleague Simon Rogers has used a 2007 report by the Congressional Research Service, to map out the 150 incidents which have occurred between North and South Korea since the Korea War in 1950.You can read more on the Guardian's Datablog and see the incidents across North and South Korea here:1.38pm: Justin McCurry reports from Osaka on Japan's reaction to this morning's developments \u2013 Japan being one of the countries involved in the stalled six-party talks.The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, has instructed government colleagues to be prepared \"for any contingency\" in the wake of North Korea's attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong earlier today.Kan said he had told his cabinet to \"put all efforts into gathering information and ... to prepare to be able to respond firmly to any eventuality.\"Japan's efforts will, for the time being, be limited to information gathering \u2013 in any case its \"pacifist\" constitution forbids it from mobilizing forces in response to an attack on an ally.An escalation in hostilities on the Korean peninsula would, however, force Tokyo to make contingencies for a potential flood of refugees across the Sea of Japan.Nevertheless Japan, which is still trying to establish the whereabouts of several of its nationals abducted by Pyongyang agents at the height of the cold war, considers itself near the top of North Korea's list of potential targets.A foreign ministry official in Tokyo quoted by the Kyodo news agency described the shellings as \"dangerous\" and \"provocative\".1.16pm: News of the exchange of fire has sent the South Korean currency tumbling, with the won currently down 3.5% on the US dollar.The South Korean central bank, after an emergency meeting, says it planned to co-operate with the government to take measures to stabilise markets if necessary. Many traders expect South Korea's financial markets to fall further when trading opens tomorrow.However the drop against the dollar should be seen in the context of the dollar spiking in reaction to the news of the shelling \u2013 as my colleague Graeme Wearden, who knows much more about such matters, reported in our 11.02am post.12.22pm: Mark Tran, Guardian colleague specialising in international news, has been mulling over the events of this morning. He says the key to rehabilitating North Korea into the international community lies with the US:North Korea is a case of what Richard Nixon used to describe as the madman theory of politics, designed to keep opponents off balance. This is how Nixon described his approach \u2013 when he was trying to extricate the US from Vietnam \u2013 to his chief of staff Bob Hadelman.Nixon said: \"I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, 'for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry -- and he has his hand on the nuclear button' -- and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.\"This time it's not Nixon acting crazy, it's the North Korean leadership. Yet there is some method behind the madness for North Korea. As Simon Tisdall wrote below, North Korea has consistently pursued a fundamental objective \u2013 a non-aggression pact with the US. But as far as the US is concerned, it has no intention with rewarding North Korea's \"bad behaviour\" with a peace treaty. Bill Clinton tried the carrot approach in the 1990s when he agreed to provide aid to Pyongyang in exchange for North Korea's commitment to stop its nuclear programme under the 1994 \"agreed framework\". That deal eventually broke down with both sides blaming each other. When George Bush became president, his administration dismissed the Clinton approach as appeasement. But eventually he adopted a less confrontational approach not so different from Clinton's, only to see the North Koreans testing its first nuclear weapon in 2006. Since then it's been a roller-coaster, with signs of progress interspersed setbacks. Meanwhile, South Korea under Lee Myung-bak, who became president in 2008, ditched his predecessor's conciliatory \"sunshine policy\" for a more hard-headed approach, reinforcing North Korea's sense of isolation. The key lies with the US, which can offer only what North Korea wants. But it's difficult for Barack Obama to show flexibility when the North Koreans behave so provocatively.11.50am: Time for a bit of a recap after a tumultuous morning.\u2022 Two South Korean marines have died after North Korea fired shells at on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong. South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff said 16 others were injured during the bombardment of the island, which is located near the countries' disputed western border.\u2022 South Korea returned fire and scrambled fighter jets in response to the attack. North Korea has not confirmed whether it suffered any losses. South Korea has accused its neighbour of an \"intentional and planned attack\", and said North Korea's action violated the 1953 armistice between the two countries.\u2022 North Korea has issued a robust response, accusing South Korea of firing first and saying it was provoked into taking action. South Korea was undertaking an annual military drill before North Korea fired. \"Despite our repeated warnings, South Korea fired dozens of shells from 1pm ... and we've taken strong military action immediately,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said.\u2022 The international community has criticised North Korea, with the White House describing the attack as \"belligerent\". In the UK, foreign secretary William Hague said the attack was \"unprovoked\" and said the country \"strongly condemns\" it. A senior Russian Foreign Ministry official said North Korea's action was \"absolutely unacceptable\".\u2022 China, North Korea's only major ally, expressed \"concern\" over the initial reports, but called on both Koreas to \"do more to contribute to peace\". A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was now \"imperative to resume six-party talks\". North Korea quit talks with South Korea, the US, China, Russia and Japan in April last year.11.23am: William Hague, the foreign secretary, has put out a statement condemning the attack on South Korea.The UK strongly condemns North Korea's unprovoked attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong Island. Such unprovoked attacks will only lead to further tensions on the Korean Peninsula. We strongly urge North Korea to refrain from such attacks and adhere to the Korean Armistice agreement. I welcome President Lee Myung-bak's call for restraint.11.02am: My colleague Graeme Wearden reports that the military action alarmed the stockmarkets this morning:With markets already nervous following the political crisis in Ireland, news of the shelling helped to send shares falling sharply when trading began. The FTSE fell by 66 points at one stage to 5614, down 1.1%, and there were similar falls in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The dollar also spiked (traders typically run to the [perceived] safety of the greenback when bombs start to fall).The South Korean Won was hit hard, falling 3.75% against the dollar, and other Asian currencies also fell.There was also a significant leap in the cost of insuring South Korean government debt -- with its five-year credit default swap jumping by 18 basis points to 102bp. That still makes South Korean debt a very safe bet, though (the Irish CDS is more than five times higher).A rumour travelled around the City this morning that North Korea's attack had been prompted by the death of Kim Jong-il \u2013 perhaps to prove to the world that the country was still in firm hands.Neil Hume, the editor of FT Alphaville, tweeted the speculation: \"@humenm: Warning broker RAW: Unconfirmed chat that kim jung-il has died. Prompts the shelling from north korea as being reported by newswires.\"Most raw gossip from stockbrokers should treated extremely cautiously, of course.10.43am: Tania Branigan has more on the events that preceded shells being fired \u2013\u00a0when South Korea was undertaking military drills close to Yeonpyeong.The North Korean artillery attack followed a live-fire exercise by the South as part of its annual Hoguk military drills.The Korea Herald reported that the North faxed a message to the South this morning saying it would not \"just sit back\" while the South carried out the exercise, citing military officials.The Korea Times reported last week that the US had pulled out of the joint drill citing scheduling conflicts, but had said it would seek to rearrange the exercise.10.36am: North Korea has accused South Korea of firing first, saying it was provoked into the military action, which has killed two soldiers in the South and set dozens of houses ablaze. \"Despite our repeated warnings, South Korea fired dozens of shells from 1pm ... and we've taken strong military action immediately,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said in a brief statement. It did not elaborate whether North Korea had suffered any losses from the exchange of fire.10.25am: South Korea's defence ministry has said North Korea's firing of artillery shells voilated the armistice between the two countries.\"This is an intentional and planned attack... and it is clearly in violation of the armistice,\" Lee Hong-ki, South Korea's defence ministry official, told reporters.10.03am: This map shows just how close the island of Yeonpyeon is to North and South Korea's disputed border.9.58am: Reuters news agency is now also reporting that two South Korean marines have been killed.Quoting South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, it says four more soldiers have been seriously injured on Yeonpyeong island.9.50am: The White House has issued a statement describing North Korea's action as \"belligerent\" and reinforcing US support for South Korea:The United States strongly condemns this attack and calls on North Korea to halt its belligerent action and to fully abide by the terms of the Armistice Agreement.The United States is firmly committed to the defense of our ally, the Republic of Korea, and to the maintenance of regional peace and stability.9.38am: Tweet from Yonhap News, the publicly funded South Korean news agency, on South Korea's initial diplomatic response: (URGENT) South Korea indefinitely postpones Red Cross talks with North Korea slated for Thursday: official9.34am: Another marine has died following North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong island, taking the number of soldiers killed to two, Yonhap news agency is reporting. More shortly.9.31am: Potentially awkward moment in Guangzhou, China, this morning, where two South and North Korean archers stood side-by-side on the Asian Games podium as their countries fired shells at one another.South Korea's Yun Ok-hee won gold in the women's individual archery competition, while Kwon Un Sil from North Korea took bronze, and stood beside Yun when they received their medals.\"Kwon, wearing a red team jacket, and Yun, with a multicolored team top, both stood with their hands behind their backs before the medals were presented,\" AP reports.\"Yun waved her national flag to a crowd of South Korean fans and held it up as all three medalists stood for photos.\"9.23am: China, North Korea's only major ally, has expressed \"concern\" over the reports that North Korea has shelled a South Korean island, and called for six party talks on its nuclear aspirations to resume.A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hong Lei, told a news conference both sides of the divided Korean peninsula should \"do more to contribute to peace\", and said it was imperative to return to six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.\"We have heard reports and express our concern. The situation still needs to be confirmed,\" said Hong, responding to a question about the North Korean artillery attack.\"China hopes that the relevant parties will do more to contribute to peace and stability in the region,\" he added.\"It is imperative now to resume the six-party talks.\"China is North Korea's only major ally, and its economic and diplomatic support have been important to shoring up its otherwise isolated neighbour, whose leader Kim Jong-il visited China twice this year to strengthen ties. North Korea quit six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the US in April last year. The country has indicated it would return to talks on the condition it first gets face to face talks with the US. The Obama administration has so largely resisted.9.09am: This footage from CNN appears to show smoke rising from the Yeonpyeong, and buildings ablaze on the island: .9.02am: Tania Branigan emails from Beijing:The artillery attacks are a \"totally justifiable act of self-defence\" in response to the South's sea drills, an unofficial spokesman for North Korea has said, warning that nuclear war could follow \"at any point\" unless the exercises stop. Pyongyang has repeatedly issued such threats in the past.\"We repeatedly warned South Korea to stop its dangerous war games. If the South continues its dangerous behaviour, Seoul will be the next target. It will be a sea of fire. Nuclear war could start at any point,\" said Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace. He said it was fair to describe him as speaking on behalf of the North's government.He added: \"We have repeatedly warned the South to avoid endangering our territory on sea or air.\"8.56am: In the comments below, seoulman writes expressively of the mood in South Korea:I'm posting this from Seoul. Everyone is watching the news closely but there isn't any signs of panic. A few people, my girlfriend included have a sense of seeing this all before. I'm not trying to play it down, my arse went a bit when I heard the news but people are still going about there normal business.8.47am: Reports are suggesting the shelling has now ceased, but fires are still burning on Yeonpyeong.South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered officials to \"sternly respond\" to North Korea's action, but also called on officials to make sure that the \"situation would not escalate,\" a presidential official told Associated Press. Lee is holding a security meeting in a presidential situation room, the official said.North Korea's actions \"are illegal and a violation of the 1953 armistice agreement\" that ended the Korean War, a Joint Chiefs of Staff official said.He said South Korea responded to the shelling by firing a K-9 155mm self-propelled howitzer. However the JCS official declined to say whether North Korean territory was hit by the South Korean artillery.The official said island residents are escaping to about 20 shelters in the island.8.34am: Simon Tisdall, assistant editor of the Guardian and foreign affairs columnist, writes that North Korea is seeking \"acceptance by the great powers\":The sudden flareup in hostilities will be attributed to several factors. But as far as North Korea is concerned, one motive above all guides its behaviour: it desire for international attention.This has been largely lacking over the past year following the stalling of the six party talks, involving the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and China, on the regime's rogue nuclear and missile programmes.Pyongyang wants to hold face to face negotiations with the US alone but so far the Obama administration has largely resisted. The main difference is the agenda for any resumed talks, with Washington insistent that the aim must be the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.Today's violence follows the sinking earlier this year of a South Korean naval vessel, which was blamed on the North - though it denies involvement. This too was seen by analysts as a bid by the regime to get the world's attention.The North badly needs more international economic, development and food aid to bolster its chronically mismanaged economy. Its maverick leadership also seems to crave acceptance by the great powers. At present, paranoia reigns, amid constant claims tha the US is seeking regime change. This instability has been exacerbated by an apparent succession process in which the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il, is seeking to gradually transfer power to his youngest son.But regional analysts suggest that notwithstanding any steps he takes now, a fight for power could erupt when the ailing Kim dies. That struggle may already be underway and could involve members of the powerful military involved in triggering today's fighting.China, the North's only influential ally, has been urging the US to engage with the regime in order to defuse tensions. It has also held two summits with Kim this year. Chinese diplomats maintain Beijing has limited influence and are privately critical and alarmed, in equal measure, at the North's aggressive behaviour.8.24am: This footage from YTN television, based in South Korea, appears to show images of of the impact of the shells on Yeonpyeong island:.8.19am: More from Tania:Yonhap has also reported that the government is considering pulling South Korean nationals out of the North following the exchange of fire.We will decide whether we should evacuate them or not after looking into the safety of those at the Mount Kumgang resort and the Kaesong industrial park,\" the Unification Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Mount Kumgang is a tourist resort, while Kaesong is a joint enterprise zone. But both have experienced their share of trouble in the past \u2013 in 2008, a Northern soldier shot dead a Southern tourist after she wandered into a restricted zone at the beauty spot, while the Kaesong complex has struggled amid increasing friction on the peninsula. The official said officials would also reconsider plans to hold Red Cross talks with North Korea on Thursday in the South Korean border town of Munsan. Until last week, many had hoped that relations were thawing again after a long period of deterioration. The North was angered when President Lee took office in Seoul and adopted a tougher stance towards it than his predecessor, cutting off free-flowing aid.8.10am: Dr Park Young-Ho, from the Korea Institute for National Unification, has said he believes the shelling is an attempt by North Korea to \"turn this region into a conflict zone\".Although I can't be certain of the rationale behind North Korea's attacks yet, I see it as North Korea's intention to turn this region into a conflict zone so that it can bring the concerned parties to the discussion table.By showing that it has nuclear capacity and by firing artillery shells today, I think it is trying to make a point that it is militarily capable and thus should not be lightly regarded. Ultimately, I think it is strategically seeking to tilt talks concerning the contested Northern Limit Line and the peace treaty towards its advantage.7.54am: The Guardian's Tania Branigan reports:Seoul is examining whether the artillery attack is related to its drills near the western sea border, a spokeswoman for the presidential Blue House said today, according to Yonhap.Kim Hee-jung told reporters that officials were looking into the North's motive, adding: \"Our Navy was conducting a maritime exercise near the western sea border today. North Korea has sent a letter of protest over the drill. We're examining a possible link between the protest and the artillery attack.\"South Korea's president Lee Myung-bak has told senior officials that the government must \"carefully manage the situation to prevent the escalation of the clash,\" another spokesperson said.He is due to hold an emergency meeting of ministers at an underground bunker in Seoul shortly, his aide Park Jung-ha added.7.44am: North Korea started firing on South Korean waters off the island of Yeonpyeong at around 2.34pm local time, some of them landing directly on the island, Yonhap news agency is reporting.Col Lee Bung-woo, spokesman for South Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff told Yonhap the South had fired back some 80 rounds.The military is on its highest peacetime alert, he said, adding that the South Korean air force has deployed fighter jets to the island.7.36am: Yonhap News, the South Korean publicly funded news agency, is reporting that one South Korean soldier has been killed in the shelling. Yonhap quotes an unnamed official. We'll hopefully have more information soon.7.30am: North Korea has fired dozens of rounds of artillery onto a populated South Korean island near their disputed western border, military officials have said.The shells have set several buildings on fire, reportedly injuring two people, and have prompted South Korea to return fire and scramble fighter jets.The skirmish came amid tension over North Korea's claim that it has a new uranium enrichment facility and just over a month after North Korean leader Kim Jong Il unveiled his youngest son Kim Jong Un as his heir apparent.South Korea's YTN television has said two people were injured, several houses were on fire and shells are still falling on Yeonpyeong island. The station is broadcasting pictures of thick columns of black smoke rising from the island.Yonhap news agency, quoting a military official, says four soldiers have been wounded. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered officials to make sure that the firing wouldn't escalate, according to Yonhap, quoting a presidential official. YTN said between 1,200 and 1,300 people live on the island.A South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff official said dozens of rounds of artillery landed on the island and in the sea. The official says South Korea fired back. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of JCS rules, said South Korea's military is on alert. He had no other details, and could not confirm the reports of casualties.Tensions between the two Koreas also remain tense after the sinking in March of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died. Seoul has blamed a North Korean torpedo, while Pyongyang has denied any responsibility. The countries' western maritime boundary has long been a flash point between the two Koreas. The North does not recognize the border that was unilaterally drawn by the United Nations at the close of the 1950-53 Korean War.North and South Korea have fought three bloody skirmishes near the maritime border in recent years, most recently in November 2009.", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea fires on South Korea \u2013 live coverage"},{"date": "2010-11-30T10:40:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The US has snubbed Chinese proposals to ease the Korean confrontation through emergency multiparty talks including the North, with a White House spokesman dismissing the suggestion as a \"PR activity\".Beijing had called for the talks by the six parties involved in the stalled North Korean aid-for-denuclearisation discussions after a Northern artillery barrage killed four people, including two civilians, on a Southern island of Yeonpyeong. Tensions on the peninsula are at their highest for years, with joint military drills by the US and the South under way in the Yellow Sea today.The White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, told reporters: \"The United States and a host of others, I don't think, are not interested in stabilising the region through a series of PR activities.\"According to the New York Times, he added that talks \"without an understanding and agreement from the North Koreans to both end their behaviour as they exhibited last week, but also to come to the table with a seriousness of purpose on the denuclearisation issue \u2013 without that seriousness of purpose, they're just a PR activity\".Seoul has indicated its lack of interest, and Japan's foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, said last night that such talks were \"impossible\" after the Yeonpyeong shelling.South Korea said today its officials would meet counterparts from Japan and the US in Washington early next month to discuss the North's expanded nuclear programme, the attack on Yeonpyeong and a Chinese proposal for emergency talks.China repeated its call for dialogue, with the foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, telling a regular press briefing: \"Bringing the issue back to dialogue and consultation at an early date is in the common interest of all parties and is the common aspiration of the international community. Ensuring the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula is the shared responsibility of all sides.\"Hong said China had made the proposal \"to ease the situation\" and to provide a platform for dialogue.Beijing has come under intense pressure to rein in its neighbour and ally over the attack, near the disputed maritime border of the two Koreas. It has refrained from criticising Pyongyang \u2013 which says it acted in response to the South's live-fire exercise \u2013 instead urging both sides to show restraint.US diplomatic cables revealed today by the Guardian and other WikiLeaks partners show China's frustration with the North. According to the documents, a south Korean official \"claimed [high-level Chinese officials] believed Korea should be unified under ROK [South Korean] control\". Another told the US Pyongyang was acting like a \"spoiled child\" to get Washington's attention.China does not want instability and a flood of refugees, and analysts believe it would be deeply unhappy to see a US-dominated Korea on its doorstep.South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that president Lee Myung-bak had rebuked his cabinet members for not having the \"right sense of crisis\".The government has been heavily criticised at home, with some commentators saying it mishandled the initial response to the artillery bombardment. The defence minister resigned last week.According to a spokeswoman for his office, Lee told his colleagues: \"We should recognise that (South Korea) is confronting the world's most belligerent group.\"He added that there seemed to be a perception that dealing with a national crisis was a task only for the defence ministry, when it should be a matter for all of them.The high stakes in the confrontation were underscored when North Korea detailed its increased nuclear programme for the first time today, saying it had thousands of centrifuges. It added that these were for peaceful purposes. It announced the expansion in an article in the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, carried by state news agency KCNA.Officials in Pyongyang had sought to send a message to the US by showing an American scientist a new uranium enrichment plant this month. He said the \"stunning\" facility had 2,000 centrifuges.Enriching uranium gives the North a second source to make nuclear bombs.

But such an urgent intervention from China, North Korea's only significant ally and the sole outside country with any sway over its actions, is significant, not least in underlining the gravity of the situation.The Seoul-based Yonhap news agency reported that Pyongyang had placed surface-to-surface missiles on launch pads along its Yellow Sea coastline. The North's military is also aiming surface-to-air missiles at South Korean fighter jets flying near the western sea border, the agency added.Two South Korean marines and two civilians died on Tuesday when the North unleashed, without warning, an artillery barrage on Yeonpyeong island, which hosts both a military garrison and a small fishing community. The attack, seen as the most serious single military incident since the end of the war, destroyed dozens of homes , injured another 18 people, and set the South on a war footing.North Korea described the civilian deaths as \"regrettable\" but blamed the South for placing residents on the island, which Pyongyang insists is North Korean territory, as human shields. The North also condemned a major US-South Korea military drill in the Yellow Sea, which began today.The four-day exercise, involving the USS George Washington aircraft carrier, is believed to be taking place about 100 miles south of Yeonpyeong. While Seoul insists the exercise is both routine and pre-planned, the North's National Peace Committee of Korea described it as \"pretext for aggression and ignite a war at any cost\".Pyongyang issued a series of warnings, and threatened to \"give a shower of dreadful fire and blow up the bulwark of the enemies if they dare to encroach again upon [North Korea's] dignity and sovereignty, even in the least.\"Seoul is being almost equally bellicose. At a funeral yesterday for the marines killed on Yeonpyeong, the South Korean military commander, Major-General You Nak-jun, laid flowers at an altar and vowed that his country would retaliate if there was a further attack from the North.\"Our marine corps ... will carry out a hundred \u2013 or thousand-fold\" in retaliation, he said at the ceremony. \"We will put our feelings of rage and animosity in our bones and take our revenge on North Korea.\"Dozens of journalists have ignored South Korean military warnings about staying on Yeonpyeong, which is seven miles from North Korean territory. They and locals sought cover today after hearing new bursts of artillery fire. No rounds landed on the island.Dai Bingguo, a senior Chinese foreign policy adviser, visited South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak. In unusually strong comments Lee made plain his concerns that Beijing was not exerting sufficient pressure on North Korea, calling on China to contribute to peace in a \"more objective, responsible\" manner.The chairman of North Korea's supreme people's assembly, Choe Thae Bok, is due to visit Beijing from Tuesday, China's official Xinhua news agency said.Since the Korean war ended, with a truce rather than a formal treaty, tensions between the two sides have risen and receded many times. However, the past year has seen particularly intense pressures, notably after a South Korean warship was sunk in March, killing 46 sailors. An international team of investigators concluded that a North Korean torpedo sank the vessel, although Pyongyang denies any involvement.The latest crisis has already cost the South Korean defence minister, Kim Tae-young, his job amid accusations that the response to North Korea's initial attack had been too weak. Now South Korea's president has sent 4,000 troops as reinforcements to Yeonpyeong and other nearby islands with extra weapons and new rules of engagement that give them greater scope to respond if attacked.", "tags": ["North Korea", "World news", "South Korea", "China", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Nuclear weapons", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "China calls for North Korea talks"},{"date": "2010-12-01T13:05:06Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is highly likely to attack again, South Korea's intelligence chief has told MPs, according to Seoul-based media.His remarks come a week after an artillery bombardment killed two civilians and two soldiers on Yeonpyeong island \u2013 and hours after the South announced fresh military manoeuvres.Won Sei-hoon, director of the National Intelligence Service, warned: \"There is a high possibility that the North will make another attack.\"He said the shelling had come amid domestic pressure in Pyongyang, telling a closed session of a parliamentary committee that \"internal complaints are growing about the North's succession for a third generation, and its economic situation is worsening\".Won also said a wire tap in August had indicated an attack in the West Sea, according to Yonhap news agency.Pyongyang said last week's bombardment was a response to the South's live-fire drill.Yonhap reported that South Korea planned to hold further artillery training exercises next week, including some in an area close to its disputed maritime border with the North. Analysts warned that could increase tensions.China's foreign minister called for restraint and said all parties should avoid any actions that could \"inflame the situation\".\"Our general goal is for all sides to exercise calm and restraint and to make every effort to avoid such incidents recurring,\" Yang Jiechi said.He said that China, North Korea's main ally, did not seek to \"protect any side\" and would not \"pour oil on the flames\", according to the country's official Xinhua news agency.Yonhap said the military had issued an advisory notice to local vessels for a six-day period from next Monday. Daecheong island \u2013 just south of the disputed Yellow Sea border \u2013 is included, although Yeonpyeong is not, according to officials from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Administration.The news agency cited government sources as saying separate artillery drills would take place in waters off Yeonpyeong soon. Reuters said the defence ministry would not comment.A South Korean joint chiefs of staff officer said Seoul and Washington were discussing whether to conduct more joint military drills this month or early next month.Analysts believe the most likely outcome of the current standoff is further negotiations, and that North Korea's actions are in part intended to push Seoul and Washington back towards talks based on giving the North aid in exchange for a pledge on scaling back its nuclear capabilities.The US has described its participation in this week's manoeuvres as a deterrent, while the South's defence minister warned there was an \"ample possibility\" of a provocation by the North following the departure of US warships.But some analysts warned that more military drills could escalate a delicate situation.\"The overall situation might be intensified and a new crisis might be brought by doing this,\" said Professor Chu Shulong, an expert on international security at Beijing's Tsinghua University.He added: \"Because of the Cheonan incident in March and the shelling in Yeonpyeong, [South Korean] people are angry and their anger has not been addressed yet. They are not happy with the reaction of the government.\"At the same time, South Korea cannot attack North Korea. They can only express their anger through military drills; it is their only way to show the determination to defend their country and to warn the North.\"Dr Leonid Petrov, an expert on the North at the University of Sydney, added: \"Conservatives in Pyongyang and Seoul are driving the situation to a new extreme.\"He added that the \"responsible\" course for the US would be to talk to the North.Beijing \u2013 under pressure to rein in its ally \u2013 threw the ball back into Washington's court by calling for an emergency meeting of the six nations involved in the stalled aid-for-denuclearisation talks.But the US, South Korea and Japan have snubbed that proposal, instead planning to hold trilateral talks next week.Japan sent its envoy to the nuclear talks to China today.

The show of force came almost a week after the attack on Yeonpyeong Island killed four, including two civilians, and sent tensions soaring in the region.China has called for a meeting of the six nations involved in the stalled North Korean denuclearisation talks.South Korea and Japan gave a tepid response to the proposal today. Analysts believe negotiations are the most plausible outcome of the conflict, but predict it will take time for the parties to come to the table. The North Korean artillery attack was the most serious incident since the sinking of a warship by what was found to be a North Korean torpedo.Media in Seoul reported today that the North had placed missiles on launch pads in the Yellow Sea, as the South and the US mounted a show of force with joint military drills in the area.Beijing, which objected to the exercises, sought a return to diplomacy, with its nuclear envoy calling for an urgent meeting with the nuclear negotiators from North and South Korea, Japan, the US and Russia. Wu Dawei said it would not be a resumption of the six-party talks but might \"help create the conditions\" for them to restart.Seoul said it would \"carefully consider\" China's suggestion, a remark read by many as in effect a rejection. President Lee Myung-bak's office said earlier that he had told a visiting Chinese delegation Beijing should contribute to peace in a \"more objective and responsible\" manner.China, the North's main ally, has not criticised Pyongyang over Tuesday's attack, merely urging all those involved to show restraint. Critics say it should be pushing harder, given the North's dependence on Chinese food and energy.\"I can see why China is doing this: 'We don't want war; we don't want to put pressure on North Korea',\" said James Hoare, former British charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Pyongyang. \"It would be a good thing if they did start talking, but I think it will take a little bit more time before anything will happen.\"I suspect in the end it won't quite blow over, but it will calm down and the two sides will find some formula to back away from the immediate confrontation.\"Andrei Lankov, an expert on the region at Kookmin University in Seoul, believed the six-party talks would resume \"sooner or later\" but suggested they were largely irrelevant to the current crisis, because the real question was whether and when South Korea and the US would provide more aid to the North. \"This is a protection racket \u2013 you pay the local toughs, and if you don't your windows are going to be broken,\" he said.Relations on the peninsula deteriorated sharply when Lee took office in 2008 and cut off free-flowing aid to the North. But Tuesday's attack marked a new level of hostility. The North said that civilian deaths \"if true \u2026 [are] very regrettable\", but blamed the South for using its citizens as human shields. It also accused the US of setting up Tuesday's incident to justify today's drills.The drills are the largest of their kind yet, according to the South's Yonhap news agency, involving an aircraft carrier carrying 75 planes and at least four other warships. But US military officials said the training was routine and no live-fire exercises were planned. According to South Korean media they are taking place far south of the disputed maritime border.Pyongyang's National Peace Committee said in a statement that the manoeuvres were creating \"a state of ultra-emergency\". It also renewed its threat of \"merciless counter-military strikes\", although it often makes similar warnings ahead of such exercises.Yonhap said North Korea had moved surface-to-surface missiles to frontline areas, but military and government officials said they could not comment.\"It is impossible to confirm the report as it is classified as a military secret,\" one told Reuters.An unidentified government source also told Yonhap that the North had deployed surface-to-air missiles along its western coastline, apparently targeting fighting jets near the disputed Yellow Sea border.Yesterday, South Korea's marine commander vowed \"thousand-fold\" revenge if the North attacked again.Earlier today the South Korean government ordered journalists to leave Yeonpyeong for safety reasons, but bad weather forced it to abort an attempted evacuation, leaving about 400 people there.", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "China", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "South Korea warns North Korea against further provocation"},{"date": "2010-12-14T17:00:01Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Having gained the world's attention by briefly waging war on South Korean territory last month, North Korea has reverted, for now, to a more familiar tactic \u2013 a war of nerves fed by vitriolic propaganda, threats and tantrums, underpinned by a policy of studied unpredictability.Pyongyang maintained its confrontational drumbeat this week. Rodong Sinmun, the main party organ, declared enhanced US-South Korean military co-operation to be \"nothing but treachery, escalating the tension \u2026 and bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean peninsula\".And today's disclosure by South Korea that the North may have built up to four additional facilities for nuclear weapons-related uranium enrichment is unlikely to calm the febrile atmosphere. The intelligence suggests the regime is hell-bent on maximising its nuclear capabilities, notwithstanding any future disarmament talks.In this tense game of diplomatic-military poker, South Korea is not even the North's principal adversary. Kim Jong-il is now blithely defying all the major regional actors \u2013 the US, China, Russia and Japan \u2013 while actively exploiting differences between them. It makes little difference whether his aim is recognition and security guarantees; economic and financial assistance; or the succession of his son. Kim is playing off the great powers against each other, to see what he can get out of them. The result is virtual diplomatic meltdown.Just look at what has happened since last month's bombardment of Yeonpyeong island. China, the North's only influential ally, has come under strong US pressure to pull its supposed client into line. China's perceived failure to do so is straining relations with Washington. James Steinberg, the US deputy secretary of state, visited Beijing today carrying the message: China must do more, fast.Resentful of such criticism, but simultaneously alarmed at the North's unruly behaviour (which it says it cannot ultimately control), China sent a top envoy, Dai Bingguo, to Pyongyang last week. In a bland statement bordering on meaninglessness, the foreign ministry claimed today the visit achieved consensus: \"The two sides believe that parties should keep calm and exercise restraint, take a responsible attitude to avoid further escalation of tensions, and play a constructive role in safeguarding peace and stability on the peninsula.\"China insists a resumption of the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear programme is the best way forward. Pyongyang would probably support this if the negotiations, broken off last year, restarted without preconditions. The US, Japan and South Korea, on the other hand, oppose rewarding Kim's \"bad behaviour\", and are demanding a range of prior assurances. So the impasse persists \u2013 and the North has no incentive to change its ways.Russia, a party to the talks, is hardly doing any better. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told his North Korean counterpart, Pak Ui-chun, yesterday that Moscow was deeply concerned by recent events. Last month's attack \"deserves condemnation\", he said. But then Lavrov grew placatory, agreeing that US-South Korean military exercises were inflaming tensions, a view shared by China.For his part, Pak, unfazed by this mild reprimand, told the Russian news agency Interfax that the \"hostile and confrontational policy\" of the US and South Korea justified \"strengthening our defence potential with a focus on nuclear deterrent forces\".Evidently worried by the North's defiant insouciance, Russia announced today it had raised the alert status of its forces in the country's far east. \"Without a doubt, we have taken measures to increase the combat-readiness of our forces,\" a military spokesman said, adding the army was \"continuing to monitor\" the situation.Differences of approach are also evident between Japan and South Korea, suspicious old enemies yet to be fully united in a common cause. In South Korea itself, the fallout from last month's attack has been damaging, prompting financial market jitters, the resignation of the army chief and the defence minister, and severe criticism of President Lee Myung-bak. If the North's aim was to sow confusion, it has succeeded \u2013 and not only in Seoul.Two things seem clear from all of this: first, that the various parties to this crisis need to form a united front if they are to have any chance of inducing the North to behave more responsibly. Second, that at present they are incapable of doing so.Maybe it's time for a fresh approach. Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico and an experienced freelance mediator who specialised in rogue regimes under Bill Clinton, is due in Pyongyang on Thursday. In his time Richardson has dealt face-to-face with the likes of Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, Sudan's Omar al-Bashir and the North Koreans.

Tania has just filed a story on today's events:South Korea warned today that it will unleash \"enormous retaliation\" if North Korea launches fresh attacks against its territory.North Korean troops bombarded Yeonpyeong, an island in disputed waters, with dozens of rounds of artillery earlier today, reportedly killing two South Korean soldiers and injuring around 20 people.Seoul placed its military on its highest non-wartime alert level, scrambling F-16 fighter jets to the western sea and returning fire, officials said. It warned that the attack was a violation of the armistice that ended the Korean war in 1953.The South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, who convened an emergency security meeting shortly after the initial bombardment, said an \"indiscriminate attack on civilians\" could never be tolerated.\"Enormous retaliation should be made, to the extent that [North Korea] cannot make provocations again,\" he said.The assault is one of the most serious in the decades since the war, given the involvement of civilians, although previous firefights around the disputed maritime border have resulted in a higher number of casualties.In a short statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, the North said the South had fired first \u2013 presumably in reference to a live-fire drill being carried out as part of annual military exercises. It said it had repeatedly warned the South not to go ahead with the drill.... Read more here.2.40pm: The President of South Korea has said he believes \"enormous retaliation is going to be necessary to make North Korea incapable of provoking us again\".Quoted by Yonhap news agency, Lee Myung-bak said: \"Reckless attacks on South Korean civilians are not tolerable, especially when South Korea is providing North Korea with humanitarian aid.\"\"As for such attacks on civilians, a response beyond the rule of engagement is necessary. \"Our military should show this through action rather than an administrative response,\" he added.Lee did not rule out the possibility of follow-up attacks.\"Given that North Korea maintains an offensive posture, I think the Army, the Navy and the Air Force should unite and retaliate against [the North's] provocation with multiple-fold firepower,\" Lee said. \"I think enormous retaliation is going to be necessary to make North Korea incapable of provoking us again.\"2.00pm: My colleague Simon Rogers has used a 2007 report by the Congressional Research Service, to map out the 150 incidents which have occurred between North and South Korea since the Korea War in 1950.You can read more on the Guardian's Datablog and see the incidents across North and South Korea here:1.38pm: Justin McCurry reports from Osaka on Japan's reaction to this morning's developments \u2013 Japan being one of the countries involved in the stalled six-party talks.The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, has instructed government colleagues to be prepared \"for any contingency\" in the wake of North Korea's attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong earlier today.Kan said he had told his cabinet to \"put all efforts into gathering information and ... to prepare to be able to respond firmly to any eventuality.\"Japan's efforts will, for the time being, be limited to information gathering \u2013 in any case its \"pacifist\" constitution forbids it from mobilizing forces in response to an attack on an ally.An escalation in hostilities on the Korean peninsula would, however, force Tokyo to make contingencies for a potential flood of refugees across the Sea of Japan.Nevertheless Japan, which is still trying to establish the whereabouts of several of its nationals abducted by Pyongyang agents at the height of the cold war, considers itself near the top of North Korea's list of potential targets.A foreign ministry official in Tokyo quoted by the Kyodo news agency described the shellings as \"dangerous\" and \"provocative\".1.16pm: News of the exchange of fire has sent the South Korean currency tumbling, with the won currently down 3.5% on the US dollar.The South Korean central bank, after an emergency meeting, says it planned to co-operate with the government to take measures to stabilise markets if necessary. Many traders expect South Korea's financial markets to fall further when trading opens tomorrow.However the drop against the dollar should be seen in the context of the dollar spiking in reaction to the news of the shelling \u2013 as my colleague Graeme Wearden, who knows much more about such matters, reported in our 11.02am post.12.22pm: Mark Tran, Guardian colleague specialising in international news, has been mulling over the events of this morning. He says the key to rehabilitating North Korea into the international community lies with the US:North Korea is a case of what Richard Nixon used to describe as the madman theory of politics, designed to keep opponents off balance. This is how Nixon described his approach \u2013 when he was trying to extricate the US from Vietnam \u2013 to his chief of staff Bob Hadelman.Nixon said: \"I call it the Madman Theory, Bob. I want the North Vietnamese to believe I've reached the point where I might do anything to stop the war. We'll just slip the word to them that, 'for God's sake, you know Nixon is obsessed about Communism. We can't restrain him when he's angry -- and he has his hand on the nuclear button' -- and Ho Chi Minh himself will be in Paris in two days begging for peace.\"This time it's not Nixon acting crazy, it's the North Korean leadership. Yet there is some method behind the madness for North Korea. As Simon Tisdall wrote below, North Korea has consistently pursued a fundamental objective \u2013 a non-aggression pact with the US. But as far as the US is concerned, it has no intention with rewarding North Korea's \"bad behaviour\" with a peace treaty. Bill Clinton tried the carrot approach in the 1990s when he agreed to provide aid to Pyongyang in exchange for North Korea's commitment to stop its nuclear programme under the 1994 \"agreed framework\". That deal eventually broke down with both sides blaming each other. When George Bush became president, his administration dismissed the Clinton approach as appeasement. But eventually he adopted a less confrontational approach not so different from Clinton's, only to see the North Koreans testing its first nuclear weapon in 2006. Since then it's been a roller-coaster, with signs of progress interspersed setbacks. Meanwhile, South Korea under Lee Myung-bak, who became president in 2008, ditched his predecessor's conciliatory \"sunshine policy\" for a more hard-headed approach, reinforcing North Korea's sense of isolation. The key lies with the US, which can offer only what North Korea wants. But it's difficult for Barack Obama to show flexibility when the North Koreans behave so provocatively.11.50am: Time for a bit of a recap after a tumultuous morning.\u2022 Two South Korean marines have died after North Korea fired shells at on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong. South Korea's Joint Chief of Staff said 16 others were injured during the bombardment of the island, which is located near the countries' disputed western border.\u2022 South Korea returned fire and scrambled fighter jets in response to the attack. North Korea has not confirmed whether it suffered any losses. South Korea has accused its neighbour of an \"intentional and planned attack\", and said North Korea's action violated the 1953 armistice between the two countries.\u2022 North Korea has issued a robust response, accusing South Korea of firing first and saying it was provoked into taking action. South Korea was undertaking an annual military drill before North Korea fired. \"Despite our repeated warnings, South Korea fired dozens of shells from 1pm ... and we've taken strong military action immediately,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said.\u2022 The international community has criticised North Korea, with the White House describing the attack as \"belligerent\". In the UK, foreign secretary William Hague said the attack was \"unprovoked\" and said the country \"strongly condemns\" it. A senior Russian Foreign Ministry official said North Korea's action was \"absolutely unacceptable\".\u2022 China, North Korea's only major ally, expressed \"concern\" over the initial reports, but called on both Koreas to \"do more to contribute to peace\". A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was now \"imperative to resume six-party talks\". North Korea quit talks with South Korea, the US, China, Russia and Japan in April last year.11.23am: William Hague, the foreign secretary, has put out a statement condemning the attack on South Korea.The UK strongly condemns North Korea's unprovoked attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong Island. Such unprovoked attacks will only lead to further tensions on the Korean Peninsula. We strongly urge North Korea to refrain from such attacks and adhere to the Korean Armistice agreement. I welcome President Lee Myung-bak's call for restraint.11.02am: My colleague Graeme Wearden reports that the military action alarmed the stockmarkets this morning:With markets already nervous following the political crisis in Ireland, news of the shelling helped to send shares falling sharply when trading began. The FTSE fell by 66 points at one stage to 5614, down 1.1%, and there were similar falls in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. The dollar also spiked (traders typically run to the [perceived] safety of the greenback when bombs start to fall).The South Korean Won was hit hard, falling 3.75% against the dollar, and other Asian currencies also fell.There was also a significant leap in the cost of insuring South Korean government debt -- with its five-year credit default swap jumping by 18 basis points to 102bp. That still makes South Korean debt a very safe bet, though (the Irish CDS is more than five times higher).A rumour travelled around the City this morning that North Korea's attack had been prompted by the death of Kim Jong-il \u2013 perhaps to prove to the world that the country was still in firm hands.Neil Hume, the editor of FT Alphaville, tweeted the speculation: \"@humenm: Warning broker RAW: Unconfirmed chat that kim jung-il has died. Prompts the shelling from north korea as being reported by newswires.\"Most raw gossip from stockbrokers should treated extremely cautiously, of course.10.43am: Tania Branigan has more on the events that preceded shells being fired \u2013\u00a0when South Korea was undertaking military drills close to Yeonpyeong.The North Korean artillery attack followed a live-fire exercise by the South as part of its annual Hoguk military drills.The Korea Herald reported that the North faxed a message to the South this morning saying it would not \"just sit back\" while the South carried out the exercise, citing military officials.The Korea Times reported last week that the US had pulled out of the joint drill citing scheduling conflicts, but had said it would seek to rearrange the exercise.10.36am: North Korea has accused South Korea of firing first, saying it was provoked into the military action, which has killed two soldiers in the South and set dozens of houses ablaze. \"Despite our repeated warnings, South Korea fired dozens of shells from 1pm ... and we've taken strong military action immediately,\" the North's official KCNA news agency said in a brief statement. It did not elaborate whether North Korea had suffered any losses from the exchange of fire.10.25am: South Korea's defence ministry has said North Korea's firing of artillery shells voilated the armistice between the two countries.\"This is an intentional and planned attack... and it is clearly in violation of the armistice,\" Lee Hong-ki, South Korea's defence ministry official, told reporters.10.03am: This map shows just how close the island of Yeonpyeon is to North and South Korea's disputed border.9.58am: Reuters news agency is now also reporting that two South Korean marines have been killed.Quoting South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, it says four more soldiers have been seriously injured on Yeonpyeong island.9.50am: The White House has issued a statement describing North Korea's action as \"belligerent\" and reinforcing US support for South Korea:The United States strongly condemns this attack and calls on North Korea to halt its belligerent action and to fully abide by the terms of the Armistice Agreement.The United States is firmly committed to the defense of our ally, the Republic of Korea, and to the maintenance of regional peace and stability.9.38am: Tweet from Yonhap News, the publicly funded South Korean news agency, on South Korea's initial diplomatic response: (URGENT) South Korea indefinitely postpones Red Cross talks with North Korea slated for Thursday: official9.34am: Another marine has died following North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong island, taking the number of soldiers killed to two, Yonhap news agency is reporting. More shortly.9.31am: Potentially awkward moment in Guangzhou, China, this morning, where two South and North Korean archers stood side-by-side on the Asian Games podium as their countries fired shells at one another.South Korea's Yun Ok-hee won gold in the women's individual archery competition, while Kwon Un Sil from North Korea took bronze, and stood beside Yun when they received their medals.\"Kwon, wearing a red team jacket, and Yun, with a multicolored team top, both stood with their hands behind their backs before the medals were presented,\" AP reports.\"Yun waved her national flag to a crowd of South Korean fans and held it up as all three medalists stood for photos.\"9.23am: China, North Korea's only major ally, has expressed \"concern\" over the reports that North Korea has shelled a South Korean island, and called for six party talks on its nuclear aspirations to resume.A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Hong Lei, told a news conference both sides of the divided Korean peninsula should \"do more to contribute to peace\", and said it was imperative to return to six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.\"We have heard reports and express our concern. The situation still needs to be confirmed,\" said Hong, responding to a question about the North Korean artillery attack.\"China hopes that the relevant parties will do more to contribute to peace and stability in the region,\" he added.\"It is imperative now to resume the six-party talks.\"China is North Korea's only major ally, and its economic and diplomatic support have been important to shoring up its otherwise isolated neighbour, whose leader Kim Jong-il visited China twice this year to strengthen ties. North Korea quit six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the US in April last year. The country has indicated it would return to talks on the condition it first gets face to face talks with the US. The Obama administration has so largely resisted.9.09am: This footage from CNN appears to show smoke rising from the Yeonpyeong, and buildings ablaze on the island: .9.02am: Tania Branigan emails from Beijing:The artillery attacks are a \"totally justifiable act of self-defence\" in response to the South's sea drills, an unofficial spokesman for North Korea has said, warning that nuclear war could follow \"at any point\" unless the exercises stop. Pyongyang has repeatedly issued such threats in the past.\"We repeatedly warned South Korea to stop its dangerous war games. If the South continues its dangerous behaviour, Seoul will be the next target. It will be a sea of fire. Nuclear war could start at any point,\" said Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace. He said it was fair to describe him as speaking on behalf of the North's government.He added: \"We have repeatedly warned the South to avoid endangering our territory on sea or air.\"8.56am: In the comments below, seoulman writes expressively of the mood in South Korea:I'm posting this from Seoul. Everyone is watching the news closely but there isn't any signs of panic. A few people, my girlfriend included have a sense of seeing this all before. I'm not trying to play it down, my arse went a bit when I heard the news but people are still going about there normal business.8.47am: Reports are suggesting the shelling has now ceased, but fires are still burning on Yeonpyeong.South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered officials to \"sternly respond\" to North Korea's action, but also called on officials to make sure that the \"situation would not escalate,\" a presidential official told Associated Press. Lee is holding a security meeting in a presidential situation room, the official said.North Korea's actions \"are illegal and a violation of the 1953 armistice agreement\" that ended the Korean War, a Joint Chiefs of Staff official said.He said South Korea responded to the shelling by firing a K-9 155mm self-propelled howitzer. However the JCS official declined to say whether North Korean territory was hit by the South Korean artillery.The official said island residents are escaping to about 20 shelters in the island.8.34am: Simon Tisdall, assistant editor of the Guardian and foreign affairs columnist, writes that North Korea is seeking \"acceptance by the great powers\":The sudden flareup in hostilities will be attributed to several factors. But as far as North Korea is concerned, one motive above all guides its behaviour: it desire for international attention.This has been largely lacking over the past year following the stalling of the six party talks, involving the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and China, on the regime's rogue nuclear and missile programmes.Pyongyang wants to hold face to face negotiations with the US alone but so far the Obama administration has largely resisted. The main difference is the agenda for any resumed talks, with Washington insistent that the aim must be the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.Today's violence follows the sinking earlier this year of a South Korean naval vessel, which was blamed on the North - though it denies involvement. This too was seen by analysts as a bid by the regime to get the world's attention.The North badly needs more international economic, development and food aid to bolster its chronically mismanaged economy. Its maverick leadership also seems to crave acceptance by the great powers. At present, paranoia reigns, amid constant claims tha the US is seeking regime change. This instability has been exacerbated by an apparent succession process in which the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il, is seeking to gradually transfer power to his youngest son.But regional analysts suggest that notwithstanding any steps he takes now, a fight for power could erupt when the ailing Kim dies. That struggle may already be underway and could involve members of the powerful military involved in triggering today's fighting.China, the North's only influential ally, has been urging the US to engage with the regime in order to defuse tensions. It has also held two summits with Kim this year. Chinese diplomats maintain Beijing has limited influence and are privately critical and alarmed, in equal measure, at the North's aggressive behaviour.8.24am: This footage from YTN television, based in South Korea, appears to show images of of the impact of the shells on Yeonpyeong island:.8.19am: More from Tania:Yonhap has also reported that the government is considering pulling South Korean nationals out of the North following the exchange of fire.We will decide whether we should evacuate them or not after looking into the safety of those at the Mount Kumgang resort and the Kaesong industrial park,\" the Unification Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Mount Kumgang is a tourist resort, while Kaesong is a joint enterprise zone. But both have experienced their share of trouble in the past \u2013 in 2008, a Northern soldier shot dead a Southern tourist after she wandered into a restricted zone at the beauty spot, while the Kaesong complex has struggled amid increasing friction on the peninsula. The official said officials would also reconsider plans to hold Red Cross talks with North Korea on Thursday in the South Korean border town of Munsan. Until last week, many had hoped that relations were thawing again after a long period of deterioration. The North was angered when President Lee took office in Seoul and adopted a tougher stance towards it than his predecessor, cutting off free-flowing aid.8.10am: Dr Park Young-Ho, from the Korea Institute for National Unification, has said he believes the shelling is an attempt by North Korea to \"turn this region into a conflict zone\".Although I can't be certain of the rationale behind North Korea's attacks yet, I see it as North Korea's intention to turn this region into a conflict zone so that it can bring the concerned parties to the discussion table.By showing that it has nuclear capacity and by firing artillery shells today, I think it is trying to make a point that it is militarily capable and thus should not be lightly regarded. Ultimately, I think it is strategically seeking to tilt talks concerning the contested Northern Limit Line and the peace treaty towards its advantage.7.54am: The Guardian's Tania Branigan reports:Seoul is examining whether the artillery attack is related to its drills near the western sea border, a spokeswoman for the presidential Blue House said today, according to Yonhap.Kim Hee-jung told reporters that officials were looking into the North's motive, adding: \"Our Navy was conducting a maritime exercise near the western sea border today. North Korea has sent a letter of protest over the drill. We're examining a possible link between the protest and the artillery attack.\"South Korea's president Lee Myung-bak has told senior officials that the government must \"carefully manage the situation to prevent the escalation of the clash,\" another spokesperson said.He is due to hold an emergency meeting of ministers at an underground bunker in Seoul shortly, his aide Park Jung-ha added.7.44am: North Korea started firing on South Korean waters off the island of Yeonpyeong at around 2.34pm local time, some of them landing directly on the island, Yonhap news agency is reporting.Col Lee Bung-woo, spokesman for South Korea Joint Chiefs of Staff told Yonhap the South had fired back some 80 rounds.The military is on its highest peacetime alert, he said, adding that the South Korean air force has deployed fighter jets to the island.7.36am: Yonhap News, the South Korean publicly funded news agency, is reporting that one South Korean soldier has been killed in the shelling. Yonhap quotes an unnamed official. We'll hopefully have more information soon.7.30am: North Korea has fired dozens of rounds of artillery onto a populated South Korean island near their disputed western border, military officials have said.The shells have set several buildings on fire, reportedly injuring two people, and have prompted South Korea to return fire and scramble fighter jets.The skirmish came amid tension over North Korea's claim that it has a new uranium enrichment facility and just over a month after North Korean leader Kim Jong Il unveiled his youngest son Kim Jong Un as his heir apparent.South Korea's YTN television has said two people were injured, several houses were on fire and shells are still falling on Yeonpyeong island. The station is broadcasting pictures of thick columns of black smoke rising from the island.Yonhap news agency, quoting a military official, says four soldiers have been wounded. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has ordered officials to make sure that the firing wouldn't escalate, according to Yonhap, quoting a presidential official. YTN said between 1,200 and 1,300 people live on the island.A South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff official said dozens of rounds of artillery landed on the island and in the sea. The official says South Korea fired back. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of JCS rules, said South Korea's military is on alert. He had no other details, and could not confirm the reports of casualties.Tensions between the two Koreas also remain tense after the sinking in March of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died. Seoul has blamed a North Korean torpedo, while Pyongyang has denied any responsibility. The countries' western maritime boundary has long been a flash point between the two Koreas. The North does not recognize the border that was unilaterally drawn by the United Nations at the close of the 1950-53 Korean War.North and South Korea have fought three bloody skirmishes near the maritime border in recent years, most recently in November 2009.", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "World news", "United Nations", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea fires on South Korea \u2013 live coverage"},{"date": "2010-11-30T10:40:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The US has snubbed Chinese proposals to ease the Korean confrontation through emergency multiparty talks including the North, with a White House spokesman dismissing the suggestion as a \"PR activity\".Beijing had called for the talks by the six parties involved in the stalled North Korean aid-for-denuclearisation discussions after a Northern artillery barrage killed four people, including two civilians, on a Southern island of Yeonpyeong. Tensions on the peninsula are at their highest for years, with joint military drills by the US and the South under way in the Yellow Sea today.The White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, told reporters: \"The United States and a host of others, I don't think, are not interested in stabilising the region through a series of PR activities.\"According to the New York Times, he added that talks \"without an understanding and agreement from the North Koreans to both end their behaviour as they exhibited last week, but also to come to the table with a seriousness of purpose on the denuclearisation issue \u2013 without that seriousness of purpose, they're just a PR activity\".Seoul has indicated its lack of interest, and Japan's foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, said last night that such talks were \"impossible\" after the Yeonpyeong shelling.South Korea said today its officials would meet counterparts from Japan and the US in Washington early next month to discuss the North's expanded nuclear programme, the attack on Yeonpyeong and a Chinese proposal for emergency talks.China repeated its call for dialogue, with the foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, telling a regular press briefing: \"Bringing the issue back to dialogue and consultation at an early date is in the common interest of all parties and is the common aspiration of the international community. Ensuring the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula is the shared responsibility of all sides.\"Hong said China had made the proposal \"to ease the situation\" and to provide a platform for dialogue.Beijing has come under intense pressure to rein in its neighbour and ally over the attack, near the disputed maritime border of the two Koreas. It has refrained from criticising Pyongyang \u2013 which says it acted in response to the South's live-fire exercise \u2013 instead urging both sides to show restraint.US diplomatic cables revealed today by the Guardian and other WikiLeaks partners show China's frustration with the North. According to the documents, a south Korean official \"claimed [high-level Chinese officials] believed Korea should be unified under ROK [South Korean] control\". Another told the US Pyongyang was acting like a \"spoiled child\" to get Washington's attention.China does not want instability and a flood of refugees, and analysts believe it would be deeply unhappy to see a US-dominated Korea on its doorstep.South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that president Lee Myung-bak had rebuked his cabinet members for not having the \"right sense of crisis\".The government has been heavily criticised at home, with some commentators saying it mishandled the initial response to the artillery bombardment. The defence minister resigned last week.According to a spokeswoman for his office, Lee told his colleagues: \"We should recognise that (South Korea) is confronting the world's most belligerent group.\"He added that there seemed to be a perception that dealing with a national crisis was a task only for the defence ministry, when it should be a matter for all of them.The high stakes in the confrontation were underscored when North Korea detailed its increased nuclear programme for the first time today, saying it had thousands of centrifuges. It added that these were for peaceful purposes. It announced the expansion in an article in the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, carried by state news agency KCNA.Officials in Pyongyang had sought to send a message to the US by showing an American scientist a new uranium enrichment plant this month. He said the \"stunning\" facility had 2,000 centrifuges.Enriching uranium gives the North a second source to make nuclear bombs.

But such an urgent intervention from China, North Korea's only significant ally and the sole outside country with any sway over its actions, is significant, not least in underlining the gravity of the situation.The Seoul-based Yonhap news agency reported that Pyongyang had placed surface-to-surface missiles on launch pads along its Yellow Sea coastline. The North's military is also aiming surface-to-air missiles at South Korean fighter jets flying near the western sea border, the agency added.Two South Korean marines and two civilians died on Tuesday when the North unleashed, without warning, an artillery barrage on Yeonpyeong island, which hosts both a military garrison and a small fishing community. The attack, seen as the most serious single military incident since the end of the war, destroyed dozens of homes , injured another 18 people, and set the South on a war footing.North Korea described the civilian deaths as \"regrettable\" but blamed the South for placing residents on the island, which Pyongyang insists is North Korean territory, as human shields. The North also condemned a major US-South Korea military drill in the Yellow Sea, which began today.The four-day exercise, involving the USS George Washington aircraft carrier, is believed to be taking place about 100 miles south of Yeonpyeong. While Seoul insists the exercise is both routine and pre-planned, the North's National Peace Committee of Korea described it as \"pretext for aggression and ignite a war at any cost\".Pyongyang issued a series of warnings, and threatened to \"give a shower of dreadful fire and blow up the bulwark of the enemies if they dare to encroach again upon [North Korea's] dignity and sovereignty, even in the least.\"Seoul is being almost equally bellicose. At a funeral yesterday for the marines killed on Yeonpyeong, the South Korean military commander, Major-General You Nak-jun, laid flowers at an altar and vowed that his country would retaliate if there was a further attack from the North.\"Our marine corps ... will carry out a hundred \u2013 or thousand-fold\" in retaliation, he said at the ceremony. \"We will put our feelings of rage and animosity in our bones and take our revenge on North Korea.\"Dozens of journalists have ignored South Korean military warnings about staying on Yeonpyeong, which is seven miles from North Korean territory. They and locals sought cover today after hearing new bursts of artillery fire. No rounds landed on the island.Dai Bingguo, a senior Chinese foreign policy adviser, visited South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak. In unusually strong comments Lee made plain his concerns that Beijing was not exerting sufficient pressure on North Korea, calling on China to contribute to peace in a \"more objective, responsible\" manner.The chairman of North Korea's supreme people's assembly, Choe Thae Bok, is due to visit Beijing from Tuesday, China's official Xinhua news agency said.Since the Korean war ended, with a truce rather than a formal treaty, tensions between the two sides have risen and receded many times. However, the past year has seen particularly intense pressures, notably after a South Korean warship was sunk in March, killing 46 sailors. An international team of investigators concluded that a North Korean torpedo sank the vessel, although Pyongyang denies any involvement.The latest crisis has already cost the South Korean defence minister, Kim Tae-young, his job amid accusations that the response to North Korea's initial attack had been too weak.

More than 20,000 elderly South Koreans have been briefly reunited with relatives from the North over the past 10 years, but many among the 80,000 others may die before they are given the chance to meet relatives they last saw six decades ago.It is not clear whether Seoul has agreed to discuss the resumption of joint projects at Kaesong, an industrial complex north of the border, and Mount Kumgang, a tourism enterprise on the North's east coast.Officials had been upbeat about the chances of a successful conclusion to the military talks. \"The atmosphere of the meeting was good, and we are doing our best,\" South Korea's chief delegate, Colonel Moon Sang-kyun, told reporters.Analysts expect the countries will have to meet several times before they agree on how to take the military dialogue to a higher level.

Pyongyang denies any involvement in the incident, in which 46 sailors died.In November North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong, an island near the countries' disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea.Two marines and two civilians were killed in the attack, the worst since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. North Korea said it had launched the bombardment in response to \"provocative\" South Korean military manoeuvres in the area.South Korea agreed to resume bilateral defence talks after the North offered to take \"responsible measures\" over the Cheonan and Yeonpyeong incidents and promised to refrain from provocative actions.The South reportedly plans to propose separate talks to put pressure on its neighbour to commit to previous agreements to dismantle its nuclear programme.In November, it emerged that North Korea had made more progress in enriching uranium than previously thought.It is known to have enough fissile material from its plutonium-based programme to make six to 12 nuclear bombs, but has not shown it has a working nuclear weapon.Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford University professor who was shown around an enrichment plant at North Korea's main nuclear facility at Yongbyon, said it contained an \"astonishingly modern control room\" overlooking 2,000 centrifuges.Pyongyang's minister for the armed forces suggested next month's meeting in a letter to the South Korean defence minister, according to North Korea's KCNA news agency. \"The Korean peninsula is at the crucial crossroads to war or peace,\" the agency said.North Korean state-run television said: \"[The letter says] we are in firm position to hold the North-South high-level military talks to solve all pending military issues.

And in this regard, North Korea does not have the technology to strike the United States, nor will it have it anytime soon, despite what Robert Gates suggested last month.

Although the country already has one launch site, at Musudan-ri, Tongchang-dong appears far more sophisticated. Brown and a colleague were the first to publicly reveal the facility, in 2008.He told Voice of America that Pyongyang had been developing the site, in the north-west of the country, for around 10 years.\"The other [site], it had dirt roads; it was pretty primitive.

And in this regard, North Korea does not have the technology to strike the United States, nor will it have it anytime soon, despite what Robert Gates suggested last month.

More than 20,000 elderly South Koreans have been briefly reunited with relatives from the North over the past 10 years, but many among the 80,000 others may die before they are given the chance to meet relatives they last saw six decades ago.It is not clear whether Seoul has agreed to discuss the resumption of joint projects at Kaesong, an industrial complex north of the border, and Mount Kumgang, a tourism enterprise on the North's east coast.Officials had been upbeat about the chances of a successful conclusion to the military talks. \"The atmosphere of the meeting was good, and we are doing our best,\" South Korea's chief delegate, Colonel Moon Sang-kyun, told reporters.Analysts expect the countries will have to meet several times before they agree on how to take the military dialogue to a higher level.

But well-informed official sources in the region said that the regime was also having problems feeding the army, and wanted to build up a stockpile to fulfil promises of a \"year of prosperity\" in 2012 to mark 100 years since the birth of Kim Il-sung, the founding ruler of the Democratic People's Republic, and the 70th birthday of his son, the current leader, Kim Jong-il.\"This year, all 40 North Korean embassies have been ordered by Pyongyang to ask governments for food. They have each been given a quota,\" an Asian diplomat said.Another Asian official said the order appears to have been given in December: \"Kim Jong-il has told his embassies to get as much rice as possible.\"In November the WFP and FAO warned that the majority of North Korea's people faced continued hunger this year after harvests were affected by unusually bad weather.The Foreign Office confirmed that the North Korean embassy in London had approached the government seeking food aid.\"Any decision we make will be based on assessments currently being made of the country's food needs,\" a Foreign Office spokesman said.The WFP/FAO needs assessment is expected to be published in the next few weeks. Marcus Prior, the WFP's spokesman in Asia, said: \"North Korea has had a severe winter and a poor vegetable harvest and there could be an impact on the spring harvest.\"A European official said he did not expect the evaluation to justify the declaration of a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, but Greg Barrow, a WFP spokesman in the organisation's Rome headquarters, said it was too early to judge the outcome.\"The mission got under way today. They are just going out in the field. Nobody knows yet what it will say,\" Barrow said. \"We will distribute as much as we can get funding for, but at the moment we are 80% underfunded.\"The WFP demands direct access to food distribution points in the North Korea countryside as a condition for handing over the food \u2013 something Kim Jong-il's secretive government has historically been reluctant to grant. Diplomatic sources suggested that this may be another reason the North Koreans are approaching foreign capitals directly.North Korea has been hit by repeated famines in recent decades, particularly when bad weather has exacerbated the effects of inefficient collectivist farming practices and a shortage of mechanisation. The situation was particularly acute in the mid-1990s, when between 600,000 and more than 2 million people are believed to have died.China, which has long served as North Korea's food supplier of last resort, faced its own food crisis as a result of a sustained drought, and that may have an impact on Beijing's food deliveries.In last year's assessment of North Korean food needs, in the wake of a similarly severe winter, the WFP and FAO estimated the country had produced about 5 million tonnes of rice and other staples.The state imported about 300,000 tonnes commercially, leaving a food deficit of half a million tonnes. However, the WFP's focus on children and pregnant and nursing mothers helped to ensure that overall rates of malnutrition declined. Anticipating that food production was likely to improve, the two UN food agencies recommended that the international community pay for another 305,000 tonnes to meet the needs of North Korea's 5 million most vulnerable people.Pyongyang's isolation has deepened after the collapse of international talks aimed at persuading Kim Jong-il to curb his nuclear and missile programme. South Korea has also suspended all but emergency humanitarian deliveries after a string of incidents along the two countries' maritime border.In November, North Korean forces shelled a South Korean island, Yeonpyeong, killing two marines, in one of the worst clashes since the Korean war ended without a peace treaty in 1953.

As a propaganda tool he was kept close to the elite and \u2013 weirdly \u2013 forced to become a film star. He escaped in 2004 and now lives in Japan. When I met him in 2008, he told me the only non-Korean music he came across before the 90s would be nationalist tomes imported from Soviet Russia. As a result, it wasn't until the mid-90s that he discovered who Michael Jackson was, when a smuggled Jacko cassette tape found its way into Jenkins's hands.Although most North Koreans are still oblivious to MJ today \u2013 leaving them ill-equipped to offer an opinion on the authenticity of his posthumous releases \u2013 those who are allowed to interact with foreigners consume pop music enthusiastically. These days most students on the foreign relations course at Pyongyang's Kim Il-sung University will at some point encounter MJ, while the penetration of South Korean pop music (and TV dramas) in North Korean cities is widely reported, with both enjoying a wide following despite the act of consuming them being an imprisonable offence.On a recent trip to Pyongyang, a guide by the name of Mr Oh took great relish in his regular party trick of \"accidentally\" confusing North Korean revolutionary songs for flashy South Korean pop. \"Whoops!

Some critics have also suggested the country could be stockpiling food for next year, because Pyongyang has vowed the North will be fully established as a strong and prosperous nation in 2012.", "tags": ["North Korea", "World news", "Aid", "United Nations", "Global development", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea 'on a knife edge' as aid agencies appeal for food donations"},{"date": "2011-01-11T18:35:43Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is becoming a direct threat to the United States, the defence secretary, Robert Gates, said today, in a marked shift in the administration's position.Gates said that North Korea was not an immediate threat but that he believed it would develop an intercontinental ballistic missile within five years. He had previously focused on the dangers posed by Pyongyang in terms of proliferation.Proliferation experts questioned whether his prediction was realistic, suggesting that he was seeking to emphasise US concerns to China.Gates, who is in Beijing for talks to improve military ties, praised Chinese efforts to lower tensions on the Korean peninsula and told reporters he had asked President Hu Jintao and others to continue pressing Pyongyang.China, as North Korea's only major ally and an essential source of energy and food, has been under pressure to rein in its neighbour. Tensions on the peninsula have deteriorated over the last two years, most strikingly since the shelling of Yeonpyeong island in November.\"With the North Koreans' continuing development of nuclear weapons and their development of intercontinental ballistic missiles, North Korea is becoming a direct threat to the United States,\" the defence secretary said.Gates said he did not believe North Korea was an immediate threat or even a five-year threat.\"I think that North Korea will have developed an intercontinental ballistic missile within that time\u2013 not that they will have huge numbers or anything like that,\" he said. \"But \u2026 I believe they will have a very limited capability.\"Experts questioned that assessment.Greg Thielmann, senior fellow at the Arms Control Association and a former Director of the Strategic, Proliferation and Military Affairs Office at the State Department, suggested it was \"a little misleading\" to imply the North could have ICBM-range missiles within five years.\"Its testing programme has been very sporadic and largely unsuccessful in testing long-range missiles. You have to assume he is trying to emphasise to China North Korean missile developments are a serious treat to international security.\"Thielmann added that the only serious threat to the US would be an ICBM with a nuclear warhead. Although the North has twice tested nuclear devices, experts believe it does not yet have the capacity to miniaturise them and mount them on a missile.Pyongyang has been attempting to create a long-range missile for several years. But a test in 2006 lasted only seconds. Two years ago the Taepodong-2 stayed airborne for longer but failed to put a satellite into orbit. Other countries judged that test to be related to the long-range missile programme because it involved the same launch technology.David Santoro, research associate for the non-proliferation and disarmament programme at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said it was difficult to judge the stage Pyongyang had reached because its technological progress was so uneven. But he added of the threat to the US: \"Five years is a long time, so potentially it could happen, but to me it seems a bit far-fetched.\"This may be part of the political discourse, trying to get China to put more pressure on the North.\"Santoro warned that North Korea's weapons programmes should remain high on the international agenda given its acquisition and export of ballistic and nuclear technology. The North is thought to have more than 800 ballistic missiles.The remarks by Gates came as Pyongyang repeated its calls for a return to talks following the tense confrontation with Seoul at the end of the year. The South's government, which has toughened its stance in the wake of the Yeonpyeong attack, has dismissed those offers as propaganda.\"We consider this a situation of real concern and we think there is some urgency to proceeding down the track of negotiations and engagement,\" said Gates, who will arrive in Seoul on Friday to discuss the issue. But he added that North Korea needed to prove its sincerity, for example by announcing a moratorium on missile and nuclear testing.The North said today that the test of sincerity would be whether the two Koreas were willing to meet to resolve their differences.\"Whether we are sincere or not will be proven when we sit together face-to-face,\" wrote Minju Joson, a publication of the North's cabinet, in an editorial carried by the state news agency.\"They will all have to talk at some point because there are not any alternatives,\" said Professor Hazel Smith, an expert on the North at Cranfield University.\"China and Russia are trying to get everybody back to the table.

Former detainees and guards who subsequently escaped from the country described horrific conditions including torture and widespread malnutrition, Amnesty said, with every former inmate saying they had witnessed executions.Thousands of prisoners are thought to be held purely for guilt by association under a system of collective punishment that holds relatives responsible when an individual breaks the law.\"Hundreds of thousands of people exist with virtually no rights, treated essentially as slaves, in some of the worst circumstances we've documented in the last 50 years,\" said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty's Asia Pacific director. \"As North Korea seems to be moving towards a new leader in Kim Jong-un and a period of political instability, the big worry is that the prison camps appear to be growing in size.\"Satellite images showed four of the six camps sprawling over large tracts of land in remote rural areas of South Pyongan, South Hamkyung and North Hamkyung provinces.A comparison with images taken 10 years ago showed that they had grown significantly, Amnesty said, with 15 more guardhouses at Yodok alone. It combined the evidence of additional buildings with former detainees' descriptions of conditions at the camps to arrive at its estimate of political prisoner numbers.The South Korean human rights commission has also estimated a population of 200,000 while South Korean government sources have suggested around 150,000 people are held in the camps. North Korea has a population of around 24 million.According to defectors, the camps consist of two areas. No one is ever released from the total control zones, for those alleged to have committed serious crimes such as those against the regime.Those deemed to have committed less serious offences, such as being critical of government policy or illegally crossing the border, face sentences of between a few months and a decade in revolutionary zones.Amnesty says only three people are known to have escaped total control zones and managed to leave North Korea. Most of its interviewees had been held in the revolutionary zone at a camp in Yodok.A devastating famine in the mid-1990s killed hundreds of thousands in North Korea and the country has suffered food shortages ever since, but conditions appear to have been particularly gruelling in the camps.Former inmate Jeong Kyoungil, who was detained in Yodok from 2000 to 2003, told Amnesty that prisoners received three meals of 200g of corn gruel a day, with food withheld if they failed to finish their work.\"Seeing people die happened frequently \u2013 every day. Frankly, unlike in a normal society, we would like it rather than feel sad because if you bring a dead body and bury it, you would be given another bowl of food.

My advice to war history fans is you should think of buying a map of the Korean peninsula.\"Government officials in Seoul, speaking off the record, agreed that they were braced for a North Korean \"provocation\", because Pyongyang's peace overtures of the past few months have failed to persuade Seoul, Washington or Tokyo to enter a dialogue. All three capitals insist on a North Korean apology for the two previous incidents, the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan, and the bombardment of the western island of Yeonpyeong, as well as concrete steps towards dismantling the North Korean nuclear programme, as preconditions for talks.\"North Korea has been trying this peace offensive for the past seven months. Now is the time for the North Koreans to change their mode towards more a conflictual approach,\" a former South Korean official and government adviser predicted.Another reason Seoul expects another incident is that the regime in Pyongyang appears to be seeking to enhance the martial credentials of the heir apparent, Kim Jong-un, by flexing North Korea's muscles.Seoul's bellicose language and heavy investment in border defences is clearly aimed at dissuading Pyongyang from trying a repeat of the Cheonan or Yeonpyeong attacks. However, some observers doubt whether South Korea's political leaders and military commanders, when the moment came, would actually order a response that risked triggering a full-scale war.\"I don't know if there is real political will,\" the former official said. \"The new order being given to commanders is 'shoot first and then call' [Seoul]. But I don't know if the field commanders will shoot. Also, while the rules of engagement have changed to more proactive deterrence, looking at the current deployment of forces, I don't think we have the ability to execute that plan.\"North Korea's next move to grab Washington's attention may also come in another form, a third nuclear test. South Korean government experts believe Pyongyang is fully capable of carrying out such a test and argue that the decision will ultimately be political: whether it would be more likely to force concessions from a concerned international community, largely in the form of food aid, or tighten the sanctions screw on North Korea still further.In response to a nuclear test, Seoul would have no military response, and would instead have to hope that China, North Korea's neighbour and protector, would agree to further sanctions. \"China's record so far is not encouraging,\" an official conceded.While there is widespread apprehension in the region that Korea's frozen conflict will turn hot once more in the near future, there is also general agreement that all the parties to the conflict will do their utmost to ensure there is no return to full-scale war.\"Both sides are afraid of war and if they see that the probability is real they will go to a lot of highly humiliating concessions to prevent it,\" Lankov said.\"That is because North Korea knows that it is going to lose, and South Korean knows it is going to win but at a cost that is unacceptable, and it doesn't know what to do if it does win.\"", "tags": ["South Korea", "North Korea", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "South Korea braced for North Korean 'provocation' as tension mounts"},{"date": "2011-05-18T14:51:35Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "China has denied allegations it was used as a trans-shipment point in the trade of banned missile technology between North Korea and Iran, following the leak of a United Nations report.Beijing blocked publication of the review, which accuses Pyongyang of breaching sanctions designed to tackle its nuclear and missile programmes, Associated Press reported.

This makes the world's longest-reigning dictator family, by a long shot, the Kims of North Korea.In the western media, the ruling Kim, Kim Jong-il, is often depicted as a figure of fun: a bequiffed, cognac-swilling, platform shoe- and shades-wearing buffoon who loves Hollywood movies and once kidnapped a film director to make a communist Godzilla. Bradley K Martin, in his book Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader (2004), comes closer to the truth when he compares Kim and his family to the troglodyte Morlocks in HG Wells's novella The Time Machine, monstrous beings who live underground and feed on the Eloi.The first of the dictator Kims was Kim Il-Sung, born on 15 April, 1912, in Pyongyang. Kim's father died when he was 14 and his mother when he was 16. He fought with Korean partisans against the Japanese and in 1940 fled to the Soviet Union, where he became a major in the red army. As Adrian Buzo notes in The Guerilla Dynasty: Politics and Leadership in North Korea (1999), the history of North Korea has been decisively shaped by Kim's time in Russia. \"In Stalinism, Kim saw a model for the rapid construction of a modern industrial nation-state under the aegis of a revolutionary party, capable of expelling all vestiges of imperialism from the Korean peninsula.\"Kim also saw firsthand how one might become a ruthless dictator.After seizing power in 1948, Kim styled himself as a kind of North Korean Stalin. According to Bradley K Martin, he presented himself not only as North Korea's great leader and liberator, but also as the country's \"leading novelist, philosopher, historian, educator, designer, literary critic, architect, industrial management specialist, general, table tennis trainer ... and agriculture experimenter.\" It was, of course, all guff. And what wasn't guff was Juche, Kim's homemade, half-baked political philosophy, which promotes a unique Korean self-reliance, guided by a great leader. \"Man is the master of everything and decides everything,\" declared Kim. In other words, he was the master of everything and decided everything.Kim died in 1994, aged 82, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Kim Jong-il. (Kim is one of the most popular surnames in Korea). It had been expected that, in turn, Kim's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, would be named heir presumptive, but he seems to have fallen out of favour after being arrested in 2001 trying to enter Japan on a fake passport in order to visit Tokyo Disneyland. It is now assumed that Kim Jong-il's successor will be his third son, Kim Jong-un, who has recently raised his political profile by being made a general in the people's army.In her book Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea (2009), the journalist Barbara Demick writes: \"If you look at satellite photographs of the far east by night, you'll see a large splotch curiously lacking in light.

It has always been a tense place, ringed by razor wire and minefields, but now there is a particular urgency to the military spadework.North Korea has carried out two major military attacks on the South in the past 15 months, and is widely believed in Seoul to be planning a third, in an attempt to extract diplomatic and economic concessions.What makes the current situation so fraught with danger \u2013 some say the most perilous moment on the Korean peninsula for a generation \u2013 is South Korea's hardline stance. The government of President Lee Myung-bak, facing elections next year and criticism for its cautious response to the previous two incidents, is threatening to unleash a far more punishing response to any further \"provocation\", setting the scene for an unpredictable tit-for-tat escalation.South Korean islands along the western maritime border, the scene of the two earlier incidents, are bristling with new weapons. Government officials in Seoul confirmed that those new defences will include Israeli-made Delilah missiles, with a range of 150 miles \u2013 enough to hit Pyongyang.The South Korean military is meanwhile preparing new rules of engagement for its frontline troops which would allow it to respond \"robustly\" to an attack without immediately consulting the government in Seoul. Security officials talk of \"proactive deterrence\", saying any future response would no longer be proportionate, but rather punitive enough to dissuade the Kim Jong-il regime in Pyongyang from making further attacks.A South Korean counterattack would target not just the North Korean units involved in any future military action but command posts as far away as the North Korean capital. Officials in Seoul even talk of a future incident as \"an opportunity\" that would allow them to \"restore\" a working level of deterrence.

The case has been referred to the SFO \u2013 which only looks at the country's highest value frauds \u2013 by the Financial Services Authority.An FSA spokesman said: \"In this case the acquisition of control occurred without the FSA having been given the prior notice which the law requires it to be given. Had it been given proper notice it would have been in a position to consider whether it should use its powers to object to and prohibit the change of control. The FSA subsequently identified a number of concerns and pursued a series of leads into what was an extremely complex corporate structure. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time due to confidentiality issues.\"The Panorama programme will show how King then used the name of the bank and its high-profile advisers to give credibility to deals.They included an attempt to obtain funding for a new company that claimed to have assets worth $2tn and the short-lived takeover of the Football League's oldest club. In 2009, King was behind a controversial takeover of Notts County which promised to bring millions of pounds of investment from the Middle East. The investment, which appeared to have been guaranteed by First London, never materialised and the club was left \u00a37m in the red \u2013 but not before Eriksson agreed to join County as director of football. Nottingham police are investigating.The coach's contract included a clause entitling him to \u20ac11m of shares in a little-known company called Swiss Commodity Holding, which had been set up a few months earlier and was claiming to have assets worth $2tn from the exclusive rights to North Korea's gold, coal and iron ore.King persuaded the former England manager to visit the rogue state as part of an SCH delegation and Eriksson was present at a meeting with the North Korean leadership. \"I was in the palace and they were handing over to the North Korean government so-called shares,\" he tells the programme. \"I asked them how much and what they told me was not millions, it was billions of dollars. They used my name. Of course they did. At the end it became a big, big mistake.\"Panorama's investigation shows that King was secretly running SCH, which was considering a public listing.Documents detailing SCH's claims were prepared by First London plc. The investment bank also sent Walker, who sat on the bank's advisory board, to check out King and his associates. The air marshal tells the programme: \"What do I think of Russell King? Not a lot.

Former detainees and guards who subsequently escaped from the country described horrific conditions including torture and widespread malnutrition, Amnesty said, with every former inmate saying they had witnessed executions.Thousands of prisoners are thought to be held purely for guilt by association under a system of collective punishment that holds relatives responsible when an individual breaks the law.\"Hundreds of thousands of people exist with virtually no rights, treated essentially as slaves, in some of the worst circumstances we've documented in the last 50 years,\" said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty's Asia Pacific director. \"As North Korea seems to be moving towards a new leader in Kim Jong-un and a period of political instability, the big worry is that the prison camps appear to be growing in size.\"Satellite images showed four of the six camps sprawling over large tracts of land in remote rural areas of South Pyongan, South Hamkyung and North Hamkyung provinces.A comparison with images taken 10 years ago showed that they had grown significantly, Amnesty said, with 15 more guardhouses at Yodok alone. It combined the evidence of additional buildings with former detainees' descriptions of conditions at the camps to arrive at its estimate of political prisoner numbers.The South Korean human rights commission has also estimated a population of 200,000 while South Korean government sources have suggested around 150,000 people are held in the camps. North Korea has a population of around 24 million.According to defectors, the camps consist of two areas. No one is ever released from the total control zones, for those alleged to have committed serious crimes such as those against the regime.Those deemed to have committed less serious offences, such as being critical of government policy or illegally crossing the border, face sentences of between a few months and a decade in revolutionary zones.Amnesty says only three people are known to have escaped total control zones and managed to leave North Korea. Most of its interviewees had been held in the revolutionary zone at a camp in Yodok.A devastating famine in the mid-1990s killed hundreds of thousands in North Korea and the country has suffered food shortages ever since, but conditions appear to have been particularly gruelling in the camps.Former inmate Jeong Kyoungil, who was detained in Yodok from 2000 to 2003, told Amnesty that prisoners received three meals of 200g of corn gruel a day, with food withheld if they failed to finish their work.\"Seeing people die happened frequently \u2013 every day. Frankly, unlike in a normal society, we would like it rather than feel sad because if you bring a dead body and bury it, you would be given another bowl of food.

The Somozas managed three presidents over 40 years in Nicaragua \u2013 Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda; Luis Somoza Debayle; Anastasio Somoza Debayle \u2013 before the Sandinistas kicked them out in 1979. The Duvaliers, \"Papa\" and \"Baby\", tyrannised Haiti for almost 30 years. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad is currently hanging on to power, bequeathed to him by his father. The Mubarak dynasty has come to a shuddering halt in Egypt. And things aren't looking good for a smooth succession for Saif Gaddafi in Libya. This makes the world's longest-reigning dictator family, by a long shot, the Kims of North Korea.In the western media, the ruling Kim, Kim Jong-il, is often depicted as a figure of fun: a bequiffed, cognac-swilling, platform shoe- and shades-wearing buffoon who loves Hollywood movies and once kidnapped a film director to make a communist Godzilla. Bradley K Martin, in his book Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader (2004), comes closer to the truth when he compares Kim and his family to the troglodyte Morlocks in HG Wells's novella The Time Machine, monstrous beings who live underground and feed on the Eloi.The first of the dictator Kims was Kim Il-Sung, born on 15 April, 1912, in Pyongyang. Kim's father died when he was 14 and his mother when he was 16. He fought with Korean partisans against the Japanese and in 1940 fled to the Soviet Union, where he became a major in the red army. As Adrian Buzo notes in The Guerilla Dynasty: Politics and Leadership in North Korea (1999), the history of North Korea has been decisively shaped by Kim's time in Russia. \"In Stalinism, Kim saw a model for the rapid construction of a modern industrial nation-state under the aegis of a revolutionary party, capable of expelling all vestiges of imperialism from the Korean peninsula.\"Kim also saw firsthand how one might become a ruthless dictator.After seizing power in 1948, Kim styled himself as a kind of North Korean Stalin. According to Bradley K Martin, he presented himself not only as North Korea's great leader and liberator, but also as the country's \"leading novelist, philosopher, historian, educator, designer, literary critic, architect, industrial management specialist, general, table tennis trainer ... and agriculture experimenter.\" It was, of course, all guff. And what wasn't guff was Juche, Kim's homemade, half-baked political philosophy, which promotes a unique Korean self-reliance, guided by a great leader. \"Man is the master of everything and decides everything,\" declared Kim. In other words, he was the master of everything and decided everything.Kim died in 1994, aged 82, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Kim Jong-il. (Kim is one of the most popular surnames in Korea). It had been expected that, in turn, Kim's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, would be named heir presumptive, but he seems to have fallen out of favour after being arrested in 2001 trying to enter Japan on a fake passport in order to visit Tokyo Disneyland. It is now assumed that Kim Jong-il's successor will be his third son, Kim Jong-un, who has recently raised his political profile by being made a general in the people's army.In her book Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea (2009), the journalist Barbara Demick writes: \"If you look at satellite photographs of the far east by night, you'll see a large splotch curiously lacking in light. This area of darkness is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\" The country has a chronic lack of fuel and food.

The case has been referred to the SFO \u2013 which only looks at the country's highest value frauds \u2013 by the Financial Services Authority.An FSA spokesman said: \"In this case the acquisition of control occurred without the FSA having been given the prior notice which the law requires it to be given. Had it been given proper notice it would have been in a position to consider whether it should use its powers to object to and prohibit the change of control. The FSA subsequently identified a number of concerns and pursued a series of leads into what was an extremely complex corporate structure. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time due to confidentiality issues.\"The Panorama programme will show how King then used the name of the bank and its high-profile advisers to give credibility to deals.They included an attempt to obtain funding for a new company that claimed to have assets worth $2tn and the short-lived takeover of the Football League's oldest club. In 2009, King was behind a controversial takeover of Notts County which promised to bring millions of pounds of investment from the Middle East. The investment, which appeared to have been guaranteed by First London, never materialised and the club was left \u00a37m in the red \u2013 but not before Eriksson agreed to join County as director of football. Nottingham police are investigating.The coach's contract included a clause entitling him to \u20ac11m of shares in a little-known company called Swiss Commodity Holding, which had been set up a few months earlier and was claiming to have assets worth $2tn from the exclusive rights to North Korea's gold, coal and iron ore.King persuaded the former England manager to visit the rogue state as part of an SCH delegation and Eriksson was present at a meeting with the North Korean leadership. \"I was in the palace and they were handing over to the North Korean government so-called shares,\" he tells the programme. \"I asked them how much and what they told me was not millions, it was billions of dollars. They used my name. Of course they did. At the end it became a big, big mistake.\"Panorama's investigation shows that King was secretly running SCH, which was considering a public listing.Documents detailing SCH's claims were prepared by First London plc. The investment bank also sent Walker, who sat on the bank's advisory board, to check out King and his associates. The air marshal tells the programme: \"What do I think of Russell King? Not a lot. He was good at chat, but that was his business. He was a con man. I was taken the same way Sven was taken.

It combined the evidence of additional buildings with former detainees' descriptions of conditions at the camps to arrive at its estimate of political prisoner numbers.The South Korean human rights commission has also estimated a population of 200,000 while South Korean government sources have suggested around 150,000 people are held in the camps. North Korea has a population of around 24 million.According to defectors, the camps consist of two areas.

The Somozas managed three presidents over 40 years in Nicaragua \u2013 Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda; Luis Somoza Debayle; Anastasio Somoza Debayle \u2013 before the Sandinistas kicked them out in 1979. The Duvaliers, \"Papa\" and \"Baby\", tyrannised Haiti for almost 30 years. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad is currently hanging on to power, bequeathed to him by his father. The Mubarak dynasty has come to a shuddering halt in Egypt. And things aren't looking good for a smooth succession for Saif Gaddafi in Libya. This makes the world's longest-reigning dictator family, by a long shot, the Kims of North Korea.In the western media, the ruling Kim, Kim Jong-il, is often depicted as a figure of fun: a bequiffed, cognac-swilling, platform shoe- and shades-wearing buffoon who loves Hollywood movies and once kidnapped a film director to make a communist Godzilla. Bradley K Martin, in his book Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader (2004), comes closer to the truth when he compares Kim and his family to the troglodyte Morlocks in HG Wells's novella The Time Machine, monstrous beings who live underground and feed on the Eloi.The first of the dictator Kims was Kim Il-Sung, born on 15 April, 1912, in Pyongyang. Kim's father died when he was 14 and his mother when he was 16. He fought with Korean partisans against the Japanese and in 1940 fled to the Soviet Union, where he became a major in the red army. As Adrian Buzo notes in The Guerilla Dynasty: Politics and Leadership in North Korea (1999), the history of North Korea has been decisively shaped by Kim's time in Russia. \"In Stalinism, Kim saw a model for the rapid construction of a modern industrial nation-state under the aegis of a revolutionary party, capable of expelling all vestiges of imperialism from the Korean peninsula.\"Kim also saw firsthand how one might become a ruthless dictator.After seizing power in 1948, Kim styled himself as a kind of North Korean Stalin. According to Bradley K Martin, he presented himself not only as North Korea's great leader and liberator, but also as the country's \"leading novelist, philosopher, historian, educator, designer, literary critic, architect, industrial management specialist, general, table tennis trainer ... and agriculture experimenter.\" It was, of course, all guff. And what wasn't guff was Juche, Kim's homemade, half-baked political philosophy, which promotes a unique Korean self-reliance, guided by a great leader. \"Man is the master of everything and decides everything,\" declared Kim. In other words, he was the master of everything and decided everything.Kim died in 1994, aged 82, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Kim Jong-il. (Kim is one of the most popular surnames in Korea). It had been expected that, in turn, Kim's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, would be named heir presumptive, but he seems to have fallen out of favour after being arrested in 2001 trying to enter Japan on a fake passport in order to visit Tokyo Disneyland. It is now assumed that Kim Jong-il's successor will be his third son, Kim Jong-un, who has recently raised his political profile by being made a general in the people's army.In her book Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea (2009), the journalist Barbara Demick writes: \"If you look at satellite photographs of the far east by night, you'll see a large splotch curiously lacking in light. This area of darkness is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\" The country has a chronic lack of fuel and food.

The case has been referred to the SFO \u2013 which only looks at the country's highest value frauds \u2013 by the Financial Services Authority.An FSA spokesman said: \"In this case the acquisition of control occurred without the FSA having been given the prior notice which the law requires it to be given. Had it been given proper notice it would have been in a position to consider whether it should use its powers to object to and prohibit the change of control. The FSA subsequently identified a number of concerns and pursued a series of leads into what was an extremely complex corporate structure. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time due to confidentiality issues.\"The Panorama programme will show how King then used the name of the bank and its high-profile advisers to give credibility to deals.They included an attempt to obtain funding for a new company that claimed to have assets worth $2tn and the short-lived takeover of the Football League's oldest club. In 2009, King was behind a controversial takeover of Notts County which promised to bring millions of pounds of investment from the Middle East. The investment, which appeared to have been guaranteed by First London, never materialised and the club was left \u00a37m in the red \u2013 but not before Eriksson agreed to join County as director of football. Nottingham police are investigating.The coach's contract included a clause entitling him to \u20ac11m of shares in a little-known company called Swiss Commodity Holding, which had been set up a few months earlier and was claiming to have assets worth $2tn from the exclusive rights to North Korea's gold, coal and iron ore.King persuaded the former England manager to visit the rogue state as part of an SCH delegation and Eriksson was present at a meeting with the North Korean leadership. \"I was in the palace and they were handing over to the North Korean government so-called shares,\" he tells the programme. \"I asked them how much and what they told me was not millions, it was billions of dollars. They used my name. Of course they did. At the end it became a big, big mistake.\"Panorama's investigation shows that King was secretly running SCH, which was considering a public listing.Documents detailing SCH's claims were prepared by First London plc. The investment bank also sent Walker, who sat on the bank's advisory board, to check out King and his associates. The air marshal tells the programme: \"What do I think of Russell King? Not a lot. He was good at chat, but that was his business. He was a con man. I was taken the same way Sven was taken. They just wanted names.\"King had gained control over First London plc shares after convincing the bank that he was managing billions of dollars of Bahraini cash by introducing some of its executives to senior members of the royal family. But Fawaz Al Khalifa, president of the Bahraini Information Affairs Authority, says King was lying about his royal connections: \"He might have met members of the family here or there, but we have no financial connection to him or his company.\"King, who was jailed for insurance fraud in 1991, denies running Notts County, SCH or First London plc.However, the programme has obtained dozens of emails and testimonies showing he was secretly pulling the strings, including some where he refers to himself as Lord Voldemort, the character from the Harry Potter books who can never be named.First London plc's parent company, First London Group plc, is still in business. In a statement, its lawyers said the failure to notify the FSA about the change in ownership was a mistake: \"This was simply an error and not done for any ulterior or questionable motive. As far as our client is aware the FSA were satisfied that the information provided was in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements. Our client is unaware of any investigation by the FSA or SFO into its activities so far as they relate to or involve Russell King.\"", "tags": ["Financial sector", "Business", "Serious Fraud Office", "Law", "Sven-Goran Eriksson", "Football", "Notts County", "UK news", "Bahrain"], "title": "SFO investigates scam that fooled North Korea"},{"date": "2011-05-26T07:30:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamNorth Korea making its own PCs >> PCWorld\"North Korea might be an unlikely place to find a PC factory, but the country has started manufacturing three models of computers, according to a recent state TV report.\"The report, on the country's main 8pm evening news, took viewers inside the factory that's making the computers.

While these may be elusive there is another that is more readily seen \u2013 the bottlenose dolphins of the Moray Firth. These dolphins are the only resident population in the north of Britain and can be seen in various ways. One is to find a vantage point such as Chanonry Point on the Black Isle, a popular place since the publicity on the BBC's Springwatch and Autumnwatch TV programmes. Another way is take one of the many boat trips out from such places as Inverness, Avoch and Cromarty.Last week I chose perhaps an even easier way and visited the dolphin and seal centre at North Kessock, based on the north shore of the Beauly Firth. There is one advantage in this centre in that if you do not actually see any dolphins you can watch a video of them taken at Chanonry Point, or listen to their strange noises via hydrophones. The centre is dominated by its panorama window that overlooks the firth: it provides binoculars to watch the seals and dolphins in the sea below. The noticeboard outside, regularly updated by the attendant, informed me that earlier that day two dolphins had been seen from the centre.Fascinatingly, many of the dolphins have been given names as they can be individually identified by characteristics, especially the shape and colour of their fins. This recognition, backed by photographs, is an invaluable aid to the close studies of this population. The video of the Chanonry Point dolphins was mesmerising as they frolicked and leapt out of the water. On the other side of the firth from the centre the underwater hydrophone is situated in the area they feed and pass through the most, and the sound of their clicking and whistling seems to sum up their enigmatic life in the firths.", "tags": ["Environment", "Rural affairs", "UK news", "Wildlife", "Scotland holidays"], "title": "Country diary: North Kessock"},{"date": "2011-06-28T18:52:04Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Around the edge of the baseball field at Camp Bonifas, South Korean marines under the United Nations Command are busy building four bomb shelters.The American and Korean troops at the camp are just 400 yards from the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that has divided North from South Korea since the 1953 armistice. It has always been a tense place, ringed by razor wire and minefields, but now there is a particular urgency to the military spadework.North Korea has carried out two major military attacks on the South in the past 15 months, and is widely believed in Seoul to be planning a third, in an attempt to extract diplomatic and economic concessions.What makes the current situation so fraught with danger \u2013 some say the most perilous moment on the Korean peninsula for a generation \u2013 is South Korea's hardline stance. The government of President Lee Myung-bak, facing elections next year and criticism for its cautious response to the previous two incidents, is threatening to unleash a far more punishing response to any further \"provocation\", setting the scene for an unpredictable tit-for-tat escalation.South Korean islands along the western maritime border, the scene of the two earlier incidents, are bristling with new weapons. Government officials in Seoul confirmed that those new defences will include Israeli-made Delilah missiles, with a range of 150 miles \u2013 enough to hit Pyongyang.The South Korean military is meanwhile preparing new rules of engagement for its frontline troops which would allow it to respond \"robustly\" to an attack without immediately consulting the government in Seoul. Security officials talk of \"proactive deterrence\", saying any future response would no longer be proportionate, but rather punitive enough to dissuade the Kim Jong-il regime in Pyongyang from making further attacks.A South Korean counterattack would target not just the North Korean units involved in any future military action but command posts as far away as the North Korean capital. Officials in Seoul even talk of a future incident as \"an opportunity\" that would allow them to \"restore\" a working level of deterrence. But it is a high-risk strategy.\"We are now in the most dangerous moment in Korean history over the last 25 years,\" said Andrei Lankov, a Russian professor at Seoul's Kookmin University. \"South Korea has already committed itself to a strong reaction to a future North Korean provocation so many times and so loudly that if they don't do it they will lose elections and be shamed.\"So they will probably react. North Korea is not getting what they want [diplomatically] so they will probably use their usual trick of rising escalation. My advice to war history fans is you should think of buying a map of the Korean peninsula.\"Government officials in Seoul, speaking off the record, agreed that they were braced for a North Korean \"provocation\", because Pyongyang's peace overtures of the past few months have failed to persuade Seoul, Washington or Tokyo to enter a dialogue. All three capitals insist on a North Korean apology for the two previous incidents, the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan, and the bombardment of the western island of Yeonpyeong, as well as concrete steps towards dismantling the North Korean nuclear programme, as preconditions for talks.\"North Korea has been trying this peace offensive for the past seven months. Now is the time for the North Koreans to change their mode towards more a conflictual approach,\" a former South Korean official and government adviser predicted.Another reason Seoul expects another incident is that the regime in Pyongyang appears to be seeking to enhance the martial credentials of the heir apparent, Kim Jong-un, by flexing North Korea's muscles.Seoul's bellicose language and heavy investment in border defences is clearly aimed at dissuading Pyongyang from trying a repeat of the Cheonan or Yeonpyeong attacks. However, some observers doubt whether South Korea's political leaders and military commanders, when the moment came, would actually order a response that risked triggering a full-scale war.\"I don't know if there is real political will,\" the former official said. \"The new order being given to commanders is 'shoot first and then call' [Seoul]. But I don't know if the field commanders will shoot. Also, while the rules of engagement have changed to more proactive deterrence, looking at the current deployment of forces, I don't think we have the ability to execute that plan.\"North Korea's next move to grab Washington's attention may also come in another form, a third nuclear test. South Korean government experts believe Pyongyang is fully capable of carrying out such a test and argue that the decision will ultimately be political: whether it would be more likely to force concessions from a concerned international community, largely in the form of food aid, or tighten the sanctions screw on North Korea still further.In response to a nuclear test, Seoul would have no military response, and would instead have to hope that China, North Korea's neighbour and protector, would agree to further sanctions. \"China's record so far is not encouraging,\" an official conceded.While there is widespread apprehension in the region that Korea's frozen conflict will turn hot once more in the near future, there is also general agreement that all the parties to the conflict will do their utmost to ensure there is no return to full-scale war.\"Both sides are afraid of war and if they see that the probability is real they will go to a lot of highly humiliating concessions to prevent it,\" Lankov said.\"That is because North Korea knows that it is going to lose, and South Korean knows it is going to win but at a cost that is unacceptable, and it doesn't know what to do if it does win.\"", "tags": ["South Korea", "North Korea", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "South Korea braced for North Korean 'provocation' as tension mounts"},{"date": "2011-05-18T14:51:35Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "China has denied allegations it was used as a trans-shipment point in the trade of banned missile technology between North Korea and Iran, following the leak of a United Nations report.Beijing blocked publication of the review, which accuses Pyongyang of breaching sanctions designed to tackle its nuclear and missile programmes, Associated Press reported.

The Duvaliers, \"Papa\" and \"Baby\", tyrannised Haiti for almost 30 years. In Syria, Bashar al-Assad is currently hanging on to power, bequeathed to him by his father. The Mubarak dynasty has come to a shuddering halt in Egypt. And things aren't looking good for a smooth succession for Saif Gaddafi in Libya. This makes the world's longest-reigning dictator family, by a long shot, the Kims of North Korea.In the western media, the ruling Kim, Kim Jong-il, is often depicted as a figure of fun: a bequiffed, cognac-swilling, platform shoe- and shades-wearing buffoon who loves Hollywood movies and once kidnapped a film director to make a communist Godzilla. Bradley K Martin, in his book Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader (2004), comes closer to the truth when he compares Kim and his family to the troglodyte Morlocks in HG Wells's novella The Time Machine, monstrous beings who live underground and feed on the Eloi.The first of the dictator Kims was Kim Il-Sung, born on 15 April, 1912, in Pyongyang. Kim's father died when he was 14 and his mother when he was 16. He fought with Korean partisans against the Japanese and in 1940 fled to the Soviet Union, where he became a major in the red army. As Adrian Buzo notes in The Guerilla Dynasty: Politics and Leadership in North Korea (1999), the history of North Korea has been decisively shaped by Kim's time in Russia. \"In Stalinism, Kim saw a model for the rapid construction of a modern industrial nation-state under the aegis of a revolutionary party, capable of expelling all vestiges of imperialism from the Korean peninsula.\"Kim also saw firsthand how one might become a ruthless dictator.After seizing power in 1948, Kim styled himself as a kind of North Korean Stalin. According to Bradley K Martin, he presented himself not only as North Korea's great leader and liberator, but also as the country's \"leading novelist, philosopher, historian, educator, designer, literary critic, architect, industrial management specialist, general, table tennis trainer ... and agriculture experimenter.\" It was, of course, all guff. And what wasn't guff was Juche, Kim's homemade, half-baked political philosophy, which promotes a unique Korean self-reliance, guided by a great leader. \"Man is the master of everything and decides everything,\" declared Kim. In other words, he was the master of everything and decided everything.Kim died in 1994, aged 82, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Kim Jong-il. (Kim is one of the most popular surnames in Korea). It had been expected that, in turn, Kim's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, would be named heir presumptive, but he seems to have fallen out of favour after being arrested in 2001 trying to enter Japan on a fake passport in order to visit Tokyo Disneyland. It is now assumed that Kim Jong-il's successor will be his third son, Kim Jong-un, who has recently raised his political profile by being made a general in the people's army.In her book Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea (2009), the journalist Barbara Demick writes: \"If you look at satellite photographs of the far east by night, you'll see a large splotch curiously lacking in light. This area of darkness is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\" The country has a chronic lack of fuel and food.

The case has been referred to the SFO \u2013 which only looks at the country's highest value frauds \u2013 by the Financial Services Authority.An FSA spokesman said: \"In this case the acquisition of control occurred without the FSA having been given the prior notice which the law requires it to be given. Had it been given proper notice it would have been in a position to consider whether it should use its powers to object to and prohibit the change of control. The FSA subsequently identified a number of concerns and pursued a series of leads into what was an extremely complex corporate structure. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time due to confidentiality issues.\"The Panorama programme will show how King then used the name of the bank and its high-profile advisers to give credibility to deals.They included an attempt to obtain funding for a new company that claimed to have assets worth $2tn and the short-lived takeover of the Football League's oldest club. In 2009, King was behind a controversial takeover of Notts County which promised to bring millions of pounds of investment from the Middle East. The investment, which appeared to have been guaranteed by First London, never materialised and the club was left \u00a37m in the red \u2013 but not before Eriksson agreed to join County as director of football. Nottingham police are investigating.The coach's contract included a clause entitling him to \u20ac11m of shares in a little-known company called Swiss Commodity Holding, which had been set up a few months earlier and was claiming to have assets worth $2tn from the exclusive rights to North Korea's gold, coal and iron ore.King persuaded the former England manager to visit the rogue state as part of an SCH delegation and Eriksson was present at a meeting with the North Korean leadership. \"I was in the palace and they were handing over to the North Korean government so-called shares,\" he tells the programme. \"I asked them how much and what they told me was not millions, it was billions of dollars. They used my name. Of course they did. At the end it became a big, big mistake.\"Panorama's investigation shows that King was secretly running SCH, which was considering a public listing.Documents detailing SCH's claims were prepared by First London plc. The investment bank also sent Walker, who sat on the bank's advisory board, to check out King and his associates. The air marshal tells the programme: \"What do I think of Russell King? Not a lot. He was good at chat, but that was his business. He was a con man. I was taken the same way Sven was taken. They just wanted names.\"King had gained control over First London plc shares after convincing the bank that he was managing billions of dollars of Bahraini cash by introducing some of its executives to senior members of the royal family. But Fawaz Al Khalifa, president of the Bahraini Information Affairs Authority, says King was lying about his royal connections: \"He might have met members of the family here or there, but we have no financial connection to him or his company.\"King, who was jailed for insurance fraud in 1991, denies running Notts County, SCH or First London plc.However, the programme has obtained dozens of emails and testimonies showing he was secretly pulling the strings, including some where he refers to himself as Lord Voldemort, the character from the Harry Potter books who can never be named.First London plc's parent company, First London Group plc, is still in business. In a statement, its lawyers said the failure to notify the FSA about the change in ownership was a mistake: \"This was simply an error and not done for any ulterior or questionable motive. As far as our client is aware the FSA were satisfied that the information provided was in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements. Our client is unaware of any investigation by the FSA or SFO into its activities so far as they relate to or involve Russell King.\"", "tags": ["Financial sector", "Business", "Serious Fraud Office", "Law", "Sven-Goran Eriksson", "Football", "Notts County", "UK news", "Bahrain"], "title": "SFO investigates scam that fooled North Korea"},{"date": "2011-05-26T07:30:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamNorth Korea making its own PCs >> PCWorld\"North Korea might be an unlikely place to find a PC factory, but the country has started manufacturing three models of computers, according to a recent state TV report.\"The report, on the country's main 8pm evening news, took viewers inside the factory that's making the computers.

One is to find a vantage point such as Chanonry Point on the Black Isle, a popular place since the publicity on the BBC's Springwatch and Autumnwatch TV programmes. Another way is take one of the many boat trips out from such places as Inverness, Avoch and Cromarty.Last week I chose perhaps an even easier way and visited the dolphin and seal centre at North Kessock, based on the north shore of the Beauly Firth. There is one advantage in this centre in that if you do not actually see any dolphins you can watch a video of them taken at Chanonry Point, or listen to their strange noises via hydrophones. The centre is dominated by its panorama window that overlooks the firth: it provides binoculars to watch the seals and dolphins in the sea below. The noticeboard outside, regularly updated by the attendant, informed me that earlier that day two dolphins had been seen from the centre.Fascinatingly, many of the dolphins have been given names as they can be individually identified by characteristics, especially the shape and colour of their fins. This recognition, backed by photographs, is an invaluable aid to the close studies of this population. The video of the Chanonry Point dolphins was mesmerising as they frolicked and leapt out of the water. On the other side of the firth from the centre the underwater hydrophone is situated in the area they feed and pass through the most, and the sound of their clicking and whistling seems to sum up their enigmatic life in the firths.", "tags": ["Environment", "Rural affairs", "UK news", "Wildlife", "Scotland holidays"], "title": "Country diary: North Kessock"},{"date": "2011-06-06T23:04:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Exactly a century ago, a tremendous thunderstorm broke over this part of the country. Tales of its duration and ferocity have been passed down through the generations; it flattened growing corn and hay, killed grazing livestock and did serious damage to buildings. One of the last-named was the medieval church in my village, Old Brampton. Its tower was put up in the 13th century and capped with an early type of broached spire 100 years later. That storm knocked the top off the spire and you can see the replacement masonry to this day. The topmost stone, which fell to the ground, was rescued by the church warden, taken to his garden (which is now mine) and fashioned into a bird bath, as which it still does service.It takes me only a couple of minutes to cross a sheep pasture and come to the crest of the broad, green valley, where it's possible to look back to the church steeple poking above the graveyard trees and out, the other way, to pick out the bright towers of Hardwick Hall all of nine miles away to the south-east.

It has always been a tense place, ringed by razor wire and minefields, but now there is a particular urgency to the military spadework.North Korea has carried out two major military attacks on the South in the past 15 months, and is widely believed in Seoul to be planning a third, in an attempt to extract diplomatic and economic concessions.What makes the current situation so fraught with danger \u2013 some say the most perilous moment on the Korean peninsula for a generation \u2013 is South Korea's hardline stance. The government of President Lee Myung-bak, facing elections next year and criticism for its cautious response to the previous two incidents, is threatening to unleash a far more punishing response to any further \"provocation\", setting the scene for an unpredictable tit-for-tat escalation.South Korean islands along the western maritime border, the scene of the two earlier incidents, are bristling with new weapons. Government officials in Seoul confirmed that those new defences will include Israeli-made Delilah missiles, with a range of 150 miles \u2013 enough to hit Pyongyang.The South Korean military is meanwhile preparing new rules of engagement for its frontline troops which would allow it to respond \"robustly\" to an attack without immediately consulting the government in Seoul. Security officials talk of \"proactive deterrence\", saying any future response would no longer be proportionate, but rather punitive enough to dissuade the Kim Jong-il regime in Pyongyang from making further attacks.A South Korean counterattack would target not just the North Korean units involved in any future military action but command posts as far away as the North Korean capital. Officials in Seoul even talk of a future incident as \"an opportunity\" that would allow them to \"restore\" a working level of deterrence. But it is a high-risk strategy.\"We are now in the most dangerous moment in Korean history over the last 25 years,\" said Andrei Lankov, a Russian professor at Seoul's Kookmin University. \"South Korea has already committed itself to a strong reaction to a future North Korean provocation so many times and so loudly that if they don't do it they will lose elections and be shamed.\"So they will probably react. North Korea is not getting what they want [diplomatically] so they will probably use their usual trick of rising escalation. My advice to war history fans is you should think of buying a map of the Korean peninsula.\"Government officials in Seoul, speaking off the record, agreed that they were braced for a North Korean \"provocation\", because Pyongyang's peace overtures of the past few months have failed to persuade Seoul, Washington or Tokyo to enter a dialogue. All three capitals insist on a North Korean apology for the two previous incidents, the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan, and the bombardment of the western island of Yeonpyeong, as well as concrete steps towards dismantling the North Korean nuclear programme, as preconditions for talks.\"North Korea has been trying this peace offensive for the past seven months. Now is the time for the North Koreans to change their mode towards more a conflictual approach,\" a former South Korean official and government adviser predicted.Another reason Seoul expects another incident is that the regime in Pyongyang appears to be seeking to enhance the martial credentials of the heir apparent, Kim Jong-un, by flexing North Korea's muscles.Seoul's bellicose language and heavy investment in border defences is clearly aimed at dissuading Pyongyang from trying a repeat of the Cheonan or Yeonpyeong attacks. However, some observers doubt whether South Korea's political leaders and military commanders, when the moment came, would actually order a response that risked triggering a full-scale war.\"I don't know if there is real political will,\" the former official said. \"The new order being given to commanders is 'shoot first and then call' [Seoul]. But I don't know if the field commanders will shoot. Also, while the rules of engagement have changed to more proactive deterrence, looking at the current deployment of forces, I don't think we have the ability to execute that plan.\"North Korea's next move to grab Washington's attention may also come in another form, a third nuclear test. South Korean government experts believe Pyongyang is fully capable of carrying out such a test and argue that the decision will ultimately be political: whether it would be more likely to force concessions from a concerned international community, largely in the form of food aid, or tighten the sanctions screw on North Korea still further.In response to a nuclear test, Seoul would have no military response, and would instead have to hope that China, North Korea's neighbour and protector, would agree to further sanctions. \"China's record so far is not encouraging,\" an official conceded.While there is widespread apprehension in the region that Korea's frozen conflict will turn hot once more in the near future, there is also general agreement that all the parties to the conflict will do their utmost to ensure there is no return to full-scale war.\"Both sides are afraid of war and if they see that the probability is real they will go to a lot of highly humiliating concessions to prevent it,\" Lankov said.\"That is because North Korea knows that it is going to lose, and South Korean knows it is going to win but at a cost that is unacceptable, and it doesn't know what to do if it does win.\"", "tags": ["South Korea", "North Korea", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "South Korea braced for North Korean 'provocation' as tension mounts"},{"date": "2011-05-18T14:51:35Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "China has denied allegations it was used as a trans-shipment point in the trade of banned missile technology between North Korea and Iran, following the leak of a United Nations report.Beijing blocked publication of the review, which accuses Pyongyang of breaching sanctions designed to tackle its nuclear and missile programmes, Associated Press reported.

Britain's deputy UN ambassador, Philip Parham, told AP there was \"pretty broad support\" for the report but China had problems with it.There has been increasing international concern over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes, particularly given high tensions on the Korean peninsula and concerns over the transition of power in coming years. The North unveiled a uranium enrichment plant in November and experts believe it has built a second launch site for long-range rockets.The report by a UN panel of experts \u2013 since obtained by media organisations including the Guardian \u2013 said North Korea appeared to have been sharing technology and expertise with Iran, violating sanctions.\"Prohibited ballistic missile-related items are suspected to have been transferred \u2026 on regular scheduled flights of Air Koryo and Iran Air, with trans-shipment through a neighbouring third country,\" the panel wrote.UN diplomats told Reuters that the unnamed country was China.However, assistant Chinese foreign minister Hu Zhengyue told reporters at a briefing today: \"I completely deny such a view.\"He added: \"On the issue of denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula, the Chinese position is crystal clear \u2026 We have nothing to hide.\"Earlier, foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu had said in a statement that the document did not have the authority of the security council or the relevant security council sanctions committee.She added: \"China is conscientious and responsible in enforcing security council resolutions.\"The allegations from UN diplomats echo a US diplomatic cable from 2007, saying China had to act \"urgently\" to halt a trans-shipment of ballistic missile components from North Korea to Iran via Beijing.The memo, signed by Condoleezza Rice \u2013 then secretary of state \u2013 urged the US ambassador to raise the issue at the earliest opportunity and at the highest level possible. It was one of the cables obtained by WikiLeaks and published by the Guardian.China's foreign ministry said when the US cables were leaked that it would not respond to their content.The UN panel report said the implementation of sanctions needed to be improved, with North Korea becoming increasingly sophisticated in exploiting loopholes in transport systems and using methods such as shell and front companies.But it added: \"Evidence suggests that the sanctions have succeeded in economic terms by raising the cost of illicit transfers while simultaneously lowering the returns to the DPRK.\"North Korea has yet to respond to the report.China is the north's main ally, but does not control it and has often been left frustrated with Pyongyang.

Former detainees and guards who subsequently escaped from the country described horrific conditions including torture and widespread malnutrition, Amnesty said, with every former inmate saying they had witnessed executions.Thousands of prisoners are thought to be held purely for guilt by association under a system of collective punishment that holds relatives responsible when an individual breaks the law.\"Hundreds of thousands of people exist with virtually no rights, treated essentially as slaves, in some of the worst circumstances we've documented in the last 50 years,\" said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty's Asia Pacific director. \"As North Korea seems to be moving towards a new leader in Kim Jong-un and a period of political instability, the big worry is that the prison camps appear to be growing in size.\"Satellite images showed four of the six camps sprawling over large tracts of land in remote rural areas of South Pyongan, South Hamkyung and North Hamkyung provinces.A comparison with images taken 10 years ago showed that they had grown significantly, Amnesty said, with 15 more guardhouses at Yodok alone. It combined the evidence of additional buildings with former detainees' descriptions of conditions at the camps to arrive at its estimate of political prisoner numbers.The South Korean human rights commission has also estimated a population of 200,000 while South Korean government sources have suggested around 150,000 people are held in the camps. North Korea has a population of around 24 million.According to defectors, the camps consist of two areas. No one is ever released from the total control zones, for those alleged to have committed serious crimes such as those against the regime.Those deemed to have committed less serious offences, such as being critical of government policy or illegally crossing the border, face sentences of between a few months and a decade in revolutionary zones.Amnesty says only three people are known to have escaped total control zones and managed to leave North Korea. Most of its interviewees had been held in the revolutionary zone at a camp in Yodok.A devastating famine in the mid-1990s killed hundreds of thousands in North Korea and the country has suffered food shortages ever since, but conditions appear to have been particularly gruelling in the camps.Former inmate Jeong Kyoungil, who was detained in Yodok from 2000 to 2003, told Amnesty that prisoners received three meals of 200g of corn gruel a day, with food withheld if they failed to finish their work.\"Seeing people die happened frequently \u2013 every day.

Kim's father died when he was 14 and his mother when he was 16. He fought with Korean partisans against the Japanese and in 1940 fled to the Soviet Union, where he became a major in the red army. As Adrian Buzo notes in The Guerilla Dynasty: Politics and Leadership in North Korea (1999), the history of North Korea has been decisively shaped by Kim's time in Russia. \"In Stalinism, Kim saw a model for the rapid construction of a modern industrial nation-state under the aegis of a revolutionary party, capable of expelling all vestiges of imperialism from the Korean peninsula.\"Kim also saw firsthand how one might become a ruthless dictator.After seizing power in 1948, Kim styled himself as a kind of North Korean Stalin. According to Bradley K Martin, he presented himself not only as North Korea's great leader and liberator, but also as the country's \"leading novelist, philosopher, historian, educator, designer, literary critic, architect, industrial management specialist, general, table tennis trainer ... and agriculture experimenter.\" It was, of course, all guff. And what wasn't guff was Juche, Kim's homemade, half-baked political philosophy, which promotes a unique Korean self-reliance, guided by a great leader. \"Man is the master of everything and decides everything,\" declared Kim. In other words, he was the master of everything and decided everything.Kim died in 1994, aged 82, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Kim Jong-il. (Kim is one of the most popular surnames in Korea). It had been expected that, in turn, Kim's eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, would be named heir presumptive, but he seems to have fallen out of favour after being arrested in 2001 trying to enter Japan on a fake passport in order to visit Tokyo Disneyland. It is now assumed that Kim Jong-il's successor will be his third son, Kim Jong-un, who has recently raised his political profile by being made a general in the people's army.In her book Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea (2009), the journalist Barbara Demick writes: \"If you look at satellite photographs of the far east by night, you'll see a large splotch curiously lacking in light. This area of darkness is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\" The country has a chronic lack of fuel and food. North Korea, writes Demick, \"is simply a blank.\" In truth, it has been effaced by one family.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Kim Jong-un", "Family", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Great dynasties of the world: The Kims of North Korea"},{"date": "2011-04-17T19:05:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The Serious Fraud Office is looking into an elaborate scam that took in the former England football manager Sven G\u00f6ran-Eriksson, former spymaster Sir John Walker and the North Korean government.Investigators are also looking at how the same fraudster took control of almost half of a London investment bank without paying for the shares.First London plc \u2013 the investment bank whose shares were listed on the Plus stock exchange and whose advisers included Tim Yeo MP and Air Marshal Sir John Walker, a former head of defence intelligence \u2013 subsequently went into administration with debts of \u00a38.7m.BBC Panorama has discovered that Russell King, a convicted fraudster, took control of 49% of First London by claiming he was managing billions of dollars for the Bahraini royal family. The case has been referred to the SFO \u2013 which only looks at the country's highest value frauds \u2013 by the Financial Services Authority.An FSA spokesman said: \"In this case the acquisition of control occurred without the FSA having been given the prior notice which the law requires it to be given. Had it been given proper notice it would have been in a position to consider whether it should use its powers to object to and prohibit the change of control. The FSA subsequently identified a number of concerns and pursued a series of leads into what was an extremely complex corporate structure. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time due to confidentiality issues.\"The Panorama programme will show how King then used the name of the bank and its high-profile advisers to give credibility to deals.They included an attempt to obtain funding for a new company that claimed to have assets worth $2tn and the short-lived takeover of the Football League's oldest club. In 2009, King was behind a controversial takeover of Notts County which promised to bring millions of pounds of investment from the Middle East. The investment, which appeared to have been guaranteed by First London, never materialised and the club was left \u00a37m in the red \u2013 but not before Eriksson agreed to join County as director of football. Nottingham police are investigating.The coach's contract included a clause entitling him to \u20ac11m of shares in a little-known company called Swiss Commodity Holding, which had been set up a few months earlier and was claiming to have assets worth $2tn from the exclusive rights to North Korea's gold, coal and iron ore.King persuaded the former England manager to visit the rogue state as part of an SCH delegation and Eriksson was present at a meeting with the North Korean leadership. \"I was in the palace and they were handing over to the North Korean government so-called shares,\" he tells the programme. \"I asked them how much and what they told me was not millions, it was billions of dollars. They used my name. Of course they did. At the end it became a big, big mistake.\"Panorama's investigation shows that King was secretly running SCH, which was considering a public listing.Documents detailing SCH's claims were prepared by First London plc. The investment bank also sent Walker, who sat on the bank's advisory board, to check out King and his associates. The air marshal tells the programme: \"What do I think of Russell King? Not a lot. He was good at chat, but that was his business. He was a con man. I was taken the same way Sven was taken. They just wanted names.\"King had gained control over First London plc shares after convincing the bank that he was managing billions of dollars of Bahraini cash by introducing some of its executives to senior members of the royal family. But Fawaz Al Khalifa, president of the Bahraini Information Affairs Authority, says King was lying about his royal connections: \"He might have met members of the family here or there, but we have no financial connection to him or his company.\"King, who was jailed for insurance fraud in 1991, denies running Notts County, SCH or First London plc.However, the programme has obtained dozens of emails and testimonies showing he was secretly pulling the strings, including some where he refers to himself as Lord Voldemort, the character from the Harry Potter books who can never be named.First London plc's parent company, First London Group plc, is still in business. In a statement, its lawyers said the failure to notify the FSA about the change in ownership was a mistake: \"This was simply an error and not done for any ulterior or questionable motive. As far as our client is aware the FSA were satisfied that the information provided was in compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements. Our client is unaware of any investigation by the FSA or SFO into its activities so far as they relate to or involve Russell King.\"", "tags": ["Financial sector", "Business", "Serious Fraud Office", "Law", "Sven-Goran Eriksson", "Football", "Notts County", "UK news", "Bahrain"], "title": "SFO investigates scam that fooled North Korea"},{"date": "2011-05-26T07:30:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A quick burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology teamNorth Korea making its own PCs >> PCWorld\"North Korea might be an unlikely place to find a PC factory, but the country has started manufacturing three models of computers, according to a recent state TV report.\"The report, on the country's main 8pm evening news, took viewers inside the factory that's making the computers.

While these may be elusive there is another that is more readily seen \u2013 the bottlenose dolphins of the Moray Firth. These dolphins are the only resident population in the north of Britain and can be seen in various ways. One is to find a vantage point such as Chanonry Point on the Black Isle, a popular place since the publicity on the BBC's Springwatch and Autumnwatch TV programmes. Another way is take one of the many boat trips out from such places as Inverness, Avoch and Cromarty.Last week I chose perhaps an even easier way and visited the dolphin and seal centre at North Kessock, based on the north shore of the Beauly Firth. There is one advantage in this centre in that if you do not actually see any dolphins you can watch a video of them taken at Chanonry Point, or listen to their strange noises via hydrophones. The centre is dominated by its panorama window that overlooks the firth: it provides binoculars to watch the seals and dolphins in the sea below. The noticeboard outside, regularly updated by the attendant, informed me that earlier that day two dolphins had been seen from the centre.Fascinatingly, many of the dolphins have been given names as they can be individually identified by characteristics, especially the shape and colour of their fins. This recognition, backed by photographs, is an invaluable aid to the close studies of this population. The video of the Chanonry Point dolphins was mesmerising as they frolicked and leapt out of the water. On the other side of the firth from the centre the underwater hydrophone is situated in the area they feed and pass through the most, and the sound of their clicking and whistling seems to sum up their enigmatic life in the firths.", "tags": ["Environment", "Rural affairs", "UK news", "Wildlife", "Scotland holidays"], "title": "Country diary: North Kessock"},{"date": "2011-06-06T23:04:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Exactly a century ago, a tremendous thunderstorm broke over this part of the country. Tales of its duration and ferocity have been passed down through the generations; it flattened growing corn and hay, killed grazing livestock and did serious damage to buildings. One of the last-named was the medieval church in my village, Old Brampton. Its tower was put up in the 13th century and capped with an early type of broached spire 100 years later. That storm knocked the top off the spire and you can see the replacement masonry to this day. The topmost stone, which fell to the ground, was rescued by the church warden, taken to his garden (which is now mine) and fashioned into a bird bath, as which it still does service.It takes me only a couple of minutes to cross a sheep pasture and come to the crest of the broad, green valley, where it's possible to look back to the church steeple poking above the graveyard trees and out, the other way, to pick out the bright towers of Hardwick Hall all of nine miles away to the south-east. On a bright summer evening the massive, pioneering fenestration of Bess of Hardwick's pile really does live up to the old local rhyme \"Hardwick Hall \u2013 more glass than wall\". The funny thing about this green valley below my field-end lookout is that it lacks a name: no official name on any map, and no local, unofficial one either. But that doesn't in any way detract from its beauty. Just recently the green fields of waving corn, and grass waiting to be made into silage, have had a particularly fine fringe of purest white lace \u2013 cow parsley in rampant bloom.Looking back to the village, I espied the top of the church spire and thought of my bird bath, which must be one of the oldest in the country. Instead of supporting a gold cockerel it must now suffer the ignominy these past 100 years of serving blackbird, robin and house sparrow.", "tags": ["Environment", "Rural affairs", "UK news", "North of England"], "title": "Country diary: North Derbyshire"},{"date": "2011-05-21T23:05:50Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The BBC has long been bipolar when it comes to its buildings. The balance of power has long swung between its visionaries and bean-counters, at least since the rising architect Norman Foster designed a dazzling new building for BBC Radio in 1982, only for it to be scrapped in favour of some dim sheds in White City. Early in the last decade the Beeb tried to play Medici again, lining up an array of distinguished and up-and-coming practices: Sir David Chipperfield, Sir Richard MacCormac, Foreign Office Architects. There was much talk of creating buildings equal to the majesty and history of the organisation.This time the visionaries got further before the bean-counters chopped their legs off. MacCormac's extension of Broadcasting House and Chipperfield's BBC Scotland in Glasgow were both built, but only after both architects had been dumped, in order that their designs could be dumbed down.The creation of BBC North in Salford is the Naseby of the corporation's Roundheads, the decisive triumph of a managerial New Model Army who trounced the Prince Ruperts and their fancy architects, and dispatched them to oblivion. This group of three glass buildings, which now houses 13% of the BBC's public service staff, is so scrupulously practical and self-effacing, so determined to avoid any suggestion of wasting licence fees, that it is hard to know it is there at all. \"Nation shall speak peace unto nation\" is not carved here in stone, as it is in Broadcasting House, not least because there is little stone in which to carve it, apart from some cheap paving from China.BBC North is the result of a deal signed with the property developers Peel Holdings, following a bidding process in which other sites, including the centre of Manchester, were considered. The Peel Holdings offer was to make something with the web-friendly brand name of MediaCityUK, which would include huge production studios laid on by the management, the media studies department of Salford University, and other media companies. ITV would later take a building on the site, and the new Coronation Street is being built nearby, in full view of the BBC's offices. Faced with fierce competition from new media and the forces of Murdoch, former rivals now like to huddle together for comfort.MediaCityUK's avowed inspirations are places like Internet City and Media City in Dubai, enclaves with special rules that allow businesses to prosper. \"The driver was to create a cluster with facilities and infrastructure,\" say Peel, clunkily, by which they mean that the different media companies and institutions would benefit from each other's presence: \"students can bump into executive producers\". By taking care of the production studios, they would relieve the BBC of the burden of managing them. Located on a brownfield site by the Manchester Ship Canal, at the end of a 20-minute tram ride from the centre of Manchester, it helps that space here is cheap. And with staff now moving in, less than four years after the deal was signed, delivery was fast and efficient.MediaCityUK stands amid the vast wilderness formed by the devastation of industry under Margaret Thatcher, since filled by chunks of regeneration. It is a land of lumps, of Manchester United's stadium red and angry as Sir Alex Ferguson's face; of the green dome of Peel Holdings' vast Trafford shopping centre; of the convulsed forms, intended to express anguish, of Daniel Libeskind's Imperial War Museum, of blocks of contemporary-lifestyle apartments. There are the shiny shapes of the Lowry Centre, and of the Lowry Outlet Mall, with the name of the grumpy old artist standing for everything that is not here. There is nothing less Lowryesque than this landscape of gloss, in which everything \u2013 culture, shopping, the pain of war \u2013 achieves a kind of equivalence.Salford contains some of the most repulsive buildings in Britain, gesticulating monsters designed to lure buy-to-let investors to their doom. It is some relief that MediaCity, apart from a jazzy diamond pattern on ITV's future premises, has gone for plain glass buildings arranged around a piazza. It offers rather what is best called CostaSpace, as in Costa coffee, the by-now standard form of \"public\" space in Britain. Like the half-competent cappuccinos and soft furnishings of the coffee chain, CostaSpace offers things that are desirable and reasonable, such as good maintenance, open space, trees and access to waterfronts, yet fail absolutely to capture the essence of the continental coffee bar/public piazza which are the supposed models.What is lacking is a sense of spontaneity, individual enterprise or, ultimately, freedom. Everything is laid on, planned, managed in advance, plotted in powerpoints and business plans. Desire is programmed: a spiritless tower of flats is called the Heart, so that you might know in the absence of other evidence that is where the home is. The Dubai models for MediaCity are gated and controlled, and help sustain an illiberal and divided society, and while the Salford version is less extreme, private security still prevents behaviour thought inappropriate. When I ask BBC people if they won't miss the liveliness of a city centre, they give the same answer: there is a Costa here, and will be a Booths food store, and a Prezzo, and a WHSmith. Really? Is that all there is to life? Do they truly want to spend their days somewhere like the concourse of a medium-sized railway station?The BBC's departments, including sport, children's, Radio 5 Live and breakfast news, are spread around three buildings whose design was started by Wilkinson Eyre Architects and finished by Chapman Taylor. Inside they are fitted out to designs by ID:SR, with open plan everywhere, and cheerful dabs of colour and patterned wallpaper, and a domestic, sometimes childlike feel that tries to bring some of the vivacity elsewhere lacking. It looks well-organised and sensible. Extravagance is avoided: images of the 1958 classic Artichoke light are printed on the wallpaper, presumably because the real thing was beyond the budget.I meet the BBC people who have organised the installation of the BBC in their new buildings, and I have every reason to think they have done a good job. You can't blame the BBC for wanting to be efficient and economical. It's also good that they use their economic might to bring employment to deprived places, even if the supposed beneficiaries, the people of the ordinary streets of Salford, are nearly invisible. But is there really no third way between the pomp of expensive architecture and this place, stripped of ceremony and liveliness and surprise? And should a public body in pursuit of a good idea surrender itself so completely to the priorities of a private development company? Should the Beeb be in a wannabe Dubai?", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture", "BBC", "Norman Foster"], "title": "BBC North \u2013 review"},{"date": "2011-09-15T06:00:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "When you ask people what North Korea conjures up in their minds, often the same responses are given \u2013 secretive, poor, aggressive and Team America.

One method with which to do this is by introducing drama techniques into history. Getting pupils to take on roles as families split when the country was divided and then act out short sketches in the form of historical theatre, is an effective way in which to do this.The Korean War was one conflict among a whole host that took place during the Cold War. This also provides us with a great opportunity to assess its significance with the more publicised and well known Vietnam War.

Speaking during an Asia visit earlier this week, secretary of state Hillary Clinton said there would be no softening of Washington's demand that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons in return for normalised relations, energy assistance and security guarantees.North Korea's vice foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan said he was \"optimistic\" the six-party talks would be revived. \"Now is the time for countries to reconcile,\" he said. In a move timed to coincide with the New York meeting, Pyongyang reiterated its call for a treaty formally ending the 1950-53 Korean war.The resumed bilateral dialogue takes place against a backdrop of growing concern in South Korea and Japan that if North Korea cannot be persuaded to abandon its enrichment and other nuclear weapons-related activities, it may soon enter a more technologically advanced phase of its nuclear programme \u2013 meaning bigger, better bombs and longer-range ballistic missiles.\"Right now, North Korea may well be at a critical transitional moment in the development of its nuclear arsenal,\" said Joel Wit and Jenny Town, writing in Foreign Policy. \"Pyongyang has already completed the first phase of developing such an arsenal ... If [North Korea] is anything like other small nuclear powers, we can expect it to move on to building increasing numbers of more sophisticated nuclear weapons mounted on a variety of missile delivery systems.\"Reflecting this heightened sense of urgency, the US appears to be urging Seoul to move on from last year's sinking of a South Korean navy ship and a brief bombardment of its territory by the North. \"The US has definitely put some pressure on the South Korean government about beginning talks with North Korea,\" Hong Hyeon-ik, an analyst at Seoul's Sejong Institute, told the Washington Post.John Kerry, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, suggested recently the current stalemate could not be allowed to continue. \"Make no mistake: given North Korea's recent irresponsible conduct, staying in a diplomatic holding pattern invites a dangerous situation to get even worse,\" he said. But at the same time, other officials and analysts worry the US may concede too much in its effort to seal a deal.These concerns come in the context of broader anxiety that Washington's security guarantees for South Korea, dating back to the 1950s, are weakening as an overstretched, financially challenged US struggles to manage, or contain, the rise of an ever more militarily powerful and assertive China, North Korea's only important ally. To a greater or lesser degree, this anxiety about American commitment infects the region as a whole.\"Comments by influential South Koreans that their country should consider requesting the return of US nuclear weapons to their shores \u2013 or even acquire its own nuclear weapons \u2013 reflect persistent unease about how regional security developments are challenging US extended security guarantees developed during the cold war,\" said Richard Weitz, writing in The Diplomat.\"Although of less immediate concern to most South Koreans, the rising power of China has also been profoundly affecting regional security dynamics,\" Weitz said. \"In particular, China's growing military power has resulted in many east Asian countries deepening their security ties with the US and building up their defences, including by acquiring ballistic missile defences. In response, the Chinese have tightened their ties with North Korea, which, despite the headaches it causes, is a reliable buffer state.\"In short, it's plain any US proposal for a deal with North Korea must meet two basic criteria.

If we are to act, we must act now.\"North Korean government rations, believed to be keeping two-thirds of the population alive, have been steadily reducing, down from 400g per person per day in April to 150g in June \u2013 the equivalent of a small bowl of rice.Georgieva sent observers who were given unusual permission to visit hospitals and clinics, kindergartens and nurseries, markets and farms, and the state food distribution centres. They reported widespread hunger, near-empty markets and warehouses, and many people being treated in hospital after eating grass.\"Among the most saddening stories were of starving children begging in the market place to people who had absolutely nothing to give them. We cannot allow that to happen if we are in a position to help,\" she said.Georgieva has been in discussion with the World Food Programme, which is using the offer of European money as a lever to increase the number of international staff in the country monitoring food distribution, and to permit up to 400 visits a month, including members of her own team.\"This is a targeted, one-off response. We will be monitoring from port to hospital. I have asked that all the food from Europe be not bought at the same time: any sign of food not getting through, or being diverted away from the people we want to help, and it stops there, we give no more,\" Georgieva said.Between 1995 and 2008 the commission spent around \u20ac124m on humanitarian aid to North Korea, but in 2008 closed its office in Pyongyang and pulled out all staff.The present food crisis has been caused by the combination of floods last year, the coldest winter in 50 years, and then an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The next main cereal harvest is not due until October.A defector from North Korea recently gave the Guardian searing accounts of life in a detention camp where she was imprisoned for a previous escape from the country.\"There were about 1,000 women in our cabin and we were so squashed together we had to sleep with our legs interlocking,\" she said. \"We had rice husks to eat and had to work cutting down trees and dragging the timber back with chains. When it got really cold in winter, five or six women would die every day and the other prisoners would have to carry the bodies out.

Any country would be stretched to hit that accommodation target in two or three years,\" he said. \"As far as we can tell they are going all out to achieve as much as they can before then.\"Building work for such prestigious state events is normally carried out by the military, but construction teams are at full stretch on monuments, residential blocks and other projects.North Korea has also recommenced work on the 105-storey Ryugong skyscraper, which was started in 1987 and was then halted during the years of starvation and economic hardship. Foreign engineers have been called in for consultation and the authorities have promised to finish the building by 2012.There has been no mention of the mobilisation in the domestic media. Japan's Kyodo news agency has reported that all universities, except for graduating seniors and foreign students, had to cancel classes until next year.University World News said universities would be closed for up to 10 months from 27 June while students were dispatched to farms, factories and construction sites.The last time this is known to have happened for such a length of time was during the famines of the late 1990s. The food situation in the country remains precarious. Earlier this year, the UN launched an appeal for humanitarian aid.Hughes said the universities remained open, but many students were being shifted to outside tasks.\"They are already out there building things. It's difficult to know exactly what,\" he said. \"This has happened before, but for maybe a month or two.

For a peninsula that invests such meaning in auspicious numbers, 2012 marks the 100-year anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the nation's founder and Kim Jong-il's father. It was the year in which North Korea would declare itself a \"full nuclear weapons state\". It was the year in which all the powers that concern it have leadership elections \u2013 the US, China and South Korea. And it was also the year in which the \"dear leader\" was to have morphed into \"the great successor\", his third son Kim Jong-un. Having had almost two decades himself to step into his father's shoes, Kim Jong-il realised after his first stroke that his third and favoured son would not have the same time. He surrounded him with protectors like his aunt Kim Kyong-hui and his uncle Jang Song-taek. But in the end he ran out of time. Just 15 months after he returned home, the son is on his own.Being the only communist monarchy in the world, the official KCNA news agency yesterday emphasised the dynastic qualities of the succession. The 28-year-old's claim on his nation's loyalty lay, it seemed to suggest, on the fact that he was an identikit version of his father, Kim Jong-il \u2013 not just a chip off the old block, but almost his reincarnation. If he is shrewd, Kim Jong-un will use his physical resemblance to his father to establish himself. After the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994, Kim Jong-il spent three years consolidating his power, ostensibly in mourning, before formally taking over. But he came from a generation that was tough. He saw one brother die in a pond and his mother die when he was seven. He spent much of his youth in terror of his siblings. Whether the cosseted Swiss educated youngest son has got his dad's instincts for survival remains to be seen.There are opportunities for him to reap. Six million people, one fourth of the population, are, according to a WFP and FAO study earlier this year, in dire need of food. Last week in Beijing, the US special envoy for human rights Robert King had talks with a senior North Korean official. The meeting produced unconfirmed reports in Seoul that a deal could be in the offing: Pyongyang might allow inspectors from the IAEA back in, suspend its uranium-enrichment programme and impose a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, in exchange for 240,000 tonnes of food aid. If true, this would go a long way to meeting Washington's conditions for restarting the stalled six-party talks. After so many setbacks, they are not unnaturally looking for deeds rather than words. They had been here many times before only to watch North Korea let off a missile in Japan's direction, torpedo a South Korean boat, bombard the coastline, or rattle the seismometers with an underground test.Of all the elections coming up, the one in South Korea matters most. Contrary to the accepted wisdom that a hard line on North Korea produces results, President Lee Myung-bak has had little to show for being tough with the north. Quite the opposite. The shelling of Yeonpyeong island in November last year and the sinking of the Cheonan, for which Seoul is formally demanding an apology before allowing talks to go ahead, has shifted the tide of opinion in the south. Once again, public opinion in the south is divided over how tough it should be with the North. Only two months after the North Korean artillery attack, 43% believed the government should shift to a policy of dialogue and compromise, a high figure in the circumstances. There could once again be mileage in ideas like creating a maritime peace zone, renewing the commitments of the armistice and establishing a no-fire zone.With North Korea, nothing is certain. The irony is that moving towards peace could require a stronger and more ruthless leader in Kim Jong-un, than stumbling towards the next hairy incident with the nuclear state.", "tags": ["Kim Jong-il", "Kim Jong-un", "North Korea", "World news"], "title": "North Korea: Kim dread spirit | Editorial"},{"date": "2011-12-19T16:40:13Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The death of North Korea's Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, has thrown up one certainty, that now more than ever we in the west can bring stability to the Korean peninsula by finally making peace with Pyongyang.It's reported that Kim's death has made for much uncertainty about the state and region. Predictably, missiles have been fired into the water, but we will be shown a sea of tears in Pyongyang rather than a sea of fire on Seoul, nor is any civil implosion likely. Open opposition to the regime in North Korea essentially doesn't exist. While many tens of thousands have risked their lives by wading across the border rivers with China, North Korea lacks the critical mass of opposition, and the communication infrastructure, to precipitate an Arab spring in Pyongyang.For all the talk of its \"collapsing economy\", the North Korean state is in fact incredibly resilient. It's survived decades of being on a semi-war footing with South Korea and the US, economic and diplomatic isolation and sanctions, famine, global opprobrium for its nuclear bomb programme, and the death of Kim Il-sung. What North Korea does best is survive, and it will continue to do so under the 20-something Kim Jong-un.That said, as often overlooked in any analysis of the north are the 24 million souls trying to survive there, human beings too often portrayed in the west as brainwashed automatons slavishly revering the dead presidents, and therefore we're less bothered when they die from famines of food and fuel that western sanctions do much to bring about.We were told that the regime, under the aegis of a madman, put its own survival first and directed resources primarily into the military. But what else would it do, when it's not at peace with either South Korea nor the hyperpower US? For all that, the west must realise that threats and throttling sanctions just don't work and take this chance to leave all the blame for the past with the dead man and his personality cult, and offer aid, trade and peace with the North Koreans, nukes or not.It's not a question of \"rewarding Pyongyang's bad behaviour\", nor appeasing the regime, nor need the efficacy of any existing structure monitoring any dealings with dangerous arms or nuclear components be compromised by peace. Anyway, it has been a nuclear power for some years and the sky hasn't fallen on anyone \u2013 not least as Beijing won't allow it.It should be remembered that the north reprised its nuclear bomb programme following claims that it had already done so from George W Bush neocons, who had already reneged on a long-standing deal for North Korea to mothball its nuclear reactors in exchange for light-water technology and fuel oil from the US. They listed the north on the \"axis of evil\", and didn't even bother to produce a dodgy dossier about Pyongyang's bomb-making, while invading the Middle East on lies. You'd be crazy not to make a bomb in the face of such aggression.But worse was that the whole atomic fracas did so much damage to years of diplomatic and economic progress in bringing North Korea in from the cold and in touch with the world, first and foremost with South Korea and the US. During the 1990s, South Korea under Kim Dae-jung, with the blessing of the Clinton administration, offered the north the \"sunshine policy\" of rapprochement and investment, and the north, under Kim Jong-il, eagerly took it up. Pyongyang's nuclear bomb programme stopped. The anti-US propaganda stopped. Diplomatic and trade relations were founded with the EU and the UK. The North Korean people, those people who just want to have enough to feed their families and have a beer with friends, who go on picnics, and lie in the park looking at the sky \u2013 ordinary people like us but whose elders still weep for Kim Il-sung and who simply happen to live in an extraordinary state on the edge of the world \u2013 genuinely believed a new age of peace was burgeoning before the Washington neocons dashed the lot.Yet, amid the ensuing sabre-rattling, billions of South Korean won were still invested into building factories and tourist facilities in North Korea. Parts of the world's most heavily fortified frontier, the de-militarised zone, have been de-mined and tourist buses have crossed south to north where tanks fear to trundle. As it is, hopes are that South Korea's free trade deal with the EU will be cemented by rail links running via Pyongyang. And just last week, officials from the US and North Korea met to talk about the US delivering food aid, with no strings attached to the north's bomb programme.

What appeared to be live footage from North Korean state TV showed the procession moving slowly through the streets against a backdrop of snowfall and clearly audible mass outpouring of grief from an estimated 200,000 mourners, most of whom were in military uniform.The procession may have helped answer key questions about the communist regime's immediate future, amid fears that the rapid rise to power of the inexperienced Kim Jong-un could spark a power struggle that could potentially threaten regional security.Jong-un, wearing a long black coat, walked at the front of the hearse carrying his father's casket on its roof, a sign that the succession is proceeding as the older Kim had envisaged when he unveiled the youngest of his three sons as his heir at a military parade in the capital in October 2010.The younger Kim bowed his head slightly and held a military salute as the motorcade left the city's main square. Just yards behind him was his Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law, Jang Song -thaek, whom many expect to help the new leader tighten his grip on power in the coming months. With them was Ri Yong-ho, the army's chief of staff.In front were cars carrying a large wreath draped with black ribbons and a huge portrait of a smiling Kim Jong-il dressed in his trademark khaki suit.Following them were about a dozen black Mercedes-Benz sedans and a larger fleet of white luxury cars. The only military vehicles on display were the jeeps surrounding Kim's hearse.Kim's two other sons, Kim Jong Nam and Kim Jong Chol, have not yet been seen.The early stages of the procession were watched by ranks of soldiers, some of whom held on to each other for support, while women in civilian clothes clasped white handkerchiefs to their mouths.The funeral was accompanied by a slow march performed by a military band and an oscillating commentary from a newscaster identified as Ri Chun-hee, who announced Kim Jong-il's death last week.Amid eulogies to Kim Jong-il, she says that under Jong-un's leadership, \"North Korea will experience only victories\".Some in the crowd could be heard shouting: \"How could you leave us? What are we supposed to do without you?\" State media used the snowy weather to bolster myths about Kim Jong-il's birth on Korea's highest peak, although Soviet records show he was born in Russia.\"The feathery snowfall reminds the Korean people of the snowy day when the leader was born in the secret camp of Mt Paektu and of the great revolutionary career that he followed through snowdrifts,\" said the Korea Central News Agency. \"It seems the sky knows well of how much he got snowed on during his uninterrupted field guidance tour for the happiness of the people.\"Citing the snowy weather, one soldier told North Korea state TV: \"A national tragedy has occurred; how could the sky not cry?Another said: \"The people, the mountains, the streams and the heavens are weeping tears of blood for having to bid the final farewell.\"State media have sought to burnish Kim Jong-il's reputation as an inspired military leader who brought prosperity and progress to what, by any measure, is one of the world's poorest countries.Kim Jong-il, who died from a heart attack on 17 December aged 69, left behind a country that is some way towards developing nuclear weapons as part of his \"military first\" policy.As soon as Kim's death was announced last Monday - two days after the fact - there were fears that North Korean military elites, resentful of the younger Kim's rapid rise to power, could block his accession and plunge the country into chaos.Jong-un, who is aged 28 or 29, had a little over a year to prepare for power after his first public appearance at a military parade in October 2010.Fears of a political vacuum appear to have been allayed, however, with senior military and Workers' party officials reportedly pledging loyalty to Jong-un.North Korean media have started referring to him as \"supreme commander\" of the armed forces; the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers' party, has also described Jong-un as the head of the party's central committee, one of the country's most powerful decision-making bodies. On Wednesday, the state media declared that the country was in the \"warm care\" of Jong-un.Kim Jong-un will be advised by a small group of \"senior revolutionaries\", including his aunt and uncle, whose first task will be to ensure stability at least until the country marks the centenary of Kim Il-sung's birth next April.Kim Jong-il had been expected to use the anniversary to pronounce North Korea a \"strong and prosperous nation\" and a bona fide nuclear power.Jong-un will continue to pursue the military-first policy of his father, according to Jeon Hyun-jun of the Korea Institute for National Unification.\"North Korea's economic crisis and security problems will not be solved easily in the future,\" he wrote in a commentary for the Daily NK website, adding that the term \"military first\" had appeared 21 times in Rodong Sinmun editorials on 22 December alone.Jeon said he believed the party and military will not oppose their new leader; the weakest link, he says, are the people, whose loyalty to the regime has been weakened by glaring faults in the food distribution system.\"We must not fall into the trap of using a hardline policy towards North Korea,\" Jeon wrote. \"Rather, we must let it be known that the rice of the North Korean people is not given by their general or supreme leader, but by the US and South Korea. We are in great need of a strategic plan.\"The younger Kim will inherit a country that is close to mounting nuclear warheads on its ballistic missiles, according to a US expert.Larry Niksch, who spent 43 years monitoring North Korea for the US congressional research service, said in a study that the regime could miniaturise and mount a nuclear warhead on a medium-range Nodong missile within one or two years.Siegfried Hecker, the former head of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said last year that the North's uranium enrichment programme was more advanced than previously thought.Hecker, who visited North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex in November 2010, believes the country would have to conduct a third nuclear test - the first two were conducted in 2006 and 2009 - to be certain its warhead technology was sound.\"If the test is successful they may be able to have the capability within a couple of years,\" he told Reuters. \"We simply don't know what else they have and how much highly enriched uranium they can make or have made.\"Before the funeral coverage started, about four hours later than scheduled, North Korean state TV was showing archive footage of Kim Jong-il's early days as leader, including his vaunted trips to farms and factories to offer \"field guidance\".Large portraits of a smiling Kim Jong-il could be seen around Pyongyang, reports said, with the streets bedecked with red \"kimjongilia\" begonias named after the deceased leader.In the 10 days since Kim Jong-il's death was announced, North Korean state TV has repeatedly broadcast scenes of uniformed soldiers and civilians in black suits or traditional dress falling to their knees in distress before the bier where the \"dear leader\" has been lying in state.In a startling break with tradition, his son was shown in obvious distress as he wiped away tears during one of a reported five visits he has made the mausoleum in just over a week.It was not immediate clear if Kim Jong-il would be buried or embalmed and placed on permanent display next to the body of his father at Kumsusan memorial palace in Pyongyang.The funeral proceedings are expected to last two days.

We are in great need of a strategic plan.\"The younger Kim will inherit a country that is close to mounting nuclear warheads on its ballistic missiles, according to a US expert.Larry Niksch, who spent 43 years monitoring North Korea for the US congressional research service, said in a study that the regime could miniaturise and mount a nuclear warhead on a medium-range Nodong missile within one or two years.Siegfried Hecker, the former head of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said last year that the North's uranium enrichment programme was more advanced than previously thought.Hecker, who visited North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex in November 2010, believes the country would have to conduct a third nuclear test - the first two were conducted in 2006 and 2009 - to be certain its warhead technology was sound.\"If the test is successful they may be able to have the capability within a couple of years,\" he told Reuters. \"We simply don't know what else they have and how much highly enriched uranium they can make or have made.\"Before the funeral coverage started, about four hours later than scheduled, North Korean state TV was showing archive footage of Kim Jong-il's early days as leader, including his vaunted trips to farms and factories to offer \"field guidance\".Large portraits of a smiling Kim Jong-il could be seen around Pyongyang, reports said, with the streets bedecked with red \"kimjongilia\" begonias named after the deceased leader.In the 10 days since Kim Jong-il's death was announced, North Korean state TV has repeatedly broadcast scenes of uniformed soldiers and civilians in black suits or traditional dress falling to their knees in distress before the bier where the \"dear leader\" has been lying in state.In a startling break with tradition, his son was shown in obvious distress as he wiped away tears during one of a reported five visits he has made the mausoleum in just over a week.It was not immediate clear if Kim Jong-il would be buried or embalmed and placed on permanent display next to the body of his father at Kumsusan memorial palace in Pyongyang.The funeral proceedings are expected to last two days. On Thursday, a national memorial service will feature an artillery salute to be followed by a three minutes' silence at noon and trains and ships sounding their horns in unison.", "tags": ["Kim Jong-il", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-un", "World news", "South Korea"], "title": "North Korea holds funeral for Kim Jong-il"},{"date": "2011-12-20T08:01:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The US wants to see a \"peaceful and stable transition\" in North Korea, Hillary Clinton has said, as Pyongyang settled into an 11-day period of mourning for Kim Jong-il.Seoul finally sent its condolences to its neighbour after more than 24 hours of pondering its response, but the measured tone of official comments suggested it had little interest in using Kim's death to thaw frosty relations on the peninsula.Anxiety about potential instability following the 69-year-old's death endured at home and abroad on Tuesday. The propaganda campaign promoting Kim's son and \"great successor\" \u2013 thought to be just 28 \u2013 stepped up a gear, with state media hailing Kim Jong-un as \"the eternally immovable mental mainstay of the Korean people\".Speaking to reporters following a meeting with Japan's foreign minister, Koichiro Gemba, the US secretary of state told reporters: \"We both share a common interest in a peaceful and stable transition in North Korea as well as ensuring regional peace and stability.\"In a formal statement issued later, Clinton noted: \"We are deeply concerned with the wellbeing of the North Korean people and our thoughts and prayers are with them during these difficult times. It is our hope that the new leadership will choose to guide their nation on to the path of peace by honouring North Korea's commitments, improving relations with its neighbours, and respecting the rights of its people.\"The United States stands ready to help the North Korean people and urges the new leadership to work with the international community to usher in a new era of peace, prosperity and lasting security on the Korean peninsula.\"John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University, said: \"In both her statements there are some direct messages, definitely, for whoever is calling the shots in Pyongyang. Referring to Kim Jong-il by his full title [of National Defence Commission chairman]; talking about national mourning \u2026 these are carefully crafted to send really non-threatening messages.\"One line, emphasising peaceful and stable transition, could sound like China wrote it.\"But Dr Leonid Petrov, of the University of Sydney, said the US was unlikely to go far enough to make significant progress in discussions.\"If Hillary Clinton is prepared to restart the relationship and forget about the animosity and propose a peace agreement and roadmap for security and trade, I am pretty sure North Korea will be very co-operative,\" he said.\"But I'm afraid the expectations are of one-sided disarmament, democratisation and openness \u2013 without much commitment from the US to changing its unequivocal position of trade sanctions, no security assurance and no diplomatic recognition, so that regime change could happen at any time. That is what North Korea fears most.\"The US had been gently attempting to improve relations with North Korea. But the prospects of fresh nuclear talks and food aid have been shelved for now as leaders assess the implications of Kim's death.The US president, Barack Obama, has spoken to the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, and the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak. The administration has also contacted officials in China and Russia, the White House said.Almost a day after the announcement of Kim's death, Seoul issued condolences to the North Korean people, with the unification minister, Yu Woo-ik, adding that it hoped the North would co-operate for peace and prosperity on the peninsula.He told reporters that no official delegation would travel to Pyongyang to pay respects, but said the government would allow visits by relatives of the former president Kim Dae-jung, who held a landmark summit with Kim Jong-il in 2000, and the former Hyundai Asan chairman Chung Mong-hun, who had business ties with the North.North Korea has already said it will not receive foreign delegations during the mourning period. It is not clear whether its stance might shift.Yu added that his government was refraining from moves that might exasperate Pyongyang and said he would ask Christian groups to refrain from lighting giant steel Christmas trees near the border with North Korea.The tepid tone of the message offered little hope to those who had thought Seoul might seek to use the occasion to reset relations.\"That is what they are trying not to do,\" said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, the north-east Asia project director for the International Crisis Group.\"If they go, the US could go and they would be opening it up and that would be a change of policy. That is simply not this government's policy; why would they push it?\"Relations on the peninsula deteriorated rapidly after Lee reversed the \"sunshine policy\" of his predecessors.\"There is no point sending anybody to North Korea considering the damage that Kim Jong-il had done to South Korea and its people,\" said Prof Han Seung-joo, a former foreign minister.\"The new leader \u2013 or leadership \u2013 needs time to establish itself so I don't think we can expect a breakthrough any time in relations between North and South Korea or on the nuclear issue.\"China and Russia had earlier sent condolences to the North and the president, Hu Jintao, visited the North Korean embassy in Beijing in an extremely rare gesture of respect.Liu Weimin, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, said China would welcome a visit from the North Korean leader at a convenient time to both sides.In Japan, the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said Noda has ordered government officials to improve measures to collect information on the North's moves, sharing it with the US, the South and China, and to be fully prepared for unpredictable circumstances.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Kim Jong-un", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Hillary Clinton", "US foreign policy", "US news"], "title": "US urges North Korea to 'follow the path of peace'"},{"date": "2011-12-19T20:57:58Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The new year came early for North Korea on Saturday. For a peninsula that invests such meaning in auspicious numbers, 2012 marks the 100-year anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the nation's founder and Kim Jong-il's father. It was the year in which North Korea would declare itself a \"full nuclear weapons state\". It was the year in which all the powers that concern it have leadership elections \u2013 the US, China and South Korea. And it was also the year in which the \"dear leader\" was to have morphed into \"the great successor\", his third son Kim Jong-un. Having had almost two decades himself to step into his father's shoes, Kim Jong-il realised after his first stroke that his third and favoured son would not have the same time. He surrounded him with protectors like his aunt Kim Kyong-hui and his uncle Jang Song-taek. But in the end he ran out of time. Just 15 months after he returned home, the son is on his own.Being the only communist monarchy in the world, the official KCNA news agency yesterday emphasised the dynastic qualities of the succession. The 28-year-old's claim on his nation's loyalty lay, it seemed to suggest, on the fact that he was an identikit version of his father, Kim Jong-il \u2013 not just a chip off the old block, but almost his reincarnation. If he is shrewd, Kim Jong-un will use his physical resemblance to his father to establish himself. After the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994, Kim Jong-il spent three years consolidating his power, ostensibly in mourning, before formally taking over. But he came from a generation that was tough. He saw one brother die in a pond and his mother die when he was seven. He spent much of his youth in terror of his siblings. Whether the cosseted Swiss educated youngest son has got his dad's instincts for survival remains to be seen.There are opportunities for him to reap. Six million people, one fourth of the population, are, according to a WFP and FAO study earlier this year, in dire need of food. Last week in Beijing, the US special envoy for human rights Robert King had talks with a senior North Korean official. The meeting produced unconfirmed reports in Seoul that a deal could be in the offing: Pyongyang might allow inspectors from the IAEA back in, suspend its uranium-enrichment programme and impose a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, in exchange for 240,000 tonnes of food aid. If true, this would go a long way to meeting Washington's conditions for restarting the stalled six-party talks. After so many setbacks, they are not unnaturally looking for deeds rather than words. They had been here many times before only to watch North Korea let off a missile in Japan's direction, torpedo a South Korean boat, bombard the coastline, or rattle the seismometers with an underground test.Of all the elections coming up, the one in South Korea matters most. Contrary to the accepted wisdom that a hard line on North Korea produces results, President Lee Myung-bak has had little to show for being tough with the north. Quite the opposite. The shelling of Yeonpyeong island in November last year and the sinking of the Cheonan, for which Seoul is formally demanding an apology before allowing talks to go ahead, has shifted the tide of opinion in the south. Once again, public opinion in the south is divided over how tough it should be with the North. Only two months after the North Korean artillery attack, 43% believed the government should shift to a policy of dialogue and compromise, a high figure in the circumstances. There could once again be mileage in ideas like creating a maritime peace zone, renewing the commitments of the armistice and establishing a no-fire zone.With North Korea, nothing is certain. The irony is that moving towards peace could require a stronger and more ruthless leader in Kim Jong-un, than stumbling towards the next hairy incident with the nuclear state.", "tags": ["Kim Jong-il", "Kim Jong-un", "North Korea", "World news"], "title": "North Korea: Kim dread spirit | Editorial"},{"date": "2011-12-19T16:40:13Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The death of North Korea's Dear Leader, Kim Jong-il, has thrown up one certainty, that now more than ever we in the west can bring stability to the Korean peninsula by finally making peace with Pyongyang.It's reported that Kim's death has made for much uncertainty about the state and region. Predictably, missiles have been fired into the water, but we will be shown a sea of tears in Pyongyang rather than a sea of fire on Seoul, nor is any civil implosion likely. Open opposition to the regime in North Korea essentially doesn't exist. While many tens of thousands have risked their lives by wading across the border rivers with China, North Korea lacks the critical mass of opposition, and the communication infrastructure, to precipitate an Arab spring in Pyongyang.For all the talk of its \"collapsing economy\", the North Korean state is in fact incredibly resilient. It's survived decades of being on a semi-war footing with South Korea and the US, economic and diplomatic isolation and sanctions, famine, global opprobrium for its nuclear bomb programme, and the death of Kim Il-sung. What North Korea does best is survive, and it will continue to do so under the 20-something Kim Jong-un.That said, as often overlooked in any analysis of the north are the 24 million souls trying to survive there, human beings too often portrayed in the west as brainwashed automatons slavishly revering the dead presidents, and therefore we're less bothered when they die from famines of food and fuel that western sanctions do much to bring about.We were told that the regime, under the aegis of a madman, put its own survival first and directed resources primarily into the military. But what else would it do, when it's not at peace with either South Korea nor the hyperpower US? For all that, the west must realise that threats and throttling sanctions just don't work and take this chance to leave all the blame for the past with the dead man and his personality cult, and offer aid, trade and peace with the North Koreans, nukes or not.It's not a question of \"rewarding Pyongyang's bad behaviour\", nor appeasing the regime, nor need the efficacy of any existing structure monitoring any dealings with dangerous arms or nuclear components be compromised by peace. Anyway, it has been a nuclear power for some years and the sky hasn't fallen on anyone \u2013 not least as Beijing won't allow it.It should be remembered that the north reprised its nuclear bomb programme following claims that it had already done so from George W Bush neocons, who had already reneged on a long-standing deal for North Korea to mothball its nuclear reactors in exchange for light-water technology and fuel oil from the US. They listed the north on the \"axis of evil\", and didn't even bother to produce a dodgy dossier about Pyongyang's bomb-making, while invading the Middle East on lies. You'd be crazy not to make a bomb in the face of such aggression.But worse was that the whole atomic fracas did so much damage to years of diplomatic and economic progress in bringing North Korea in from the cold and in touch with the world, first and foremost with South Korea and the US. During the 1990s, South Korea under Kim Dae-jung, with the blessing of the Clinton administration, offered the north the \"sunshine policy\" of rapprochement and investment, and the north, under Kim Jong-il, eagerly took it up. Pyongyang's nuclear bomb programme stopped. The anti-US propaganda stopped. Diplomatic and trade relations were founded with the EU and the UK. The North Korean people, those people who just want to have enough to feed their families and have a beer with friends, who go on picnics, and lie in the park looking at the sky \u2013 ordinary people like us but whose elders still weep for Kim Il-sung and who simply happen to live in an extraordinary state on the edge of the world \u2013 genuinely believed a new age of peace was burgeoning before the Washington neocons dashed the lot.Yet, amid the ensuing sabre-rattling, billions of South Korean won were still invested into building factories and tourist facilities in North Korea. Parts of the world's most heavily fortified frontier, the de-militarised zone, have been de-mined and tourist buses have crossed south to north where tanks fear to trundle. As it is, hopes are that South Korea's free trade deal with the EU will be cemented by rail links running via Pyongyang. And just last week, officials from the US and North Korea met to talk about the US delivering food aid, with no strings attached to the north's bomb programme. Add peace to the bargain, and let Obama end the war with North Korea as well as Iraq.The precedents have long been set that working with Pyongyang pays off, and aid and trade would at the very least give some deliverance to the suffering populace.

We are in great need of a strategic plan.\"The younger Kim will inherit a country that is close to mounting nuclear warheads on its ballistic missiles, according to a US expert.Larry Niksch, who spent 43 years monitoring North Korea for the US congressional research service, said in a study that the regime could miniaturise and mount a nuclear warhead on a medium-range Nodong missile within one or two years.Siegfried Hecker, the former head of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said last year that the North's uranium enrichment programme was more advanced than previously thought.Hecker, who visited North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex in November 2010, believes the country would have to conduct a third nuclear test - the first two were conducted in 2006 and 2009 - to be certain its warhead technology was sound.\"If the test is successful they may be able to have the capability within a couple of years,\" he told Reuters. \"We simply don't know what else they have and how much highly enriched uranium they can make or have made.\"Before the funeral coverage started, about four hours later than scheduled, North Korean state TV was showing archive footage of Kim Jong-il's early days as leader, including his vaunted trips to farms and factories to offer \"field guidance\".Large portraits of a smiling Kim Jong-il could be seen around Pyongyang, reports said, with the streets bedecked with red \"kimjongilia\" begonias named after the deceased leader.In the 10 days since Kim Jong-il's death was announced, North Korean state TV has repeatedly broadcast scenes of uniformed soldiers and civilians in black suits or traditional dress falling to their knees in distress before the bier where the \"dear leader\" has been lying in state.In a startling break with tradition, his son was shown in obvious distress as he wiped away tears during one of a reported five visits he has made the mausoleum in just over a week.It was not immediate clear if Kim Jong-il would be buried or embalmed and placed on permanent display next to the body of his father at Kumsusan memorial palace in Pyongyang.The funeral proceedings are expected to last two days. On Thursday, a national memorial service will feature an artillery salute to be followed by a three minutes' silence at noon and trains and ships sounding their horns in unison.", "tags": ["Kim Jong-il", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-un", "World news", "South Korea"], "title": "North Korea holds funeral for Kim Jong-il"},{"date": "2011-12-20T08:01:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The US wants to see a \"peaceful and stable transition\" in North Korea, Hillary Clinton has said, as Pyongyang settled into an 11-day period of mourning for Kim Jong-il.Seoul finally sent its condolences to its neighbour after more than 24 hours of pondering its response, but the measured tone of official comments suggested it had little interest in using Kim's death to thaw frosty relations on the peninsula.Anxiety about potential instability following the 69-year-old's death endured at home and abroad on Tuesday. The propaganda campaign promoting Kim's son and \"great successor\" \u2013 thought to be just 28 \u2013 stepped up a gear, with state media hailing Kim Jong-un as \"the eternally immovable mental mainstay of the Korean people\".Speaking to reporters following a meeting with Japan's foreign minister, Koichiro Gemba, the US secretary of state told reporters: \"We both share a common interest in a peaceful and stable transition in North Korea as well as ensuring regional peace and stability.\"In a formal statement issued later, Clinton noted: \"We are deeply concerned with the wellbeing of the North Korean people and our thoughts and prayers are with them during these difficult times. It is our hope that the new leadership will choose to guide their nation on to the path of peace by honouring North Korea's commitments, improving relations with its neighbours, and respecting the rights of its people.\"The United States stands ready to help the North Korean people and urges the new leadership to work with the international community to usher in a new era of peace, prosperity and lasting security on the Korean peninsula.\"John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University, said: \"In both her statements there are some direct messages, definitely, for whoever is calling the shots in Pyongyang. Referring to Kim Jong-il by his full title [of National Defence Commission chairman]; talking about national mourning \u2026 these are carefully crafted to send really non-threatening messages.\"One line, emphasising peaceful and stable transition, could sound like China wrote it.\"But Dr Leonid Petrov, of the University of Sydney, said the US was unlikely to go far enough to make significant progress in discussions.\"If Hillary Clinton is prepared to restart the relationship and forget about the animosity and propose a peace agreement and roadmap for security and trade, I am pretty sure North Korea will be very co-operative,\" he said.\"But I'm afraid the expectations are of one-sided disarmament, democratisation and openness \u2013 without much commitment from the US to changing its unequivocal position of trade sanctions, no security assurance and no diplomatic recognition, so that regime change could happen at any time. That is what North Korea fears most.\"The US had been gently attempting to improve relations with North Korea. But the prospects of fresh nuclear talks and food aid have been shelved for now as leaders assess the implications of Kim's death.The US president, Barack Obama, has spoken to the Japanese prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, and the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak. The administration has also contacted officials in China and Russia, the White House said.Almost a day after the announcement of Kim's death, Seoul issued condolences to the North Korean people, with the unification minister, Yu Woo-ik, adding that it hoped the North would co-operate for peace and prosperity on the peninsula.He told reporters that no official delegation would travel to Pyongyang to pay respects, but said the government would allow visits by relatives of the former president Kim Dae-jung, who held a landmark summit with Kim Jong-il in 2000, and the former Hyundai Asan chairman Chung Mong-hun, who had business ties with the North.North Korea has already said it will not receive foreign delegations during the mourning period. It is not clear whether its stance might shift.Yu added that his government was refraining from moves that might exasperate Pyongyang and said he would ask Christian groups to refrain from lighting giant steel Christmas trees near the border with North Korea.The tepid tone of the message offered little hope to those who had thought Seoul might seek to use the occasion to reset relations.\"That is what they are trying not to do,\" said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, the north-east Asia project director for the International Crisis Group.\"If they go, the US could go and they would be opening it up and that would be a change of policy. That is simply not this government's policy; why would they push it?\"Relations on the peninsula deteriorated rapidly after Lee reversed the \"sunshine policy\" of his predecessors.\"There is no point sending anybody to North Korea considering the damage that Kim Jong-il had done to South Korea and its people,\" said Prof Han Seung-joo, a former foreign minister.\"The new leader \u2013 or leadership \u2013 needs time to establish itself so I don't think we can expect a breakthrough any time in relations between North and South Korea or on the nuclear issue.\"China and Russia had earlier sent condolences to the North and the president, Hu Jintao, visited the North Korean embassy in Beijing in an extremely rare gesture of respect.Liu Weimin, a spokesman for the foreign ministry, said China would welcome a visit from the North Korean leader at a convenient time to both sides.In Japan, the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said Noda has ordered government officials to improve measures to collect information on the North's moves, sharing it with the US, the South and China, and to be fully prepared for unpredictable circumstances.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Kim Jong-un", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Hillary Clinton", "US foreign policy", "US news"], "title": "US urges North Korea to 'follow the path of peace'"},{"date": "2011-12-19T06:20:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Kim Jong-il's death has shifted the world's focus to his likely successor, his youngest son Kim Jong-un.If the planned succession proceeds without a hitch, the little-known, Swiss-educated Kim will be the leader of a nuclear state wracked by instability.Reports from North Korea said the country's 24 million people had already begun to rally round Kim Jong-un, who has been the communist state's leader-in-waiting for more than a year.The North's official Korean Central News Agency said the country, people and military \"must faithfully revere respectable comrade Kim Jong-un. At the leadership of comrade Kim Jong-un, we have to change sadness to strength and courage and overcome today's difficulties.\"Little is known about Kim Jong-il's third son, who is believed to be in his late twenties; reports from Pyongyang suggest his ailing father had spent the past year grooming Kim Jong-un, whom the state media are now calling \"the great successor\" for leadership of the world's most isolated nation by taking him on \"field guidance\" trips around the country.The Swiss-educated Kim Jong-un is believed to have accompanied his father on a trip to China in May this year, apparently in an attempt to win support for his succession from Beijing, North Korea's only remaining ally and a major donor of aid.He is also reported to have travelled to China with his father in August 2010, when Kim senior - known as the \"Dear Leader\" - is thought to have met Chinese president Hu Jintao and appealed for diplomatic and financial support for his son's succession.North Korean state media have mentioned Jong-un in glowing terms, amid fears that his succession could meet with resistance from the upper ranks of the powerful Korean People's Army.It is possible that Kim Jong-un, who lacks the years of political experience his father enjoyed before becoming leader in 1994, will initially act as the figurehead of a regime run by influential members of the ruling party, according to Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies in Seoul.\"Chances that the North Korean military is attempting a coup are very low, because North Korea has called itself a nation sharing a common destiny, Kim Jong-un,\" he said.\"I think the collective leadership of the party, government and military will go on for a while, because Kim Jong-un is still young.\"Yang said South Korea, which has put its military on high alert, would probably attempt to quickly establish a working relationship with the new leadership.\"Now, South Korea urgently needs to think of who in North Korea it has to deal with,\" he said. \"South Korea doesn't want any instability in North Korea, so will probably work to expand its co-operation efforts.\"South Korean media have reported that Jang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law and a trusted member of his inner circle, had been acting as a mentor to Kim Jong-un in anticipation of a more steady transition of power.But as it is, Kim senior, who suffered a stroke in 2008 and was reportedly ill with heart disease, died a year short of the centennial of the birth of his father, an event he was to mark by proclaiming his country a successful, modern state and a bona fide nuclear power.If the handover of power in North Korea, the world's only communistdynasty, proceeds as envisaged by Kim Jong-il, his son could be about to complete a rapid rise to prominence following his public debut in September last year.Then, he was awarded the rank of four-star general and made vice-chairman of the ruling Workers' party of Korea central military commission, a move analysts say was designed to place him at the centre of the country's power structure.If he does become the third member of his family to lead North Korea - his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, founded the state in 1948 - Kim Jong-un will face immediate challenges.The regime had recently been seeking tens of thousands of tonnes of aid amid reports of serious food shortages this winter; a famine in the 1990s killed an estimated 1 million of North Korea's 23 million people.He will also face renewed pressure to end North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, sparked strict international sanctions that have placed the leadership under serious financial strain.Multiparty talks involving the two Koreas, China, the US, Russia and Japan have not been held since Pyongyang walked out of the process in April 2009.Last year it emerged that North Korea had built a uranium enrichment plant that could give it the ability to drastically strengthen its nuclear capability.It is known to have enough fissile material from its plutonium-basedprogramme to make between six and 12 nuclear bombs, but has not proved it has a working nuclear weapon.Kim Jong-il passed over his first and second sons as potential successors, but there are suggestions that he was never convinced that Kim Jong-un would make a successful leader.Early this year, his eldest son, Kim Jong-nam, told a Japanese newspaper that his father opposed continuing the family dynasty, but had named his youngest brother heir to maintain stability.In an interview with the Tokyo Shimbun, Kim Jong-nam said that hereditary succession \"does not fit with socialism, and my father was against it as well\".Kim Jong-nam fell out of favour with his father in 2001 after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.\"My understanding is that [succession] was to stabilise the internal system. An unstable North Korea leads to instability in the region,\" he said in an interview in a southern Chinese city this month.In a country that, despite its communist doctrine, retains a Confucian respect for seniority, Kim Jong-un could have expected to give way to his older siblings, but reportedly emerged as his father's favourite after impressing him with his single-mindedness and leadership qualities.The leader-in-waiting, who shares his father's chubby frame, was educated at a Swiss boarding school, where he is said to have excelled at skiing and basketball, and learned to speak English, German and French.In a 2003 book, Kenji Fujimoto, a Japanese chef who worked as Kim Jong-il's personal cook before fleeing back to Japan, described Kim Jong-un as \"a chip off the old block, a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape and personality\".Kim Jong-un's presence at North Korea's biggest-ever military parade, in Pyongyang in October last year, was taken by some to mean that he had been accepted by the leaders of the country's 1.2-million strong army.Kim Yong-hyun, an expert on North Korea at Seoul's Fdongguk University, said at the time.\" The parade served as a sign that the military has loyalty to the successor.\"It remains to be seen how the North Korean establishment and the country's impoverished people react to his possible accession. In leaked US embassy cables published by WikiLeaks last November, South Korean analysts warned the assistant secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, of possible instability arising from a botched succession.\"Of the five experts, one thought the younger Kim might succeed and one argued his lack of leadership experience made it unlikely he would win the support of the ruling elites,\" the cables said.They continued: \"They agreed that Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law Jang Song-taek would prove a strong rival for the younger Kim and would probably be tempted to challenge him. Kim Jong-il had used draconian controls and international aid to discourage coups after having foiled three such attempts in the late 90s.\"The cables referred to doubts about Kim Jong-un's ability to fend off challenges to his leadership in the event of his father's death. The experts noted that the younger Kim \"had very little experience and might not get much direct guidance before Kim Jong-il dies\".His father's sudden death, reportedly of heart failure while travelling by train on Saturday morning, has lent even more weight to doubts about his ability to quickly fill his father's shoes.", "tags": ["Kim Jong-un", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "World news", "South Korea"], "title": "Kim Jong-un, 'great successor' poised to lead North Korea"},{"date": "2012-03-16T08:48:24Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea has announced a satellite launch barely two weeks after agreeing a deal with the US that Washington had greeted as a first step in resolving years of tension in the region.Relations deteriorated sharply after Pyongyang's last such launch in 2009, which prompted UN security council condemnation and tightened sanctions.

"north%20korea", "content": "North Korea's test-launch of two short-range missiles this week has raised anxiety levels in the region, as the regime in Pyongyang prepares to defy international opinion with the launch next month of a long-range rocket, which many believe is connected to its ballistic missile programme.South Korean defence officials said that North Korea had launched two surface-to-ship missiles from a site on its west coast early on Wednesday, a day after world leaders attending a nuclear security summit in Seoul urged the regime to cancel the rocket launch and return to six-party nuclear talks.North Korea insists that the forthcoming launch, which is expected around 15 April to coincide with the centenary of the birth of the country's founder Kim Il-sung, is designed to put an observation satellite into orbit.The US, South Korea and Japan, however, say it would be a violation of UN security council resolutions banning North Korea from missile activity, as the same technology could be developed for use in multistage missiles, including those capable of hitting the US mainland.If the launch goes ahead it will immediately kill off a deal, which was reached at the end of February, in which the US agreed to provide 240,000 tonnes of food aid provided that Pyongyang end its uranium enrichment programme and tests of long-range and nuclear missiles.The prospect of a fourth North Korean long-range missile launch since 1998 is causing disquiet across the region, partly due to concerns that it will veer off course and potentially dump debris on its neighbours' territory.On Friday Indonesia's foreign minister Marty Natalegawa urged North Korea to abandon the launch, saying it would \"undermine peace and stability in the region\".The Philippine president, Benigno Aquino, said he was concerned that debris may fall on his country's territory, calling the planed launch a \"needless provocation\".Japan is concerned that the rocket may fly over the southern island chain of Okinawa and has ordered its self-defence forces to intercept the rocket or its fragments if they pose a threat.In an unusual show of transparency, Pyongyang has told the international maritime organisation that the rocket will be launched between 7am and noon from 12-16 April. The first stage of the Unha-3 rocket will come down about 87 miles (140km) off the west coast of South Korea, while the second will fly over a chain near the main Okinawa island before falling into the sea east of the northern Philippines.Japan's defence minister, Naoki Tanaka, said the odds of the rocket striking Japan were low, but added: \"We want to be fully prepared for the possibility of rocket fragments falling on our territory.\"Japan will deploy ground-based Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptor missiles in its south-west and Okinawa, and send three Aegis-equipped destroyers carrying missile defence systems to the Japan Sea and East China Sea.Experts doubt Japan has the ability to shoot down the rocket in mid-flight; instead, the precautionary moves appear to be aimed at reassuring the public that Tokyo is taking North Korea's latest provocation seriously.The planned launch is causing particular alarm in Japan, which is already within striking distance of North Korea's medium-range Rodong missiles.In a report published on Friday, the national institute for defence studies in Tokyo warned that North Korea's progress on nuclear technology, coupled with recent regime change, had increased the risk of conflict breaking out in the region.Satellite images taken earlier this week show North Korea is making preparations for the missile launch from its Tongchang-ri site, located about 35 miles from the northern border with China.

with the launch next month of a long-range rocket, which many believe is connected to its ballistic missile programme.South Korean defence officials said that North Korea had launched two surface-to-ship missiles from a site on its west coast early on Wednesday, a day after world leaders attending a nuclear security summit in Seoul urged the regime to cancel the rocket launch and return to six-party nuclear talks.North Korea insists that the forthcoming launch, which is expected around 15 April to coincide with the centenary of the birth of the country's founder Kim Il-sung, is designed to put an observation satellite into orbit.The US, South Korea and Japan, however, say it would be a violation of UN security council resolutions banning North Korea from missile activity, as the same technology could be developed for use in multistage missiles, including those capable of hitting the US mainland.If the launch goes ahead it will immediately kill off a deal, which was reached at the end of February, in which the US agreed to provide 240,000 tonnes of food aid provided that Pyongyang end its uranium enrichment programme and tests of long-range and nuclear missiles.The prospect of a fourth North Korean long-range missile launch since 1998 is causing disquiet across the region, partly due to concerns that it will veer off course and potentially dump debris on its neighbours' territory.On Friday Indonesia's foreign minister Marty Natalegawa urged North Korea to abandon the launch, saying it would \"undermine peace and stability in the region\".The Philippine president, Benigno Aquino, said he was concerned that debris may fall on his country's territory, calling the planed launch a \"needless provocation\".Japan is concerned that the rocket may fly over the southern island chain of Okinawa and has ordered its self-defence forces to intercept the rocket or its fragments if they pose a threat.In an unusual show of transparency, Pyongyang has told the international maritime organisation that the rocket will be launched between 7am and noon from 12-16 April. The first stage of the Unha-3 rocket will come down about 87 miles (140km) off the west coast of South Korea, while the second will fly over a chain near the main Okinawa island before falling into the sea east of the northern Philippines.Japan's defence minister, Naoki Tanaka, said the odds of the rocket striking Japan were low, but added: \"We want to be fully prepared for the possibility of rocket fragments falling on our territory.\"Japan will deploy ground-based Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptor missiles in its south-west and Okinawa, and send three Aegis-equipped destroyers carrying missile defence systems to the Japan Sea and East China Sea.Experts doubt Japan has the ability to shoot down the rocket in mid-flight; instead, the precautionary moves appear to be aimed at reassuring the public that Tokyo is taking North Korea's latest provocation seriously.The planned launch is causing particular alarm in Japan, which is already within striking distance of North Korea's medium-range Rodong missiles.In a report published on Friday, the national institute for defence studies in Tokyo warned that North Korea's progress on nuclear technology, coupled with recent regime change, had increased the risk of conflict breaking out in the region.Satellite images taken earlier this week show North Korea is making preparations for the missile launch from its Tongchang-ri site, located about 35 miles from the northern border with China.

with the launch next month of a long-range rocket, which many believe is connected to its ballistic missile programme.South Korean defence officials said that North Korea had launched two surface-to-ship missiles from a site on its west coast early on Wednesday, a day after world leaders attending a nuclear security summit in Seoul urged the regime to cancel the rocket launch and return to six-party nuclear talks.North Korea insists that the forthcoming launch, which is expected around 15 April to coincide with the centenary of the birth of the country's founder Kim Il-sung, is designed to put an observation satellite into orbit.The US, South Korea and Japan, however, say it would be a violation of UN security council resolutions banning North Korea from missile activity, as the same technology could be developed for use in multistage missiles, including those capable of hitting the US mainland.If the launch goes ahead it will immediately kill off a deal, which was reached at the end of February, in which the US agreed to provide 240,000 tonnes of food aid provided that Pyongyang end its uranium enrichment programme and tests of long-range and nuclear missiles.The prospect of a fourth North Korean long-range missile launch since 1998 is causing disquiet across the region, partly due to concerns that it will veer off course and potentially dump debris on its neighbours' territory.On Friday Indonesia's foreign minister Marty Natalegawa urged North Korea to abandon the launch, saying it would \"undermine peace and stability in the region\".The Philippine president, Benigno Aquino, said he was concerned that debris may fall on his country's territory, calling the planed launch a \"needless provocation\".Japan is concerned that the rocket may fly over the southern island chain of Okinawa and has ordered its self-defence forces to intercept the rocket or its fragments if they pose a threat.In an unusual show of transparency, Pyongyang has told the international maritime organisation that the rocket will be launched between 7am and noon from 12-16 April. The first stage of the Unha-3 rocket will come down about 87 miles (140km) off the west coast of South Korea, while the second will fly over a chain near the main Okinawa island before falling into the sea east of the northern Philippines.Japan's defence minister, Naoki Tanaka, said the odds of the rocket striking Japan were low, but added: \"We want to be fully prepared for the possibility of rocket fragments falling on our territory.\"Japan will deploy ground-based Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptor missiles in its south-west and Okinawa, and send three Aegis-equipped destroyers carrying missile defence systems to the Japan Sea and East China Sea.Experts doubt Japan has the ability to shoot down the rocket in mid-flight; instead, the precautionary moves appear to be aimed at reassuring the public that Tokyo is taking North Korea's latest provocation seriously.The planned launch is causing particular alarm in Japan, which is already within striking distance of North Korea's medium-range Rodong missiles.In a report published on Friday, the national institute for defence studies in Tokyo warned that North Korea's progress on nuclear technology, coupled with recent regime change, had increased the risk of conflict breaking out in the region.Satellite images taken earlier this week show North Korea is making preparations for the missile launch from its Tongchang-ri site, located about 35 miles from the northern border with China.

"north%20korea", "content": "North Korea's test-launch of two short-range missiles this week has raised anxiety levels in the region, as the regime in Pyongyang prepares to defy international opinion with the launch next month of a long-range rocket, which many believe is connected to its ballistic missile programme.South Korean defence officials said that North Korea had launched two surface-to-ship missiles from a site on its west coast early on Wednesday, a day after world leaders attending a nuclear security summit in Seoul urged the regime to cancel the rocket launch and return to six-party nuclear talks.North Korea insists that the forthcoming launch, which is expected around 15 April to coincide with the centenary of the birth of the country's founder Kim Il-sung, is designed to put an observation satellite into orbit.The US, South Korea and Japan, however, say it would be a violation of UN security council resolutions banning North Korea from missile activity, as the same technology could be developed for use in multistage missiles, including those capable of hitting the US mainland.If the launch goes ahead it will immediately kill off a deal, which was reached at the end of February, in which the US agreed to provide 240,000 tonnes of food aid provided that Pyongyang end its uranium enrichment programme and tests of long-range and nuclear missiles.The prospect of a fourth North Korean long-range missile launch since 1998 is causing disquiet across the region, partly due to concerns that it will veer off course and potentially dump debris on its neighbours' territory.On Friday Indonesia's foreign minister Marty Natalegawa urged North Korea to abandon the launch, saying it would \"undermine peace and stability in the region\".The Philippine president, Benigno Aquino, said he was concerned that debris may fall on his country's territory, calling the planed launch a \"needless provocation\".Japan is concerned that the rocket may fly over the southern island chain of Okinawa and has ordered its self-defence forces to intercept the rocket or its fragments if they pose a threat.In an unusual show of transparency, Pyongyang has told the international maritime organisation that the rocket will be launched between 7am and noon from 12-16 April. The first stage of the Unha-3 rocket will come down about 87 miles (140km) off the west coast of South Korea, while the second will fly over a chain near the main Okinawa island before falling into the sea east of the northern Philippines.Japan's defence minister, Naoki Tanaka, said the odds of the rocket striking Japan were low, but added: \"We want to be fully prepared for the possibility of rocket fragments falling on our territory.\"Japan will deploy ground-based Patriot Advanced Capability-3 interceptor missiles in its south-west and Okinawa, and send three Aegis-equipped destroyers carrying missile defence systems to the Japan Sea and East China Sea.Experts doubt Japan has the ability to shoot down the rocket in mid-flight; instead, the precautionary moves appear to be aimed at reassuring the public that Tokyo is taking North Korea's latest provocation seriously.The planned launch is causing particular alarm in Japan, which is already within striking distance of North Korea's medium-range Rodong missiles.In a report published on Friday, the national institute for defence studies in Tokyo warned that North Korea's progress on nuclear technology, coupled with recent regime change, had increased the risk of conflict breaking out in the region.Satellite images taken earlier this week show North Korea is making preparations for the missile launch from its Tongchang-ri site, located about 35 miles from the northern border with China. Expert analysis showed trucks and fuel tanks outside two large buildings used to store propellant for the rocket, although the rocket itself was not visible.", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "Philippines", "China", "Nuclear weapons", "Satellites", "Space"], "title": "North Korea missile launches raise tensions"},{"date": "2012-03-25T13:26:35Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Barack Obama has urged North Korea to cancel a rocket launch planned for next month, warning the regime that it had nothing to gain from \"threats or provocations\".Speaking on the eve of an international summit on nuclear security in Seoul, the South Korean capital, Obama said the expected launch of a long-range rocket to coincide with the centenary of the birth of North Korea's founder, Kim Il-sung, in mid-April, would deepen the country's international isolation.\"Bad behaviour will not be rewarded,\" Obama said after meeting the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak. \"There had been a pattern, I think, for decades, in which North Korea thought if they had acted provocatively, then somehow they would be bribed into ceasing and desisting acting provocatively.\"The US and its allies say the missile launch would be a violation of a UN ban on nuclear and missile activity; it could also derail a deal, reached last month, in which the North would halt missile tests and its uranium enrichment programme in return for US food aid.Obama called on China to use its influence as North Korea's only ally and biggest aid donor to persuade the regime to return to six-party nuclear talks, stalled since the North walked out in 2009 and conducted its second nuclear weapons test.\"What I've said to [China] consistently is rewarding bad behaviour, turning a blind eye to deliberate provocations, trying to paper over these not just provocative words but extraordinarily provocative acts that violate international norms, that that's not obviously working,\" he said.During a visit on Sunday morning to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, Obama told US troops they stood between a free and prosperous South Korea and repression in the North. \"I could not be prouder of what you do,\" he said. The same was true of US military bases worldwide, he added, \"but there's something about this spot in particular.\"You guys are at freedom's frontier. The contrast between South Korea and North Korea could not be clearer, could not be starker, both in terms of freedom and in terms of prosperity.\"He later said of the DMZ: \"It's like you're in a time warp. It's like you're looking across 50 years into a country that has missed 40 years or 50 years of progress.\"Obama's visit to the 2.5-mile-wide stretch of land that has separated the two countries since the end of the Korean war in 1953 came as North Koreans ended their 100-day official mourning period for Kim Jong-il, who died of a heart attack in December.Over the past three months the regime has sought to strengthen the position of Kim's youngest son and successor, Kim Jong-un, culminating in a rocket launch next month as part of events to mark Kim Il-sung's centenary on 15 April.Kim Jong-un visited Panmunjom, the so-called peace village that lies inside the DMZ, last month and has made several high-profile inspections of military units around North Korea.Next month the country's supreme people's assembly and ruling Workers' party are expected to give Kim Jong-un the titles of chairman of the defence commission and secretary general of the party in an attempt to consolidate his grip on power.Obama, China's Hu Jintao and dozens of other world leaders will meet in Seoul on Monday to discuss ways to prevent nuclear terrorism. Iran and North Korea are not on the official agenda but are expected to dominate bilateral discussions on the sideline of the two-day summit.North Korea says it has the right to launch what it describes as an observation satellite, and accused the international community of hypocrisy. \"If there are any sinister attempts to deprive the [North] of its independent and legitimate right and impose unreasonable double standards, this will inevitably compel us to take countermeasures,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement.Media reports quoted unnamed US and South Korean military sources as saying the rocket had been taken to a site in North Korea's north-west region in preparation for the launch. The foreign ministry in Pyongyang said preparations to put an observation satellite into orbit had entered a \"fully fledged stage of action\".The US, Japan and other countries say the launch would violate a UN ban on nuclear and missile activity because the same technology could be developed to deliver a nuclear warhead on a long-range missile.Australia and the Philippines have voiced concern about the three-stage rocket's trajectory, while Japan has threatened to shoot it down if it threatens its territory. Even China, the North's main benefactor, has urged its ally to \"stay calm, exercise restraint and avoid escalation\".", "tags": ["Barack Obama", "North Korea", "South Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "US news", "US national security", "Kim Jong-un", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Barack Obama urges North Korea to cancel rocket launch"},{"date": "2012-03-16T11:17:05Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea has announced its first satellite launch in three years, throwing into doubt a recent deal with the US that had aimed to end years of tension.The US state department said the trial was \"highly provocative\" and would breach North Korea's international obligations.

It was being negotiated at the time of Kim Jong-il's death in December.The ailing Dear Leader wanted the agreement because he had promised his malnourished country that 2012 would mark the dawn of a new era of prosperity. Given the parlous state of the country, it was an absurd promise but the regime's priority was to put at least some food in the markets, to ensure the irony is not overwhelmingly painful. The sealing of the deal, after just one meeting between US and North Korean officials last week in China, confirms that the regime is looking for continuity and stability while the heir, Kim Jong-un, takes over the reins. There had been concerns that Pyongyang might launch more military operations against South Korean, like the shelling of a South Korean island in late 2010, to burnish the dauphin's credentials as a martial figure. But clearly, the regime felt that his credentials as a provider for his 25 million people was more important.This is what Stephen Bosworth, the US special envoy on North Korea until last year, told the Washington Post:This is what we had been trying to do for the last year. It's a sign that the North Koreans want to have continuity. ... It's important to keep in mind that this is not one individual acting and that they've done this for their own reasons. First, they need the food aid, and I think they probably want a relatively quiet political environment to carry on the transition.The Obama administration must be mightily relieved. The president who had promised multilateral diplomacy and a light touch, did not need two nuclear crises on his hands in an election year. This deal allows his foreign staff to focus on Iran. It also demonstrates to the international community a readiness to strike bargains when opportunities present themselves.However, there is no particular reason to believe there are any lessons here for Tehran. Iranian officials are generally horrified by any comparison with a basket case like Hermit Kingdom, although Tehran is not above buying North Korean missile technology. Iran pursuit of the full nuclear fuel cycle is rooted in its image of itself as a great world civilisation assuming its rightful role as a regional power. In 2008, Iran was offered a far more substantial packet of incentives to give up enrichment, and turned it down.Furthermore, the Iranian regime is not monolithic. As Friday's Majlis elections will illustrate, there are different groups within the establishment struggling for dominance or survival.

The worst-case scenario is an unstable North Korea. But if China can't achieve that ideal, then it will at least try to avoid the worst possible alternative. That means it will tolerate a North Korea with nuclear weapons, as long as it remains stable.\"The planned launch has put on hold a deal reached last month that would have required North Korea to suspend long-range missile tests and its uranium enrichment programme in return for 240,000 tonnes of US food aid.In a speech to students at Hankuk University in Seoul, Obama warned North Korea's new leadership under Kim Jong-un not to invite \"more isolation\" by developing nuclear weapons.\"By now it should be clear,\" he said. \"Your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek, they have undermined it. Instead of the dignity you desire, you are more isolated.\"His comments may also have been directed at Republicans who are seeking to exploit what they see as Obama's failure of diplomacy on North Korea in an election year.\"The United States doesn't want to do anything that will result in North Korea conducting nuclear tests or missile launches or anything that would be detrimental to the Obama administration,\" said Kim Hyun Wook, a professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul.\"If that happens, there could be criticism from Republicans of Obama that his diplomatic efforts with North Korea have failed.

The next time Pyongyang makes a grand gesture, it may feel more constrained.But that could be overly optimistic. The pessimistic reading is that the hardliners won their way only weeks after completing an agreement with Washington to receive food aid in return for Pyongyang's agreement to suspend uranium enrichment and stop test launchings of long-range missiles. The poverty of their people, who regularly suffer famines, means nothing to them and they are prepared to sacrifice food aid and the possibility of detente, for the doomed attempt to build a missile that can reach the Alaskan coast. Prestige means all.The truth may lie somewhere between the two extremes. As a former state department official has written, it is easily forgotten that the US has done quite well out of its negotiations with Pyongyang. The North so neglected its nuclear programme after the 1994 framework agreement was signed, that when it fell apart, it only had a fraction of the fissile material it should have had.

This must have come from Kim Jong-un himself, newly graced with the title of chairman of the national defence commission. On this reading, the decision to launch the rocket was not his, but his father's. Furthermore, the new leader has been fashioned to look like a chip off the old block, not so much his father's son, but the spitting image of his grandfather, the centenary of whose birth will be celebrated with great fanfare this weekend. Even if he had wanted to, he could not have stopped a project into which so much money \u2013 an estimated $850m \u2013 had been ploughed. The public admission may not be good news for those deemed responsible for the rocket failure \u2013 the party official blamed for the doomed currency revaluation was executed \u2013 but it may mean there is a livelier debate going on about the merits of this project than anyone had imagined. The next time Pyongyang makes a grand gesture, it may feel more constrained.But that could be overly optimistic. The pessimistic reading is that the hardliners won their way only weeks after completing an agreement with Washington to receive food aid in return for Pyongyang's agreement to suspend uranium enrichment and stop test launchings of long-range missiles. The poverty of their people, who regularly suffer famines, means nothing to them and they are prepared to sacrifice food aid and the possibility of detente, for the doomed attempt to build a missile that can reach the Alaskan coast. Prestige means all.The truth may lie somewhere between the two extremes. As a former state department official has written, it is easily forgotten that the US has done quite well out of its negotiations with Pyongyang. The North so neglected its nuclear programme after the 1994 framework agreement was signed, that when it fell apart, it only had a fraction of the fissile material it should have had. This is a long game and it needs patience.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-il", "Kim Jong-un", "Nuclear weapons", "South Korea"], "title": "North Korea: damp squib | Editorial"},{"date": "2012-06-29T14:49:19Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is claiming a propaganda victory after a woman who claimed she had been tricked into defecting to South Korea returned home after growing disillusioned with her \"miserable\" life in the capitalist south.Speaking at the People's Palace of Culture in Pyongyang on Thursday, Pak Jong-suk apologised for defecting in 2006, apparently so that she could be reunited with her father in the Chinese city of Qingdao.\"I am an ingrate who had betrayed my motherland to seek better living while others devoted themselves to building a thriving nation, tightening their belts,\" Pak, wearing a pink traditional dress, told reporters in Pyongyang.The 66-year-old claimed that South Korean intelligence agents had later tricked her into boarding a boat to their country.South Korea's unification ministry said Pak had lived in eastern Seoul under the name Park In-sook, but would not provide further details. Park Sang-hak, a North Korean defector, said he and Pak had lived in the same apartment complex in Seoul. He said she had been an \"ordinary woman\" who had never discussed politics with him.Media reports said Pak had flown back to North Korea, via China, on 25 May this year.It was not clear if Pak had volunteered to speak publicly or under pressure from the North Korean authorities. Her public appearance may have been designed to counter claims that returning defectors, most of whom are forcibly repatriated from China, face harsh punishments.Earlier this week, South Korean media reported that four defectors repatriated to North Korea by China had been publicly executed.In her comments, some of which were later broadcast on state television, Pak repeatedly thanked North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un.\"When I deplaned [in Pyongyang], quieting my thumping heart, I was stunned by the cordial reception,\" she said in a translation provided by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. \"I felt at that time how affectionate and great the motherland is to me.\"The dear respected Kim Jong-un did not blame me, who did so many wrongs in the past, but brought me under his warm care. He showed profound loving care for me.\"Pak said she had crossed the Tumen river into China in March 2006, hoping to meet her father, who had stayed in the south after the peninsula was divided by the demilitarised zone at the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. Her father, who was unconscious following brain surgery, was unable to speak to her before he died two months after her arrival.The details of Pak's recent defection are hazy. She said she had decided to return after becoming disillusioned with life in South Korea, where, she claimed, defectors are paid to slander North Korea. She now lives in Pyongyang with her son, a teacher, and his wife.Defections from South Korea to North Korea are extremely rare. Park Soo-jin, a spokesman for the unification ministry, said the only other known case involved a defector known as Yoo, who entered South Korea in 1998 and returned to Pyongyang in 2000, before defecting for the second time a year later.While most defectors say they are happy in South Korea, they face discrimination, lower salaries and higher rates of unemployment.At around 12%, unemployment among North Korean defectors is far higher than the 3.4% rate among South Koreans.Those in work earn significantly less than their southern counterparts, despite government subsidies and three months of mandatory resettlement training, according to the government-affiliated North Korean Refugees Foundation.But a recent unification ministry survey showed that seven out of 10 adult defectors said they were satisfied with life in the south; only 4.8% said they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied.About half of those questioned left North Korea due to food shortages, while 31% said they came south in search of freedom. Just over a quarter fled because of North Korea's political system.More than 23,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since the Korean war ended in a truce almost 60 years ago.

In their report, Pabian and Hecker, use satellite imagery of tunneling to try to pinpoint the location of the 2006 and 2009 North Korean tests, and point to evidence first published by the 38 North website in April of a third major tunnel in the same Punggye-ri area, which the authors assess is now ready for use. It apparently has been under construction since 2009 and significant activity was reported at the tunnel site after the failed April space launch. Technically, North Korea could be ready to test within two weeks.Pabian and Hecker think that any new North Korean test could involve both plutonium and highly-enriched uranium devices, speculating that Pyongyang will emulate the Pakistani experience and that it might have acquired blueprints for making small HEU warheads from the AQ Khan nuclear smuggling network, as suggested by the UN panel of experts.However, the authors do not believe the regime has made up its mind to test, and argue that there is still time for the international community to weigh in on Pyongyang's cost-benefit analysis:North Korea has strong technical and military drivers to conduct additional nuclear tests, and it is capable of doing so within as little as two weeks. It appears that Kim Jong-un's regime is now weighing the political costs it would have to bear should it decide to test...[I]t is imperative for Washington, Beijing, and their partners in the six-party talks to join forces to increase the costs on North Korea of continued testing. An additional nuclear test or two would greatly increase the likelihood that Pyongyang could fashion warheads to fit at least some of its missiles -- a circumstance that would vastly increase the threat its nuclear program poses to the security of northeast Asia.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Nuclear weapons"], "title": "North Korea capable of new nuclear test 'within two weeks'"},{"date": "2012-08-04T11:23:25Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Almost 170 people have died in recent severe floods in North Korea, with a further 400 missing and more than 84,000 made homeless across the country, according to the state media.The official Korean Central News Agency said floods and a typhoon also displaced about 212,200 people and submerged more than 65,000 hectares (160,000 acres) of farmland between late June and the end of July.The flooding occurred after a severe drought and renewed concerns about North Korea's ability to feed its people. In June, the UN said two-thirds of the country's 24 million people were facing chronic food shortages.The UN World Food Programme announced on Friday the details of its first batch of emergency food aid to the country, although it did not state when it would arrive.The WFP said the emergency aid will provide the flood victims \"with an initial ration of 400g of maize per day for 14 days\".According to reports from the UN and Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency, the flooding has destroyed more than 45,000 hectares of farmland.A UN mission recently found considerable damage to maize, soybean and rice fields, the WFP said.A recent UN report classified 7.2 million of the population as \"chronic poor\", and said one in three children suffered from poor nutrition.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "United Nations", "Food security", "Global development", "Aid"], "title": "North Korea floods leave 170 dead and 84,000 homeless"},{"date": "2012-07-19T08:00:01Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Earlier this month a shocking scene played out at Panmunjom in the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.Ro Su-hui, the South Korean vice-chairman of the Reunification of the Fatherland Union, was returning from North Korea where he had paid his respects at ceremonies to mark the 100th day since the death of leader Kim Jong-Il. Before re-crossing the border to the South, he declared \"Hurrah for the unification of the two Koreas!\" to a cheering crowd and was presented with flowers by his hosts.But as the grinning 69-year-old crossed the border, he received very different treatment by the South Korean border security. The watching North Koreans howled in horror as Ro Su-hui was thrown to the ground and carried off in a headlock.The arrest made a very small splash in the western media, which comes as little surprise because a story with a warm North and a cold South is doesn't square easily with the message that has been delivered by media outlets in Europe and the US for the last two decades.Reunification and conciliation are usually portrayed as South Korean concepts, while North Korea is seen as a closed state, hostile to such talk on \"idealistic grounds\" \u2013 a view perpetuated by media outlets' lack of interest in all recent North Korean initiatives. In fact it is almost impossible to find any piece of positive European journalism relating to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The days of cold war pantomime journalism and great ideological battles might be over, but North Korea remains an area in which journalists have free licence for sensationalism and partiality.The lack of western sources in North Korea has allowed the media to conjure up fantastic stories that enthrall readers but aren't grounded in hard fact. No attempt is made to see both sides of the Korean conflict: it is much easier and more palatable to a western audience to pigeonhole the DPRK as a dangerous maverick state ruled by a capricious dictator and South Korea as its long-suffering, patient neighbour.These roles are dusted off whenever there are flare-ups, such as the Yeonpyeong Island incident of 2010 when North Korea was condemned for firing shots at South Korean military and civilians in an \"unprovoked attack\". It was not widely reported that South Korea had been test firing artillery in a patch of ocean that North Korea claims ownership of or that North Korea's repeated demands for an explanation were ignored. While military intervention may not have been wise, it was far from the random act of hostility it was made out to be.When the South Korean navy ship, the Cheonan, sank on March 26, 2010, the South Koreans accused their neighbours of having fired a torpedo. A detailed rebuttal by North Korea's military was disregarded by the wider world, as was the offer to aid an open investigation.One of the South Korean investigators, Shin Sang-cheol, sacrificed his career to express his belief that the Cheonan had run aground in a tragic accident and with reports of evidence tampering circulating, even the South Korean public wasn't widely convinced of North Korean involvement: a survey conducted in Seoul found less than 33% blamed the DPRK. Nonetheless North Korean guilt was stated as fact in the British press.Since the bloody coup of 1979, South Korea seems to have had journalistic carte blanche as the \"lesser of two evils\". While North Korean actions are condemned and derided, very few column inches are devoted to scrutiny of South Korea's president Lee Myung-bak and his oppressive policies.The National Security Act, of which Ro So-hui fell foul, gives the South Korean government the right to prosecute anyone speaking in favour of North Korea or communism in general. There are frequent reports of detention without trial, human rights abuses and clampdowns on freedom of speech. Both Koreas are quite justifiably scared of the other but when South Korea flexes its military muscles, the North is expected to watch passively with any attempt to do the same reported as an act of despicable brinkmanship.Whatever your view on the actions of North and South Korea's governments, the hypocrisy of using one-sided journalism to label North Korea a rogue, propaganda-led state is surely self-evident and fans the fire of intolerance and animosity. The Korean divide is a complex, multi-faceted political situation. Nobody benefits from turning it into a moral melodrama and we should demand more from our supposedly impartial media.\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Media"], "title": "South Korea good, North Korea bad?

The rocket launch was outrageous. The international community needs to impose harsh sanctions,\" Abe said.Abe, a former prime minister who is tipped to unseat the ruling Democratic party government in this weekend's closely-fought parliamentary election, could be a big beneficiary of North Korea's action, said Christopher Hughes, a regional expert and professor of international politics at Warwick University.\"The North has played directly into the hands of Japan's conservative rightwing and nationalist forces,\" Hughes said. \"This is very much an 'I told you so' situation for Abe.

The North has denounced Park as a \"fascist\".Park's spokesman described the launch as a \"serious provocation\" before attacking her main rival, Moon Jae-in, who has advocated unconditional talks with the North. Park would pursue \"strong national security\", the spokesman said. He accused Moon of being \"ignorant of the reason why the international community is concerned and against North Korea's long-range rocket launching test\".US missile warning systems detected the rocket on Wednesday after it lifted off from a site on North Korea's west coast, said officials at the North American Aerospace Defence Command (Norad), adding that the rocket deployed an object that appeared to achieve orbit around Earth.Norad said the three-stage Unha rocket had taken its expected southerly course, with its first stage falling into the Yellow Sea west of South Korea and the second landing in the sea east of the Philippines.\"Initial indications are that the missile deployed an object that appeared to achieve orbit,\" Norad said. \"At no time was the missile or the resultant debris a threat to North America.\"South Korea and Japan said they were unable to immediately confirm Norad's report.In a triumphalist TV announcement accompanied by stirring string music and images of a snow-covered landscape, North Korea's state media said the country had successfully launched a rocket carrying a satellite.The launch from the Tongchang-ri site in North Pyongan province at 9.49am local time took the world by surprise. Speculation had mounted that it would be delayed by at least several days while North Korean engineers fixed what had been described as a technical deficiency in the rocket's first-stage control engine module.North Korea had said it was extending the original 13-day launch window by a week until 29 December. On Tuesday, satellite images suggested that the rocket had been emptied of fuel and removed from its launchpad.Wednesday's apparent success has raised the stakes in international efforts to pressure Pyongyang into abandoning its ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.It follows four previous unsuccessful attempts to put satellites into space using long-range rockets. The most recent attempt came on 13 April \u2013 two days before the centennial of the birth of the country's founder and Kim Jong-un's grandfather, Kim Il-sung \u2013 when another three-stage rocket disintegrated less than two minutes after liftoff. In an unusual show of candour, the regime quickly admitted the launch had been a failure.If reports about the success of this latest launch are correct, the regime can reasonably claim to have significantly improved its technological knowhow.The North has frequently dismissed accusations that it uses rocket launches as a cover to test its ballistic missile technology, which, if perfected, could give the regime a projectile capable of reaching the US mainland. North Korea insists the rocket launch was intended to send an Earth observation satellite into orbit.North Korea is believed to have weaponised enough plutonium for about half a dozen rudimentary nuclear weapons, although experts say it has yet to develop a warhead small enough to mount on a missile.Daniel Pinkston, deputy project director of the north-east Asia programme at the International Crisis Group, said the earlier-than-expected launch suggested there had either been a misperception along the way or a deliberate operation to mislead observers.But Pinkston said no one should be surprised by the North's decision to fire another rocket. \"It would be absolutely illogical for them not to do it,\" he said.\"They have invested tremendous amounts of resources in this over decades. They want to possess the capabilities: this is dual-use technology with both military and peaceful applications.

The UN security council imposed tough sanctions after the North conducted nuclear weapons tests in 2006 and 2009.China, the regime's only major diplomatic ally and chief benefactor, voiced \"deep concern\" but is expected to oppose further sanctions.

Japan on Wednesday requested an emergency meeting of the UN body to discuss its response.Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, said: \"I strongly condemn the satellite launch today.\" The UK government would summon the North Korean ambassador in London, he said. \"This provocative act will increase tensions in the region. I deplore the fact that [North Korea] has chosen to prioritise this launch over improving the livelihoods of its people.\"It is essential that [North Korea] refrain from further provocative action and take constructive steps towards denuclearisation and lasting peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.\"Japan had positioned missile defence systems on the southern island of Okinawa but reported that no debris had fallen on to its territory.South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, convened an emergency security meeting. The country had positioned three Aegis warships equipped with SPY-1 radar off its western and southern coasts to track the rocket's path.Ban Ki-moon deplored the launch, said the office of the UN secretary general.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "South Korea", "Space", "Science", "Kim Jong-un", "United Nations"], "title": "North Korea rocket launch prompts international condemnation"},{"date": "2012-11-30T22:02:23Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Normally, North Korea's official state news agency is the place to go for reports ranging from the reclusive totalitarian state's unparalleled scientific achievements to the limitless love which its inhabitants reserve for their successive leaders.Yet in what appears to be a genuine world exclusive, the inimitable Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) has now broken the incredible news that archaeologists in Pyongyang have discovered a unicorn's lair.Or rather, the report says that they have \"recently reconfirmed\" the lair of one of the unicorns ridden by the ancient Korean King Tongmyong, founder of a kingdom which ruled parts of China and the Korean peninsula from the the 3rd century BC to 7th century AD.The KCNA goes on to state that the location happens to be 200 metres from a temple in the North Korean capital, adding: \"A rectangular rock carved with words \"Unicorn Lair\" stands in front of the lair.\"\"The carved words are believed to date back to the period of Koryo Kingdom (918-1392),\" says the report.Archaeologists from the Academy of Social Sciences at North Korea's History Institute were credited with making the discovery.The news story comes days after eyebrows were raised by another news story relating to the state officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).On that occasion, it was the online version of China's Communist party newspaper which hailed a report by The Onion naming North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un as the sexiest man alive \u2013 not realising it was satire.", "tags": ["North Korea", "World news"], "title": "Unicorn lair 'discovered' in North Korea"},{"date": "2013-03-12T20:14:31Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "In the past two days alone North Korea has torn up an armistice it made with Seoul in 1953, Barack Obama's security adviser has warned Pyongyang that were it to carry out a nuclear attack, it would face \"the full range of our capabilities\", and China has announced it is going to send a team to survey a group of uninhabited islands which Japan claims as its own.

Even though they returned unscathed, it appears to have escaped the notice of the BBC that they have probably caused even longer-lasting damage. Many academic disciplines, including anthropology and archaeology, with which we are all concerned, undertake academic research not only in North Korea, but in other countries that are not favourably inclined to academic research. Now they will have a reason to reject research projects altogether. So future knowledge may well have been jeopardised as the result of the scandalous behaviour of a few and for what \u2013 a film that shows nothing more than the normal tourist's view of North Korea?Emeritus professor Roy Ellen University of Kent, immediate past President, Royal Anthropological Institute Professor Clive Gamble Southampton University, president, the Royal Anthropological InstituteProfessor Mark Harris Head of the anthropology department, St Andrews University Dr. David Shankland, Director, the Royal Anthropological InstituteEmeritus professor Jean La Fontaine LSE, past President Royal Anthropological Institute\u2022 When intelligence agencies use journalists as cover to gather information on hard-to-penetrate regimes, they are rightly condemned \u2013 not least by journalists \u2013 for threatening the safety of those working in the profession. So regardless of the quality or otherwise of the information gathered in North Korea by Panorama, for journalists to use academic cover is profoundly hypocritical.

On a day with a coffin on a gun carriage, Big Ben silenced and other general dottiness, LSE's relationship with North Korea should be taken calmly.

The editor of a Japanese magazine said a North Korean contact had told him of a mass execution in late August, possibly involving celebrities, but suggested that it could be related to other issues.Ri Sol-ju was a singer with the Unhasu Orchestra before marrying the North Korean leader. Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper claimed at the weekend that members of that group and the Wangjaesan Art Troupe were executed because they were suspected of making a pornographic video and that Kim feared his wife's reputation might be damaged.A similar story, published by South Korea's Chosun Ilbo a few weeks ago, did not mention Ri but claimed that a singer, Hyon Song-wol, rumoured to be Kim's ex-lover, was among a dozen performers executed for violating pornography laws.Pyongyang's state news agency KCNA criticised media in the South for quoting the Asahi Shimbun story \u2013 without giving any details of the reports \u2013 saying it was an attempt to tarnish the leadership's image. It blamed \"confrontation maniacs\" for \"[making their] servants of conservative media let loose a whole string of sophism intended to hatch all sorts of dastardly wicked plots and float misinformation\".John Delury, an expert on North Korea at Yonsei University in Seoul, noted numerous eye-catching stories in South Korean and Japanese media about the regime and particularly Kim that relied on an anonymous, single source, often from intelligence services.\"This stuff gets planted regularly in media outlets and then quickly goes viral,\" he said. \"There's a global appetite for any North Korea story and the more salacious the better. Some of it is probably true \u2013 but a great deal of it is probably not.\"The normal standards of journalism are thrown out of the window because the attitude is: 'It's North Korea \u2013 no one knows what's going on in there.'\"The Asahi Shimbun report said it was based on information from a high-ranking defector, although it did not appear that the individual had spoken directly to the newspaper.Leonid Petrov, a North Korea specialist at the Australian National University, said he had not heard of any high-level defections since 1997 and that while there was now much more information on the lives of ordinary North Koreans, through defectors and people working abroad, there was very little knowledge about the elite.He added: \"Whether this [particular event] happened in August, or earlier, or it never happened\u00a0\u2026 is it likely that such an ugly thing may happen in North Korea? Everyone would say yes. There are simply no checks on the totalitarian power of the leader,\" he said.Jiro Ishimaru, editor of Asia Press \u2013 a magazine based in Osaka, Japan, which has a network of informants in the North \u2013 said: \"One of our contacts in North Korea has confirmed that a mass execution took place on 20 August, but we've also heard about several sightings since then of Hyon Song-wol [Kim Jong-un's ex-girlfriend].\"Ishimaru, identifying his source only as a male who had made contact with the North Korean public security officials, said the regime might be using a crackdown on \"obscene materials\" launched by Kim in early June as a pretext for neutralising potential threats to his authority.The possible cause of Kim's rumoured execution order is an unflattering 2010 documentary about him produced by the South Korean broadcaster KBS which has been copied and smuggled into North Korea from China. Ishimaru's source said he had watched the documentary in North Korea.Kim may have ordered the confiscation of copies of the video under the guise of a crackdown on pornography, Ishimaru said. \"If the documentary becomes widely available in North Korea it could cause huge problems for the regime,\" he said.While Chosun Ilbo said those executed were well-known figures, the identities of most of those involved remain a mystery.Ishimaru said his contact had been able to confirm the identities of only two people, believed to be celebrities, adding that neither was Hyon. \"There is still a lot we don't know, such as why North Korean celebrities might have been targeted for political reasons,\" Ishimaru said. \"But as far as we can tell this doesn't look like a straightforward campaign against pornography.\"The Asahi Shimbun claimed that, according to the defector, North Korean security services had wiretapped conversations among the performers and overhead one saying that Ri had \"played around\" before she met Kim.A website carrying footage of Unhasu Orchestra performances has been closed down and both groups have been disbanded, according to media reports in Japan and South Korea. \"That suggests that something involving performers really has happened,\" Ishimaru said.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "South Korea", "Communism"], "title": "North Korea criticises 'reptile media' for saying Kim Jong-un ordered executions"},{"date": "2013-12-10T20:44:31Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "It is no good pretending that we know much about what is going on in North Korea, because we don't.

But many had thought his marriage to the youthful leader's aunt \u2013 the sister of late leader Kim Jong-il \u2013 was likely to save his life.In Pyongyang, people crowded around subway station billboards displaying the morning paper and news of the execution, Associated Press reported. Others sat quietly and listened as a radio broadcast broadcast into the subway listed Jang's crimes.The lengthy, bombastic and at times downright bizarre report from KCNA quoted an alleged admission by Jang that he sought to destabilise the country, triggering discontent among the military and others. He planned to become premier if North Korea approached collapse and use illicitly acquired wealth to ensure that \"the people and service personnel will shout 'hurrah' for me\" and his coup would succeed smoothly\".It also claimed he pursued a \"decadent capitalist lifestyle\" \u2013 squandering at least \u20ac4.6m in 2009 alone, including in a foreign casino \u2013 and deliberately hampered construction projects in Pyongyang.He sold off natural resources \"at random\" and committed treachery by selling off land at the Rason special economic zone for five decades, it added, apparently in reference to a deal with Russia.\"They are using this opportunity to scapegoat Uncle Jang by relegating responsibility for all policy failures,\" said Leonid Petrov of the Australian National University.Other offences cited include halfhearted applause as Kim rose to power and Jang's \"reckless\" instruction to security forces to erect a granite block with Kim's signature in a shaded corner rather than in front of their headquarters.Brian Myers, an expert on ideology at Dongseo University in Busan, noted that the denigration of Jang held potential perils for the leadership. It raised questions about his ability to cause so much damage for so long and sat uneasily with North Korea's use of collective punishment.\"This is a member of the clan in a culture where the regime tends to punish entire families for crimes committed by one of them. So it seems odd to be so explicit about [his] crimes,\" Myers said.KCNA said Jang had long held a \"dirty political ambition\" but dared not act while Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il were alive.\"He began revealing his true colours, thinking that it was just the time for him to realise his wild ambition in the period of historic turn when the generation of the revolution was replaced,\" it added.That was when Jang \u2013 who had been purged twice before \u2013 returned to the forefront of North Korean politics. Kim Jong-il appeared to have selected him as a mentor figure who could help smooth Kim Jong-un's path to power.Adam Cathcart, an expert on North Korea, said accusations of factionalism and seeking power were \"pro forma\" in such cases, but he noted how specific the charges were and added: \"There certainly were discussions about the direction North Korea would take [when Kim Jong-il died]. It would be natural for Jang to want to be part of a collective leadership system.\"But North Korea is not moving towards a collective system: it's all about the one leader\u00a0\u2026 It's the divine right of Kims.\"Myers added: \"The most surprising and unprecedented thing is not that someone was planning to overthrow the state\u00a0\u2026 but the implication that he had a substantial number of followers.

But many had thought his marriage to the youthful leader's aunt \u2013 the sister of late leader Kim Jong-il \u2013 was likely to save his life.In Pyongyang, people crowded around subway station billboards displaying the morning paper and news of the execution, Associated Press reported. Others sat quietly and listened as a radio broadcast broadcast into the subway listed Jang's crimes.The lengthy, bombastic and at times downright bizarre report from KCNA quoted an alleged admission by Jang that he sought to destabilise the country, triggering discontent among the military and others. He planned to become premier if North Korea approached collapse and use illicitly acquired wealth to ensure that \"the people and service personnel will shout 'hurrah' for me\" and his coup would succeed smoothly\".It also claimed he pursued a \"decadent capitalist lifestyle\" \u2013 squandering at least \u20ac4.6m in 2009 alone, including in a foreign casino \u2013 and deliberately hampered construction projects in Pyongyang.He sold off natural resources \"at random\" and committed treachery by selling off land at the Rason special economic zone for five decades, it added, apparently in reference to a deal with Russia.\"They are using this opportunity to scapegoat Uncle Jang by relegating responsibility for all policy failures,\" said Leonid Petrov of the Australian National University.Other offences cited include halfhearted applause as Kim rose to power and Jang's \"reckless\" instruction to security forces to erect a granite block with Kim's signature in a shaded corner rather than in front of their headquarters.Brian Myers, an expert on ideology at Dongseo University in Busan, noted that the denigration of Jang held potential perils for the leadership. It raised questions about his ability to cause so much damage for so long and sat uneasily with North Korea's use of collective punishment.\"This is a member of the clan in a culture where the regime tends to punish entire families for crimes committed by one of them. So it seems odd to be so explicit about [his] crimes,\" Myers said.KCNA said Jang had long held a \"dirty political ambition\" but dared not act while Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il were alive.\"He began revealing his true colours, thinking that it was just the time for him to realise his wild ambition in the period of historic turn when the generation of the revolution was replaced,\" it added.That was when Jang \u2013 who had been purged twice before \u2013 returned to the forefront of North Korean politics. Kim Jong-il appeared to have selected him as a mentor figure who could help smooth Kim Jong-un's path to power.Adam Cathcart, an expert on North Korea, said accusations of factionalism and seeking power were \"pro forma\" in such cases, but he noted how specific the charges were and added: \"There certainly were discussions about the direction North Korea would take [when Kim Jong-il died]. It would be natural for Jang to want to be part of a collective leadership system.\"But North Korea is not moving towards a collective system: it's all about the one leader\u00a0\u2026 It's the divine right of Kims.\"Myers added: \"The most surprising and unprecedented thing is not that someone was planning to overthrow the state\u00a0\u2026 but the implication that he had a substantial number of followers. That's the first ever official admission of significant disunity in the North Korean state itself.\"Kim has made sweeping changes to the hierarchy in North Korea, changing key military personnel repeatedly as well as removing civilian members, but family members are normally dealt with more leniently and quietly. It is unclear how the position of Jang's wife Kim Kyong Hui \u2013 also seen as something of a mentor for Kim following her brother's death \u2013 has been affected.Nor is it clear whether Kim himself initiated his uncle's ousting or whether other parts of the elite were behind Jang's fall. While some analysts predict increased instability in the North, as those associated with Jang are removed, others argue that Kim has consolidated his position effectively.Patrick Ventrell, White House National Security Council spokesman, said: \"If confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the regime.\"The KCNA report raises further questions about the development of North's economic and foreign policy, alleging Jang believed that after his coup his \"reformist\" reputation would encourage foreign countries to recognise him quickly.Cathcart noted: \"Kim has been very lucky in the external environment and I think he will continue to be. For all the bile [the North has] directed at South Korea, Japan and the US and even China, none of those countries are interested in grabbing this hornets' nest and shaking it right now.\"", "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "North Korea executes Kim Jong-un's uncle as 'traitor'"},{"date": "2013-12-05T16:38:57Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "New rules for farmers.

Now we can say it seems like reforms are here and beginning to speed up - but we have to wait another year or two to be certain,\" said Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul, a leading expert on the country. \"It looks like they are looking at doing something serious, but it is hard to say because [over decades] we have seen at least three or four waves of speculation about change.\"This week's unconfirmed claims that Kim's uncle Jang Song Thaek had been ousted from power have refocused attention on the country's domestic affairs; some analysts say Jang was associated with reform.The country's 24 million inhabitants have been heavily dependent on the unofficial economy since the devastating famine of the 1990s; people even pay bribes not to turn up to their allocated jobs, because wages are so low.The north has repeatedly indicated interest in reform - only to waver or roll back changes, despite the encouragement of China, which embraced capitalism from the late 1970s. Periodic crackdowns onmarkets and trading have devastated household incomes and even in more tolerant times such illicit activity has limited economic development.The North Korean economy grew by 1.1% in 2012. Staple food production has increased in recent years, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme; but their latest report warned that chronic malnutrition persists and 84% of households have borderline or poor food consumption.\"There is lots of knowledge and interest in economic reform at senior levels in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but it is always stymied by the security imperative,\" said Hazel Smith, an expert on the North at the University of Central Lancashire.The elite has good reason to be cautious, Lankov noted: a reforming North Korea will be much less stable.But there is a logic to the idea that Kim would take the step when his father hesitated, he added. The gradual disintegration of state control and people's growing awareness of the outside world - through illicitly consumed media or working overseas \u2013 has made the regime vulnerable.\"Kim Jong-un is a young boy: if he does nothing and just sits and waits, the system is not going to last,\" said Lankov. \"Without reform, he can easily continue for another five or 10 years, maybe 25. But definitely not 50 \u2013 and being 30, he needs 50 years.\"The question is how much of an impact will come from recent developments including pilot agricultural projects allowing farmers to keep part of the harvest, one hundredfold increases in the wages for key export-oriented jobs \u2013 giving employees wages of around $40 (\u00a325) a month \u2013 and the announcement of multiple new special economic zones.Moving towards reform and denuclearisation could see inter-Korean trade grow from around $2bn a year to $11-16bn by 2020.\"They are avoiding saying reform or opening [up] but that's what it amounts to \u2013 a crack at any rate,\" said Andray Abrahamian of Choson Exchange, a non-profit organisation which helps to develop economic and business skills in the country.He said the new zones would allow the people running them to learn from each other and outsiders. Marcus Noland, executive vice president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted that the current pilot agricultural projects are similar to experiments in the late 1990s, involving changes such as the introduction of sharecropping.\"My understanding is that the state \u2013 not the market \u2013 is still setting the price for inputs such as fertiliser and the prices at which grain could be sold back to the state in the sharecropping arrangement,\" he added.\"This is an attempt to tweak the existing system, not fundamentally reform it.\"The country's current premier, Pak Pong-ju, previously held the role around a decade ago, when the North introduced major wage increases for groups including military officers, scientists, and coal miners.Recognising the importance of material incentives is important, Noland said, adding: \"That earlier reform attempt was full of contradictions and was badly implemented and failed. Pak was removed from his position. Normally one would not think of the appointment of a 74-year-old who had failed earlier as a good sign, but at a minimum he probably learned some things from his mistakes.\"On the investment front, Japanese media has claimed that most of the new zones will be small.

Yet this chilly north Asian capital is not Pyongyang, but Ulan Bator, Mongolia.When Mongolia's president, Tsakhia Elbegdorj, arrives in North Korea on Sunday \u2013 the first head of state to visit since Kim Jong-un took power \u2013 it will cement a longstanding relationship.Other countries have ties to North Korea, but Mongolia is highly unusual as a democracy enjoying warm relations with both Pyongyang's authoritarian regime and Seoul government in the South. \"The visit of our president will elevate relations to a new stage,\" Mongolia's foreign minister, Luvsanvandan Bold, told the Guardian.\"We want to make a more secure region \u2013 more safe and stable \u2013 with more economic development. Of course we have different systems but we shared a common history and there's a lot of sympathy between Mongolian and Korean people.\"Mongolia, then a Soviet satellite, was the second country to recognise North Korea and took orphans following the Korean war. Such charitable initiatives continued after Mongolia's democratisation; last month it delivered food aid, following a request from Pyongyang.Charles Armstrong, professor of Korean Studies at Columbia University and author of Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, said the two countries had a shared history that pre-dated the communist period and \"a common concern about domination by larger countries, namely Russia and China, and retaining political independence\".On Mongolia's side, its ability to engage with North Korea is a potentially important asset in dealing with other, more powerful countries.\"Ulan Bator can be a useful platform to create understanding,\" Bold said. \"What Mongolia can provide is leverage to improve the situation in the region and pursue the initiative for parties to share dialogue \u2026 We see a lot of room to be more active.\"Last year Ulan Bator hosted talks between Tokyo and Pyongyang on Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.\"Mongolia has done a good job of portraying itself as an honest broker on Korean peninsula issues. It is probably the only country that both North and South Korea can be said to trust,\" Armstrong said.\"To the extent that North Korea can be persuaded to do anything, Mongolia can play an important mediating role \u2026 Of course, North Korea is fiercely protective of its independence and will act in its own perceived interest, taking maximum advantage of the countries it deals with. But due to its non-threatening nature, Mongolia is in a better position to positively influence North Korea's behaviour than are China, Russia, South Korea, Japan or the US.\"Economic links are becoming as important; one key advantage for the landlocked country is North Korea's access to the sea.This year, Mongolia-listed HB Oil bought a 20% stake in a North Korean state-owned refinery. It plans to supply crude oil to the Sungri refinery, based in the special economic zone at Rason, exporting the products back to Mongolia.\"That has triggered a lot of interest,\" said Munkhdul Badral, founder of business research firm Cover Mongolia, who visited Pyongyang with a business delegation last month. \"Other potentially developing countries are already crowded with Chinese investment \u2026 It doesn't make much sense for Mongolian companies to be going into Myanmar [Burma].\"Mongolian firms can also benefit from offering others a route into North Korea. \"Essentially, tThis HB Oil opportunity has provided those foreign investors who specialise in managing funds in emerging and frontier markets with an opportunity to gain exposure to the DPRK [North Korea],\" said Joseph Naemi, non-executive director of HB Oil.If Pyongyang approves the processing deal, Sungri could reach full operational capacity by the first quarter of 2015, he said; the Mongolian oil firm also has exclusive rights to onshore exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons.Given North Korea's fractious relations with other states, such investments come at significant risk. \"Of course, sanctions can change. If they affect the oil and gas industry of the DPRK then yes, we are out of business,\" said Naemi, adding that if the sector was not used to risk, \"oil would have been at $1,000 a barrel 30 years ago\".Others warn that foreign operations in North Korea face considerable domestic challenges and have little protection even if their countries have good diplomatic relations, as Chinese businesses have found.\"I can think of five or six cases - two are success stories,\" said Andrei Lankov, an expert on North Korea at Kookmin University in Seoul.Hiring North Korean workers, however, had proved \"a capitalist dream: people work hard, don't ask for much money and never ever unionise\". There are around 1,700 such labourers in Mongolia and construction and manufacturing firms seek more; existing agreements would allow up to 5,000 to work there.Lankov noted that North Koreans paid \"very significant\" bribes to get jobs abroad because they could earn five or six times the average wage at home. Even after Pyongyang has taken a large chunk of their earnings, \"it's unbelievably profitable - and they save most of it and buy goods that will sell well in the North Korean markets, multiplying it\".He and others argue that exposing North Koreans to the outside world has to be positive. \"We are still not a rich country, but we have gained a lot of experience in the past 20 years and more in shaping society and democratising.

Andrei Lankov, an expert on North Korea, noted in his book The Real North Korea that when he lived in Pyongyang in the 1980s, \"the authorities took care to isolate the populace not only from the foreign media but also from the official publications of earlier years\".He added: \"All North Korean periodicals and a significant number of publications on social and political topics were regularly removed from common access libraries and could only be perused by people with special permission\u00a0\u2026 This rule was obviously introduced to ensure that the changes in the policy line of the regime would remain unnoticeable to the populace.\"", "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-un", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "North Korea erases online archives"},{"date": "2013-12-13T08:11:45Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea has executed Kim Jong-un's uncle as a \"traitor for all ages\" who confessed to planning a coup, state media has announced.Jang Song-thaek, previously one of the country's most powerful men, was accused of everything from plotting to overthrow the state to instigating disastrous currency reforms and dishing out pornography in the report from official news agency KCNA.It denounced him as \"worse than a dog\" and \"despicable human scum\".KCNA said a special military tribunal had found him guilty of treason and the Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried a photograph of him handcuffed and held by uniformed guards in the courtroom.North Korea announced earlier this week that Jang, thought to be in his late 60s, had been stripped of all posts and expelled from the Workers' party for offences including factionalism, corruption and dissolute behaviour. But many had thought his marriage to the youthful leader's aunt \u2013 the sister of late leader Kim Jong-il \u2013 was likely to save his life.In Pyongyang, people crowded around subway station billboards displaying the morning paper and news of the execution, Associated Press reported. Others sat quietly and listened as a radio broadcast broadcast into the subway listed Jang's crimes.The lengthy, bombastic and at times downright bizarre report from KCNA quoted an alleged admission by Jang that he sought to destabilise the country, triggering discontent among the military and others. He planned to become premier if North Korea approached collapse and use illicitly acquired wealth to ensure that \"the people and service personnel will shout 'hurrah' for me\" and his coup would succeed smoothly\".It also claimed he pursued a \"decadent capitalist lifestyle\" \u2013 squandering at least \u20ac4.6m in 2009 alone, including in a foreign casino \u2013 and deliberately hampered construction projects in Pyongyang.He sold off natural resources \"at random\" and committed treachery by selling off land at the Rason special economic zone for five decades, it added, apparently in reference to a deal with Russia.\"They are using this opportunity to scapegoat Uncle Jang by relegating responsibility for all policy failures,\" said Leonid Petrov of the Australian National University.Other offences cited include halfhearted applause as Kim rose to power and Jang's \"reckless\" instruction to security forces to erect a granite block with Kim's signature in a shaded corner rather than in front of their headquarters.Brian Myers, an expert on ideology at Dongseo University in Busan, noted that the denigration of Jang held potential perils for the leadership. It raised questions about his ability to cause so much damage for so long and sat uneasily with North Korea's use of collective punishment.\"This is a member of the clan in a culture where the regime tends to punish entire families for crimes committed by one of them. So it seems odd to be so explicit about [his] crimes,\" Myers said.KCNA said Jang had long held a \"dirty political ambition\" but dared not act while Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il were alive.\"He began revealing his true colours, thinking that it was just the time for him to realise his wild ambition in the period of historic turn when the generation of the revolution was replaced,\" it added.That was when Jang \u2013 who had been purged twice before \u2013 returned to the forefront of North Korean politics. Kim Jong-il appeared to have selected him as a mentor figure who could help smooth Kim Jong-un's path to power.Adam Cathcart, an expert on North Korea, said accusations of factionalism and seeking power were \"pro forma\" in such cases, but he noted how specific the charges were and added: \"There certainly were discussions about the direction North Korea would take [when Kim Jong-il died]. It would be natural for Jang to want to be part of a collective leadership system.\"But North Korea is not moving towards a collective system: it's all about the one leader\u00a0\u2026 It's the divine right of Kims.\"Myers added: \"The most surprising and unprecedented thing is not that someone was planning to overthrow the state\u00a0\u2026 but the implication that he had a substantial number of followers. That's the first ever official admission of significant disunity in the North Korean state itself.\"Kim has made sweeping changes to the hierarchy in North Korea, changing key military personnel repeatedly as well as removing civilian members, but family members are normally dealt with more leniently and quietly. It is unclear how the position of Jang's wife Kim Kyong Hui \u2013 also seen as something of a mentor for Kim following her brother's death \u2013 has been affected.Nor is it clear whether Kim himself initiated his uncle's ousting or whether other parts of the elite were behind Jang's fall. While some analysts predict increased instability in the North, as those associated with Jang are removed, others argue that Kim has consolidated his position effectively.Patrick Ventrell, White House National Security Council spokesman, said: \"If confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the regime.\"The KCNA report raises further questions about the development of North's economic and foreign policy, alleging Jang believed that after his coup his \"reformist\" reputation would encourage foreign countries to recognise him quickly.Cathcart noted: \"Kim has been very lucky in the external environment and I think he will continue to be. For all the bile [the North has] directed at South Korea, Japan and the US and even China, none of those countries are interested in grabbing this hornets' nest and shaking it right now.\"", "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "North Korea executes Kim Jong-un's uncle as 'traitor'"},{"date": "2013-12-05T16:38:57Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "New rules for farmers. A massive wage hike for some miners and steelworkers. Multiple new economic zones to attract foreign investors.Observers are asking whether these dots join to form a picture of real change for North Korea, almost two years after its young leader Kim Jong-un took the helm.\"Two months ago I would have said that I don't think it's happening. Now we can say it seems like reforms are here and beginning to speed up - but we have to wait another year or two to be certain,\" said Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul, a leading expert on the country. \"It looks like they are looking at doing something serious, but it is hard to say because [over decades] we have seen at least three or four waves of speculation about change.\"This week's unconfirmed claims that Kim's uncle Jang Song Thaek had been ousted from power have refocused attention on the country's domestic affairs; some analysts say Jang was associated with reform.The country's 24 million inhabitants have been heavily dependent on the unofficial economy since the devastating famine of the 1990s; people even pay bribes not to turn up to their allocated jobs, because wages are so low.The north has repeatedly indicated interest in reform - only to waver or roll back changes, despite the encouragement of China, which embraced capitalism from the late 1970s. Periodic crackdowns onmarkets and trading have devastated household incomes and even in more tolerant times such illicit activity has limited economic development.The North Korean economy grew by 1.1% in 2012. Staple food production has increased in recent years, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme; but their latest report warned that chronic malnutrition persists and 84% of households have borderline or poor food consumption.\"There is lots of knowledge and interest in economic reform at senior levels in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, but it is always stymied by the security imperative,\" said Hazel Smith, an expert on the North at the University of Central Lancashire.The elite has good reason to be cautious, Lankov noted: a reforming North Korea will be much less stable.But there is a logic to the idea that Kim would take the step when his father hesitated, he added. The gradual disintegration of state control and people's growing awareness of the outside world - through illicitly consumed media or working overseas \u2013 has made the regime vulnerable.\"Kim Jong-un is a young boy: if he does nothing and just sits and waits, the system is not going to last,\" said Lankov. \"Without reform, he can easily continue for another five or 10 years, maybe 25. But definitely not 50 \u2013 and being 30, he needs 50 years.\"The question is how much of an impact will come from recent developments including pilot agricultural projects allowing farmers to keep part of the harvest, one hundredfold increases in the wages for key export-oriented jobs \u2013 giving employees wages of around $40 (\u00a325) a month \u2013 and the announcement of multiple new special economic zones.Moving towards reform and denuclearisation could see inter-Korean trade grow from around $2bn a year to $11-16bn by 2020.\"They are avoiding saying reform or opening [up] but that's what it amounts to \u2013 a crack at any rate,\" said Andray Abrahamian of Choson Exchange, a non-profit organisation which helps to develop economic and business skills in the country.He said the new zones would allow the people running them to learn from each other and outsiders. Marcus Noland, executive vice president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted that the current pilot agricultural projects are similar to experiments in the late 1990s, involving changes such as the introduction of sharecropping.\"My understanding is that the state \u2013 not the market \u2013 is still setting the price for inputs such as fertiliser and the prices at which grain could be sold back to the state in the sharecropping arrangement,\" he added.\"This is an attempt to tweak the existing system, not fundamentally reform it.\"The country's current premier, Pak Pong-ju, previously held the role around a decade ago, when the North introduced major wage increases for groups including military officers, scientists, and coal miners.Recognising the importance of material incentives is important, Noland said, adding: \"That earlier reform attempt was full of contradictions and was badly implemented and failed. Pak was removed from his position. Normally one would not think of the appointment of a 74-year-old who had failed earlier as a good sign, but at a minimum he probably learned some things from his mistakes.\"On the investment front, Japanese media has claimed that most of the new zones will be small. Infrastructure and particularly power remain unreliable, though Kim appears to be overseeing a building boom.Shuttering the Kaesong industrial complex, run jointly with the South, during this spring's nuclear crisis also hammered home the investment risks. There is plenty of cheap labour elsewhere in Asia.The fundamental challenge, said Noland, is the fundamental challenge is the north's policy of developing nuclear weapons and the economy in parallel; \"a contradiction reified as doctrine\".\"How do you convince the world that you are open for business while brandishing nuclear weapons at the world's largest economy and kidnapping an octogenarian?\" he said, referring to the detention of 85-year-old Korean war veteran Merrill Newman, a US citizen.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Kim Jong-un", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "North Korea faces a long road to reform"},{"date": "2013-11-25T16:40:38Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "In their brave pursuit of creativity, fashion magazines aren't strangers to causing offence - Italian Vogue's feature on \"slave\" earrings, for example, rightly caused outrage a couple of years ago. Now American Elle has come under fire after running a trend report on military style with the headline North Korea chic and the image of a North Korean soldier next to a stiletto from the Prabal Gurung runway collection.Although the magazine has since apologised and removed the image, the reduction of the world's most mysterious military dictatorship to simple aesthetics is clumsy and offensive. But it also fits into fashion's longstanding fascination with the military. The Elle story picked up on Gurung's collection, but this season the theme was visible at Rag & Bone, Christopher Kane and Whistles in the form of camouflage print. The military look comes up every season, moving from a more urban take such as Kane's, to specific historical moments. Both Burberry and McQ have recently referenced the greatcoats and laced-up boots of the first world war trenches, and Margaret Howell's autumn collection had a second world war home front utilitarian look.The trend dates back even further. Ever since the 60s when army jackets were adopted by the counter-culture movement, a beret-wearing Che Guevara its poster boy, military clothing has been fetishised by US civilians. Khaki jackets, combat trousers, camo and army boots are now as much part of the fashion lexicon as they are part of an actual soldier's uniform. We don't blink an eye when they're recycled on the catwalk or on Kate Moss. There may even be added cachet that comes with a link to the more glamorous elements of the military \u2013 hence our adoption of the aviator shades favoured by fighter pilots or the current trend for bomber jackets.The US army appears to be aware of the sticking power of this trend; it has licensed the Authentic Apparel Group to produce a range of civilian clothes inspired by army uniforms, with sales benefiting the families of the military. Released for autumn \u2013 and with real-life action man The Rock starring in the campaign \u2013 each piece in the menswear range is individually approved by the Pentagon, a detail that will no doubt appeal to those still playing GI Joe through their clothes.

Yet this chilly north Asian capital is not Pyongyang, but Ulan Bator, Mongolia.When Mongolia's president, Tsakhia Elbegdorj, arrives in North Korea on Sunday \u2013 the first head of state to visit since Kim Jong-un took power \u2013 it will cement a longstanding relationship.Other countries have ties to North Korea, but Mongolia is highly unusual as a democracy enjoying warm relations with both Pyongyang's authoritarian regime and Seoul government in the South. \"The visit of our president will elevate relations to a new stage,\" Mongolia's foreign minister, Luvsanvandan Bold, told the Guardian.\"We want to make a more secure region \u2013 more safe and stable \u2013 with more economic development. Of course we have different systems but we shared a common history and there's a lot of sympathy between Mongolian and Korean people.\"Mongolia, then a Soviet satellite, was the second country to recognise North Korea and took orphans following the Korean war. Such charitable initiatives continued after Mongolia's democratisation; last month it delivered food aid, following a request from Pyongyang.Charles Armstrong, professor of Korean Studies at Columbia University and author of Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, said the two countries had a shared history that pre-dated the communist period and \"a common concern about domination by larger countries, namely Russia and China, and retaining political independence\".On Mongolia's side, its ability to engage with North Korea is a potentially important asset in dealing with other, more powerful countries.\"Ulan Bator can be a useful platform to create understanding,\" Bold said. \"What Mongolia can provide is leverage to improve the situation in the region and pursue the initiative for parties to share dialogue \u2026 We see a lot of room to be more active.\"Last year Ulan Bator hosted talks between Tokyo and Pyongyang on Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.\"Mongolia has done a good job of portraying itself as an honest broker on Korean peninsula issues. It is probably the only country that both North and South Korea can be said to trust,\" Armstrong said.\"To the extent that North Korea can be persuaded to do anything, Mongolia can play an important mediating role \u2026 Of course, North Korea is fiercely protective of its independence and will act in its own perceived interest, taking maximum advantage of the countries it deals with. But due to its non-threatening nature, Mongolia is in a better position to positively influence North Korea's behaviour than are China, Russia, South Korea, Japan or the US.\"Economic links are becoming as important; one key advantage for the landlocked country is North Korea's access to the sea.This year, Mongolia-listed HB Oil bought a 20% stake in a North Korean state-owned refinery. It plans to supply crude oil to the Sungri refinery, based in the special economic zone at Rason, exporting the products back to Mongolia.\"That has triggered a lot of interest,\" said Munkhdul Badral, founder of business research firm Cover Mongolia, who visited Pyongyang with a business delegation last month. \"Other potentially developing countries are already crowded with Chinese investment \u2026 It doesn't make much sense for Mongolian companies to be going into Myanmar [Burma].\"Mongolian firms can also benefit from offering others a route into North Korea. \"Essentially, tThis HB Oil opportunity has provided those foreign investors who specialise in managing funds in emerging and frontier markets with an opportunity to gain exposure to the DPRK [North Korea],\" said Joseph Naemi, non-executive director of HB Oil.If Pyongyang approves the processing deal, Sungri could reach full operational capacity by the first quarter of 2015, he said; the Mongolian oil firm also has exclusive rights to onshore exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons.Given North Korea's fractious relations with other states, such investments come at significant risk. \"Of course, sanctions can change. If they affect the oil and gas industry of the DPRK then yes, we are out of business,\" said Naemi, adding that if the sector was not used to risk, \"oil would have been at $1,000 a barrel 30 years ago\".Others warn that foreign operations in North Korea face considerable domestic challenges and have little protection even if their countries have good diplomatic relations, as Chinese businesses have found.\"I can think of five or six cases - two are success stories,\" said Andrei Lankov, an expert on North Korea at Kookmin University in Seoul.Hiring North Korean workers, however, had proved \"a capitalist dream: people work hard, don't ask for much money and never ever unionise\". There are around 1,700 such labourers in Mongolia and construction and manufacturing firms seek more; existing agreements would allow up to 5,000 to work there.Lankov noted that North Koreans paid \"very significant\" bribes to get jobs abroad because they could earn five or six times the average wage at home. Even after Pyongyang has taken a large chunk of their earnings, \"it's unbelievably profitable - and they save most of it and buy goods that will sell well in the North Korean markets, multiplying it\".He and others argue that exposing North Koreans to the outside world has to be positive. \"We are still not a rich country, but we have gained a lot of experience in the past 20 years and more in shaping society and democratising. I think that's very important,\" said Bold. \"There are a lot of opportunities for North Korea \u2026 It is very important they can see how there could be a transformation process.\"", "tags": ["Mongolia", "World news", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Mongolia's special relationship with North Korea pays economic dividends"},{"date": "2013-10-22T15:13:09Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "All the hoo-ha that's surrounded the recent opening of North Korea's ski resort, framed as it's been by the western press as the answer to chubby Kim Jong Un's wont to indulge his Swiss ways, has overlooked the fact that every dollar spent on tourism is a dollar not spent on centrifuges or Mercedes.I've been to North Korea many times since 2002, when I first went to research for a guidebook on the land, and genuinely, a tourist ski resort is really quite a canny investment. Dollar for dollar it has the potential for a far quicker and greater return than investing, for example, in manufacturing industry, which depends on regular supplies of power, raw materials, detailed and up-to-date market data and actual access to international markets, none of which the North has. For a ski resort, the hill's free, the snow's free, it's just up to the tourists to decide to come.Building a tourist industry provides jobs for locals who'd otherwise be working in bomb factories, if they had work at all. It diversifies the North Korean economy away from weapons' exports. It provides and demands skills ranging from designing and building quality accommodation, to the people skills required in servicing hotels guests, and brings in investment in infrastructure, roads, railways, airports, health facilities and food supply chains that ever more areas will seek to benefit from as they open up to visitors.All in, tourist dollars help to expand the economy and create dependents at every level on tourist dollars, which creates a great incentive not to go around starting wars. That's one reason South Korea built the large industrial zone near Kaesong city in North Korea, a large development right on the flashpoint DMZ. The North closed the zone during April's stand-off \u2013 but, note, they didn't smash it up, and it's now reopened. The world's press did much to exaggerate the state of tensions during the stand-off, but tourism to North Korea continued, and British-run tour firm Koryo Tours  was, for the very first time, opening up the formerly closed border city of Sinuiju. Tourism also brings foreign currency into the North, which might be spent on something nefarious or may be used to import foodstuffs that international donors have refused to give since April's stand-off.The reality is the ski resort is the latest small, but tangible shift in the mindset of those running the state. A friend of mine who specialises in tours of North Korea was just this year sent to the east coast port of Wonsan to check out buildings that formerly housed former Korean People's Army officers but are now being converted to civilian use as hotels. If the Korean People's Army is getting out of goose-stepping and into tourism, surely that's a good thing.Of course, tourism will only profit the army as it does the state overall, and they may spend any profits on sinister things. But in this multi-connected world. you can't get out of bed without money being taxed or profited into the hands of bad people. Tax is the state's racket, but it's only when we talk about North Korea that tourism is framed by what the government there does \u2013 no-one complains that the billions spent on touring the US helps fund drone strikes on Pakistani children, for example, or the British government spends billions on Trident nuclear submarines while demand at food banks continues to rise.I'm no supporter of the regime that runs North Korea. The regime spends an inordinate amount of energy trying to convince its people that we westerners are terrible savages. But the regime isn't going anywhere. It's survived for over 60 years on a war footing with the South and the US (which almost wiped the North off the map during the Korean War); it's survived famine and total economic and diplomatic isolation. My tourist dollars contribute as much to propping up the regime, funding its gulags or its nuclear program, as they did 20 years ago when there were no tourists nor nukes.But most importantly, I don't see why anyone should dictate to me where I can go, be it the regime or outsiders, nor who I'll meet in North Korea, what opportunities in engagement that come from that and why the local people should be denied the livelihoods and learning of skills and languages. Additional tourism in North Korea will help locals see that outsiders aren't all awful people, and outsiders to see that the North Koreans are not the soulless automatons or brainwashed actors terrified of meeting foreigners that the western press loves to portray them as. They're real people, who might have other concerns than to immediately give westerners the attention they think they deserve, but if they catch your smile they'll wave back with genuine warmth, if not actually talk to you (assuming they are confident in English, more than I am in Korean). This is increasingly true, in ever more places.

The Associated Press, quoting officials who had seen the commission's embargoed report, confirmed it found North Korea culpable for offences including crimes against humanity through starvation and extermination, as well as the abduction of people in South Korea and Japan.The report concludes that the evidence gathered by the three-person commission, which held sometimes emotional public sessions in Seoul, Tokyo, London and Washington, gives \"reasonable grounds \u2026 to merit a criminal investigation by a competent national or international organ of justice\".One part of the commission's remit was to decide whether North Korea's leadership, potentially including the top ruler, Kim Jong-un, should be referred to the ICC.

Founded in 1939 to bring diversion to British troops, the Entertainment National Service Association rapidly found its acronym, Ensa, lampooned as \"Every Night Something Awful\", as well as suggestions that some of its productions could be employed as a weapon against the enemy to make them surrender.An allied tactic \u2013 the sending of plays to controversial regimes \u2013 has now caused a row, with criticism from Amnesty International over plans for Shakespeare's Globe in London to include North Korea among the venues for its new staging of Hamlet. Amnesty's suggestion that the visit ignored the human rights abuses under Kim Jong-un and previous leaders irritated the theatre company. They pointed to their record of working with libertarian organisations and accused the charity of giving the impression that they were going out of their way to visit North Korea as a provocative one-off rather than stopping there on a large world tour.The obvious reference point in any discussion about which stamps actors should have on their passports is the boycott of South Africa by the theatrical union Equity and other representatives of the entertainment industry, which ran from 1965 until the Mandela presidency. This was widely observed, although rightwing performers would occasionally mount tours of rickety farces as a theatrical equivalent of the \"rebel\" cricket tours to the country, which defied the parallel sporting boycott. The late Marius Goring, a former president of Equity, spent much time and money trying to lift the ban.For most except Goring, though, there was a solid logic to the embargo on exporting drama to South Africa. The plays would be performed in venues operating a policy of segregation, with the result that touring productions participated in and legitimised apartheid. The governments during the discriminatory years also strictly censored the sort of material that was admitted.Hateful as the North Korean regime is, the situation is significantly different. The Globe will presumably have no control over the makeup of the audience, but the choice of play is its own, and the use of Shakespeare's plays as a weapon against repression has an honourable history. As Professor James Shapiro discusses in his tremendous book 1599, Shakespeare wrote a play about political overthrow \u2013 Julius Caesar \u2013 during a period when England was feverish with fear about the end of the regime of Elizabeth I (a rumour of her death spread that year) and the possibility of invasion. Shortly afterwards, he wrote another play about a conspiracy within a rotten state: the one, in fact, that the Globe is taking to North Korea.During the era of Soviet control of Eastern Europe, Shakespeare's political tragedies were often staged either overtly or covertly as coded commentary by dissidents. In Russian-run Prague, the Czech author and philosopher Pavel Kohout founded the Living Room theatre, which performed a reduced but politically very-pointed production of Macbeth. Tom Stoppard's 1979 short play Cahoot's Macbeth \u2013 in which a government inspector interrupts an undercover staging of the play \u2013 was inspired by, and dedicated to, Kohout's troupe.The model of the South African boycott shows how denying entertainment to a regime can isolate and weaken it, but the possibility of drama as a discreet provocation is shown by both the Eastern European example and by a March 1985 visit to Turkey by the playwrights Harold Pinter and Arthur Miller (described in Michael Billington's biography of Pinter), when the dramatists challenged the prevailing political climate so fiercely that they were ejected from a dinner at the US embassy.It is perhaps too much to hope of the Globe's visit to North Korea that Kim Jong-un himself will sit and watch a play in which a bloody usurper sits and watches a play that triggers his guilt. And there are clear risks of surreptitious censorship: will any synopses or surtitles for the local audience be full and accurate? But it was the admirable human rights group PEN that encouraged Pinter and Miller to go to Turkey, and Amnesty International might be sensible to see what effect Shakespeare's discreet political subversion might have in another country.\u2022 Amnesty criticises Globe theatre's North Korea visit on Hamlet world tour", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "William Shakespeare", "Kim Jong-un", "World news", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Amnesty International", "Culture"], "title": "Is there something rotten in taking Hamlet to North Korea?"},{"date": "2014-03-03T04:03:09Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea has expelled an Australian man who was arrested last month while working as a Christian missionary.The North Korean state news agency KCNA reported on Monday that 75-year-old John Short had admitted to violating North Korean law and apologised.

Open contributions: mythbustersWe have asked you to help us turn this on its head by submitting a myth to be debunked or a burning question you\u2019ve always wanted to ask. Here\u2019s the first round of responses from our expert network.Chad Henshaw was curious about Pyongyang\u2019s metro: I read that the metro only runs between two station for tourists, filled with actors. Are any other stops on the line operational? Does the subway operate all day every day or only at peak times? Every third Tuesday if there is enough power? Is it a viable form of transport for a North Korean?There are all manner of conspiracy theories about the Pyongyang metro: that there are, in reality, only two stations; that it only works when tourists are there; that all the locals there are actors. Despite the claims, the Pyongyang metro is indeed a functional system, running along two bisecting lines in the central and outer-western parts of Pyongyang. The Chollima line runs north to south, the Hyoksin line snakes from west to east.Pyongyang is plagued by power shortages but they are not common on the metro. Tourists sometimes experience them, not on the trains, but on the 100 metre escalators. The metro is cheap \u2013 five won a ride, which is pocket-change even for the poorer of Pyongyang\u2019s residents \u2013 but limited. In the heavily residential area east of the Taedong river there are no stations. It may not cover as many places as the tram and trolley-bus network, but if you need to go anywhere near a station the chances are you\u2019ll use it. Simon Cockerell is the general manager of Koryo Tours , who have been taking tourists to North Korea for 21 years. He has been a regular visitor to Pyongyang since 2002, and has ridden the metro more than 100 timesAlex Fletcher wanted to know more about the Kim family tree: How many siblings does Kim Jong-un have? Some say that he has two brothers and two sisters, others say he has more. Also, how did Kim meet Ri Sol-ju?Kim Jong-un has two siblings and is the middle child. He has an older brother, 33-year old Kim Jong-chol, and and a younger sister, 26-year old Kim Yo-jong. They both work as aides to their brother, although Kim Yo-jong is the more publicly active of the two. They both studied in Switzerland, like their brother, in the 1990s and early 2000s. Kim Jong-un also has four step siblings: three stepsisters and one stepbrother. As to how Kim Jong-un met Ri Sol-ju: Ri\u2019s parents are members of the DPRK\u2019s outer elite and Ri was active as a performer and cheerleader. Matchmaking and arranged marriages are still practiced in the two Koreas and Ri was matched with Kim Jong-un between 2009 and 2010. After Kim Jong-un selected Ri, his aunt Kim Kyong-hui recommended her to his late father, leader Kim Jong-il, who approved the nuptials.Michael Madden of North Korea Leadership Watch, a Guardian network partner focused on politics and people at the heart of the Kim regimeMauricio Fiore and Alan McLemore both asked whether cannabis was legal:  According to Wikipedia cannabis is \"legal or effectively legal\" in North Korea. Reports on Vice and Huffington Post suggest the country is \"a weed-smoker\u2019s paradise\", where the drug is \"smoked freely and its sweet scent often catches your nostrils unannounced\". But, amusing as it may be to some that the brutal regime has taken a progressive stance on drug policy, experts agree that cannabis is rare and most definitely illegal in North Korea.The origin of the myth is a green, potpourri-like mixture of herbs and uncured tobacco leaves called ipdambae (\uc78e\ub2f4\ubc30), translated literally as \"leaf tobacco\". Matthew Reichel who has traveled to North Korea more than 30 times since 2009 as the director of Pyongyang Project, says that bags of this are commonly sold as a cheap alternative to cigarettes at public markets.\u201cIt looks a little bit similar if you haven\u2019t smoked a lot of weed,\u201d Reichel says. \u201cIf you smoke that stuff it\u2019ll smell weird but it won\u2019t get you high.\u201dNorth Korea does cultivate industrial hemp and these plants can be found growing wild in the countryside, but they contain just a fraction of the THC found in regular cannabis. Reichel suggests it\u2019s possible that some farmers have managed to grow their own private stashes (a scenario described by a frequent North Korea visitor in a popular Reddit \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d thread), but the drug would certainly not be smoked in public.Drug offenders in North Korea can be sentenced to death, but Reichel says petty pot possession would not likely lead to an execution or banishment to one the country\u2019s concentration camps, which are mostly reserved for political prisoners.Keegan Hamilton is a freelance journalist in New York reporting on drugs, crime, culture, and many other topics for The Village Voice, The Atlantic, and Vice News.Liam Patrik had a question about leadership: Are the Kims in control of the country? Or are they puppets of the National Defence Commission to give the military a kind of royal veneer that helps support their own control over the Workers' Party and affairs of state?Kim Jong-un and his immediate subordinates control the DPRK. The system is not an obdurate one-man rule, but a balancing of power groups, including the military, government and internal security, all have different interests and policies. Kim is \"the decider\". His late father, Kim Jong-il, dominated DPRK politics for nearly four decades and was the country\u2019s ultimate authority. He ruled, giving the power groups wide scope to formulate policy, but by retaining ultimate control over decision making. He installed a rigid system of cross-checking bureaucracies, surveillance, personnel control and encouraged competition pitting groups against each other for his attention. The National Defence Commission was very much a Kim Jong-iIl production, its members were people he had handpicked. It remains to be seen whether Kim Jong-un will be as effective leader as his father.As for the role of the Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA); there are numerous checks to prevent them from forming a power center to rival the the Supreme Leader. The KPA has never been in a power competition or dominated the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea. It is misrepresented by some analysts as a monolith; but in reality it is made up of factions with different goals and perspectives.Michael Madden, North Korea Leadership Watch Eric had a few questions about the history of the Koreas: What form did Korean government take pre-1948? Under what circumstances did they assume control of North Korea? Was Kim Il-sung a 'freedom fighter' as state propaganda claims? What was his role in the war?It\u2019s probably easiest to take these questions together. The ancient nation of Korea was \u2018temporarily\u2019 partitioned at the arbitrary 38th Parallel in 1945 by the victorious allies, initially so as to take the Japanese surrender. Japan had brutally occupied Korea since 1910; the scars linger still. Partition was a US idea which the USSR accepted.Each power then tried to create a regime in its own image. Until 1948, the South was directly ruled by the US military. The Soviets were more subtle, building up a young unknown called Kim Il-sung: a former, minor anti-Japanese guerrilla in Manchuria, who\u2019d fled to Siberia in 1941. In the early years Moscow pulled all the strings, as analyst Andrei Lankov et al have shown. But as real reforms including land and women\u2019s rights were rolled out, Kim proved himself to be more than a puppet. Historians tend to think Kim bounced an initially doubtful Stalin and Mao into his bid to forcibly reunify Korea, starting the war. He would have succeeded if it had not been for a US-led multinational UN force that helped South Korea. In 1953, Kim\u2019s rival Syngman Rhee \u2013 the first president of South Korea \u2013 refused to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement, he wanted to fight on. South Korea never signed, but Kim went on to build the North Korean regime, now ruled by his grandson. That\u2019s the gist of it. North Korea claims that Kim liberated Korea single-handed and deny that he started the Korean War. It must be said that evaluating the 1945-50 period remains controversial. For more detail and debate, see books by, amongst others, Sheila Miyoshi Jager, Andrei Lankov, Charles Armstrong, Bruce Cumings and Shen Zhuiha.Aidan Foster-Carter is an honorary senior research fellow in sociology and modern Korea at Leeds University.

He has an older brother, 33-year old Kim Jong-chol, and and a younger sister, 26-year old Kim Yo-jong. They both work as aides to their brother, although Kim Yo-jong is the more publicly active of the two. They both studied in Switzerland, like their brother, in the 1990s and early 2000s. Kim Jong-un also has four step siblings: three stepsisters and one stepbrother. As to how Kim Jong-un met Ri Sol-ju: Ri\u2019s parents are members of the DPRK\u2019s outer elite and Ri was active as a performer and cheerleader. Matchmaking and arranged marriages are still practiced in the two Koreas and Ri was matched with Kim Jong-un between 2009 and 2010. After Kim Jong-un selected Ri, his aunt Kim Kyong-hui recommended her to his late father, leader Kim Jong-il, who approved the nuptials.Michael Madden of North Korea Leadership Watch, a Guardian network partner focused on politics and people at the heart of the Kim regimeMauricio Fiore and Alan McLemore both asked whether cannabis was legal:  According to Wikipedia cannabis is \"legal or effectively legal\" in North Korea. Reports on Vice and Huffington Post suggest the country is \"a weed-smoker\u2019s paradise\", where the drug is \"smoked freely and its sweet scent often catches your nostrils unannounced\". But, amusing as it may be to some that the brutal regime has taken a progressive stance on drug policy, experts agree that cannabis is rare and most definitely illegal in North Korea.The origin of the myth is a green, potpourri-like mixture of herbs and uncured tobacco leaves called ipdambae (\uc78e\ub2f4\ubc30), translated literally as \"leaf tobacco\". Matthew Reichel who has traveled to North Korea more than 30 times since 2009 as the director of Pyongyang Project, says that bags of this are commonly sold as a cheap alternative to cigarettes at public markets.\u201cIt looks a little bit similar if you haven\u2019t smoked a lot of weed,\u201d Reichel says. \u201cIf you smoke that stuff it\u2019ll smell weird but it won\u2019t get you high.\u201dNorth Korea does cultivate industrial hemp and these plants can be found growing wild in the countryside, but they contain just a fraction of the THC found in regular cannabis. Reichel suggests it\u2019s possible that some farmers have managed to grow their own private stashes (a scenario described by a frequent North Korea visitor in a popular Reddit \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d thread), but the drug would certainly not be smoked in public.Drug offenders in North Korea can be sentenced to death, but Reichel says petty pot possession would not likely lead to an execution or banishment to one the country\u2019s concentration camps, which are mostly reserved for political prisoners.Keegan Hamilton is a freelance journalist in New York reporting on drugs, crime, culture, and many other topics for The Village Voice, The Atlantic, and Vice News.Liam Patrik had a question about leadership: Are the Kims in control of the country? Or are they puppets of the National Defence Commission to give the military a kind of royal veneer that helps support their own control over the Workers' Party and affairs of state?Kim Jong-un and his immediate subordinates control the DPRK. The system is not an obdurate one-man rule, but a balancing of power groups, including the military, government and internal security, all have different interests and policies. Kim is \"the decider\". His late father, Kim Jong-il, dominated DPRK politics for nearly four decades and was the country\u2019s ultimate authority. He ruled, giving the power groups wide scope to formulate policy, but by retaining ultimate control over decision making. He installed a rigid system of cross-checking bureaucracies, surveillance, personnel control and encouraged competition pitting groups against each other for his attention. The National Defence Commission was very much a Kim Jong-iIl production, its members were people he had handpicked. It remains to be seen whether Kim Jong-un will be as effective leader as his father.As for the role of the Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA); there are numerous checks to prevent them from forming a power center to rival the the Supreme Leader. The KPA has never been in a power competition or dominated the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea. It is misrepresented by some analysts as a monolith; but in reality it is made up of factions with different goals and perspectives.Michael Madden, North Korea Leadership Watch Eric had a few questions about the history of the Koreas: What form did Korean government take pre-1948? Under what circumstances did they assume control of North Korea? Was Kim Il-sung a 'freedom fighter' as state propaganda claims? What was his role in the war?It\u2019s probably easiest to take these questions together. The ancient nation of Korea was \u2018temporarily\u2019 partitioned at the arbitrary 38th Parallel in 1945 by the victorious allies, initially so as to take the Japanese surrender. Japan had brutally occupied Korea since 1910; the scars linger still. Partition was a US idea which the USSR accepted.Each power then tried to create a regime in its own image. Until 1948, the South was directly ruled by the US military. The Soviets were more subtle, building up a young unknown called Kim Il-sung: a former, minor anti-Japanese guerrilla in Manchuria, who\u2019d fled to Siberia in 1941. In the early years Moscow pulled all the strings, as analyst Andrei Lankov et al have shown. But as real reforms including land and women\u2019s rights were rolled out, Kim proved himself to be more than a puppet. Historians tend to think Kim bounced an initially doubtful Stalin and Mao into his bid to forcibly reunify Korea, starting the war. He would have succeeded if it had not been for a US-led multinational UN force that helped South Korea. In 1953, Kim\u2019s rival Syngman Rhee \u2013 the first president of South Korea \u2013 refused to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement, he wanted to fight on. South Korea never signed, but Kim went on to build the North Korean regime, now ruled by his grandson. That\u2019s the gist of it. North Korea claims that Kim liberated Korea single-handed and deny that he started the Korean War. It must be said that evaluating the 1945-50 period remains controversial.

We asked a panel of North Korean experts whether they thought the documents were genuine and, if so, what could be concluded from a leak of this sort. One aspect of the leaked Chinese contingency plan is monumental \u2013 if it were true. But it is so implausible it suggests this report must be bogus.We have heard only vague details about the plan. Apparently it envisions a scenario in which North Korea\u2019s government collapses after foreign military forces enter the country. As the Guardian reported: \u201cThe possible causes of upheaval in the North include an attack by an unnamed foreign force that triggers the collapse of the regime, sending civilians and soldiers across the border with China.\u201d The plan then apparently goes on to discuss various Chinese responses, such as setting up refugee camps, detaining North Korean elites, and preventing armed members of the North Korean military from entering China.Take a step back and think about the scenario on which this plan is based. It suggests that if foreign military forces (presumably the United States and South Korea) invaded North Korea, China would not react by coming to the defence of North Korea (as it is obliged to do as Pyongyang\u2019s ally) but would allow the regime to be conquered and/or collapse. Only after this collapse would China act \u2013 not on North Korea\u2019s behalf, but to ensure that instability does not spread into China.If this were true \u2013 that China would not act in defence of North Korea at the time of an invasion \u2013 this is momentous news. But there are two reasons why this makes no senseIf this were true \u2013 that China would not act in defence of North Korea at the time of an invasion \u2013 this is momentous news indeed. But there are two reasons why this makes no sense, thus suggesting that the report is bogus.First, if China did decide to abandon its military alliance with North Korea, it would not announce this through a leak in this odd way. Putting aside whether or not China might actually do this (which is a whole other issue), the way in which Beijing would go about this momentous policy change would be to convey it very privately to US and South Korean leaders.Secondly, the United States and South Korea have long urged China to pressure the North Korean government, to punish or deter it from engaging in destabilising behaviour (missile and nuclear tests, the use of force, and so forth). A Chinese abrogation of its alliance with North Korea would be quite welcome news to those countries \u2013 and thus presumably Beijing would never do it without negotiating significant concessions from Seoul and Washington.China would never, in other words, give this away for free. Thus the sheer improbability of what would constitute a truly monumental policy change \u2013 let alone the way the change was communicated \u2013 casts doubt on the veracity of the leaked report.Here\u2019s what we know for sure. North Korea has limped by despite its poverty and weakness, and may continue to do so for decades to come. Or it might collapse next week.Here\u2019s what we know for sure. North Korea has limped by despite its poverty and weakness, and may continue to do so for decades to come. Or it might collapse next week. If the government does collapse, the Korean peninsula could erupt in a humanitarian, political and military crisis that threatens the broader stability of East Asia.Bruce W Bennett, of the thinktank Rand, and I modelled the military missions that countries might perform in the event of North Korean collapse. We calculated that stabilising the peninsula could require hundreds of thousands of troops. Drawing up contingency plans (as the United States, South Korea and, yes, also China have all been doing) is therefore vital. But even more importantly, those countries need to have a dialogue about this contingency, to mitigate the dangers that it might create in East Asian international relations.Jennifer Lind is an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and the author of Sorry States: Apologies in International Politics (Cornell University Press, 2008). Follow on Twitter @profLindThe leaked news that Beijing has drawn up significant contingency plans in the event of a regime collapse in North Korea (DPRK) reflects just how little Kim Jong-un has managed to reassure the Chinese authorities that he is securely in power. Clearly China believes his hold on power to be fragile.We\u2019ve been here before. Ramping up of contingency plans for a crisis on China\u2019s border with the DPRK has occurred previously when Beijing\u2019s analysts have felt collapse may be imminent. In 2003, in the wake of a failed economic reform programme, initiated by Kim Jong-il, and a growing nuclear crisis, a large contingent of People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) troops were moved into the border region of Yanbian in China\u2019s south-eastern Jilin Province. High voltage fences were erected along portions of the rather porous border to prevent an escalation in defections across the Yalu River.Clearly China believes Kim Jong-un's hold on power to be fragile.China\u2019s plans come hot on the heels of a flurry of renewed interest in the North from Seoul and are, in part, probably a reaction to it. The South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, Beijing clearly worries about a massive influx of refugees and an ousted Kim3 trying to re-establish his power base from Chinese soil; Seoul knows it would face a humanitarian disaster that would cost multiples of German reunification and perilously threaten the South\u2019s economy.The presence of 30,000 or so American GIs in the South moving up to China\u2019s borders obviously alarms the PLA, while Seoul wonders what it would do with the DPRK\u2019s 1.2m-man army and the possibility of \u201clast ditch\u201d attacks on its territory.The fact is though that now is a time to plan for collapse.The fact is, though, that now is a time to plan for collapse. Kim Jong-un has not achieved the status of his father and grandfather as yet. His purging of senior cadres has led to nervousness among the higher echelons of power in Pyongyang and not consolidation. His half-hearted economic reforms (the so-called \u201c6.28 Policy\u201d of handing more control to agricultural co-operatives and a \u201cQuality of Life\u201d initiative to more widely distribute consumer goods) have both failed. The North remains mired in poverty, food insecurity and with an uncertain leadership.That China should be heightening its preparations for a collapse across the Yalu, and directly warning the North to avoid \"chaos\", is important. It reveals that Beijing believes the economic and political situation to be worsening and that elements on the North\u2019s ruling Korean Workers\u2019 Party that have been urging more wholesale economic reform (known loosely in Beijing as the Chrysanthemum Group) are distinctly on the back foot, if not now almost wholly purged. It also indicates that Beijing now believes that any return to the economic reform programme of 2002, instigated by Kim Jong-il, is now off the cards. Those reforms, which ultimately failed, did include the seeds of a Chinese style \"reform and opening up\" policy but went nowhere near far enough. Kim Jong-un has little to offer in the way of policy except more of the same \"Arduous march\u201d North Koreans have had to endure since 1993.Paul French is the author of North Korea: State of Paranoia, published by Zed Books. Follow on Twitter @StateofParanoiaThis leak of documents outlining how the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) would respond to a collapse in North Korea does not necessarily mean that China thinks that such a collapse is now more likely. It is more probable that the leak's timing was determined by internal Chinese debates. In late 2013, China was showing signs of greater openness in discussing what to do if North Korea collapsed. But in early spring 2014 this changed, and Chinese officials have since then been very reluctant to discuss the possibility that North Korea might collapse, let alone contingencies for such an event. (Perhaps this was because of rising tensions with Japan and a consequent Chinese reluctance to risk irritating North Korea, its only ally, by discussing that country's possible demise).Whatever the reasons for this leak it will infuriate North Korea, whose ties with China are already strained.This change must have been very frustrating to the PLA, who would have to deal in the first instance with the fallout of any North Korean collapse, and who therefore need clear direction from the civilian political leadership on what they should do. So perhaps the PLA leaked these documents so as to force the civilian leadership into a proper debate on these difficult issues. (The sharp response to the leak by the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs, which has no love for the PLA, supports this view. Its Asia directorate has been strongly against allowing even an internal debate on a North Korean collapse, let alone a discussion with foreigners).I suspect that the PLA's move will be welcomed in both Washington and Seoul, both of whom have been pressing the Chinese to share thoughts on contingencies so as to avoid possibly dangerous misunderstandings in the inevitable confusion of such a collapse.The document is significant too for what it does not say. On several occasions South Korea has worried aloud that, should North Korea collapse, Chinese troops might enter North Korea to maintain stability there. As far as I can tell without seeing the full document (which has not been published), these plans envisage no such move. It is possible therefore that the PLA leaked them in part so as to reassure South Korea, a country with which China now enjoys very good relations and with whose president senior Chinese leaders seem to have a warm personal rapport.Whatever the reasons for this leak it will infuriate North Korea, whose ties with China are already strained. There have been reports of a placard in North Korea's main military academy reading \u201cThe Chinese are traitors and are our enemies\u201d and Chinese attempts to disown the leaked documents are unlikely to persuade North Koreans to change this view. Sadly this leak may well increase the chances that North Korea does go ahead with a fourth nuclear test.The Pentagon recently noted what appear to be the final preparations for a detonation at North Korea's nuclear test site and, sadly, this leak \u2013 which will reinforce North Korea's belief that it is isolated and needs to be strong in a hostile world \u2013 may well increase the chances that North Korea does go ahead with a fourth nuclear test.John Everard was the British ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2008Kyodo\u2019s report about leaked Chinese military documents outlining what to do in the case of a North Korean collapse raises more questions than it answers.In the age of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, readers expect maximum transparency. As a leading news agency, if Kyodo really obtained Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) planning documents for what to do in case of North Korean collapse, they should post them online. Barring that, one would naturally expect their news report to quote extensively from the original documents. To my great disappointment, bordering on disbelief, quotation marks are merited only twice in referring to the plans, and for relatively trivial phrases. However much Kyodo saw of these documents, the next critical question is who showed it to them and why? But the report is frustratingly ambiguous as to how Kyodo learned about the contents of China\u2019s plan. There is one reference to \"Chinese military sources say\u2026\" \u2013 suggesting this was the manner in which the documents were obtained. But this is insinuated rather than explicit. This is an absolutely critical point. If a Chinese military officer (at what level? Acting on what authority?) purposefully leaked information, then the story here is that the PLA \u2013 or certain elements within the PLA \u2013 wants to send a message to Pyongyang. This is a rather indirect means of communication, but not inconceivable as a way to send an ally the unpleasant message that our patience is running thin, so don\u2019t push us too far. The PLA would be reinforcing recent Chinese foreign ministry warnings against North Korea conducting a fourth nuclear test and \u201ccausing turmoil at China\u2019s doorstep\u201d \u2013 but in a way that the foreign ministry can still vociferously deny the existence of such documents. Given the recent demotion of Choe Ryong-hae, who acted as Kim Jong-un\u2019s personal envoy to China last year, and the dramatic execution of previous China envoy Jang Song-taek, such circuitous signalling might also be related to Chinese frustration at the lack of direct channels to Pyongyang. But what if Kyodo\u2019s report is not based on a PLA leak? Then we have to ask where they got what purports to be highly classified information. The most nearby source of course would be Japanese; South Korean or American origin would also be logical, and the purpose would probably be to sow doubt about North Korean stability (even their ally, the Chinese, are preparing for imminent collapse!) and/or destabilise the China-North Korea relationship. The Chinese foreign ministry suggested as much when asked about the Kyodo report. It would be woefully irresponsible of the PLA not to have drafted contingency plans for numerous scenarios on their northeast borderOn the one hand, Beijing\u2019s denial of such plans is hard to believe \u2013 it would be woefully irresponsible of the PLA not to have drafted and periodically revise contingency plans for numerous scenarios on their north-east border (North Korean collapse being just one of those scenarios). On the other hand, the foreign ministry\u2019s contention that the story was planted \"for ulterior motives\" could very well be true.By revealing so little of the supposed documents and obfuscating the facts of their acquisition, the Kyodo report in the end tells us very little about Chinese assessments of North Korea\u2019s stability or its planning process for how to deal with various destabilising scenarios that could occur along their 800 mile border. The sparse details mentioned in the report about setting up refugee camps, dispatching reconnaissance teams, and offering safe haven to exiled North Korean leaders are too vague to be of much edification. Does Kyodo actually have these documents in hand? Did a PLA source leak them as a warning to Pyongyang? Or did a third party disclose a few details from \"documents\" for their own reasons? Without more extensive reporting from Kyodo, there is no way to tell. And until then, there is not much to learn here, except another reminder that just about every catchy North Korea headline should add a warning \u2013 Caution: Contents May Have Shifted During Flight.John Delury is an assistant professor at Yonsei University GSIS and author of Wealth & Power: China's Long March to the Twenty-First Century. Follow on Twitter @johndeluryOne of the things you quickly realise from travelling along the full length of the Chinese border with North Korea is just how much of North Korea there is. China\u2019s boundary stretches along four northern frontier provinces of the DPRK, stretching for hundreds of kilometres along the Yalu and Tumen rivers. Along those tributaries, there are at least five good-sized North Korean cities (Sinuiju, Manpo, Hyesan, Musan, and Hoeryong) which could easily absorb China\u2019s attention during a crisis.Whilst we tend to imagine a wholesale collapse scenario where chaos radiates outward from Pyongyang, we might better examine the possibility of chaos farther from the bright and labyrinthine capital city \u2013 and far closer to China. For instance, we might see a chemical accident in Sinuiju, \u201cterrorism\u201d directed at Kimist monuments in Hyesan, the forcible expropriation of Chinese mining concerns within the DPRK, a nuclear accident or even a volcanic eruption.China is of course planning to handle such problems, but not for the first time.China is of course planning to handle such problems, but not for the first time. Documents in the Chinese Foreign Ministry Archive describe China\u2019s intensive interactions with the DPRK during the last full-scale collapse scenario in 1950. China was able to absorb about 10,000 North Korean refugees on either end of the border, and the DPRK was pressing to set up consulates up and down the frontier so that they could themselves keep track of the outflow. At that time, North Korean military units moved into Chinese territory to escape bombing by US planes \u2013 such as happened in Hyesan.The North Koreans have hardly forgotten the war or China\u2019s massive aid and stationing of troops until 1958, but the recent warming between Seoul and Beijing is clearly troubling; Kim Jong-un\u2019s level of trust in Chinese comrades is as limited as his contact with them. The international community needs to understand that North Korea doesn\u2019t simply fear American nuclear missiles, nuclear submarines, and nuclear-capable bombers; the country\u2019s leadership also is concerned about falling unwillingly into the embrace of its huge northern neighbour.Travels to the frontier region, and conversations with China\u2019s own North Korea experts, help to contextualise that the real struggle along that frontier is likely to be above all economic and cultural. But China does need to be ready for a catastrophe; appearing helpless before its own population in the face of the North Korean equivalent of Fukushima is not a scenario the Chinese Communist Party wants to face.Adam Cathcart is a lecturer in Chinese History at University of Leeds, and Editor-in-Chief of SinoNK.comHow can China not be preparing for the possible collapse of the North Korean regime? Especially now, when things are so different compared to how they were under Kim Jong-il. The Pyongyang power structures have changed so much, and China knows this more than any other country. Kim Jong-un does not have the same level of control as his father did. It is like North Korea is wearing full-frontal Kevlar riot gear, but at the back it is naked. All the world focuses on the Kevlar, and does not seem to see the extreme weakness.I believe that within the next five years we will see major changes in North Korea, and how China responds to this in particular will have great bearing on North Korea\u2019s future. The borders [between the two countries] are already more porous - of course China must prepare for the what the regime\u2019s collapse could bring. In the meantime, the international community should be focussing on the human rights situation within North Korea, and trying to understand the country better.

A report in KCNA at the time said the centre had been built \u201caccording to the noble intention of Kim Jong-un making a new history of industrialisation of mushroom growing\u201d and that it had a \u201cvery important duty\u201d to help turn \u201cDPRK into a huge producer of mushroom\u201d.The report said there is now a \u201cbrisk drive for mushroom production\u201d across North Korea, and the efforts of the institute are anticipated to bring \u201csubstantial benefits to the people\u201d.North Korea has struggled with food production since the famine of the 1990s, which is believed to have killed around one million people. Outdated farming practices, mismanagement, lack of fertilisers and extreme weather have all been blamed for poor food production. Though the situation is believed to be steadily improving, chronic levels of infant malnutrition persist, according the UN.North Koreans receive much of their food through state rations, and can receive food packages as work bonuses and holiday treats. There is also a thriving black market trade in rare or imported foods, such as South Korean Choco Pies. North Korea\u2019s State Academy of Sciences is a sprawling network of institutes dedicated to all manner of state-endorsed research. Other discoveries in the KCNA list of \u201cnew inventions\u201d include the creation of a new substance for \u201cseparating the shuttering from concrete by making use of leftovers from the processing of duck feathers and tanning.\u201d", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Food & drink", "World news"], "title": "North Korea unveils new mushroom sports drink"},{"date": "2014-05-13T12:30:18Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The world\u2019s interest in North Korea dwarfs the amount we really know about the so-called \"hermit kingdom\". With a media hungry for information, reports based on rumours or anonymous sources are not uncommon \u2013 what our partners at NK News call \"an echo-chamber effect\". Open contributions: mythbustersWe have asked you to help us turn this on its head by submitting a myth to be debunked or a burning question you\u2019ve always wanted to ask. Here\u2019s the first round of responses from our expert network.Chad Henshaw was curious about Pyongyang\u2019s metro: I read that the metro only runs between two station for tourists, filled with actors. Are any other stops on the line operational? Does the subway operate all day every day or only at peak times? Every third Tuesday if there is enough power? Is it a viable form of transport for a North Korean?There are all manner of conspiracy theories about the Pyongyang metro: that there are, in reality, only two stations; that it only works when tourists are there; that all the locals there are actors. Despite the claims, the Pyongyang metro is indeed a functional system, running along two bisecting lines in the central and outer-western parts of Pyongyang. The Chollima line runs north to south, the Hyoksin line snakes from west to east.Pyongyang is plagued by power shortages but they are not common on the metro. Tourists sometimes experience them, not on the trains, but on the 100 metre escalators. The metro is cheap \u2013 five won a ride, which is pocket-change even for the poorer of Pyongyang\u2019s residents \u2013 but limited. In the heavily residential area east of the Taedong river there are no stations. It may not cover as many places as the tram and trolley-bus network, but if you need to go anywhere near a station the chances are you\u2019ll use it. Simon Cockerell is the general manager of Koryo Tours , who have been taking tourists to North Korea for 21 years. He has been a regular visitor to Pyongyang since 2002, and has ridden the metro more than 100 timesAlex Fletcher wanted to know more about the Kim family tree: How many siblings does Kim Jong-un have? Some say that he has two brothers and two sisters, others say he has more. Also, how did Kim meet Ri Sol-ju?Kim Jong-un has two siblings and is the middle child. He has an older brother, 33-year old Kim Jong-chol, and and a younger sister, 26-year old Kim Yo-jong. They both work as aides to their brother, although Kim Yo-jong is the more publicly active of the two. They both studied in Switzerland, like their brother, in the 1990s and early 2000s. Kim Jong-un also has four step siblings: three stepsisters and one stepbrother. As to how Kim Jong-un met Ri Sol-ju: Ri\u2019s parents are members of the DPRK\u2019s outer elite and Ri was active as a performer and cheerleader. Matchmaking and arranged marriages are still practiced in the two Koreas and Ri was matched with Kim Jong-un between 2009 and 2010. After Kim Jong-un selected Ri, his aunt Kim Kyong-hui recommended her to his late father, leader Kim Jong-il, who approved the nuptials.Michael Madden of North Korea Leadership Watch, a Guardian network partner focused on politics and people at the heart of the Kim regimeMauricio Fiore and Alan McLemore both asked whether cannabis was legal:  According to Wikipedia cannabis is \"legal or effectively legal\" in North Korea. Reports on Vice and Huffington Post suggest the country is \"a weed-smoker\u2019s paradise\", where the drug is \"smoked freely and its sweet scent often catches your nostrils unannounced\". But, amusing as it may be to some that the brutal regime has taken a progressive stance on drug policy, experts agree that cannabis is rare and most definitely illegal in North Korea.The origin of the myth is a green, potpourri-like mixture of herbs and uncured tobacco leaves called ipdambae (\uc78e\ub2f4\ubc30), translated literally as \"leaf tobacco\". Matthew Reichel who has traveled to North Korea more than 30 times since 2009 as the director of Pyongyang Project, says that bags of this are commonly sold as a cheap alternative to cigarettes at public markets.\u201cIt looks a little bit similar if you haven\u2019t smoked a lot of weed,\u201d Reichel says. \u201cIf you smoke that stuff it\u2019ll smell weird but it won\u2019t get you high.\u201dNorth Korea does cultivate industrial hemp and these plants can be found growing wild in the countryside, but they contain just a fraction of the THC found in regular cannabis. Reichel suggests it\u2019s possible that some farmers have managed to grow their own private stashes (a scenario described by a frequent North Korea visitor in a popular Reddit \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d thread), but the drug would certainly not be smoked in public.Drug offenders in North Korea can be sentenced to death, but Reichel says petty pot possession would not likely lead to an execution or banishment to one the country\u2019s concentration camps, which are mostly reserved for political prisoners.Keegan Hamilton is a freelance journalist in New York reporting on drugs, crime, culture, and many other topics for The Village Voice, The Atlantic, and Vice News.Liam Patrik had a question about leadership: Are the Kims in control of the country? Or are they puppets of the National Defence Commission to give the military a kind of royal veneer that helps support their own control over the Workers' Party and affairs of state?Kim Jong-un and his immediate subordinates control the DPRK. The system is not an obdurate one-man rule, but a balancing of power groups, including the military, government and internal security, all have different interests and policies. Kim is \"the decider\". His late father, Kim Jong-il, dominated DPRK politics for nearly four decades and was the country\u2019s ultimate authority. He ruled, giving the power groups wide scope to formulate policy, but by retaining ultimate control over decision making. He installed a rigid system of cross-checking bureaucracies, surveillance, personnel control and encouraged competition pitting groups against each other for his attention. The National Defence Commission was very much a Kim Jong-iIl production, its members were people he had handpicked. It remains to be seen whether Kim Jong-un will be as effective leader as his father.As for the role of the Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA); there are numerous checks to prevent them from forming a power center to rival the the Supreme Leader. The KPA has never been in a power competition or dominated the Workers\u2019 Party of Korea. It is misrepresented by some analysts as a monolith; but in reality it is made up of factions with different goals and perspectives.Michael Madden, North Korea Leadership Watch Eric had a few questions about the history of the Koreas: What form did Korean government take pre-1948? Under what circumstances did they assume control of North Korea? Was Kim Il-sung a 'freedom fighter' as state propaganda claims? What was his role in the war?It\u2019s probably easiest to take these questions together. The ancient nation of Korea was \u2018temporarily\u2019 partitioned at the arbitrary 38th Parallel in 1945 by the victorious allies, initially so as to take the Japanese surrender. Japan had brutally occupied Korea since 1910; the scars linger still. Partition was a US idea which the USSR accepted.Each power then tried to create a regime in its own image. Until 1948, the South was directly ruled by the US military. The Soviets were more subtle, building up a young unknown called Kim Il-sung: a former, minor anti-Japanese guerrilla in Manchuria, who\u2019d fled to Siberia in 1941. In the early years Moscow pulled all the strings, as analyst Andrei Lankov et al have shown. But as real reforms including land and women\u2019s rights were rolled out, Kim proved himself to be more than a puppet. Historians tend to think Kim bounced an initially doubtful Stalin and Mao into his bid to forcibly reunify Korea, starting the war. He would have succeeded if it had not been for a US-led multinational UN force that helped South Korea. In 1953, Kim\u2019s rival Syngman Rhee \u2013 the first president of South Korea \u2013 refused to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement, he wanted to fight on. South Korea never signed, but Kim went on to build the North Korean regime, now ruled by his grandson. That\u2019s the gist of it. North Korea claims that Kim liberated Korea single-handed and deny that he started the Korean War. It must be said that evaluating the 1945-50 period remains controversial.

We asked a panel of North Korean experts whether they thought the documents were genuine and, if so, what could be concluded from a leak of this sort. One aspect of the leaked Chinese contingency plan is monumental \u2013 if it were true. But it is so implausible it suggests this report must be bogus.We have heard only vague details about the plan. Apparently it envisions a scenario in which North Korea\u2019s government collapses after foreign military forces enter the country. As the Guardian reported: \u201cThe possible causes of upheaval in the North include an attack by an unnamed foreign force that triggers the collapse of the regime, sending civilians and soldiers across the border with China.\u201d The plan then apparently goes on to discuss various Chinese responses, such as setting up refugee camps, detaining North Korean elites, and preventing armed members of the North Korean military from entering China.Take a step back and think about the scenario on which this plan is based. It suggests that if foreign military forces (presumably the United States and South Korea) invaded North Korea, China would not react by coming to the defence of North Korea (as it is obliged to do as Pyongyang\u2019s ally) but would allow the regime to be conquered and/or collapse. Only after this collapse would China act \u2013 not on North Korea\u2019s behalf, but to ensure that instability does not spread into China.If this were true \u2013 that China would not act in defence of North Korea at the time of an invasion \u2013 this is momentous news. But there are two reasons why this makes no senseIf this were true \u2013 that China would not act in defence of North Korea at the time of an invasion \u2013 this is momentous news indeed. But there are two reasons why this makes no sense, thus suggesting that the report is bogus.First, if China did decide to abandon its military alliance with North Korea, it would not announce this through a leak in this odd way. Putting aside whether or not China might actually do this (which is a whole other issue), the way in which Beijing would go about this momentous policy change would be to convey it very privately to US and South Korean leaders.Secondly, the United States and South Korea have long urged China to pressure the North Korean government, to punish or deter it from engaging in destabilising behaviour (missile and nuclear tests, the use of force, and so forth). A Chinese abrogation of its alliance with North Korea would be quite welcome news to those countries \u2013 and thus presumably Beijing would never do it without negotiating significant concessions from Seoul and Washington.China would never, in other words, give this away for free. Thus the sheer improbability of what would constitute a truly monumental policy change \u2013 let alone the way the change was communicated \u2013 casts doubt on the veracity of the leaked report.Here\u2019s what we know for sure. North Korea has limped by despite its poverty and weakness, and may continue to do so for decades to come. Or it might collapse next week.Here\u2019s what we know for sure. North Korea has limped by despite its poverty and weakness, and may continue to do so for decades to come. Or it might collapse next week. If the government does collapse, the Korean peninsula could erupt in a humanitarian, political and military crisis that threatens the broader stability of East Asia.Bruce W Bennett, of the thinktank Rand, and I modelled the military missions that countries might perform in the event of North Korean collapse. We calculated that stabilising the peninsula could require hundreds of thousands of troops. Drawing up contingency plans (as the United States, South Korea and, yes, also China have all been doing) is therefore vital. But even more importantly, those countries need to have a dialogue about this contingency, to mitigate the dangers that it might create in East Asian international relations.Jennifer Lind is an associate professor of government at Dartmouth College and the author of Sorry States: Apologies in International Politics (Cornell University Press, 2008). Follow on Twitter @profLindThe leaked news that Beijing has drawn up significant contingency plans in the event of a regime collapse in North Korea (DPRK) reflects just how little Kim Jong-un has managed to reassure the Chinese authorities that he is securely in power. Clearly China believes his hold on power to be fragile.We\u2019ve been here before. Ramping up of contingency plans for a crisis on China\u2019s border with the DPRK has occurred previously when Beijing\u2019s analysts have felt collapse may be imminent. In 2003, in the wake of a failed economic reform programme, initiated by Kim Jong-il, and a growing nuclear crisis, a large contingent of People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) troops were moved into the border region of Yanbian in China\u2019s south-eastern Jilin Province. High voltage fences were erected along portions of the rather porous border to prevent an escalation in defections across the Yalu River.Clearly China believes Kim Jong-un's hold on power to be fragile.China\u2019s plans come hot on the heels of a flurry of renewed interest in the North from Seoul and are, in part, probably a reaction to it. The South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, Beijing clearly worries about a massive influx of refugees and an ousted Kim3 trying to re-establish his power base from Chinese soil; Seoul knows it would face a humanitarian disaster that would cost multiples of German reunification and perilously threaten the South\u2019s economy.The presence of 30,000 or so American GIs in the South moving up to China\u2019s borders obviously alarms the PLA, while Seoul wonders what it would do with the DPRK\u2019s 1.2m-man army and the possibility of \u201clast ditch\u201d attacks on its territory.The fact is though that now is a time to plan for collapse.The fact is, though, that now is a time to plan for collapse. Kim Jong-un has not achieved the status of his father and grandfather as yet. His purging of senior cadres has led to nervousness among the higher echelons of power in Pyongyang and not consolidation. His half-hearted economic reforms (the so-called \u201c6.28 Policy\u201d of handing more control to agricultural co-operatives and a \u201cQuality of Life\u201d initiative to more widely distribute consumer goods) have both failed. The North remains mired in poverty, food insecurity and with an uncertain leadership.That China should be heightening its preparations for a collapse across the Yalu, and directly warning the North to avoid \"chaos\", is important. It reveals that Beijing believes the economic and political situation to be worsening and that elements on the North\u2019s ruling Korean Workers\u2019 Party that have been urging more wholesale economic reform (known loosely in Beijing as the Chrysanthemum Group) are distinctly on the back foot, if not now almost wholly purged. It also indicates that Beijing now believes that any return to the economic reform programme of 2002, instigated by Kim Jong-il, is now off the cards. Those reforms, which ultimately failed, did include the seeds of a Chinese style \"reform and opening up\" policy but went nowhere near far enough. Kim Jong-un has little to offer in the way of policy except more of the same \"Arduous march\u201d North Koreans have had to endure since 1993.Paul French is the author of North Korea: State of Paranoia, published by Zed Books. Follow on Twitter @StateofParanoiaThis leak of documents outlining how the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) would respond to a collapse in North Korea does not necessarily mean that China thinks that such a collapse is now more likely. It is more probable that the leak's timing was determined by internal Chinese debates. In late 2013, China was showing signs of greater openness in discussing what to do if North Korea collapsed. But in early spring 2014 this changed, and Chinese officials have since then been very reluctant to discuss the possibility that North Korea might collapse, let alone contingencies for such an event. (Perhaps this was because of rising tensions with Japan and a consequent Chinese reluctance to risk irritating North Korea, its only ally, by discussing that country's possible demise).Whatever the reasons for this leak it will infuriate North Korea, whose ties with China are already strained.This change must have been very frustrating to the PLA, who would have to deal in the first instance with the fallout of any North Korean collapse, and who therefore need clear direction from the civilian political leadership on what they should do. So perhaps the PLA leaked these documents so as to force the civilian leadership into a proper debate on these difficult issues. (The sharp response to the leak by the Chinese ministry of foreign affairs, which has no love for the PLA, supports this view. Its Asia directorate has been strongly against allowing even an internal debate on a North Korean collapse, let alone a discussion with foreigners).I suspect that the PLA's move will be welcomed in both Washington and Seoul, both of whom have been pressing the Chinese to share thoughts on contingencies so as to avoid possibly dangerous misunderstandings in the inevitable confusion of such a collapse.The document is significant too for what it does not say. On several occasions South Korea has worried aloud that, should North Korea collapse, Chinese troops might enter North Korea to maintain stability there. As far as I can tell without seeing the full document (which has not been published), these plans envisage no such move. It is possible therefore that the PLA leaked them in part so as to reassure South Korea, a country with which China now enjoys very good relations and with whose president senior Chinese leaders seem to have a warm personal rapport.Whatever the reasons for this leak it will infuriate North Korea, whose ties with China are already strained. There have been reports of a placard in North Korea's main military academy reading \u201cThe Chinese are traitors and are our enemies\u201d and Chinese attempts to disown the leaked documents are unlikely to persuade North Koreans to change this view. Sadly this leak may well increase the chances that North Korea does go ahead with a fourth nuclear test.The Pentagon recently noted what appear to be the final preparations for a detonation at North Korea's nuclear test site and, sadly, this leak \u2013 which will reinforce North Korea's belief that it is isolated and needs to be strong in a hostile world \u2013 may well increase the chances that North Korea does go ahead with a fourth nuclear test.John Everard was the British ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2008Kyodo\u2019s report about leaked Chinese military documents outlining what to do in the case of a North Korean collapse raises more questions than it answers.In the age of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, readers expect maximum transparency. As a leading news agency, if Kyodo really obtained Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) planning documents for what to do in case of North Korean collapse, they should post them online. Barring that, one would naturally expect their news report to quote extensively from the original documents. To my great disappointment, bordering on disbelief, quotation marks are merited only twice in referring to the plans, and for relatively trivial phrases. However much Kyodo saw of these documents, the next critical question is who showed it to them and why? But the report is frustratingly ambiguous as to how Kyodo learned about the contents of China\u2019s plan. There is one reference to \"Chinese military sources say\u2026\" \u2013 suggesting this was the manner in which the documents were obtained. But this is insinuated rather than explicit. This is an absolutely critical point. If a Chinese military officer (at what level? Acting on what authority?) purposefully leaked information, then the story here is that the PLA \u2013 or certain elements within the PLA \u2013 wants to send a message to Pyongyang. This is a rather indirect means of communication, but not inconceivable as a way to send an ally the unpleasant message that our patience is running thin, so don\u2019t push us too far. The PLA would be reinforcing recent Chinese foreign ministry warnings against North Korea conducting a fourth nuclear test and \u201ccausing turmoil at China\u2019s doorstep\u201d \u2013 but in a way that the foreign ministry can still vociferously deny the existence of such documents. Given the recent demotion of Choe Ryong-hae, who acted as Kim Jong-un\u2019s personal envoy to China last year, and the dramatic execution of previous China envoy Jang Song-taek, such circuitous signalling might also be related to Chinese frustration at the lack of direct channels to Pyongyang. But what if Kyodo\u2019s report is not based on a PLA leak? Then we have to ask where they got what purports to be highly classified information. The most nearby source of course would be Japanese; South Korean or American origin would also be logical, and the purpose would probably be to sow doubt about North Korean stability (even their ally, the Chinese, are preparing for imminent collapse!) and/or destabilise the China-North Korea relationship. The Chinese foreign ministry suggested as much when asked about the Kyodo report. It would be woefully irresponsible of the PLA not to have drafted contingency plans for numerous scenarios on their northeast borderOn the one hand, Beijing\u2019s denial of such plans is hard to believe \u2013 it would be woefully irresponsible of the PLA not to have drafted and periodically revise contingency plans for numerous scenarios on their north-east border (North Korean collapse being just one of those scenarios). On the other hand, the foreign ministry\u2019s contention that the story was planted \"for ulterior motives\" could very well be true.By revealing so little of the supposed documents and obfuscating the facts of their acquisition, the Kyodo report in the end tells us very little about Chinese assessments of North Korea\u2019s stability or its planning process for how to deal with various destabilising scenarios that could occur along their 800 mile border. The sparse details mentioned in the report about setting up refugee camps, dispatching reconnaissance teams, and offering safe haven to exiled North Korean leaders are too vague to be of much edification. Does Kyodo actually have these documents in hand? Did a PLA source leak them as a warning to Pyongyang? Or did a third party disclose a few details from \"documents\" for their own reasons? Without more extensive reporting from Kyodo, there is no way to tell. And until then, there is not much to learn here, except another reminder that just about every catchy North Korea headline should add a warning \u2013 Caution: Contents May Have Shifted During Flight.John Delury is an assistant professor at Yonsei University GSIS and author of Wealth & Power: China's Long March to the Twenty-First Century. Follow on Twitter @johndeluryOne of the things you quickly realise from travelling along the full length of the Chinese border with North Korea is just how much of North Korea there is. China\u2019s boundary stretches along four northern frontier provinces of the DPRK, stretching for hundreds of kilometres along the Yalu and Tumen rivers. Along those tributaries, there are at least five good-sized North Korean cities (Sinuiju, Manpo, Hyesan, Musan, and Hoeryong) which could easily absorb China\u2019s attention during a crisis.Whilst we tend to imagine a wholesale collapse scenario where chaos radiates outward from Pyongyang, we might better examine the possibility of chaos farther from the bright and labyrinthine capital city \u2013 and far closer to China. For instance, we might see a chemical accident in Sinuiju, \u201cterrorism\u201d directed at Kimist monuments in Hyesan, the forcible expropriation of Chinese mining concerns within the DPRK, a nuclear accident or even a volcanic eruption.China is of course planning to handle such problems, but not for the first time.China is of course planning to handle such problems, but not for the first time. Documents in the Chinese Foreign Ministry Archive describe China\u2019s intensive interactions with the DPRK during the last full-scale collapse scenario in 1950. China was able to absorb about 10,000 North Korean refugees on either end of the border, and the DPRK was pressing to set up consulates up and down the frontier so that they could themselves keep track of the outflow. At that time, North Korean military units moved into Chinese territory to escape bombing by US planes \u2013 such as happened in Hyesan.The North Koreans have hardly forgotten the war or China\u2019s massive aid and stationing of troops until 1958, but the recent warming between Seoul and Beijing is clearly troubling; Kim Jong-un\u2019s level of trust in Chinese comrades is as limited as his contact with them. The international community needs to understand that North Korea doesn\u2019t simply fear American nuclear missiles, nuclear submarines, and nuclear-capable bombers; the country\u2019s leadership also is concerned about falling unwillingly into the embrace of its huge northern neighbour.Travels to the frontier region, and conversations with China\u2019s own North Korea experts, help to contextualise that the real struggle along that frontier is likely to be above all economic and cultural. But China does need to be ready for a catastrophe; appearing helpless before its own population in the face of the North Korean equivalent of Fukushima is not a scenario the Chinese Communist Party wants to face.Adam Cathcart is a lecturer in Chinese History at University of Leeds, and Editor-in-Chief of SinoNK.comHow can China not be preparing for the possible collapse of the North Korean regime? Especially now, when things are so different compared to how they were under Kim Jong-il. The Pyongyang power structures have changed so much, and China knows this more than any other country. Kim Jong-un does not have the same level of control as his father did. It is like North Korea is wearing full-frontal Kevlar riot gear, but at the back it is naked. All the world focuses on the Kevlar, and does not seem to see the extreme weakness.I believe that within the next five years we will see major changes in North Korea, and how China responds to this in particular will have great bearing on North Korea\u2019s future. The borders [between the two countries] are already more porous - of course China must prepare for the what the regime\u2019s collapse could bring. In the meantime, the international community should be focussing on the human rights situation within North Korea, and trying to understand the country better.

Neither has Beijing withdrawn its extensive economic assistance or political support for North Korea.Even in the aftermath of North Korea\u2019s 2010 shelling of South Korean islands, Beijing protected North Korea from international condemnation of those actions at the United Nations.No doubt, Xi\u2019s Seoul visit is a powerful expression of his displeasure with North Korea\u2019s direction under Kim Jong-un, but despite Beijing\u2019s symbolic chastening of Pyongyang and stories that China has cut its export of oil to North Korea, China still places maintenance of North Korea\u2019s stability as a top priority.South Korean efforts to gain China\u2019s understanding for a South Korean-led reunification of the Korean peninsula and Park\u2019s desire to warm up relations with Beijing may be understandable, but China may not be swayed by Seoul\u2019s logic on Korean reunification as long as South Korea\u2019s alliance with the United States remains central to South Korea.China may not be swayed by Seoul\u2019s logic on Korean reunification as long as South Korea\u2019s alliance with the United States remains central to South KoreaChina wants a reunified Korea to be friendly to Beijing, has explicitly stated its distrust of US alliances and its view that the US-Korea alliance would have no utility in the absence of a North Korean threat, and probably believes that its growing economic importance to South Korea will eventually provide it with the leverage necessary to marginalise the US security role on the peninsula.At present, Chinese and South Korean political and strategic differences on these issues impose real limits on the improvement of political relations between China and South Korea, despite a bilateral trade relationship of over $220 billion in 2013 and notwithstanding the current honeymoon in Sino-ROK relations under Xi and Park. Beijing probably believes that time and the forces of economic interdependence are on its side.The more difficult near-term questions for Xi may come after Seoul, when he may return to the more difficult task of determining how to more effectively deal with Pyongyang.Scott Snyder is senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Follow him on Twitter @snydersasFor all the international frisson which is being generated around Xi Jinping\u2019s preference for travelling to Seoul over Pyongyang, there is one large demographic that seems unlikely to know or care anything about it: the North Korean people.For the 23 million people trapped within the otherworldly bubble of DPRK state media, the current news cycle is far more fixated on the revolutionary repertoire of an obscure Russian wind band than the itinerary of China\u2019s head of state. To the extent that they might be discussed at all outside of North Korean elite circles, Xi Jinping\u2019s diplomatic goals in the South Korean capital do not perturb the North Korean regime in the least.Nevertheless, ire must be displayed for the proper audiences. And, since well over 80% of its non-peninsular trade is with China, the North Korean state has to resort to indirect insults. One article referred to withstanding the \u201cpressure of the great power chauvinists.\u201d Another article in the Party newspaper called Park Geun-hye\u2019s goal of denuclearisation (a goal very much shared by Xi Jinping) a \u201cdog\u2019s dream.\u201dMeanwhile, Kim Jong-un demonstrates an almost Rabelasian appetite for, and delight in, watching missile launches. China has seen far worse, however, and the Chinese Communist Party continues to build up its northeastern frontier with the Korean peninsula. The Party Secretary for Jilin province was recently on the Sino-North Korean border, talking in Xi-inflected language about \"accelerating the interconnection of Northeast Asian transportation routes\u201d via new high-speed trains, and making the borderlands safe and prosperous.Trade with North Korea continues, even as reports emerge of problems with oil exports, deadly accidents and a total cessation of construction on two islands leased to China. Perfectly-timed defector narratives recently asserted that a letter to Chinese leaders helped to seal the death sentence for Kim Jong-un\u2019s very uncle this past December.The People\u2019s Republic of China has had diplomatic relations with Seoul since 1992, but its business ties to South Korea date back another decade. And South Korean business leaders are meeting with Xi in force on 4 July, investing heavily in Northeast China and gambling on the long-term prospect of gaining access to the minerals and manpower north of the 38th parallel. China's greatest leverage with Pyongyang is geographical, and Chinese dynasties have made a pattern of allying with southern Korean kingdoms to extinguish disrespectful foes in the north. As Xi Jinping cosies up to South Korean capitalists and dreams his canine dream of a nuclear-free peninsula, the North Korean leadership might keep that in mind.Adam Cathcart is a lecturer in Chinese History at University of Leeds, and Editor-in-Chief of SinoNK.com. Follow him on Twitter @adamcathcartI think the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping has decided to go to Seoul prior to visiting Pyongyang, and instead of having Kim Jong-un visit Beijing, reflects both growing frustration on the part of the Chinese leadership with North Korea\u2019s young General, as well as a growing level of distrust toward the North Korean regime.I\u2019m told by Chinese security specialists that Pyongyang has been pushing hard for a Kim visit to China and that Beijing has been reluctant since it fears that a Kim Jong-un visit to Beijing might be followed shortly after his return home by another North Korean nuclear test, thus implying (falsely) that Beijing had given Kim a green light. The same logic would apply regarding a Xi visit to Pyongyang. This highlights the growing mistrust between the two nations, especially following Jang Song-thaek\u2019s execution.Clearly both President Xi and South Korean President Park Guen-hye see the visit as a way to pressure Pyongyang to be more forthcoming and to act more responsibly. It also has the added \u201cbenefit\u201d (from a PRC and ROK perspective; certainly not from a US perspective) of contrasting the increasingly close ties between Beijing in Seoul with the continued frosty relations both currently have with Tokyo. The visit also contrasts the increasingly close ties between Beijing and Seoul, with the frosty relations both currently have with TokyoWhile Xi and Park may hope their second summit (the first was held last year) will have a sobering effect on Kim Jong-un, it is more likely to have the opposite effect. The North seems to still believe, based on logic that is clear only to those residing in Pyongyang, that China needs the North more than it needs China, and that while China will send signals of its annoyance from time to time, at the end of the day it will not pull the plug and take Pyongyang off of life support; any pain Pyongyang may experience will be temporary.As a result, the North is more likely to take steps that appear to up the ante since history has told them that the more confrontational Pyongyang appears, the more likely Beijing (and Washington and Seoul) will be to eventually reward them not for good behaviour but merely for the absence of bad behaviour.Pyongyang also appears to be attempting some sort of crude quid pro quo by all of a sudden cooperating with Tokyo on the abductees issue, even though this is likely to once again provide disappointing to Japan.Ralph Cossa is president of the Asia Forum at the the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Beijing probably believes that time and the forces of economic interdependence are on its side.The more difficult near-term questions for Xi may come after Seoul, when he may return to the more difficult task of determining how to more effectively deal with Pyongyang.Scott Snyder is senior fellow for Korea studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Follow him on Twitter @snydersasFor all the international frisson which is being generated around Xi Jinping\u2019s preference for travelling to Seoul over Pyongyang, there is one large demographic that seems unlikely to know or care anything about it: the North Korean people.For the 23 million people trapped within the otherworldly bubble of DPRK state media, the current news cycle is far more fixated on the revolutionary repertoire of an obscure Russian wind band than the itinerary of China\u2019s head of state. To the extent that they might be discussed at all outside of North Korean elite circles, Xi Jinping\u2019s diplomatic goals in the South Korean capital do not perturb the North Korean regime in the least.Nevertheless, ire must be displayed for the proper audiences. And, since well over 80% of its non-peninsular trade is with China, the North Korean state has to resort to indirect insults. One article referred to withstanding the \u201cpressure of the great power chauvinists.\u201d Another article in the Party newspaper called Park Geun-hye\u2019s goal of denuclearisation (a goal very much shared by Xi Jinping) a \u201cdog\u2019s dream.\u201dMeanwhile, Kim Jong-un demonstrates an almost Rabelasian appetite for, and delight in, watching missile launches. China has seen far worse, however, and the Chinese Communist Party continues to build up its northeastern frontier with the Korean peninsula. The Party Secretary for Jilin province was recently on the Sino-North Korean border, talking in Xi-inflected language about \"accelerating the interconnection of Northeast Asian transportation routes\u201d via new high-speed trains, and making the borderlands safe and prosperous.Trade with North Korea continues, even as reports emerge of problems with oil exports, deadly accidents and a total cessation of construction on two islands leased to China. Perfectly-timed defector narratives recently asserted that a letter to Chinese leaders helped to seal the death sentence for Kim Jong-un\u2019s very uncle this past December.The People\u2019s Republic of China has had diplomatic relations with Seoul since 1992, but its business ties to South Korea date back another decade. And South Korean business leaders are meeting with Xi in force on 4 July, investing heavily in Northeast China and gambling on the long-term prospect of gaining access to the minerals and manpower north of the 38th parallel. China's greatest leverage with Pyongyang is geographical, and Chinese dynasties have made a pattern of allying with southern Korean kingdoms to extinguish disrespectful foes in the north. As Xi Jinping cosies up to South Korean capitalists and dreams his canine dream of a nuclear-free peninsula, the North Korean leadership might keep that in mind.Adam Cathcart is a lecturer in Chinese History at University of Leeds, and Editor-in-Chief of SinoNK.com. Follow him on Twitter @adamcathcartI think the fact that Chinese President Xi Jinping has decided to go to Seoul prior to visiting Pyongyang, and instead of having Kim Jong-un visit Beijing, reflects both growing frustration on the part of the Chinese leadership with North Korea\u2019s young General, as well as a growing level of distrust toward the North Korean regime.I\u2019m told by Chinese security specialists that Pyongyang has been pushing hard for a Kim visit to China and that Beijing has been reluctant since it fears that a Kim Jong-un visit to Beijing might be followed shortly after his return home by another North Korean nuclear test, thus implying (falsely) that Beijing had given Kim a green light. The same logic would apply regarding a Xi visit to Pyongyang. This highlights the growing mistrust between the two nations, especially following Jang Song-thaek\u2019s execution.Clearly both President Xi and South Korean President Park Guen-hye see the visit as a way to pressure Pyongyang to be more forthcoming and to act more responsibly. It also has the added \u201cbenefit\u201d (from a PRC and ROK perspective; certainly not from a US perspective) of contrasting the increasingly close ties between Beijing in Seoul with the continued frosty relations both currently have with Tokyo. The visit also contrasts the increasingly close ties between Beijing and Seoul, with the frosty relations both currently have with TokyoWhile Xi and Park may hope their second summit (the first was held last year) will have a sobering effect on Kim Jong-un, it is more likely to have the opposite effect. The North seems to still believe, based on logic that is clear only to those residing in Pyongyang, that China needs the North more than it needs China, and that while China will send signals of its annoyance from time to time, at the end of the day it will not pull the plug and take Pyongyang off of life support; any pain Pyongyang may experience will be temporary.As a result, the North is more likely to take steps that appear to up the ante since history has told them that the more confrontational Pyongyang appears, the more likely Beijing (and Washington and Seoul) will be to eventually reward them not for good behaviour but merely for the absence of bad behaviour.Pyongyang also appears to be attempting some sort of crude quid pro quo by all of a sudden cooperating with Tokyo on the abductees issue, even though this is likely to once again provide disappointing to Japan.Ralph Cossa is president of the Asia Forum at the the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Earlier this month a throwdown, organised by a Japanese wrestler-turned-MP, saw North Koreans wrestlers line up against an international competitors in front of dozens of reporters, tourists and celebrity guests. In 1995 Collision in Korea was the largest pay-per-view event in the history of pro-wrestling. It attracted a crowd of 340,000 people and was described by one of the news anchors at \u201cwrestling and diplomacy at it\u2019s best.\u201dCritics have previously dismissed the Kim Jong-un-Dennis Rodman relationship as ego-driven, dysfunctional and damaging for diplomatic relations. He has skirted around the human rights issue during his previous trips, and got himself tangled up in the case of Kenneth Bae \u2013 the American serving 15 years hard labour in North Korea for crimes against the state.If the claim comes good, it will be the fifth big trip for Rodman to the country in just under two years. We take a look back at his most prolific visits, what he said and how the world reacted. Rodman makes headlines by arriving in North Korea with a group of players for the Harlem Globetrotters and a Vice film crew for some self-styled \u201cbasketball diplomacy\u201d.Rodman and Kim watch basketball together and the visiting entourage was reportedly treated to alcoholic drinks provided by the leader. Rodman tells Kim \u201cyou have a friend for life\u201d.The trip took place amid continued hostility between the US government and North Korea. An official statement from the White House said that it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for North Korea to have spent money on such a big spectacle when people were being starved and denied their human rights. When asked about the trip secretary of state John Kerry said: \u201cYou know what? Dennis Rodman was a great basketball player, and as a diplomat, he was a great basketball player. And that\u2019s where we\u2019ll leave it\u201d.Whilst Rodman is there he also makes internet history becoming one of the first to tweet from the country on a 3G network newly opened for foreign tourists, using the hashtag #WORMinNorthKorea (Worm being his nickname from his basketball playing days).It's true, I'm in North Korea. Looking forward to sitting down with Kim Jung Un. I love the people of North Korea. #WORMinNorthKoreaA few months later Rodman was back again but this time it was a more low-key affair. \u201cThe Marshal Kim and I had a relaxing time by the sea with his family\u201d said Rodman, before accidently announcing to the world the name of Kim\u2019s daughter: Ju-ae.Leaving Vice behind (the regime wasn\u2019t happy about the negative coverage from his last visit, according to Buzzfeed), Rodman finds new facilitators led by Michael P Spavor, a consultant specialising in sports and cultural exchanges with the DPRK. Spavor\u2019s website features him enjoying a few laughs with Kim Jong-un, and he describes September\u2019s trip as \u201ca blast\u201d.Squeezing in a last trip in 2013 Rodman arrived back in North Korea in December for a sponsored trip to help train the North Korean basketball team in preparation for the leader\u2019s birthday.Rodman\u2019s team arrive shortly after the dramatic, highly publicised execution of Kim\u2019s uncle Jang Song-thaek: thought to be a strong message from the regime about the importance of absolute loyalty.Ahead of the trip, Rodman says he does not intend raise the issue with the leader because he doesn\u2019t want to exploit his friendship for political reasons, but then refuses to say whether the pair even met up on his return. Shortly after, the sponsors, Paddy Power, pull out in \u201creaction to the worldwide focus and total condemnation of the North Korean regime over recent events\u201d.In January, Rodman is back \u2013 again \u2013 with a team of NBA players to perform an exhibition game, a birthday present to Kim Jong-un. Not content with the basketball spectacle, Rodman takes to centre court to sing a quick happy birthday is hushed tones in front of the crowds applauding uniformly. This time it\u2019s the NBA who speak out against the Rodman show, arguing that \u201cbirthday parties for dictators that torture and kill\u201d should not be thought of as sports diplomacy.Rodman also found himself again embroiled in controversy around American prisoner Kenneth Bae, whose detention is a tense sticking point between US and North Korea. In May 2013 he had tweeted that he would ask his friend Kim to \u201cdo me solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose\u201d. In September, he backtracked, saying it was the job of then-US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and president Barack Obama to sort it out.After the January trip he was questioned again about Bae, and attempted to blame Bae and his actions in North Korea for his detention. Bae\u2019s sister condemned Rodman saying: \u201cThis isn\u2019t some game.

Cinema expert Simon Fowler has selected the best five films for the North Korean Network, from the \u201cimmortal classic\u201d the Flower Girl, made in 1972 to the Marathon Runner, from 2002, based around the real story of Jong Song-ok the athletics champion.

The Hong Kong NK Human Rights Film Festival, now in its second year, is organised by North Korean Defectors Concern and Amnesty International to address human rights abuses and the plight of defectors.With the aforementioned film festivals coming up we want to ask: what is the film about North Korea you\u2019d most like to see? Imagine a scenario where money is no object, nor is access to the country. What would it be called? Who would it star and where would it be set? Would you address human rights?

Spavor\u2019s website features him enjoying a few laughs with Kim Jong-un, and he describes September\u2019s trip as \u201ca blast\u201d.Squeezing in a last trip in 2013 Rodman arrived back in North Korea in December for a sponsored trip to help train the North Korean basketball team in preparation for the leader\u2019s birthday.Rodman\u2019s team arrive shortly after the dramatic, highly publicised execution of Kim\u2019s uncle Jang Song-thaek: thought to be a strong message from the regime about the importance of absolute loyalty.Ahead of the trip, Rodman says he does not intend raise the issue with the leader because he doesn\u2019t want to exploit his friendship for political reasons, but then refuses to say whether the pair even met up on his return. Shortly after, the sponsors, Paddy Power, pull out in \u201creaction to the worldwide focus and total condemnation of the North Korean regime over recent events\u201d.In January, Rodman is back \u2013 again \u2013 with a team of NBA players to perform an exhibition game, a birthday present to Kim Jong-un. Not content with the basketball spectacle, Rodman takes to centre court to sing a quick happy birthday is hushed tones in front of the crowds applauding uniformly. This time it\u2019s the NBA who speak out against the Rodman show, arguing that \u201cbirthday parties for dictators that torture and kill\u201d should not be thought of as sports diplomacy.Rodman also found himself again embroiled in controversy around American prisoner Kenneth Bae, whose detention is a tense sticking point between US and North Korea. In May 2013 he had tweeted that he would ask his friend Kim to \u201cdo me solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose\u201d. In September, he backtracked, saying it was the job of then-US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and president Barack Obama to sort it out.After the January trip he was questioned again about Bae, and attempted to blame Bae and his actions in North Korea for his detention. Bae\u2019s sister condemned Rodman saying: \u201cThis isn\u2019t some game. This is about a person\u2019s life \u2013 father of three, a son and a brother and a husband.\u201d", "tags": ["North Korea", "Dennis Rodman", "Asia Pacific", "Basketball"], "title": "Dennis Rodman to go back to North Korea \u2013 again"},{"date": "2014-09-27T01:00:37Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Hopes for an imminent resolution to North Korea\u2019s abductions of Japanese citizens during the Cold War have dimmed after Pyongyang failed to produce a promised report on its initial investigation into the missing people.Having agreed to pass on their findings by the end of this month, North Korean authorities have said that the probe could last up to a year, sparking anger in Tokyo.Establishing the whereabouts of a dozen Japanese citizens snatched in the 1970s and 80s and taken to North Korea to teach their language and customs to communist agents is an emotive topic in Japan, where it is considered more important than Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programme.Five of 17 people on Tokyo\u2019s official missing list were allowed to return home with their families in 2002, but Japan has refused to believe North Korean claims that it had abducted only 13 people, and that the remaining eight had died.Japan will demand an explanation for the delay when officials from both sides meet in Shenyang, China, on Monday.\u201cWhat will result from the meeting? I\u2019m not in a position to say\u2026 I can\u2019t speak in detail about Japan\u2019s expectations at this time,\u201d Eriko Yamatani, Japan\u2019s state minister in charge of the abduction issue, told reporters on Thursday.\u201cThe way North Korea deals with this will affect not just the abductions\u2026 it is an important test of how serious it is about addressing its human rights abuses.\u201dThe cause of the delay isn\u2019t clear, but there have been suggestions that Pyongyang is unhappy with the way Japanese media have portrayed the abductions as a human rights issue, and that it hopes to win further concessions with each new piece of information.Despite the delay, Professor Hajime Izumi, director of the Center for Korean Studies at Shizuoka University, said he was confident North Korea would present an initial report on its investigation, possibly by the end of next month.\u201cThis will proceed on the basis of a comprehensive plan of action,\u201d Izumi said. \u201cIf North Korea does something, then Japan will be expected to do something in return.\u201d Izumi believes North Korea could be holding out for the early resumption of a ferry service between the two countries \u2013 one of several conciliatory measures announced by Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in July after Pyongyang agreed to reopen its investigation into the abductions.The Mangyongbong-92, which once sailed regularly between Wonsan and Niigata, has not made the journey since sanctions were imposed in 2006.By delaying the process, North Korea may try to use it as a diplomatic card to get further concessions from Tokyo\u201cNorth Korea would probably want that to be first to happen, but in Japan the Mangyongbong has great symbolic value. It may have been involved in the abductions, so here it is still seen a something evil.\u201dIn light of the breakdown of multiparty talks on North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme and the introduction of tough UN sanctions following its nuclear and missile tests, Abe appeared to be taking a gamble with the offer to ease Tokyo\u2019s punitive measures against the regime.Some analysts, however, say the current impasse probably won\u2019t damage Japan\u2019s leader, who has made resolving the abductions a priority of his political career.\u201cBy delaying the process, North Korea may try to use it as a diplomatic card to get further concessions from Tokyo,\u201d said Tetsuo Kotani, a fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs in Tokyo. \u201cOr North Korea needed to delay it because it knows it cannot meet Tokyo\u2019s high expectations. \u201cBy lifting the economic sanctions, Abe showed his pragmatic side. Because he had always been tough on the abduction issue, he could show some flexibility. Even if North Korea does not meet his expectations this time, it won\u2019t harm Abe\u2019s political foundations, because North Korea will be to blame.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Human rights"], "title": "Anger in Tokyo after North Korea delays report on abductions"},{"date": "2014-12-23T10:01:18Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "In the ongoing debacle about The Interview \u2013 a film in which Seth Rogen is sent to assassinate Kim Jong-un \u2013 North Korea has taken aim at the United States.

The White House and the Department of State declined to comment.US tech companies monitoring the North Korean web network, which has only about 1,000 web addresses and is accessible only to a handful of elite officials, said it appeared to have suffered a concerted denial-of-service attack, in which a target\u2019s internet equipment is overwhelmed by spurious traffic.Websites such as those of the official Korean Central News Agency and the Rodong Sinmun newspaper went down during the outage.

For two months, hackers unleashed a wave of digital assaults that crippled government and corporate sites. Estonia traced the attacks to groups in Russia, and suggested that they had been activated by the Kremlin. Russian officials denied it. Estonia went on to host a special Nato centre for cyber defence and research. Later, a group of international experts produced a document called the Tallinn manual on international law applicable to cyberwarfare. This text attempts to look at how cyber operations can cross certain threshholds in the realm of international security, and how states can respond. A lot of the discussion revolves around whether a cyber assaultfalls into the category of an armed attack. There are no clear-cut answers. It seems this debate will continue to unfold on a case-by-case basis.The targeting of Estonia was not to do with a movie that might have displeased Russia, but with a decision made by Estonian officials to dislodge a Soviet second world war monument in Tallinn. This sparked rioting among Estonia\u2019s ethnic Russian minority and a furore among Russian-based nationalist groups such as the youth organisation Nashi, which later claimed responsibility for the cyber campaign \u2013 although proof of this was never produced.The parallels between the Estonian episode and the Sony hacking are striking. Just as North Korea now stands accused of trying to censor a movie in the US through cyberthreats, Russia came under criticism for trying to blackmail a neighbouring state into preserving a remnant of Soviet historiography on its territory. It is no surprise the Estonian president feels strongly about the attack on Sony, and its wider meaning in terms of freedom of expression and state sovereignty.The attack on Estonia was in a way more foreboding than the strike on Sony, because it temporarily paralysed the very functioning of some state institutions. In Sony\u2019s case, however, there was obviously more at stake than just a private company\u2019s wellbeing. Hollywood, a whole industry that many\u00a0in the world can associate with American soft power or influence, found\u00a0itself under threat.Cyber vandals play on the notion of plausible deniability. Their aim is to inflict damage or force their adversary to retreat without openly claiming responsibility for any attack. This strategy basically follows what the Chinese warrior-philosopher Sun Tzu described as the supreme art of war: \u201cto subdue the enemy without fighting\u201d. The withdrawal of the movie was a clear victory for the hackers and their intimidation.Just as North Korea denies any responsibility over Sony, Russia has spent most of the past year denying any\u00a0direct role in the armed insurgencies in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has acted through proxies and stealth military action, just as North Korea relied on an army of hackers that was difficult to trace. This is a new era of hybrid warfare and deniable attacks. So\u00a0perhaps it wasn\u2019t a big surprise to see, in the middle of the Sony hacking scandal, Vladimir Putin suddenly inviting the North Korea leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Russia.If they meet, they will surely have an interesting conversation, comparing notes on how their strategy unfolded and how the outside world responded.

Georgia provides 90% of Armenia\u2019s internet, meaning the bulk of the nation lost all access for up to five hours.The damage was detected by a system monitoring the fibre-optic link from western Europe and a security team was sent to the spot, where the woman was arrested.While land-based cables are usually better protected, those running under the sea are seen as vulnerable, mainly to accidental damage.In 2008 web and phone access was impaired in much of the Middle East on two occasions after a cable under the Mediterranean was damaged. The first time, in January, a ship\u2019s anchor was believed to have been the culprit.

The men reportedly said they cut the cable in error.Sometimes cables just break \u2013 in September this year web access in south-east Asia was affected after a 12,000-mile cable under the Pacific, connecting the region with the US, suffered a fault.And sometimes government action can also be to blame.

Calling the country a \u201ccesspool of terrorism\u201d, officials accused Washington of being directly involved with the film plot and threatened retaliation. \u201cThe army and people of the DPRK are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the US in all war spaces, including cyber warfare to blow up those citadels,\u201d said a statement on the KCNA, the country\u2019s official news channel. The Interview was cancelled by Sony Pictures last week after hackers calling themselves Guardians of Peace made threats against potential cinema audiences. Last month the company suffered a serious cyberbreach, which the US has blamed on North Korea.Pyongyang has praised the cyber attack but denies it was responsible, calling the White House \u201creckless\u201d for saying it was. So, could a such juvenile film be the start of world war three? Unlikely, according to those familiar with North Korea who doubt Pyongyang\u2019s capacity to follow through on such threats.The country is well practiced in the art of brinkmanship, using threatening, often Shakespearean language, against its key antagonists, Tokyo, Seoul and Washington, and beyond. We take a look at who they lashed out at in 2014 and why. The North\u2019s immediate neighbours are a popular target for attacks, with the South, who are within the boundary of short-and medium-range missiles, bearing the brunt. In November, upset about a UN decision to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court over its human rights record, KCNA put out a series of eight bellicose articles in which they threatened to nuke South Korea\u2019s Blue House. They also called Japan a \u201cpolitical pygmy\u201d and threatened to send the country to the bottom of the sea. Sometimes the threats got personal. In May, after an official US visit to Seoul, North Korea called the South Korean president a \u201ccrafty prostitute\u201d in thrall to her \u201cpimp\u201d Barack Obama who, in a related editorial, was called a \u201cwicked black monkey\u201d. In August North Korea lashed out at John Kerry calling him \u201ca wolf with a hideous lantern jaw\u201d after the US and South Korea carried out joint military drills. They said they were also unhappy about Kerry\u2019s comments on North Korea\u2019s human rights record. International organisations did not escape. The North threatened a nuclear attack ahead of a UN vote on whether to to refer the country to the ICC. After the vote was passed the North declared the motion \u201cgrave political provocation\u201d orchestrated by the US, although it was drafted by the UN and the European Union. Pyongyang then organised mass protests in Kim Il-sung square, accusing the UN of relying on trumped-up allegations by defectors backed by the US and other countries seeking to overthrow its ruling regime.Earlier in the year North Korea released its own rosy report on human rights claiming that they were enjoyed by the popular masses. In a sprawling document it again took aim at the US and its allies, accusing them in being \u201csteeped in repugnancy toward the DPRK\u201d. Defectors were called \u201chuman scum who betrayed their homeland and people\u201d. In an earlier editorial Michael Kirby, the chair of UN Commission Inquiry into human rights, was attacked over his sexuality.A Christmas tree also became diplomatic sore spot, as plans by a South Korean Christian group to rebuild an illuminated installation, three miles from the atheist North\u2019s border, were shelved. North Korea had called it a \u201csymbol of frantic anti-North confrontation rackets\u201d aimed at aggravating \u201cextreme tension\u201d between the two Koreas. They warned of a \u201ccatastrophic impact\u201d if the reconstruction was to go ahead, leaving some living near the tower site in Gimpo to raise concerns about their safetyBalloons containing anti-Pyongyang leaflets, which have been periodically floated across the border by South Korean activists, also came under fire. The North said it considered these leaflet drops \u201ca war-provoking act\u201d and that they would \u201cmercilessly crush the source of provocation and forces behind this operation.\u201d They also said that: \u201cspeaking ill of and criticising our highest leadership and system with evil bad mouthing through these consistent cross-border leaflets is the gravest act of hostility that obstructs inter-Korean relations and peace and unity in the nation.\u201d", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Sony Pictures", "The Interview", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Film", "United Nations", "Human rights", "Culture"], "title": "North Korea \u2013 a year in threats"},{"date": "2014-12-23T13:35:32Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea\u2019s tiny internet network appeared to be working again on Tuesday following a near 10-hour shutdown, amid a row with the US over a hack against Sony Pictures that Washington has blamed on Pyongyang.There was no indication as to whether a cyber-attack caused the outage, and if so who might have been behind it. The White House and the Department of State declined to comment.US tech companies monitoring the North Korean web network, which has only about 1,000 web addresses and is accessible only to a handful of elite officials, said it appeared to have suffered a concerted denial-of-service attack, in which a target\u2019s internet equipment is overwhelmed by spurious traffic.Websites such as those of the official Korean Central News Agency and the Rodong Sinmun newspaper went down during the outage. On Tuesday, US computer experts said the network appeared to have been resurrected.Jim Cowie, chief scientist at Dyn Research, a US internet analysis company, said in an online post that the entire North Korean internet \u201cwent dark\u201d following instability that began at the weekend and seemed \u201cconsistent with a fragile network under external attack\u201d. However, he added, it could also have been caused by a technical fault such as a power problem.In an update, Cowie said the network was now functioning again following a nine-and-a-half-hour shutdown. He told Reuters: \u201cWe\u2019re yet to see how stable the new connection is. The question for the next few hours is whether it will return to the unstable fluctuations we saw before the outage.\u201d North Korean websites were again accessible.The issue of who carried out a cyber-attack, if there was one, is complicated by the fact that knocking out North Korea\u2019s web network would not be a particularly difficult task. It has a total of 1,024 IP addresses \u2013 in a country of 25 million people \u2013 a single service provider and one connection to the outside world, via China. \u201cAny one of us that was upset because we couldn\u2019t watch the movie, you could do that,\u201d said Dan Holden, director of security research at Arbor Networks. \u201cTheir internet is just not that sophisticated.\u201dNonetheless, some suspicion is likely to fall on the US after Barack Obama said on Friday that the US government expected to respond to the hacking of Sony Pictures and a subsequent threat against filmgoers which prompted Sony to cancel the release of The Interview, a comedy drama centred on a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.Obama did not say what steps might be taken. A state department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to discuss, you know, publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen.\u201dNorth Korea, which reveres Kim and his predecessors, Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung, as near deities, has reacted with fury to The Interview. It has denied any connection to the Guardians of Power, an anonymous hacking group that claimed responsibility for the theft of a huge cache of emails from Sony, but has praised the hack as a \u201crighteous deed\u201d.On Monday North Korea again denied being behind the Sony hack, and issued unspecified threats of action against the US after saying it had \u201cclear evidence\u201d that Washington was heavily involved in devising the plot of The Interview.A statement from the country\u2019s National Defence Commission said North Korea had \u201calready launched the toughest counteraction\u201d to the film, without specifying what this might involve. \u201cNothing is [a] more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target[s are] all the citadels of the US imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans,\u201d it said.It is not known how many people in North Korea have access to the internet, but given the tiny extent of the network it is believed to run to just a handful of people among the political elite. Mobile phones are becoming more common in the country, but these are not able to make overseas calls or access the web.North Korea also has its own very tightly regulated intranet called Kwangmyong, or Bright, to which a slightly larger elite group has access. This provides a connection between industry, universities and government, and is believed to be used mainly to pass information rather than entertainment or commerce.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Internet", "Technology", "US news", "The Interview", "Sony Pictures", "Film"], "title": "North Korea internet service resumes after shutdown"},{"date": "2014-12-23T17:09:04Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Has the age of cyber warfare dawned? Barack Obama refrained from calling the hacking of Sony an act of war by North Korea. He prefers to describe it as \u201ccyber vandalism\u201d, and has warned of a \u201cproportionate\u201d response.As experts ponder what form such retaliation might take \u2013 and we still don\u2019t know what caused North Korea\u2019s internet outage this week \u2013 there were interesting tweets from Toomas Hendrik Ilves, president of one of the smallest states in the world, Estonia. \u201cDestructive cyber-attacks, as we have seen in the Sony case, threaten all our liberties worldwide if intimidation is allowed to stand. A free and open internet is the life blood of 21st century democracy, worldwide. Its defence needs all like-minded nations\u2019 cooperation.\u201dIlves knows a bit about cyber vandalism because Estonia, which prides itself as being among the most wired states in Europe, was in 2007 subjected to one of the most spectacular cyber-attacks yet. For two months, hackers unleashed a wave of digital assaults that crippled government and corporate sites. Estonia traced the attacks to groups in Russia, and suggested that they had been activated by the Kremlin. Russian officials denied it. Estonia went on to host a special Nato centre for cyber defence and research. Later, a group of international experts produced a document called the Tallinn manual on international law applicable to cyberwarfare. This text attempts to look at how cyber operations can cross certain threshholds in the realm of international security, and how states can respond. A lot of the discussion revolves around whether a cyber assaultfalls into the category of an armed attack. There are no clear-cut answers. It seems this debate will continue to unfold on a case-by-case basis.The targeting of Estonia was not to do with a movie that might have displeased Russia, but with a decision made by Estonian officials to dislodge a Soviet second world war monument in Tallinn. This sparked rioting among Estonia\u2019s ethnic Russian minority and a furore among Russian-based nationalist groups such as the youth organisation Nashi, which later claimed responsibility for the cyber campaign \u2013 although proof of this was never produced.The parallels between the Estonian episode and the Sony hacking are striking. Just as North Korea now stands accused of trying to censor a movie in the US through cyberthreats, Russia came under criticism for trying to blackmail a neighbouring state into preserving a remnant of Soviet historiography on its territory. It is no surprise the Estonian president feels strongly about the attack on Sony, and its wider meaning in terms of freedom of expression and state sovereignty.The attack on Estonia was in a way more foreboding than the strike on Sony, because it temporarily paralysed the very functioning of some state institutions. In Sony\u2019s case, however, there was obviously more at stake than just a private company\u2019s wellbeing. Hollywood, a whole industry that many\u00a0in the world can associate with American soft power or influence, found\u00a0itself under threat.Cyber vandals play on the notion of plausible deniability.

The Interview was cancelled by Sony Pictures last week after hackers calling themselves Guardians of Peace made threats against potential cinema audiences. Last month the company suffered a serious cyberbreach, which the US has blamed on North Korea.Pyongyang has praised the cyber attack but denies it was responsible, calling the White House \u201creckless\u201d for saying it was. So, could a such juvenile film be the start of world war three? Unlikely, according to those familiar with North Korea who doubt Pyongyang\u2019s capacity to follow through on such threats.The country is well practiced in the art of brinkmanship, using threatening, often Shakespearean language, against its key antagonists, Tokyo, Seoul and Washington, and beyond. We take a look at who they lashed out at in 2014 and why. The North\u2019s immediate neighbours are a popular target for attacks, with the South, who are within the boundary of short-and medium-range missiles, bearing the brunt. In November, upset about a UN decision to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court over its human rights record, KCNA put out a series of eight bellicose articles in which they threatened to nuke South Korea\u2019s Blue House. They also called Japan a \u201cpolitical pygmy\u201d and threatened to send the country to the bottom of the sea. Sometimes the threats got personal. In May, after an official US visit to Seoul, North Korea called the South Korean president a \u201ccrafty prostitute\u201d in thrall to her \u201cpimp\u201d Barack Obama who, in a related editorial, was called a \u201cwicked black monkey\u201d. In August North Korea lashed out at John Kerry calling him \u201ca wolf with a hideous lantern jaw\u201d after the US and South Korea carried out joint military drills. They said they were also unhappy about Kerry\u2019s comments on North Korea\u2019s human rights record. International organisations did not escape. The North threatened a nuclear attack ahead of a UN vote on whether to to refer the country to the ICC. After the vote was passed the North declared the motion \u201cgrave political provocation\u201d orchestrated by the US, although it was drafted by the UN and the European Union. Pyongyang then organised mass protests in Kim Il-sung square, accusing the UN of relying on trumped-up allegations by defectors backed by the US and other countries seeking to overthrow its ruling regime.Earlier in the year North Korea released its own rosy report on human rights claiming that they were enjoyed by the popular masses. In a sprawling document it again took aim at the US and its allies, accusing them in being \u201csteeped in repugnancy toward the DPRK\u201d. Defectors were called \u201chuman scum who betrayed their homeland and people\u201d. In an earlier editorial Michael Kirby, the chair of UN Commission Inquiry into human rights, was attacked over his sexuality.A Christmas tree also became diplomatic sore spot, as plans by a South Korean Christian group to rebuild an illuminated installation, three miles from the atheist North\u2019s border, were shelved. North Korea had called it a \u201csymbol of frantic anti-North confrontation rackets\u201d aimed at aggravating \u201cextreme tension\u201d between the two Koreas. They warned of a \u201ccatastrophic impact\u201d if the reconstruction was to go ahead, leaving some living near the tower site in Gimpo to raise concerns about their safetyBalloons containing anti-Pyongyang leaflets, which have been periodically floated across the border by South Korean activists, also came under fire. The North said it considered these leaflet drops \u201ca war-provoking act\u201d and that they would \u201cmercilessly crush the source of provocation and forces behind this operation.\u201d They also said that: \u201cspeaking ill of and criticising our highest leadership and system with evil bad mouthing through these consistent cross-border leaflets is the gravest act of hostility that obstructs inter-Korean relations and peace and unity in the nation.\u201d", "tags": ["North Korea", "South Korea", "Sony Pictures", "The Interview", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Film", "United Nations", "Human rights", "Culture"], "title": "North Korea \u2013 a year in threats"},{"date": "2014-12-23T13:35:32Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea\u2019s tiny internet network appeared to be working again on Tuesday following a near 10-hour shutdown, amid a row with the US over a hack against Sony Pictures that Washington has blamed on Pyongyang.There was no indication as to whether a cyber-attack caused the outage, and if so who might have been behind it. The White House and the Department of State declined to comment.US tech companies monitoring the North Korean web network, which has only about 1,000 web addresses and is accessible only to a handful of elite officials, said it appeared to have suffered a concerted denial-of-service attack, in which a target\u2019s internet equipment is overwhelmed by spurious traffic.Websites such as those of the official Korean Central News Agency and the Rodong Sinmun newspaper went down during the outage. On Tuesday, US computer experts said the network appeared to have been resurrected.Jim Cowie, chief scientist at Dyn Research, a US internet analysis company, said in an online post that the entire North Korean internet \u201cwent dark\u201d following instability that began at the weekend and seemed \u201cconsistent with a fragile network under external attack\u201d. However, he added, it could also have been caused by a technical fault such as a power problem.In an update, Cowie said the network was now functioning again following a nine-and-a-half-hour shutdown. He told Reuters: \u201cWe\u2019re yet to see how stable the new connection is. The question for the next few hours is whether it will return to the unstable fluctuations we saw before the outage.\u201d North Korean websites were again accessible.The issue of who carried out a cyber-attack, if there was one, is complicated by the fact that knocking out North Korea\u2019s web network would not be a particularly difficult task. It has a total of 1,024 IP addresses \u2013 in a country of 25 million people \u2013 a single service provider and one connection to the outside world, via China. \u201cAny one of us that was upset because we couldn\u2019t watch the movie, you could do that,\u201d said Dan Holden, director of security research at Arbor Networks. \u201cTheir internet is just not that sophisticated.\u201dNonetheless, some suspicion is likely to fall on the US after Barack Obama said on Friday that the US government expected to respond to the hacking of Sony Pictures and a subsequent threat against filmgoers which prompted Sony to cancel the release of The Interview, a comedy drama centred on a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.Obama did not say what steps might be taken. A state department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to discuss, you know, publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen.\u201dNorth Korea, which reveres Kim and his predecessors, Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung, as near deities, has reacted with fury to The Interview. It has denied any connection to the Guardians of Power, an anonymous hacking group that claimed responsibility for the theft of a huge cache of emails from Sony, but has praised the hack as a \u201crighteous deed\u201d.On Monday North Korea again denied being behind the Sony hack, and issued unspecified threats of action against the US after saying it had \u201cclear evidence\u201d that Washington was heavily involved in devising the plot of The Interview.A statement from the country\u2019s National Defence Commission said North Korea had \u201calready launched the toughest counteraction\u201d to the film, without specifying what this might involve. \u201cNothing is [a] more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target[s are] all the citadels of the US imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans,\u201d it said.It is not known how many people in North Korea have access to the internet, but given the tiny extent of the network it is believed to run to just a handful of people among the political elite. Mobile phones are becoming more common in the country, but these are not able to make overseas calls or access the web.North Korea also has its own very tightly regulated intranet called Kwangmyong, or Bright, to which a slightly larger elite group has access. This provides a connection between industry, universities and government, and is believed to be used mainly to pass information rather than entertainment or commerce.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Internet", "Technology", "US news", "The Interview", "Sony Pictures", "Film"], "title": "North Korea internet service resumes after shutdown"},{"date": "2014-12-23T17:09:04Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Has the age of cyber warfare dawned? Barack Obama refrained from calling the hacking of Sony an act of war by North Korea. He prefers to describe it as \u201ccyber vandalism\u201d, and has warned of a \u201cproportionate\u201d response.As experts ponder what form such retaliation might take \u2013 and we still don\u2019t know what caused North Korea\u2019s internet outage this week \u2013 there were interesting tweets from Toomas Hendrik Ilves, president of one of the smallest states in the world, Estonia. \u201cDestructive cyber-attacks, as we have seen in the Sony case, threaten all our liberties worldwide if intimidation is allowed to stand. A free and open internet is the life blood of 21st century democracy, worldwide. Its defence needs all like-minded nations\u2019 cooperation.\u201dIlves knows a bit about cyber vandalism because Estonia, which prides itself as being among the most wired states in Europe, was in 2007 subjected to one of the most spectacular cyber-attacks yet. For two months, hackers unleashed a wave of digital assaults that crippled government and corporate sites. Estonia traced the attacks to groups in Russia, and suggested that they had been activated by the Kremlin. Russian officials denied it. Estonia went on to host a special Nato centre for cyber defence and research. Later, a group of international experts produced a document called the Tallinn manual on international law applicable to cyberwarfare. This text attempts to look at how cyber operations can cross certain threshholds in the realm of international security, and how states can respond. A lot of the discussion revolves around whether a cyber assaultfalls into the category of an armed attack. There are no clear-cut answers. It seems this debate will continue to unfold on a case-by-case basis.The targeting of Estonia was not to do with a movie that might have displeased Russia, but with a decision made by Estonian officials to dislodge a Soviet second world war monument in Tallinn. This sparked rioting among Estonia\u2019s ethnic Russian minority and a furore among Russian-based nationalist groups such as the youth organisation Nashi, which later claimed responsibility for the cyber campaign \u2013 although proof of this was never produced.The parallels between the Estonian episode and the Sony hacking are striking. Just as North Korea now stands accused of trying to censor a movie in the US through cyberthreats, Russia came under criticism for trying to blackmail a neighbouring state into preserving a remnant of Soviet historiography on its territory. It is no surprise the Estonian president feels strongly about the attack on Sony, and its wider meaning in terms of freedom of expression and state sovereignty.The attack on Estonia was in a way more foreboding than the strike on Sony, because it temporarily paralysed the very functioning of some state institutions. In Sony\u2019s case, however, there was obviously more at stake than just a private company\u2019s wellbeing. Hollywood, a whole industry that many\u00a0in the world can associate with American soft power or influence, found\u00a0itself under threat.Cyber vandals play on the notion of plausible deniability. Their aim is to inflict damage or force their adversary to retreat without openly claiming responsibility for any attack. This strategy basically follows what the Chinese warrior-philosopher Sun Tzu described as the supreme art of war: \u201cto subdue the enemy without fighting\u201d. The withdrawal of the movie was a clear victory for the hackers and their intimidation.Just as North Korea denies any responsibility over Sony, Russia has spent most of the past year denying any\u00a0direct role in the armed insurgencies in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has acted through proxies and stealth military action, just as North Korea relied on an army of hackers that was difficult to trace. This is a new era of hybrid warfare and deniable attacks. So\u00a0perhaps it wasn\u2019t a big surprise to see, in the middle of the Sony hacking scandal, Vladimir Putin suddenly inviting the North Korea leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Russia.If they meet, they will surely have an interesting conversation, comparing notes on how their strategy unfolded and how the outside world responded. They might even mention Sun Tzu.", "tags": ["Cyberwar", "Sony Pictures", "Cybercrime", "Internet", "Technology", "Hacking", "Espionage", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Russia", "Europe", "Estonia", "Film"], "title": "Has North Korea found a friend in President Putin? | Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de"},{"date": "2014-12-23T13:44:26Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea suffered an internet outage lasting almost 10 hours in the wake of a row with the US over a cyber-attack against Sony Pictures.Washington blamed the hacking on the secretive state \u2013 in allegations countered by strong denials from the North Koreans \u2013 and promised retribution.While it is not known if the shutdown on Monday and Tuesday was the result of US action or caused by something else, history shows web access can be cut for all sorts of unlikely reasons.In 2011 a 75-year-old Georgian woman scavenging for copper to sell as scrap accidentally sliced through an underground cable with her spade and cut off internet services to all of neighbouring Armenia.The woman, soon labelled \u201cthe spade hacker\u201d by local media, was digging near the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, when she damaged the fibre-optic cable. Georgia provides 90% of Armenia\u2019s internet, meaning the bulk of the nation lost all access for up to five hours.The damage was detected by a system monitoring the fibre-optic link from western Europe and a security team was sent to the spot, where the woman was arrested.While land-based cables are usually better protected, those running under the sea are seen as vulnerable, mainly to accidental damage.In 2008 web and phone access was impaired in much of the Middle East on two occasions after a cable under the Mediterranean was damaged. The first time, in January, a ship\u2019s anchor was believed to have been the culprit. Later in the year engineers sent out an underwater robot after three cables were damaged, either by an earthquake or a trawler net.More unusually, last year Egypt\u2019s navy arrested three men alleged to have deliberately cut undersea cables off the country\u2019s coast, causing a big drop in web speeds. The men reportedly said they cut the cable in error.Sometimes cables just break \u2013 in September this year web access in south-east Asia was affected after a 12,000-mile cable under the Pacific, connecting the region with the US, suffered a fault.And sometimes government action can also be to blame. In 2012 the Syrian government was widely accused of being behind a near-total web blackout in the country \u2013 seemingly caused to prevent rebels spreading propaganda images of the country\u2019s civil war.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Internet", "Technology"], "title": "North Korea internet outage: weirdest web shutdowns around the world"},{"date": "2014-12-18T08:42:35Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "No one is surprised to hear bellicose rhetoric from North Korea. The cause for astonishment, especially among those who follow the country closely, is that Sony has caved in to it by pulling its film The Interview.If the North was behind the hacking of the company - and scepticism remains despite briefings from unnamed US officials that it was \u201ccentrally involved\u201d \u2013 experts say that still does not indicate an imminent risk to audiences.The US president certainly did not seem overly concerned. Asked about the stern warnings of retribution targeted at screenings of The Interview, which invoked the memory of the 9/11 terror attacks, Barack Obama told ABC News: \u201cFor now, my recommendation would be that people go to the movies.\u201dThe North has yet to respond to the cancellation of the film, which depicts the assassination of its leader Kim Jong-un. It has praised the cyber-attack but denied any involvement.In June it threatened a \u201cstrong and merciless\u201d response if the US did not ban the film and warned that allowing its release would be an \u201cact of war\u201d, in comments which state news agency KCNA attributed to a foreign ministry spokesman.But it has a long history of sabre-rattling and of issuing harsh threats that it does not act upon. In 2012 it specifically threatened to reduce several South Korean media organisations \u201cto ashes \u2026 by unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style\u201d for slandering its leadership. The newspapers and broadcasters were unharmed.Earlier this year Pyongyang repeated a threat of preemptive nuclear strikes against the US if it believed that joint military drills by the US and South Korea were putting it at risk. Most experts believe it is incapable of doing so.\u201cIn terms of acts of terrorism directed against American citizens in the US \u2013 that would be totally without precedent,\u201d said John Delury, an expert on the North at Yonsei University.\u201cNorth Korea did engage in international terrorism [in the past], but it has been decades.\u201dAn attack on the US would also be an act of grotesque stupidity for a country which has excelled at brinksmanship, inviting retaliation.\u201cObviously, there are threats \u2013 and then there are threats where we are really concerned something is going to happen,\u201d said Delury.He said if the US government was certain the North was responsible it should say so clearly and noted that he could not think of any recent case where the North has issued a warning through a front group rather than through official media.Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University, who said he had \u201cnot the slightest doubt\u201d of Pyongyang\u2019s involvement in the cyber-attack, added: \u201cThey never really do it. They hack, but they never carry through [physical] threats.\u201dSony said it had cancelled the release in light of the decision by most of its exhibitors not to show the film, adding that it respected their choice and shared their \u201cparamount interest in the safety of employees and theatergoers\u201d.Lankov said the decision would simply encourage more hacking in future.\u201cIt was a stupid idea to have the movie in the first place\u00a0\u2026 These people try to target groups they think are harmless. I don\u2019t think they would make such a movie about assassinating a Chinese president or an Ayatollah, especially named by their real name. If Iran made a comedy about assassinating Obama, I don\u2019t think it would be seen as good clean humour,\u201d said Lankov.\u201cIt was ignorance and arrogance.

The White House and the Department of State declined to comment.US tech companies monitoring the North Korean web network, which has only about 1,000 web addresses and is accessible only to a handful of elite officials, said it appeared to have suffered a concerted denial-of-service attack, in which a target\u2019s internet equipment is overwhelmed by spurious traffic.Websites such as those of the official Korean Central News Agency and the Rodong Sinmun newspaper went down during the outage. On Tuesday, US computer experts said the network appeared to have been resurrected.Jim Cowie, chief scientist at Dyn Research, a US internet analysis company, said in an online post that the entire North Korean internet \u201cwent dark\u201d following instability that began at the weekend and seemed \u201cconsistent with a fragile network under external attack\u201d. However, he added, it could also have been caused by a technical fault such as a power problem.In an update, Cowie said the network was now functioning again following a nine-and-a-half-hour shutdown. He told Reuters: \u201cWe\u2019re yet to see how stable the new connection is. The question for the next few hours is whether it will return to the unstable fluctuations we saw before the outage.\u201d North Korean websites were again accessible.The issue of who carried out a cyber-attack, if there was one, is complicated by the fact that knocking out North Korea\u2019s web network would not be a particularly difficult task. It has a total of 1,024 IP addresses \u2013 in a country of 25 million people \u2013 a single service provider and one connection to the outside world, via China. \u201cAny one of us that was upset because we couldn\u2019t watch the movie, you could do that,\u201d said Dan Holden, director of security research at Arbor Networks. \u201cTheir internet is just not that sophisticated.\u201dNonetheless, some suspicion is likely to fall on the US after Barack Obama said on Friday that the US government expected to respond to the hacking of Sony Pictures and a subsequent threat against filmgoers which prompted Sony to cancel the release of The Interview, a comedy drama centred on a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.Obama did not say what steps might be taken. A state department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to discuss, you know, publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen.\u201dNorth Korea, which reveres Kim and his predecessors, Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung, as near deities, has reacted with fury to The Interview. It has denied any connection to the Guardians of Power, an anonymous hacking group that claimed responsibility for the theft of a huge cache of emails from Sony, but has praised the hack as a \u201crighteous deed\u201d.On Monday North Korea again denied being behind the Sony hack, and issued unspecified threats of action against the US after saying it had \u201cclear evidence\u201d that Washington was heavily involved in devising the plot of The Interview.A statement from the country\u2019s National Defence Commission said North Korea had \u201calready launched the toughest counteraction\u201d to the film, without specifying what this might involve. \u201cNothing is [a] more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target[s are] all the citadels of the US imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans,\u201d it said.It is not known how many people in North Korea have access to the internet, but given the tiny extent of the network it is believed to run to just a handful of people among the political elite. Mobile phones are becoming more common in the country, but these are not able to make overseas calls or access the web.North Korea also has its own very tightly regulated intranet called Kwangmyong, or Bright, to which a slightly larger elite group has access. This provides a connection between industry, universities and government, and is believed to be used mainly to pass information rather than entertainment or commerce.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Internet", "Technology", "US news", "The Interview", "Sony Pictures", "Film"], "title": "North Korea internet service resumes after shutdown"},{"date": "2014-12-23T17:09:04Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Has the age of cyber warfare dawned? Barack Obama refrained from calling the hacking of Sony an act of war by North Korea. He prefers to describe it as \u201ccyber vandalism\u201d, and has warned of a \u201cproportionate\u201d response.As experts ponder what form such retaliation might take \u2013 and we still don\u2019t know what caused North Korea\u2019s internet outage this week \u2013 there were interesting tweets from Toomas Hendrik Ilves, president of one of the smallest states in the world, Estonia. \u201cDestructive cyber-attacks, as we have seen in the Sony case, threaten all our liberties worldwide if intimidation is allowed to stand. A free and open internet is the life blood of 21st century democracy, worldwide. Its defence needs all like-minded nations\u2019 cooperation.\u201dIlves knows a bit about cyber vandalism because Estonia, which prides itself as being among the most wired states in Europe, was in 2007 subjected to one of the most spectacular cyber-attacks yet. For two months, hackers unleashed a wave of digital assaults that crippled government and corporate sites. Estonia traced the attacks to groups in Russia, and suggested that they had been activated by the Kremlin. Russian officials denied it. Estonia went on to host a special Nato centre for cyber defence and research. Later, a group of international experts produced a document called the Tallinn manual on international law applicable to cyberwarfare. This text attempts to look at how cyber operations can cross certain threshholds in the realm of international security, and how states can respond. A lot of the discussion revolves around whether a cyber assaultfalls into the category of an armed attack. There are no clear-cut answers. It seems this debate will continue to unfold on a case-by-case basis.The targeting of Estonia was not to do with a movie that might have displeased Russia, but with a decision made by Estonian officials to dislodge a Soviet second world war monument in Tallinn. This sparked rioting among Estonia\u2019s ethnic Russian minority and a furore among Russian-based nationalist groups such as the youth organisation Nashi, which later claimed responsibility for the cyber campaign \u2013 although proof of this was never produced.The parallels between the Estonian episode and the Sony hacking are striking. Just as North Korea now stands accused of trying to censor a movie in the US through cyberthreats, Russia came under criticism for trying to blackmail a neighbouring state into preserving a remnant of Soviet historiography on its territory. It is no surprise the Estonian president feels strongly about the attack on Sony, and its wider meaning in terms of freedom of expression and state sovereignty.The attack on Estonia was in a way more foreboding than the strike on Sony, because it temporarily paralysed the very functioning of some state institutions. In Sony\u2019s case, however, there was obviously more at stake than just a private company\u2019s wellbeing. Hollywood, a whole industry that many\u00a0in the world can associate with American soft power or influence, found\u00a0itself under threat.Cyber vandals play on the notion of plausible deniability. Their aim is to inflict damage or force their adversary to retreat without openly claiming responsibility for any attack. This strategy basically follows what the Chinese warrior-philosopher Sun Tzu described as the supreme art of war: \u201cto subdue the enemy without fighting\u201d. The withdrawal of the movie was a clear victory for the hackers and their intimidation.Just as North Korea denies any responsibility over Sony, Russia has spent most of the past year denying any\u00a0direct role in the armed insurgencies in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has acted through proxies and stealth military action, just as North Korea relied on an army of hackers that was difficult to trace. This is a new era of hybrid warfare and deniable attacks. So\u00a0perhaps it wasn\u2019t a big surprise to see, in the middle of the Sony hacking scandal, Vladimir Putin suddenly inviting the North Korea leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Russia.If they meet, they will surely have an interesting conversation, comparing notes on how their strategy unfolded and how the outside world responded.

Georgia provides 90% of Armenia\u2019s internet, meaning the bulk of the nation lost all access for up to five hours.The damage was detected by a system monitoring the fibre-optic link from western Europe and a security team was sent to the spot, where the woman was arrested.While land-based cables are usually better protected, those running under the sea are seen as vulnerable, mainly to accidental damage.In 2008 web and phone access was impaired in much of the Middle East on two occasions after a cable under the Mediterranean was damaged. The first time, in January, a ship\u2019s anchor was believed to have been the culprit. Later in the year engineers sent out an underwater robot after three cables were damaged, either by an earthquake or a trawler net.More unusually, last year Egypt\u2019s navy arrested three men alleged to have deliberately cut undersea cables off the country\u2019s coast, causing a big drop in web speeds. The men reportedly said they cut the cable in error.Sometimes cables just break \u2013 in September this year web access in south-east Asia was affected after a 12,000-mile cable under the Pacific, connecting the region with the US, suffered a fault.And sometimes government action can also be to blame.

The cause for astonishment, especially among those who follow the country closely, is that Sony has caved in to it by pulling its film The Interview.If the North was behind the hacking of the company - and scepticism remains despite briefings from unnamed US officials that it was \u201ccentrally involved\u201d \u2013 experts say that still does not indicate an imminent risk to audiences.The US president certainly did not seem overly concerned. Asked about the stern warnings of retribution targeted at screenings of The Interview, which invoked the memory of the 9/11 terror attacks, Barack Obama told ABC News: \u201cFor now, my recommendation would be that people go to the movies.\u201dThe North has yet to respond to the cancellation of the film, which depicts the assassination of its leader Kim Jong-un. It has praised the cyber-attack but denied any involvement.In June it threatened a \u201cstrong and merciless\u201d response if the US did not ban the film and warned that allowing its release would be an \u201cact of war\u201d, in comments which state news agency KCNA attributed to a foreign ministry spokesman.But it has a long history of sabre-rattling and of issuing harsh threats that it does not act upon. In 2012 it specifically threatened to reduce several South Korean media organisations \u201cto ashes \u2026 by unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style\u201d for slandering its leadership. The newspapers and broadcasters were unharmed.Earlier this year Pyongyang repeated a threat of preemptive nuclear strikes against the US if it believed that joint military drills by the US and South Korea were putting it at risk. Most experts believe it is incapable of doing so.\u201cIn terms of acts of terrorism directed against American citizens in the US \u2013 that would be totally without precedent,\u201d said John Delury, an expert on the North at Yonsei University.\u201cNorth Korea did engage in international terrorism [in the past], but it has been decades.\u201dAn attack on the US would also be an act of grotesque stupidity for a country which has excelled at brinksmanship, inviting retaliation.\u201cObviously, there are threats \u2013 and then there are threats where we are really concerned something is going to happen,\u201d said Delury.He said if the US government was certain the North was responsible it should say so clearly and noted that he could not think of any recent case where the North has issued a warning through a front group rather than through official media.Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University, who said he had \u201cnot the slightest doubt\u201d of Pyongyang\u2019s involvement in the cyber-attack, added: \u201cThey never really do it. They hack, but they never carry through [physical] threats.\u201dSony said it had cancelled the release in light of the decision by most of its exhibitors not to show the film, adding that it respected their choice and shared their \u201cparamount interest in the safety of employees and theatergoers\u201d.Lankov said the decision would simply encourage more hacking in future.\u201cIt was a stupid idea to have the movie in the first place\u00a0\u2026 These people try to target groups they think are harmless. I don\u2019t think they would make such a movie about assassinating a Chinese president or an Ayatollah, especially named by their real name. If Iran made a comedy about assassinating Obama, I don\u2019t think it would be seen as good clean humour,\u201d said Lankov.\u201cIt was ignorance and arrogance.

By which logic, we\u2019d have been at war with Malaysia over Zoolander for over a decade now.This is merely the latest skirmish in an ongoing cinematic cold war, however. North Korea was fine with being branded part of Bush\u2019s \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d, but mock them and they won\u2019t see the funny side.They certainly weren\u2019t laughing when Kim Jong-il was ridiculed as a pathetic, isolated dictator in Team America: World Police, singing his borderline-racist ballad I\u2019m So Ronery around his empty palace. \u201cSuch behaviour is not part of our country\u2019s political culture.

North Korea is an easy target. There\u2019s no export market there for a start, in glaring contrast to its equally undemocratic but immeasurably more powerful neighbour: China. Often, North Korea is merely a last-minute substitute. The Red Dawn remake actually started out with China as the invading force, but when Beijing started to grumble, they hastily removed the Chinese flags and dialogue and made the invaders North Korean instead.

The Interview was cancelled by Sony Pictures last week after hackers calling themselves Guardians of Peace made threats against potential cinema audiences. Last month the company suffered a serious cyberbreach, which the US has blamed on North Korea.Pyongyang has praised the cyber attack but denies it was responsible, calling the White House \u201creckless\u201d for saying it was. So, could a such juvenile film be the start of world war three? Unlikely, according to those familiar with North Korea who doubt Pyongyang\u2019s capacity to follow through on such threats.The country is well practiced in the art of brinkmanship, using threatening, often Shakespearean language, against its key antagonists, Tokyo, Seoul and Washington, and beyond. We take a look at who they lashed out at in 2014 and why. The North\u2019s immediate neighbours are a popular target for attacks, with the South, who are within the boundary of short-and medium-range missiles, bearing the brunt. In November, upset about a UN decision to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court over its human rights record, KCNA put out a series of eight bellicose articles in which they threatened to nuke South Korea\u2019s Blue House. They also called Japan a \u201cpolitical pygmy\u201d and threatened to send the country to the bottom of the sea. Sometimes the threats got personal. In May, after an official US visit to Seoul, North Korea called the South Korean president a \u201ccrafty prostitute\u201d in thrall to her \u201cpimp\u201d Barack Obama who, in a related editorial, was called a \u201cwicked black monkey\u201d. In August North Korea lashed out at John Kerry calling him \u201ca wolf with a hideous lantern jaw\u201d after the US and South Korea carried out joint military drills. They said they were also unhappy about Kerry\u2019s comments on North Korea\u2019s human rights record. International organisations did not escape. The North threatened a nuclear attack ahead of a UN vote on whether to to refer the country to the ICC. After the vote was passed the North declared the motion \u201cgrave political provocation\u201d orchestrated by the US, although it was drafted by the UN and the European Union. Pyongyang then organised mass protests in Kim Il-sung square, accusing the UN of relying on trumped-up allegations by defectors backed by the US and other countries seeking to overthrow its ruling regime.Earlier in the year North Korea released its own rosy report on human rights claiming that they were enjoyed by the popular masses. In a sprawling document it again took aim at the US and its allies, accusing them in being \u201csteeped in repugnancy toward the DPRK\u201d. Defectors were called \u201chuman scum who betrayed their homeland and people\u201d. In an earlier editorial Michael Kirby, the chair of UN Commission Inquiry into human rights, was attacked over his sexuality.A Christmas tree also became diplomatic sore spot, as plans by a South Korean Christian group to rebuild an illuminated installation, three miles from the atheist North\u2019s border, were shelved.

The White House and the Department of State declined to comment.US tech companies monitoring the North Korean web network, which has only about 1,000 web addresses and is accessible only to a handful of elite officials, said it appeared to have suffered a concerted denial-of-service attack, in which a target\u2019s internet equipment is overwhelmed by spurious traffic.Websites such as those of the official Korean Central News Agency and the Rodong Sinmun newspaper went down during the outage. On Tuesday, US computer experts said the network appeared to have been resurrected.Jim Cowie, chief scientist at Dyn Research, a US internet analysis company, said in an online post that the entire North Korean internet \u201cwent dark\u201d following instability that began at the weekend and seemed \u201cconsistent with a fragile network under external attack\u201d. However, he added, it could also have been caused by a technical fault such as a power problem.In an update, Cowie said the network was now functioning again following a nine-and-a-half-hour shutdown. He told Reuters: \u201cWe\u2019re yet to see how stable the new connection is. The question for the next few hours is whether it will return to the unstable fluctuations we saw before the outage.\u201d North Korean websites were again accessible.The issue of who carried out a cyber-attack, if there was one, is complicated by the fact that knocking out North Korea\u2019s web network would not be a particularly difficult task. It has a total of 1,024 IP addresses \u2013 in a country of 25 million people \u2013 a single service provider and one connection to the outside world, via China. \u201cAny one of us that was upset because we couldn\u2019t watch the movie, you could do that,\u201d said Dan Holden, director of security research at Arbor Networks. \u201cTheir internet is just not that sophisticated.\u201dNonetheless, some suspicion is likely to fall on the US after Barack Obama said on Friday that the US government expected to respond to the hacking of Sony Pictures and a subsequent threat against filmgoers which prompted Sony to cancel the release of The Interview, a comedy drama centred on a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.Obama did not say what steps might be taken. A state department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to discuss, you know, publicly operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen.\u201dNorth Korea, which reveres Kim and his predecessors, Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung, as near deities, has reacted with fury to The Interview. It has denied any connection to the Guardians of Power, an anonymous hacking group that claimed responsibility for the theft of a huge cache of emails from Sony, but has praised the hack as a \u201crighteous deed\u201d.On Monday North Korea again denied being behind the Sony hack, and issued unspecified threats of action against the US after saying it had \u201cclear evidence\u201d that Washington was heavily involved in devising the plot of The Interview.A statement from the country\u2019s National Defence Commission said North Korea had \u201calready launched the toughest counteraction\u201d to the film, without specifying what this might involve. \u201cNothing is [a] more serious miscalculation than guessing that just a single movie production company is the target of this counteraction. Our target[s are] all the citadels of the US imperialists who earned the bitterest grudge of all Koreans,\u201d it said.It is not known how many people in North Korea have access to the internet, but given the tiny extent of the network it is believed to run to just a handful of people among the political elite. Mobile phones are becoming more common in the country, but these are not able to make overseas calls or access the web.North Korea also has its own very tightly regulated intranet called Kwangmyong, or Bright, to which a slightly larger elite group has access. This provides a connection between industry, universities and government, and is believed to be used mainly to pass information rather than entertainment or commerce.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Internet", "Technology", "US news", "The Interview", "Sony Pictures", "Film"], "title": "North Korea internet service resumes after shutdown"},{"date": "2014-12-23T17:09:04Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Has the age of cyber warfare dawned? Barack Obama refrained from calling the hacking of Sony an act of war by North Korea. He prefers to describe it as \u201ccyber vandalism\u201d, and has warned of a \u201cproportionate\u201d response.As experts ponder what form such retaliation might take \u2013 and we still don\u2019t know what caused North Korea\u2019s internet outage this week \u2013 there were interesting tweets from Toomas Hendrik Ilves, president of one of the smallest states in the world, Estonia. \u201cDestructive cyber-attacks, as we have seen in the Sony case, threaten all our liberties worldwide if intimidation is allowed to stand. A free and open internet is the life blood of 21st century democracy, worldwide. Its defence needs all like-minded nations\u2019 cooperation.\u201dIlves knows a bit about cyber vandalism because Estonia, which prides itself as being among the most wired states in Europe, was in 2007 subjected to one of the most spectacular cyber-attacks yet. For two months, hackers unleashed a wave of digital assaults that crippled government and corporate sites. Estonia traced the attacks to groups in Russia, and suggested that they had been activated by the Kremlin. Russian officials denied it. Estonia went on to host a special Nato centre for cyber defence and research. Later, a group of international experts produced a document called the Tallinn manual on international law applicable to cyberwarfare. This text attempts to look at how cyber operations can cross certain threshholds in the realm of international security, and how states can respond. A lot of the discussion revolves around whether a cyber assaultfalls into the category of an armed attack. There are no clear-cut answers. It seems this debate will continue to unfold on a case-by-case basis.The targeting of Estonia was not to do with a movie that might have displeased Russia, but with a decision made by Estonian officials to dislodge a Soviet second world war monument in Tallinn. This sparked rioting among Estonia\u2019s ethnic Russian minority and a furore among Russian-based nationalist groups such as the youth organisation Nashi, which later claimed responsibility for the cyber campaign \u2013 although proof of this was never produced.The parallels between the Estonian episode and the Sony hacking are striking. Just as North Korea now stands accused of trying to censor a movie in the US through cyberthreats, Russia came under criticism for trying to blackmail a neighbouring state into preserving a remnant of Soviet historiography on its territory. It is no surprise the Estonian president feels strongly about the attack on Sony, and its wider meaning in terms of freedom of expression and state sovereignty.The attack on Estonia was in a way more foreboding than the strike on Sony, because it temporarily paralysed the very functioning of some state institutions. In Sony\u2019s case, however, there was obviously more at stake than just a private company\u2019s wellbeing. Hollywood, a whole industry that many\u00a0in the world can associate with American soft power or influence, found\u00a0itself under threat.Cyber vandals play on the notion of plausible deniability. Their aim is to inflict damage or force their adversary to retreat without openly claiming responsibility for any attack. This strategy basically follows what the Chinese warrior-philosopher Sun Tzu described as the supreme art of war: \u201cto subdue the enemy without fighting\u201d. The withdrawal of the movie was a clear victory for the hackers and their intimidation.Just as North Korea denies any responsibility over Sony, Russia has spent most of the past year denying any\u00a0direct role in the armed insurgencies in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has acted through proxies and stealth military action, just as North Korea relied on an army of hackers that was difficult to trace. This is a new era of hybrid warfare and deniable attacks. So\u00a0perhaps it wasn\u2019t a big surprise to see, in the middle of the Sony hacking scandal, Vladimir Putin suddenly inviting the North Korea leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Russia.If they meet, they will surely have an interesting conversation, comparing notes on how their strategy unfolded and how the outside world responded.

Georgia provides 90% of Armenia\u2019s internet, meaning the bulk of the nation lost all access for up to five hours.The damage was detected by a system monitoring the fibre-optic link from western Europe and a security team was sent to the spot, where the woman was arrested.While land-based cables are usually better protected, those running under the sea are seen as vulnerable, mainly to accidental damage.In 2008 web and phone access was impaired in much of the Middle East on two occasions after a cable under the Mediterranean was damaged. The first time, in January, a ship\u2019s anchor was believed to have been the culprit. Later in the year engineers sent out an underwater robot after three cables were damaged, either by an earthquake or a trawler net.More unusually, last year Egypt\u2019s navy arrested three men alleged to have deliberately cut undersea cables off the country\u2019s coast, causing a big drop in web speeds. The men reportedly said they cut the cable in error.Sometimes cables just break \u2013 in September this year web access in south-east Asia was affected after a 12,000-mile cable under the Pacific, connecting the region with the US, suffered a fault.And sometimes government action can also be to blame.

Asked about the stern warnings of retribution targeted at screenings of The Interview, which invoked the memory of the 9/11 terror attacks, Barack Obama told ABC News: \u201cFor now, my recommendation would be that people go to the movies.\u201dThe North has yet to respond to the cancellation of the film, which depicts the assassination of its leader Kim Jong-un. It has praised the cyber-attack but denied any involvement.In June it threatened a \u201cstrong and merciless\u201d response if the US did not ban the film and warned that allowing its release would be an \u201cact of war\u201d, in comments which state news agency KCNA attributed to a foreign ministry spokesman.But it has a long history of sabre-rattling and of issuing harsh threats that it does not act upon.

Most experts believe it is incapable of doing so.\u201cIn terms of acts of terrorism directed against American citizens in the US \u2013 that would be totally without precedent,\u201d said John Delury, an expert on the North at Yonsei University.\u201cNorth Korea did engage in international terrorism [in the past], but it has been decades.\u201dAn attack on the US would also be an act of grotesque stupidity for a country which has excelled at brinksmanship, inviting retaliation.\u201cObviously, there are threats \u2013 and then there are threats where we are really concerned something is going to happen,\u201d said Delury.He said if the US government was certain the North was responsible it should say so clearly and noted that he could not think of any recent case where the North has issued a warning through a front group rather than through official media.Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University, who said he had \u201cnot the slightest doubt\u201d of Pyongyang\u2019s involvement in the cyber-attack, added: \u201cThey never really do it.

A great deal, apparently. On 31 January 2015, a North Korean government-run website posted an 18-minute video titled The Human Rights Propaganda Puppet, Yeon-mi Park, which denounced the charismatic 21-year-old defector. It was the latest attack in a smear campaign aimed at silencing Yeon-mi, a human rights activist and outspoken critic of the world\u2019s most repressive and secretive regime.Attacks on prominent North Korean defectors are nothing new. These individuals regularly endure charges that they lie and exaggerate. Occasionally there are death threats. Park Sang-hak, who launches helium balloons laden with USB sticks and anti-regime leaflets into North Korean airspace, has been called \u201chuman scum\u201d who will \u201cpay for his crimes in blood\u201d. Sometimes the threats go beyond mere rhetoric: in 2011, a hitman with a poison-tipped needle was intercepted in South Korea on his way to kill Park Sang-hak. In 1997 the nephew of one of Kim Jong-il\u2019s mistresses was gunned down outside Seoul; he had recently published an expose about the dictator\u2019s family.

The smears and threats have ramped up in the wake of a UN report documenting crimes against humanity in North Korea and recommending that the case be referred to the International Criminal Court. The UN findings were based on the testimony of more than 300 defectors who painted a picture of institutionalised cruelty within the regime, including mass incarceration in forced labour camps. North Korea has tried \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to discredit the entire report because one of its well-known witnesses, Shin Dong-hyuk, later admitted to changing parts of his biography. \u201cThe fundamental building blocks of Shin\u2019s story remain the same,\u201d says Scarlatoiu. \u201cHe was still a political prisoner and still tortured.\u201d But the controversy highlights a tragic catch-22: sometimes the traumatic firsthand experiences that make defectors such powerful witnesses also make them vulnerable to assaults on their credibility.Yeon-mi did not testify before the UN inquiry, but became a YouTube sensation last autumn, following her emotional speech at the One Young World Summit in Dublin. Looking like a fragile porcelain doll dressed in a flowing pink hanbok (traditional Korean dress), Yeon-mi took the podium and, fighting to keep her composure, told a harrowing and heartbreaking story: \u201cNorth Korea is an unimaginable country,\u201d she began in halting English. \u201cWe aren\u2019t free to sing, say, wear or think what we want.\u201dShe said she believed the dictator could hear her thoughts, and she described the hideous punishments meted out to those who broke the rules or expressed doubt about the regime. When she was nine years old she saw her friend\u2019s mother publicly executed for a minor infraction. When she was 13, she fled into China, only to see her mother raped by a human trafficker. Her father later died in China, where she buried his ashes in secret. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even cry,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid to be sent back to North Korea.\u201dEventually Yeon-mi and her mother escaped into Mongolia by walking and crawling across the frozen Gobi desert, following the stars north to freedom. By the time Yeon-mi had finished with a plea to \u201cshed light on the darkest place in the world\u201d, the whole audience was in tears and on its feet.After her Dublin speech, Yeon-mi became the human face of North Korea\u2019s oppressed. The media clamoured for interviews. A book deal followed, which was where I came into the picture. As Yeon-mi\u2019s \u201ccollaborator\u201d \u2013 a publishing term for a writer who helps an author find her voice and turn her story into a narrative \u2013 I was immediately taken with the power of Yeon-mi\u2019s testimony, as well as the warmth of her personality and her playful sense of humour. It was hard to fathom how this vibrant young woman could have suffered such an ordeal.As soon as we began working together, I noticed there were some minor discrepancies in the articles written about Yeon-mi, a jumbling of dates and places and some inconsistent details about her family\u2019s escape. Most of these issues could be explained by a language barrier \u2013 Yeon-mi was giving interviews in English before she was fully fluent. But Yeon-mi was also protecting a secret, something she had tried to bury and forget from the moment she arrived in South Korea at age 15: like tens of thousands of other refugees, Yeon-mi had been trafficked in China. In South Korea \u2013 and many other societies \u2013 admitting to such a \u201cshameful\u201d past would destroy her prospects for marriage and any sort of normal life.She had hoped that by changing a few details about her escape she could avoid revealing the full story. But after she decided to plunge into human rights activism, she realised that without the whole truth, the story of her life would have no real power or meaning. She has apologised for any discrepancies in her public record, and is determined that her book be scrupulously accurate.With Yeon-mi\u2019s cooperation, I have been able to verify her story through family members and fellow defectors who knew her in North Korea and China. Sometimes Yeon-mi had forgotten or blocked out graphic details from her childhood, only to have the memories return in all their horror as we reviewed her recollections with other witnesses. It seemed that she wasn\u2019t just remembering these things, but actually reliving them.Countless scientific studies have shown that trauma changes how the brain processes memory. It turns out that scrambling details and confusing time frames is actually a sign that the trauma survivor is being truthful \u2013 they honestly can\u2019t remember things in sequence. Dr Judith Herman, clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard and author of Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence from Domestic Abuse to Political Terror, tells me: \u201cTraumatised people don\u2019t give you a perfect, complete narrative on the first go-round. You see this all the time with refugees seeking asylum. That doesn\u2019t mean their story isn\u2019t credible, because the gist of their story is consistent.\u201dAccording to Herman, more and more judges in US asylum hearings understand and accept the impact of trauma on memory. Unfortunately the general public can be less forgiving. Which is why North Korea, its sympathisers and dupes have been able to exploit the discrepancies in some defectors\u2019 stories as a weapon to attack their motives.A few days before Christmas last year I checked my inbox and found a mysterious email warning me not to write the book with Yeon-mi and help \u201cspread her lies\u201d. Then came the North Korean video. Despite having the production values of a Stalin-era newsreel, the footage was chilling: some of her uncles, aunts and cousins still living in North Korea were paraded in front of the camera to denounce her. The worst they could come up with was that Yeon-mi was an ambitious child. But it was horrifying for her to see them so vulnerable. At least she knew they were still alive.Yeon-mi continues to work on her book and to speak out for freedom in North Korea. On Human Rights Day last 10 December, Yeon-mi appeared on a panel at the US State Department with another outspoken defector named Joseph Kim. In many public forums, Kim has told how he watched his father wither and die from starvation, how his sister disappeared and his mother left home, and how he survived as a street kid, scrabbling for crusts of bread. \u201cHunger is humiliation,\u201d he says. \u201cHunger is helplessness.\u201d But on this day he added something new: his mother had sold his sister to a man in China, thinking it was better than sending her back to North Korea.\u201cThis is an important part of my story,\u201d said Kim, \u201cthat I hope illustrates how difficult and desperate the life is, and how many North Korean mothers were forced to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.\u201dDoes this fresh revelation in any way diminish this remarkable young man\u2019s credibility? Absolutely not. It only shows how traumatic narratives sometimes come out in fits and starts. The whole story does not emerge until the survivor finds a way to tell it. But for those who have the patience to listen closely, the stories gather and build to a heroic and truthful testimony of survival that cannot be silenced.\u2022 Author and journalist Maryanne Vollers has collaborated on several memoirs including Living History by Hillary Clinton.

The Russian foreign ministry said the agreement was designed to elevate ties \u201cin the political, economic, humanitarian and other areas to a new level\u201d.The Kremlin confirmed it had invited North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the end of the second word war in Europe.The trip would be Kim\u2019s first outside North Korea since he became leader of regime following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011. The older Kim visited Russia in August 2011 in his armoured train for a meeting with then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev.The friendship agreement was announced on the same day that officials in Berlin said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would not attend the ceremony in Moscow \u2013 a snub believed to be in retaliation for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine.The leaders in Moscow and Pyongyang appear to have much in the way of common cause. The UN has targeted North Korea with sanctions since it tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, and is applying pressure on the Kremlin to end its military involvement in Ukraine.The shift in North Korea\u2019s diplomatic focus towards Russia has been accelerated by tensions with China, Pyongyang\u2019s traditional ally and aid giver. China barely disguised its irritation with Kim after he ordered North Korea\u2019s third nuclear test in 2013 and the execution later that year of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had been instrumental in forging closer co-operation with Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping has yet to meet Kim; significantly, though, he has met South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, several times.In an apparent attempt to counter Russian influence, China has approved increased co-operation with North Korea along their border and indicated it would be willing to hold a bilateral summit.Xi and Kim could also find themselves face to face at the war commemorations in May.Putin would doubtless welcome the international opprobrium that would follow a public appearance alongside Kim in Moscow this spring. North Korea, meanwhile, stands to gain financially and militarily from closer ties with Russia. In 2014 Moscow cancelled almost US$10bn, or 90%, of North Korea\u2019s bilateral debt and said it would invest the remaining $1.09bn \u2013 to be paid back over 20 years \u2013 in infrastructure projects such as a cross-border gas pipeline between Russia and the North, and a rail link to South Korea.Russia has also offered to invest $25bn in North Korea\u2019s creaking rail network in return for access to mineral resources.It remains to be seen how a closer the Putin-Kim relationship will affect international attempts to end the North\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. Talks involving North Korea, Russia, the US, China, South Korea and Japan to reach a nuclear deal have been stalled since 2009.North Korea is believed to possess between 10 and 16 nuclear weapons developed using plutonium or weapons-grade uranium. A recent report by US researchers warned that Pyongyang was poised to expand its nuclear programme over the next five years. A worst-case scenario would see it armed with as many as 100 nuclear weapons by end of the decade, the report said.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Russia", "Ukraine", "World news"], "title": "North Korea and Russia forge \u2018year of friendship\u2019 pariah alliance"},{"date": "2015-01-29T12:29:40Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "In North Korea, men and women wear their ideology on their skin.Tattoos are a time-honoured form of self-expression created within the political lexicon of one of the world\u2019s most isolated countries.For many men in their late teens beginning their mandatory military service, tattoos offer a limited way to express themselves.

A great deal, apparently. On 31 January 2015, a North Korean government-run website posted an 18-minute video titled The Human Rights Propaganda Puppet, Yeon-mi Park, which denounced the charismatic 21-year-old defector. It was the latest attack in a smear campaign aimed at silencing Yeon-mi, a human rights activist and outspoken critic of the world\u2019s most repressive and secretive regime.Attacks on prominent North Korean defectors are nothing new. These individuals regularly endure charges that they lie and exaggerate. Occasionally there are death threats. Park Sang-hak, who launches helium balloons laden with USB sticks and anti-regime leaflets into North Korean airspace, has been called \u201chuman scum\u201d who will \u201cpay for his crimes in blood\u201d. Sometimes the threats go beyond mere rhetoric: in 2011, a hitman with a poison-tipped needle was intercepted in South Korea on his way to kill Park Sang-hak. In 1997 the nephew of one of Kim Jong-il\u2019s mistresses was gunned down outside Seoul; he had recently published an expose about the dictator\u2019s family. But the regime\u2019s most common weapon against its critics is character assassination. Related: Journey of a North Korean defector: from escaping by bike to singing at Harvard \u201cOne of the very few growing industries in North Korea is this operation of trying to compromise defectors and witnesses,\u201d says Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the US Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. The smears and threats have ramped up in the wake of a UN report documenting crimes against humanity in North Korea and recommending that the case be referred to the International Criminal Court. The UN findings were based on the testimony of more than 300 defectors who painted a picture of institutionalised cruelty within the regime, including mass incarceration in forced labour camps. North Korea has tried \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to discredit the entire report because one of its well-known witnesses, Shin Dong-hyuk, later admitted to changing parts of his biography. \u201cThe fundamental building blocks of Shin\u2019s story remain the same,\u201d says Scarlatoiu. \u201cHe was still a political prisoner and still tortured.\u201d But the controversy highlights a tragic catch-22: sometimes the traumatic firsthand experiences that make defectors such powerful witnesses also make them vulnerable to assaults on their credibility.Yeon-mi did not testify before the UN inquiry, but became a YouTube sensation last autumn, following her emotional speech at the One Young World Summit in Dublin. Looking like a fragile porcelain doll dressed in a flowing pink hanbok (traditional Korean dress), Yeon-mi took the podium and, fighting to keep her composure, told a harrowing and heartbreaking story: \u201cNorth Korea is an unimaginable country,\u201d she began in halting English. \u201cWe aren\u2019t free to sing, say, wear or think what we want.\u201dShe said she believed the dictator could hear her thoughts, and she described the hideous punishments meted out to those who broke the rules or expressed doubt about the regime. When she was nine years old she saw her friend\u2019s mother publicly executed for a minor infraction. When she was 13, she fled into China, only to see her mother raped by a human trafficker. Her father later died in China, where she buried his ashes in secret. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even cry,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid to be sent back to North Korea.\u201dEventually Yeon-mi and her mother escaped into Mongolia by walking and crawling across the frozen Gobi desert, following the stars north to freedom. By the time Yeon-mi had finished with a plea to \u201cshed light on the darkest place in the world\u201d, the whole audience was in tears and on its feet.After her Dublin speech, Yeon-mi became the human face of North Korea\u2019s oppressed. The media clamoured for interviews. A book deal followed, which was where I came into the picture. As Yeon-mi\u2019s \u201ccollaborator\u201d \u2013 a publishing term for a writer who helps an author find her voice and turn her story into a narrative \u2013 I was immediately taken with the power of Yeon-mi\u2019s testimony, as well as the warmth of her personality and her playful sense of humour. It was hard to fathom how this vibrant young woman could have suffered such an ordeal.As soon as we began working together, I noticed there were some minor discrepancies in the articles written about Yeon-mi, a jumbling of dates and places and some inconsistent details about her family\u2019s escape. Most of these issues could be explained by a language barrier \u2013 Yeon-mi was giving interviews in English before she was fully fluent. But Yeon-mi was also protecting a secret, something she had tried to bury and forget from the moment she arrived in South Korea at age 15: like tens of thousands of other refugees, Yeon-mi had been trafficked in China. In South Korea \u2013 and many other societies \u2013 admitting to such a \u201cshameful\u201d past would destroy her prospects for marriage and any sort of normal life.She had hoped that by changing a few details about her escape she could avoid revealing the full story. But after she decided to plunge into human rights activism, she realised that without the whole truth, the story of her life would have no real power or meaning. She has apologised for any discrepancies in her public record, and is determined that her book be scrupulously accurate.With Yeon-mi\u2019s cooperation, I have been able to verify her story through family members and fellow defectors who knew her in North Korea and China. Sometimes Yeon-mi had forgotten or blocked out graphic details from her childhood, only to have the memories return in all their horror as we reviewed her recollections with other witnesses. It seemed that she wasn\u2019t just remembering these things, but actually reliving them.Countless scientific studies have shown that trauma changes how the brain processes memory. It turns out that scrambling details and confusing time frames is actually a sign that the trauma survivor is being truthful \u2013 they honestly can\u2019t remember things in sequence. Dr Judith Herman, clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard and author of Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence from Domestic Abuse to Political Terror, tells me: \u201cTraumatised people don\u2019t give you a perfect, complete narrative on the first go-round. You see this all the time with refugees seeking asylum. That doesn\u2019t mean their story isn\u2019t credible, because the gist of their story is consistent.\u201dAccording to Herman, more and more judges in US asylum hearings understand and accept the impact of trauma on memory. Unfortunately the general public can be less forgiving. Which is why North Korea, its sympathisers and dupes have been able to exploit the discrepancies in some defectors\u2019 stories as a weapon to attack their motives.A few days before Christmas last year I checked my inbox and found a mysterious email warning me not to write the book with Yeon-mi and help \u201cspread her lies\u201d. Then came the North Korean video. Despite having the production values of a Stalin-era newsreel, the footage was chilling: some of her uncles, aunts and cousins still living in North Korea were paraded in front of the camera to denounce her. The worst they could come up with was that Yeon-mi was an ambitious child. But it was horrifying for her to see them so vulnerable. At least she knew they were still alive.Yeon-mi continues to work on her book and to speak out for freedom in North Korea. On Human Rights Day last 10 December, Yeon-mi appeared on a panel at the US State Department with another outspoken defector named Joseph Kim. In many public forums, Kim has told how he watched his father wither and die from starvation, how his sister disappeared and his mother left home, and how he survived as a street kid, scrabbling for crusts of bread. \u201cHunger is humiliation,\u201d he says. \u201cHunger is helplessness.\u201d But on this day he added something new: his mother had sold his sister to a man in China, thinking it was better than sending her back to North Korea.\u201cThis is an important part of my story,\u201d said Kim, \u201cthat I hope illustrates how difficult and desperate the life is, and how many North Korean mothers were forced to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.\u201dDoes this fresh revelation in any way diminish this remarkable young man\u2019s credibility? Absolutely not. It only shows how traumatic narratives sometimes come out in fits and starts. The whole story does not emerge until the survivor finds a way to tell it. But for those who have the patience to listen closely, the stories gather and build to a heroic and truthful testimony of survival that cannot be silenced.\u2022 Author and journalist Maryanne Vollers has collaborated on several memoirs including Living History by Hillary Clinton.

Looking like a fragile porcelain doll dressed in a flowing pink hanbok (traditional Korean dress), Yeon-mi took the podium and, fighting to keep her composure, told a harrowing and heartbreaking story: \u201cNorth Korea is an unimaginable country,\u201d she began in halting English. \u201cWe aren\u2019t free to sing, say, wear or think what we want.\u201dShe said she believed the dictator could hear her thoughts, and she described the hideous punishments meted out to those who broke the rules or expressed doubt about the regime.

By the time Yeon-mi had finished with a plea to \u201cshed light on the darkest place in the world\u201d, the whole audience was in tears and on its feet.After her Dublin speech, Yeon-mi became the human face of North Korea\u2019s oppressed. The media clamoured for interviews. A book deal followed, which was where I came into the picture. As Yeon-mi\u2019s \u201ccollaborator\u201d \u2013 a publishing term for a writer who helps an author find her voice and turn her story into a narrative \u2013 I was immediately taken with the power of Yeon-mi\u2019s testimony, as well as the warmth of her personality and her playful sense of humour. It was hard to fathom how this vibrant young woman could have suffered such an ordeal.As soon as we began working together, I noticed there were some minor discrepancies in the articles written about Yeon-mi, a jumbling of dates and places and some inconsistent details about her family\u2019s escape. Most of these issues could be explained by a language barrier \u2013 Yeon-mi was giving interviews in English before she was fully fluent. But Yeon-mi was also protecting a secret, something she had tried to bury and forget from the moment she arrived in South Korea at age 15: like tens of thousands of other refugees, Yeon-mi had been trafficked in China. In South Korea \u2013 and many other societies \u2013 admitting to such a \u201cshameful\u201d past would destroy her prospects for marriage and any sort of normal life.She had hoped that by changing a few details about her escape she could avoid revealing the full story. But after she decided to plunge into human rights activism, she realised that without the whole truth, the story of her life would have no real power or meaning. She has apologised for any discrepancies in her public record, and is determined that her book be scrupulously accurate.With Yeon-mi\u2019s cooperation, I have been able to verify her story through family members and fellow defectors who knew her in North Korea and China. Sometimes Yeon-mi had forgotten or blocked out graphic details from her childhood, only to have the memories return in all their horror as we reviewed her recollections with other witnesses. It seemed that she wasn\u2019t just remembering these things, but actually reliving them.Countless scientific studies have shown that trauma changes how the brain processes memory. It turns out that scrambling details and confusing time frames is actually a sign that the trauma survivor is being truthful \u2013 they honestly can\u2019t remember things in sequence. Dr Judith Herman, clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard and author of Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence from Domestic Abuse to Political Terror, tells me: \u201cTraumatised people don\u2019t give you a perfect, complete narrative on the first go-round. You see this all the time with refugees seeking asylum. That doesn\u2019t mean their story isn\u2019t credible, because the gist of their story is consistent.\u201dAccording to Herman, more and more judges in US asylum hearings understand and accept the impact of trauma on memory. Unfortunately the general public can be less forgiving. Which is why North Korea, its sympathisers and dupes have been able to exploit the discrepancies in some defectors\u2019 stories as a weapon to attack their motives.A few days before Christmas last year I checked my inbox and found a mysterious email warning me not to write the book with Yeon-mi and help \u201cspread her lies\u201d. Then came the North Korean video. Despite having the production values of a Stalin-era newsreel, the footage was chilling: some of her uncles, aunts and cousins still living in North Korea were paraded in front of the camera to denounce her. The worst they could come up with was that Yeon-mi was an ambitious child. But it was horrifying for her to see them so vulnerable. At least she knew they were still alive.Yeon-mi continues to work on her book and to speak out for freedom in North Korea. On Human Rights Day last 10 December, Yeon-mi appeared on a panel at the US State Department with another outspoken defector named Joseph Kim. In many public forums, Kim has told how he watched his father wither and die from starvation, how his sister disappeared and his mother left home, and how he survived as a street kid, scrabbling for crusts of bread. \u201cHunger is humiliation,\u201d he says. \u201cHunger is helplessness.\u201d But on this day he added something new: his mother had sold his sister to a man in China, thinking it was better than sending her back to North Korea.\u201cThis is an important part of my story,\u201d said Kim, \u201cthat I hope illustrates how difficult and desperate the life is, and how many North Korean mothers were forced to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.\u201dDoes this fresh revelation in any way diminish this remarkable young man\u2019s credibility? Absolutely not. It only shows how traumatic narratives sometimes come out in fits and starts. The whole story does not emerge until the survivor finds a way to tell it. But for those who have the patience to listen closely, the stories gather and build to a heroic and truthful testimony of survival that cannot be silenced.\u2022 Author and journalist Maryanne Vollers has collaborated on several memoirs including Living History by Hillary Clinton.

The Russian foreign ministry said the agreement was designed to elevate ties \u201cin the political, economic, humanitarian and other areas to a new level\u201d.The Kremlin confirmed it had invited North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the end of the second word war in Europe.The trip would be Kim\u2019s first outside North Korea since he became leader of regime following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011. The older Kim visited Russia in August 2011 in his armoured train for a meeting with then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev.The friendship agreement was announced on the same day that officials in Berlin said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would not attend the ceremony in Moscow \u2013 a snub believed to be in retaliation for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine.The leaders in Moscow and Pyongyang appear to have much in the way of common cause. The UN has targeted North Korea with sanctions since it tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, and is applying pressure on the Kremlin to end its military involvement in Ukraine.The shift in North Korea\u2019s diplomatic focus towards Russia has been accelerated by tensions with China, Pyongyang\u2019s traditional ally and aid giver. China barely disguised its irritation with Kim after he ordered North Korea\u2019s third nuclear test in 2013 and the execution later that year of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had been instrumental in forging closer co-operation with Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping has yet to meet Kim; significantly, though, he has met South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, several times.In an apparent attempt to counter Russian influence, China has approved increased co-operation with North Korea along their border and indicated it would be willing to hold a bilateral summit.Xi and Kim could also find themselves face to face at the war commemorations in May.Putin would doubtless welcome the international opprobrium that would follow a public appearance alongside Kim in Moscow this spring. North Korea, meanwhile, stands to gain financially and militarily from closer ties with Russia. In 2014 Moscow cancelled almost US$10bn, or 90%, of North Korea\u2019s bilateral debt and said it would invest the remaining $1.09bn \u2013 to be paid back over 20 years \u2013 in infrastructure projects such as a cross-border gas pipeline between Russia and the North, and a rail link to South Korea.Russia has also offered to invest $25bn in North Korea\u2019s creaking rail network in return for access to mineral resources.It remains to be seen how a closer the Putin-Kim relationship will affect international attempts to end the North\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. Talks involving North Korea, Russia, the US, China, South Korea and Japan to reach a nuclear deal have been stalled since 2009.North Korea is believed to possess between 10 and 16 nuclear weapons developed using plutonium or weapons-grade uranium. A recent report by US researchers warned that Pyongyang was poised to expand its nuclear programme over the next five years. A worst-case scenario would see it armed with as many as 100 nuclear weapons by end of the decade, the report said.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Russia", "Ukraine", "World news"], "title": "North Korea and Russia forge \u2018year of friendship\u2019 pariah alliance"},{"date": "2015-01-31T05:00:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is making military service mandatory for young women in a bid to strengthen the nation\u2019s armed forces, sources inside the secretive state have told DailyNK.The measure is said to apply to women aged between 17 and 20, and has been handed down to mobilisation offices in each province, city, and county. Implementation is reported to be already underway.\u201cLate last year, we received orders for all women who have graduated from middle and high school to undergo mandatory military service,\u201d a source based in North Hamkyung Province told Daily NK this week.\u201cThe preliminary screening and physicals related to enlistment, which begins in April, are all complete and duty sectors have been organised,\u201d the source said.Screenings look for physical problems or contagious diseases. The minimum height requirement for women to serve was lowered to 142cm in 2012, but this standard is not strictly enforced, according to the source. The military is said to be hoping to make up for a shortfall in troop numbers in its \u201cmillion-man army\u201dCustomarily, enlistment in North Korea occurs twice a year in April and August, and up until now, women served on a voluntarily basis, while men invariably underwent mandatory service.School graduates (17-18 years-old) enlist in April, while the enlistment period for workers at or under the age of 20 takes place in August.This new policy, however, is not expected to compel women to serve the same length of time as men. \u201cUnlike men, who have to serve for 10 years, mandatory service for women is only up to the age of 23,\u201d the source said.The military is said to be hoping to make up for a shortfall in troop numbers in its \u201cmillion-man army\u201d, following the high child mortality rate and low birth rate stemming from the Arduous March, the name given to the North Korean famine in the 1990s.The source explained that this year\u2019s admission quotas for female applicants to universities and technical schools have yet to be announced, presumably \u201cto only recommend those who have completed their military service or exceptionally gifted students from special schools who may be exempt from service altogether.\u201d The new directive is said to have caused concern among the public; women tend to be key breadwinners for their families by engaging in various types of business. In March 2003, at the sixth session of the 10th Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, it was announced that military service was to be reduced to 10 years from 13 for men, and to seven from 10 for women. Only women signing up voluntarily were to serve, while men in some specialised units would still be required to fulfil 13 years of service. Translated by Jiyeon Lee.

It is evidently agitation of terrorism quite contrary to the purpose and nature of the Berlin International Film Festival.\u201dIt continued: \u201cThe US and Germany should immediately stop the farce of screening the anti-North Korean movie at the film festival. Those who attempt at terrorist acts and commit politically-motivated provocations and those who join them in violation of the sovereignty and dignity of North Korea will never be able to escape merciless punishment.\u201dFestival head Dieter Kosslick was reportedly forced to meet with the North Korean ambassador to Germany to explain. A spokesperson told Variety the situation was now resolved and Pyongyang understood the comedy was not being screened at the Berlinale.North Korea\u2019s ire over The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-un by two bumbling American journalists (Seth Rogen and James Franco), proved no laughing matter for Sony when a group linked by the FBI to Pyongyang began releasing embarrassing private emails online, as well as five upcoming movies, following a cyber attack in December. The studio appeared to bow to threats of further revelations when it cancelled the film\u2019s theatrical release, but was later forced into a U-turn after Barack Obama went public to suggest executives should not have caved into the demands.The Interview has since gone on to make more than $45m via on demand and a limited US release in cinemas, and could even be on course to recoup the lion\u2019s share of its $75m budget.

State approved animosity for \u2018American imperialists,\u2019 slogans trumpeting their fearlessness, and simple designs representing accepted narratives of conflict and sexuality are common.Defectors say the growing popularity of tattoos written in English also reflects changes in the economic, political and cultural landscape.There were plenty [of phrases] to choose from, like: Defend the Fatherland! Victory! and Battle!\u201cIn my father\u2019s generation it used to be really popular to get tattoos of a North Korean soldier killing an American invader,\u201d says Kim Shin-woo, who arrived in South Korea from the DPRK, also known as North Korea, in 2007.\u201cThere were plenty [of phrases] to choose from, like: Defend the Fatherland!

They have \u2018one against one hundred\u2019 on their arms, to show how they could kill a hundred enemies in battle.\u201d Of course, tattoos are not always political. \u201cI\u2019ve even seen some guys with images of nude women tattooed on their body,\u201d says Shin Hyun-jae. \u201cBears are a popular image \u2013 a bear playing an accordion \u2013 and sometimes guys get a dragon on their arm or down their backs.\u201dHaving a picture of Kim Jong-un\u2019s smiling face emblazoned on your bicep would lead to swift punishmentDefectors say that while such combative designs are still common, cosmological symbols and Chinese characters are also becoming popular.\u201cPictures of doves representing peace or an eagle for strength are common too,\u201d says Kim. \u201cIt\u2019s also been trendy to have the unified Korean peninsula as a tattoo.\u201dAbsent from the list of desired images, however, is anything associated with the Kim dynasty. Having a picture of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s smiling face emblazoned on your bicep would lead to swift punishment for all involved; while embodying the state with tattoos of government-approved images is tolerated, images of the ruling family are sacrosanct. The state holds the monopoly on the reproduction of such iconography. In North Korea, if a woman has a tattoo it usually means she comes from a bad familyIn many respects, getting a tattoo in North Korea is similar to the process one would follow in many other areas of the world. The customer takes a picture of their desired image to their local tattooist (in the North, they usually work out of their homes), or simply describe it.The biggest struggle for the mostly self-taught artists is finding the ink to draw the image. Tattoos in the DPRK are usually entirely monochrome and performed using sewing needles \u2013 tattooing needles also a rare luxury \u2013 dipped in ink and then applied to the area.The biggest struggle for the mostly self-taught artists is finding the ink to draw the imageIt seems that the tattooing industry is one area where international sanctions may have proved unintentionally effective. \u201cInk and medical swabs used to be imported by North Korea-supporting Koreans in Japan,\u201d says Sun Dong-hyun, who defected in the mid-2000s. The imports ended when sanctions were introduced. \u201cThat\u2019s all dried up and now a lot of it has to come in across the Sino-Korean border.\u201dDefectors have told me \u201cthere were lots of famous tattoo artists in North Korea,\u201d but \u201cthese days they are few and far between.\u201d Tattooing is a difficult way to make a living, given the struggle to find equipment. According to testimonies, tattoos have also become less common in civilian life, and mostly continues for those in the military.

Dr Judith Herman, clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard and author of Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence from Domestic Abuse to Political Terror, tells me: \u201cTraumatised people don\u2019t give you a perfect, complete narrative on the first go-round. You see this all the time with refugees seeking asylum. That doesn\u2019t mean their story isn\u2019t credible, because the gist of their story is consistent.\u201dAccording to Herman, more and more judges in US asylum hearings understand and accept the impact of trauma on memory. Unfortunately the general public can be less forgiving. Which is why North Korea, its sympathisers and dupes have been able to exploit the discrepancies in some defectors\u2019 stories as a weapon to attack their motives.A few days before Christmas last year I checked my inbox and found a mysterious email warning me not to write the book with Yeon-mi and help \u201cspread her lies\u201d. Then came the North Korean video. Despite having the production values of a Stalin-era newsreel, the footage was chilling: some of her uncles, aunts and cousins still living in North Korea were paraded in front of the camera to denounce her. The worst they could come up with was that Yeon-mi was an ambitious child. But it was horrifying for her to see them so vulnerable. At least she knew they were still alive.Yeon-mi continues to work on her book and to speak out for freedom in North Korea. On Human Rights Day last 10 December, Yeon-mi appeared on a panel at the US State Department with another outspoken defector named Joseph Kim. In many public forums, Kim has told how he watched his father wither and die from starvation, how his sister disappeared and his mother left home, and how he survived as a street kid, scrabbling for crusts of bread. \u201cHunger is humiliation,\u201d he says. \u201cHunger is helplessness.\u201d But on this day he added something new: his mother had sold his sister to a man in China, thinking it was better than sending her back to North Korea.\u201cThis is an important part of my story,\u201d said Kim, \u201cthat I hope illustrates how difficult and desperate the life is, and how many North Korean mothers were forced to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.\u201dDoes this fresh revelation in any way diminish this remarkable young man\u2019s credibility? Absolutely not. It only shows how traumatic narratives sometimes come out in fits and starts. The whole story does not emerge until the survivor finds a way to tell it. But for those who have the patience to listen closely, the stories gather and build to a heroic and truthful testimony of survival that cannot be silenced.\u2022 Author and journalist Maryanne Vollers has collaborated on several memoirs including Living History by Hillary Clinton.

The Russian foreign ministry said the agreement was designed to elevate ties \u201cin the political, economic, humanitarian and other areas to a new level\u201d.The Kremlin confirmed it had invited North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the end of the second word war in Europe.The trip would be Kim\u2019s first outside North Korea since he became leader of regime following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011. The older Kim visited Russia in August 2011 in his armoured train for a meeting with then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev.The friendship agreement was announced on the same day that officials in Berlin said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would not attend the ceremony in Moscow \u2013 a snub believed to be in retaliation for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine.The leaders in Moscow and Pyongyang appear to have much in the way of common cause. The UN has targeted North Korea with sanctions since it tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, and is applying pressure on the Kremlin to end its military involvement in Ukraine.The shift in North Korea\u2019s diplomatic focus towards Russia has been accelerated by tensions with China, Pyongyang\u2019s traditional ally and aid giver. China barely disguised its irritation with Kim after he ordered North Korea\u2019s third nuclear test in 2013 and the execution later that year of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had been instrumental in forging closer co-operation with Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping has yet to meet Kim; significantly, though, he has met South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, several times.In an apparent attempt to counter Russian influence, China has approved increased co-operation with North Korea along their border and indicated it would be willing to hold a bilateral summit.Xi and Kim could also find themselves face to face at the war commemorations in May.Putin would doubtless welcome the international opprobrium that would follow a public appearance alongside Kim in Moscow this spring. North Korea, meanwhile, stands to gain financially and militarily from closer ties with Russia. In 2014 Moscow cancelled almost US$10bn, or 90%, of North Korea\u2019s bilateral debt and said it would invest the remaining $1.09bn \u2013 to be paid back over 20 years \u2013 in infrastructure projects such as a cross-border gas pipeline between Russia and the North, and a rail link to South Korea.Russia has also offered to invest $25bn in North Korea\u2019s creaking rail network in return for access to mineral resources.It remains to be seen how a closer the Putin-Kim relationship will affect international attempts to end the North\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. Talks involving North Korea, Russia, the US, China, South Korea and Japan to reach a nuclear deal have been stalled since 2009.North Korea is believed to possess between 10 and 16 nuclear weapons developed using plutonium or weapons-grade uranium. A recent report by US researchers warned that Pyongyang was poised to expand its nuclear programme over the next five years. A worst-case scenario would see it armed with as many as 100 nuclear weapons by end of the decade, the report said.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Russia", "Ukraine", "World news"], "title": "North Korea and Russia forge \u2018year of friendship\u2019 pariah alliance"},{"date": "2015-01-31T05:00:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is making military service mandatory for young women in a bid to strengthen the nation\u2019s armed forces, sources inside the secretive state have told DailyNK.The measure is said to apply to women aged between 17 and 20, and has been handed down to mobilisation offices in each province, city, and county. Implementation is reported to be already underway.\u201cLate last year, we received orders for all women who have graduated from middle and high school to undergo mandatory military service,\u201d a source based in North Hamkyung Province told Daily NK this week.\u201cThe preliminary screening and physicals related to enlistment, which begins in April, are all complete and duty sectors have been organised,\u201d the source said.Screenings look for physical problems or contagious diseases. The minimum height requirement for women to serve was lowered to 142cm in 2012, but this standard is not strictly enforced, according to the source. The military is said to be hoping to make up for a shortfall in troop numbers in its \u201cmillion-man army\u201dCustomarily, enlistment in North Korea occurs twice a year in April and August, and up until now, women served on a voluntarily basis, while men invariably underwent mandatory service.School graduates (17-18 years-old) enlist in April, while the enlistment period for workers at or under the age of 20 takes place in August.This new policy, however, is not expected to compel women to serve the same length of time as men. \u201cUnlike men, who have to serve for 10 years, mandatory service for women is only up to the age of 23,\u201d the source said.The military is said to be hoping to make up for a shortfall in troop numbers in its \u201cmillion-man army\u201d, following the high child mortality rate and low birth rate stemming from the Arduous March, the name given to the North Korean famine in the 1990s.The source explained that this year\u2019s admission quotas for female applicants to universities and technical schools have yet to be announced, presumably \u201cto only recommend those who have completed their military service or exceptionally gifted students from special schools who may be exempt from service altogether.\u201d The new directive is said to have caused concern among the public; women tend to be key breadwinners for their families by engaging in various types of business. In March 2003, at the sixth session of the 10th Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, it was announced that military service was to be reduced to 10 years from 13 for men, and to seven from 10 for women. Only women signing up voluntarily were to serve, while men in some specialised units would still be required to fulfil 13 years of service. Translated by Jiyeon Lee.

In fact, Pyongyang appears to have confused the film festival, which commences on 5 February, with Germany\u2019s domestic release schedule: The Interview is due out in cinemas across the country the same day.The North Korean statement read: \u201cThe screening of the movie that hurts the dignity of the supreme leadership of North Korea and openly agitates state-sponsored terrorism has nothing to do with the \u2018freedom of expression\u2019 touted by Germany. It is evidently agitation of terrorism quite contrary to the purpose and nature of the Berlin International Film Festival.\u201dIt continued: \u201cThe US and Germany should immediately stop the farce of screening the anti-North Korean movie at the film festival. Those who attempt at terrorist acts and commit politically-motivated provocations and those who join them in violation of the sovereignty and dignity of North Korea will never be able to escape merciless punishment.\u201dFestival head Dieter Kosslick was reportedly forced to meet with the North Korean ambassador to Germany to explain. A spokesperson told Variety the situation was now resolved and Pyongyang understood the comedy was not being screened at the Berlinale.North Korea\u2019s ire over The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-un by two bumbling American journalists (Seth Rogen and James Franco), proved no laughing matter for Sony when a group linked by the FBI to Pyongyang began releasing embarrassing private emails online, as well as five upcoming movies, following a cyber attack in December. The studio appeared to bow to threats of further revelations when it cancelled the film\u2019s theatrical release, but was later forced into a U-turn after Barack Obama went public to suggest executives should not have caved into the demands.The Interview has since gone on to make more than $45m via on demand and a limited US release in cinemas, and could even be on course to recoup the lion\u2019s share of its $75m budget.

The programme, which offers a month-long teaching placement at Pyongyang Tourism College in the secretive country\u2019s capital city, is run by Juche Travel Services (JTS), a certified travel company which promises \u201cunparalleled levels of interaction and engagement with local Koreans.\u201d Volunteers will head up courses teaching English or tourism. The company says it is looking for people with a Tefl (teaching English as a foreign language) qualification or a background in tourism management, \u201cwho can contribute positively to growing the country\u2019s tourism industry\u201d.The scheme costs \u20ac1000 Euros (\u00a3765) for each volunteer which covers travel, accommodation and tourist excursions in the country. JTS says it is operating on a not-for-profit basis, with any excess funds to be spent on the tourism library at the college. The company says it is hoping to take up to five people on trips in May and November, but says it would consider alternative dates.Since 2009, western interest in travelling to North Korea has gathered momentum. An estimated 6,000 western tourists now visit every year through accredited tour companies, which includes US citizens, though their government \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d they do not travel there. Hundreds of thousands of tourists are estimated to come from neighbouring China each year. The ethics of travelling to North Korea are a subject of much debate. Some argue that greater interactions with the outside world is a positive development. Others have reservations about contributing financially to a regime accused of grave human rights abuses against its people, and travelling to a country where foreigners are escorted everywhere, and interactions with North Koreans are usually stage-managed with specially selected members of the public.Two of North Korea\u2019s biggest prestige projects in recent years have been the Masikryong ski resort and the \u2018tourist city\u2019 of Wonsan, and representatives promoting the country have begun to make themselves known on the world\u2019s travel forum circuit.\u201cThe country has made it clear that it is looking to grow its tourism sector in the coming years,\u201d said David Thompson from JTS. \u201cTo do so will require both international tourism expertise and foreign language skills.\u201dThompson said volunteers will be subject to the same limitations as other tourists in terms of where they can go inside North Korea, and who they can speak to. \u201cTo my knowledge there will not be the opportunity to wander freely,\u201d he said.21 year-old British student Ben Griffin was the first to sign up for a test trial for the volunteer programme last year in conjunction with North Korea\u2019s National Tourism Authority. He had travelled to North Korea on an official tour the year before and \u201cjumped on the chance\u201d to go again, he says. Griffin was not allowed freedom of movement, though he insists he did not feel closely monitored, and his guides were flexible with his itinerary if he made a request.In an enthusiastic account of his trip for Juche Travel he describes being driven around in luxury cars and using clips of the classic television show Only Fools and Horses to aide his English lessons. My students were on an advanced level although I\u2019m sure that they felt Del boy\u2019s cockney slang was almost a different language in itself.He says the show was a big hit: \u201cMy students were on an advanced level although I\u2019m sure that they felt Del boy\u2019s cockney slang was almost a different language in itself.

That can only be a good thing.\u201dChoson Exchange, an organisation working inside North Korea to educate young professionals in business, economic policy and law, has long-advocated for meaningful interaction with the country, especially through industry.

State approved animosity for \u2018American imperialists,\u2019 slogans trumpeting their fearlessness, and simple designs representing accepted narratives of conflict and sexuality are common.Defectors say the growing popularity of tattoos written in English also reflects changes in the economic, political and cultural landscape.There were plenty [of phrases] to choose from, like: Defend the Fatherland! Victory! and Battle!\u201cIn my father\u2019s generation it used to be really popular to get tattoos of a North Korean soldier killing an American invader,\u201d says Kim Shin-woo, who arrived in South Korea from the DPRK, also known as North Korea, in 2007.\u201cThere were plenty [of phrases] to choose from, like: Defend the Fatherland! Victory! and Battle! My father and uncle both have tattoos on their upper arms and biceps. They have \u2018one against one hundred\u2019 on their arms, to show how they could kill a hundred enemies in battle.\u201d Of course, tattoos are not always political. \u201cI\u2019ve even seen some guys with images of nude women tattooed on their body,\u201d says Shin Hyun-jae. \u201cBears are a popular image \u2013 a bear playing an accordion \u2013 and sometimes guys get a dragon on their arm or down their backs.\u201dHaving a picture of Kim Jong-un\u2019s smiling face emblazoned on your bicep would lead to swift punishmentDefectors say that while such combative designs are still common, cosmological symbols and Chinese characters are also becoming popular.\u201cPictures of doves representing peace or an eagle for strength are common too,\u201d says Kim. \u201cIt\u2019s also been trendy to have the unified Korean peninsula as a tattoo.\u201dAbsent from the list of desired images, however, is anything associated with the Kim dynasty. Having a picture of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s smiling face emblazoned on your bicep would lead to swift punishment for all involved; while embodying the state with tattoos of government-approved images is tolerated, images of the ruling family are sacrosanct. The state holds the monopoly on the reproduction of such iconography. In North Korea, if a woman has a tattoo it usually means she comes from a bad familyIn many respects, getting a tattoo in North Korea is similar to the process one would follow in many other areas of the world. The customer takes a picture of their desired image to their local tattooist (in the North, they usually work out of their homes), or simply describe it.The biggest struggle for the mostly self-taught artists is finding the ink to draw the image. Tattoos in the DPRK are usually entirely monochrome and performed using sewing needles \u2013 tattooing needles also a rare luxury \u2013 dipped in ink and then applied to the area.The biggest struggle for the mostly self-taught artists is finding the ink to draw the imageIt seems that the tattooing industry is one area where international sanctions may have proved unintentionally effective. \u201cInk and medical swabs used to be imported by North Korea-supporting Koreans in Japan,\u201d says Sun Dong-hyun, who defected in the mid-2000s. The imports ended when sanctions were introduced. \u201cThat\u2019s all dried up and now a lot of it has to come in across the Sino-Korean border.\u201dDefectors have told me \u201cthere were lots of famous tattoo artists in North Korea,\u201d but \u201cthese days they are few and far between.\u201d Tattooing is a difficult way to make a living, given the struggle to find equipment. According to testimonies, tattoos have also become less common in civilian life, and mostly continues for those in the military. For men, tattoos brought back from military service are worn as badges of honour representing the camaraderie experienced during long service to the state. Tattooed women, however, are frowned upon. \u201cIf a woman has a tattoo it usually means she comes from a bad family,\u201d says Shin. For those who escape the DPRK, distinctive tattoos quickly take on a more pernicious meaning, changing the bearer from patriot to criminal.In China, designs written in Korean calling for \u201crevolution!\u201d or \u201creunification!\u201d identify a person as North Korean, and threaten to expose them to authorities who repatriate undocumented North Koreans found in their territory.In South Korea, these markings again transform the status of the wearer, this time from patriot to pariah. As such, North Koreans are told to have them removed by staff in Hanawon, the centre in which North Korean refugees learn how to live like a South Korean. In 2009, South Korea\u2019s Association for Assistance to North Korean Escapees announced it would pay 70% of the cost of tattoo removal, up to 500,000 won ($320).

A great deal, apparently. On 31 January 2015, a North Korean government-run website posted an 18-minute video titled The Human Rights Propaganda Puppet, Yeon-mi Park, which denounced the charismatic 21-year-old defector. It was the latest attack in a smear campaign aimed at silencing Yeon-mi, a human rights activist and outspoken critic of the world\u2019s most repressive and secretive regime.Attacks on prominent North Korean defectors are nothing new. These individuals regularly endure charges that they lie and exaggerate. Occasionally there are death threats. Park Sang-hak, who launches helium balloons laden with USB sticks and anti-regime leaflets into North Korean airspace, has been called \u201chuman scum\u201d who will \u201cpay for his crimes in blood\u201d. Sometimes the threats go beyond mere rhetoric: in 2011, a hitman with a poison-tipped needle was intercepted in South Korea on his way to kill Park Sang-hak. In 1997 the nephew of one of Kim Jong-il\u2019s mistresses was gunned down outside Seoul; he had recently published an expose about the dictator\u2019s family. But the regime\u2019s most common weapon against its critics is character assassination. Related: Journey of a North Korean defector: from escaping by bike to singing at Harvard \u201cOne of the very few growing industries in North Korea is this operation of trying to compromise defectors and witnesses,\u201d says Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the US Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. The smears and threats have ramped up in the wake of a UN report documenting crimes against humanity in North Korea and recommending that the case be referred to the International Criminal Court. The UN findings were based on the testimony of more than 300 defectors who painted a picture of institutionalised cruelty within the regime, including mass incarceration in forced labour camps. North Korea has tried \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to discredit the entire report because one of its well-known witnesses, Shin Dong-hyuk, later admitted to changing parts of his biography. \u201cThe fundamental building blocks of Shin\u2019s story remain the same,\u201d says Scarlatoiu. \u201cHe was still a political prisoner and still tortured.\u201d But the controversy highlights a tragic catch-22: sometimes the traumatic firsthand experiences that make defectors such powerful witnesses also make them vulnerable to assaults on their credibility.Yeon-mi did not testify before the UN inquiry, but became a YouTube sensation last autumn, following her emotional speech at the One Young World Summit in Dublin. Looking like a fragile porcelain doll dressed in a flowing pink hanbok (traditional Korean dress), Yeon-mi took the podium and, fighting to keep her composure, told a harrowing and heartbreaking story: \u201cNorth Korea is an unimaginable country,\u201d she began in halting English. \u201cWe aren\u2019t free to sing, say, wear or think what we want.\u201dShe said she believed the dictator could hear her thoughts, and she described the hideous punishments meted out to those who broke the rules or expressed doubt about the regime. When she was nine years old she saw her friend\u2019s mother publicly executed for a minor infraction. When she was 13, she fled into China, only to see her mother raped by a human trafficker. Her father later died in China, where she buried his ashes in secret. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even cry,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid to be sent back to North Korea.\u201dEventually Yeon-mi and her mother escaped into Mongolia by walking and crawling across the frozen Gobi desert, following the stars north to freedom. By the time Yeon-mi had finished with a plea to \u201cshed light on the darkest place in the world\u201d, the whole audience was in tears and on its feet.After her Dublin speech, Yeon-mi became the human face of North Korea\u2019s oppressed. The media clamoured for interviews. A book deal followed, which was where I came into the picture. As Yeon-mi\u2019s \u201ccollaborator\u201d \u2013 a publishing term for a writer who helps an author find her voice and turn her story into a narrative \u2013 I was immediately taken with the power of Yeon-mi\u2019s testimony, as well as the warmth of her personality and her playful sense of humour. It was hard to fathom how this vibrant young woman could have suffered such an ordeal.As soon as we began working together, I noticed there were some minor discrepancies in the articles written about Yeon-mi, a jumbling of dates and places and some inconsistent details about her family\u2019s escape. Most of these issues could be explained by a language barrier \u2013 Yeon-mi was giving interviews in English before she was fully fluent. But Yeon-mi was also protecting a secret, something she had tried to bury and forget from the moment she arrived in South Korea at age 15: like tens of thousands of other refugees, Yeon-mi had been trafficked in China. In South Korea \u2013 and many other societies \u2013 admitting to such a \u201cshameful\u201d past would destroy her prospects for marriage and any sort of normal life.She had hoped that by changing a few details about her escape she could avoid revealing the full story. But after she decided to plunge into human rights activism, she realised that without the whole truth, the story of her life would have no real power or meaning. She has apologised for any discrepancies in her public record, and is determined that her book be scrupulously accurate.With Yeon-mi\u2019s cooperation, I have been able to verify her story through family members and fellow defectors who knew her in North Korea and China. Sometimes Yeon-mi had forgotten or blocked out graphic details from her childhood, only to have the memories return in all their horror as we reviewed her recollections with other witnesses. It seemed that she wasn\u2019t just remembering these things, but actually reliving them.Countless scientific studies have shown that trauma changes how the brain processes memory.

In many public forums, Kim has told how he watched his father wither and die from starvation, how his sister disappeared and his mother left home, and how he survived as a street kid, scrabbling for crusts of bread. \u201cHunger is humiliation,\u201d he says. \u201cHunger is helplessness.\u201d But on this day he added something new: his mother had sold his sister to a man in China, thinking it was better than sending her back to North Korea.\u201cThis is an important part of my story,\u201d said Kim, \u201cthat I hope illustrates how difficult and desperate the life is, and how many North Korean mothers were forced to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.\u201dDoes this fresh revelation in any way diminish this remarkable young man\u2019s credibility? Absolutely not. It only shows how traumatic narratives sometimes come out in fits and starts. The whole story does not emerge until the survivor finds a way to tell it. But for those who have the patience to listen closely, the stories gather and build to a heroic and truthful testimony of survival that cannot be silenced.\u2022 Author and journalist Maryanne Vollers has collaborated on several memoirs including Living History by Hillary Clinton.

The Russian foreign ministry said the agreement was designed to elevate ties \u201cin the political, economic, humanitarian and other areas to a new level\u201d.The Kremlin confirmed it had invited North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the end of the second word war in Europe.The trip would be Kim\u2019s first outside North Korea since he became leader of regime following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011. The older Kim visited Russia in August 2011 in his armoured train for a meeting with then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev.The friendship agreement was announced on the same day that officials in Berlin said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would not attend the ceremony in Moscow \u2013 a snub believed to be in retaliation for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine.The leaders in Moscow and Pyongyang appear to have much in the way of common cause. The UN has targeted North Korea with sanctions since it tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, and is applying pressure on the Kremlin to end its military involvement in Ukraine.The shift in North Korea\u2019s diplomatic focus towards Russia has been accelerated by tensions with China, Pyongyang\u2019s traditional ally and aid giver. China barely disguised its irritation with Kim after he ordered North Korea\u2019s third nuclear test in 2013 and the execution later that year of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had been instrumental in forging closer co-operation with Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping has yet to meet Kim; significantly, though, he has met South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, several times.In an apparent attempt to counter Russian influence, China has approved increased co-operation with North Korea along their border and indicated it would be willing to hold a bilateral summit.Xi and Kim could also find themselves face to face at the war commemorations in May.Putin would doubtless welcome the international opprobrium that would follow a public appearance alongside Kim in Moscow this spring. North Korea, meanwhile, stands to gain financially and militarily from closer ties with Russia. In 2014 Moscow cancelled almost US$10bn, or 90%, of North Korea\u2019s bilateral debt and said it would invest the remaining $1.09bn \u2013 to be paid back over 20 years \u2013 in infrastructure projects such as a cross-border gas pipeline between Russia and the North, and a rail link to South Korea.Russia has also offered to invest $25bn in North Korea\u2019s creaking rail network in return for access to mineral resources.It remains to be seen how a closer the Putin-Kim relationship will affect international attempts to end the North\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. Talks involving North Korea, Russia, the US, China, South Korea and Japan to reach a nuclear deal have been stalled since 2009.North Korea is believed to possess between 10 and 16 nuclear weapons developed using plutonium or weapons-grade uranium. A recent report by US researchers warned that Pyongyang was poised to expand its nuclear programme over the next five years. A worst-case scenario would see it armed with as many as 100 nuclear weapons by end of the decade, the report said.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Russia", "Ukraine", "World news"], "title": "North Korea and Russia forge \u2018year of friendship\u2019 pariah alliance"},{"date": "2015-01-31T05:00:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is making military service mandatory for young women in a bid to strengthen the nation\u2019s armed forces, sources inside the secretive state have told DailyNK.The measure is said to apply to women aged between 17 and 20, and has been handed down to mobilisation offices in each province, city, and county. Implementation is reported to be already underway.\u201cLate last year, we received orders for all women who have graduated from middle and high school to undergo mandatory military service,\u201d a source based in North Hamkyung Province told Daily NK this week.\u201cThe preliminary screening and physicals related to enlistment, which begins in April, are all complete and duty sectors have been organised,\u201d the source said.Screenings look for physical problems or contagious diseases. The minimum height requirement for women to serve was lowered to 142cm in 2012, but this standard is not strictly enforced, according to the source. The military is said to be hoping to make up for a shortfall in troop numbers in its \u201cmillion-man army\u201dCustomarily, enlistment in North Korea occurs twice a year in April and August, and up until now, women served on a voluntarily basis, while men invariably underwent mandatory service.School graduates (17-18 years-old) enlist in April, while the enlistment period for workers at or under the age of 20 takes place in August.This new policy, however, is not expected to compel women to serve the same length of time as men. \u201cUnlike men, who have to serve for 10 years, mandatory service for women is only up to the age of 23,\u201d the source said.The military is said to be hoping to make up for a shortfall in troop numbers in its \u201cmillion-man army\u201d, following the high child mortality rate and low birth rate stemming from the Arduous March, the name given to the North Korean famine in the 1990s.The source explained that this year\u2019s admission quotas for female applicants to universities and technical schools have yet to be announced, presumably \u201cto only recommend those who have completed their military service or exceptionally gifted students from special schools who may be exempt from service altogether.\u201d The new directive is said to have caused concern among the public; women tend to be key breadwinners for their families by engaging in various types of business. In March 2003, at the sixth session of the 10th Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, it was announced that military service was to be reduced to 10 years from 13 for men, and to seven from 10 for women. Only women signing up voluntarily were to serve, while men in some specialised units would still be required to fulfil 13 years of service. Translated by Jiyeon Lee.

In fact, Pyongyang appears to have confused the film festival, which commences on 5 February, with Germany\u2019s domestic release schedule: The Interview is due out in cinemas across the country the same day.The North Korean statement read: \u201cThe screening of the movie that hurts the dignity of the supreme leadership of North Korea and openly agitates state-sponsored terrorism has nothing to do with the \u2018freedom of expression\u2019 touted by Germany. It is evidently agitation of terrorism quite contrary to the purpose and nature of the Berlin International Film Festival.\u201dIt continued: \u201cThe US and Germany should immediately stop the farce of screening the anti-North Korean movie at the film festival. Those who attempt at terrorist acts and commit politically-motivated provocations and those who join them in violation of the sovereignty and dignity of North Korea will never be able to escape merciless punishment.\u201dFestival head Dieter Kosslick was reportedly forced to meet with the North Korean ambassador to Germany to explain. A spokesperson told Variety the situation was now resolved and Pyongyang understood the comedy was not being screened at the Berlinale.North Korea\u2019s ire over The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-un by two bumbling American journalists (Seth Rogen and James Franco), proved no laughing matter for Sony when a group linked by the FBI to Pyongyang began releasing embarrassing private emails online, as well as five upcoming movies, following a cyber attack in December. The studio appeared to bow to threats of further revelations when it cancelled the film\u2019s theatrical release, but was later forced into a U-turn after Barack Obama went public to suggest executives should not have caved into the demands.The Interview has since gone on to make more than $45m via on demand and a limited US release in cinemas, and could even be on course to recoup the lion\u2019s share of its $75m budget.

JTS says it is operating on a not-for-profit basis, with any excess funds to be spent on the tourism library at the college. The company says it is hoping to take up to five people on trips in May and November, but says it would consider alternative dates.Since 2009, western interest in travelling to North Korea has gathered momentum. An estimated 6,000 western tourists now visit every year through accredited tour companies, which includes US citizens, though their government \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d they do not travel there. Hundreds of thousands of tourists are estimated to come from neighbouring China each year. The ethics of travelling to North Korea are a subject of much debate. Some argue that greater interactions with the outside world is a positive development. Others have reservations about contributing financially to a regime accused of grave human rights abuses against its people, and travelling to a country where foreigners are escorted everywhere, and interactions with North Koreans are usually stage-managed with specially selected members of the public.Two of North Korea\u2019s biggest prestige projects in recent years have been the Masikryong ski resort and the \u2018tourist city\u2019 of Wonsan, and representatives promoting the country have begun to make themselves known on the world\u2019s travel forum circuit.\u201cThe country has made it clear that it is looking to grow its tourism sector in the coming years,\u201d said David Thompson from JTS. \u201cTo do so will require both international tourism expertise and foreign language skills.\u201dThompson said volunteers will be subject to the same limitations as other tourists in terms of where they can go inside North Korea, and who they can speak to. \u201cTo my knowledge there will not be the opportunity to wander freely,\u201d he said.21 year-old British student Ben Griffin was the first to sign up for a test trial for the volunteer programme last year in conjunction with North Korea\u2019s National Tourism Authority. He had travelled to North Korea on an official tour the year before and \u201cjumped on the chance\u201d to go again, he says. Griffin was not allowed freedom of movement, though he insists he did not feel closely monitored, and his guides were flexible with his itinerary if he made a request.In an enthusiastic account of his trip for Juche Travel he describes being driven around in luxury cars and using clips of the classic television show Only Fools and Horses to aide his English lessons. My students were on an advanced level although I\u2019m sure that they felt Del boy\u2019s cockney slang was almost a different language in itself.He says the show was a big hit: \u201cMy students were on an advanced level although I\u2019m sure that they felt Del boy\u2019s cockney slang was almost a different language in itself.

That can only be a good thing.\u201dChoson Exchange, an organisation working inside North Korea to educate young professionals in business, economic policy and law, has long-advocated for meaningful interaction with the country, especially through industry.

He reportedly added that it \u201chas proved to be efficacious against liver diseases like fatty liver and hepatitis.\u201dThe article cites the case of Choe Ryong from the Pothonggang District of the North Korean capital Pyongyang, who \u201cfeels no pain in his right side and digests well after taking it for nearly half a month.\u201d The medicine has been awarded the DPRK patent, the report said.Robert Winstanley-Chesters, director of research at Sino NK, a group of academics focused on North Korea, says the \u2018liver cure\u2019 is not as weird or wonderful as some might think \u201cbut one quite closely connected to east Asian, Chinese and Korean traditional medicine.\u201dBears gall and bile are regularly used in Chinese medicine so this should be seen as \u201cquite an expected medical development so far as North Korea is concerned\u201d, he says. Moreover, it is an example of \u201cself sufficiency and the creation or development of medical practice and technique that is specifically North Korean,\u201d he added.Winstanley-Chesters points to an article in Rodong Sinmun, the state newspaper, which says that doctors were hoping to cure what they called obstinate diseases with the \u2018Koryo Medical Method\u2019. The method is never explained but the reference to Korean history asserts an \u201cauthentic Koreaness\u201d, integral to any institution, development or technology coming out of North Korea, he says.The maackia amurensis, also known as amur maackia, is a deciduous shrub common in east Asia, China and Korea.

Fatty liver disease is also a symptom of alcohol abuse, and can affect people who are overweight or obese.This is not the first medical advancement North Korea has announced. In July KCNA revealed a \u201cnano gold injection\u201d for \u201cimmunity invigoration, inflammation, pain, neurosis, cerebration and blood circulation, promotion of metabolism and effacement of active oxygen. It also removes poisoning by medicine or chemicals.\u201d Nano-gold, which is gold broken down in to tiny particles is popular among some followers of alternative medicine, often ingested in a tea or as a tonic, and researchers at a Norwegian University are currently testing whether injecting it in to the body could help to combat cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s.KCNA said, it was developed at the Nano Technology Institute at Kim Il-sung University, but, as with the case with the liver medicine, gave no details on when it would made commonly available.In May 2014, KCNA also announced plans for a mushroom sports drink to enhance athletic prowess. \u201cThis natural drink is very effective in enhancing physical ability of sportspersons and recovering from their fatigues\u201d, a news report said. No independent media outlets exist in North Korea to help verify information released by the state media organisation.Analysts believe claims of medical advancement could be part of state attempts to deflect possible criticism of the general health care system, which is believed to be dire.A series of Guardian interviews with North Korean defectors painted a bleak picture of healthcare: a crumbling system where people are said to be taking methamphetamine as drugs are too expensive to buy. But Winstanley-Chesters points out that \u201cnot all aspects of the North Korean health service will be as decrepit as is the popular or media conception\u201d.

State approved animosity for \u2018American imperialists,\u2019 slogans trumpeting their fearlessness, and simple designs representing accepted narratives of conflict and sexuality are common.Defectors say the growing popularity of tattoos written in English also reflects changes in the economic, political and cultural landscape.There were plenty [of phrases] to choose from, like: Defend the Fatherland! Victory! and Battle!\u201cIn my father\u2019s generation it used to be really popular to get tattoos of a North Korean soldier killing an American invader,\u201d says Kim Shin-woo, who arrived in South Korea from the DPRK, also known as North Korea, in 2007.\u201cThere were plenty [of phrases] to choose from, like: Defend the Fatherland! Victory! and Battle! My father and uncle both have tattoos on their upper arms and biceps. They have \u2018one against one hundred\u2019 on their arms, to show how they could kill a hundred enemies in battle.\u201d Of course, tattoos are not always political. \u201cI\u2019ve even seen some guys with images of nude women tattooed on their body,\u201d says Shin Hyun-jae. \u201cBears are a popular image \u2013 a bear playing an accordion \u2013 and sometimes guys get a dragon on their arm or down their backs.\u201dHaving a picture of Kim Jong-un\u2019s smiling face emblazoned on your bicep would lead to swift punishmentDefectors say that while such combative designs are still common, cosmological symbols and Chinese characters are also becoming popular.\u201cPictures of doves representing peace or an eagle for strength are common too,\u201d says Kim. \u201cIt\u2019s also been trendy to have the unified Korean peninsula as a tattoo.\u201dAbsent from the list of desired images, however, is anything associated with the Kim dynasty. Having a picture of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s smiling face emblazoned on your bicep would lead to swift punishment for all involved; while embodying the state with tattoos of government-approved images is tolerated, images of the ruling family are sacrosanct. The state holds the monopoly on the reproduction of such iconography. In North Korea, if a woman has a tattoo it usually means she comes from a bad familyIn many respects, getting a tattoo in North Korea is similar to the process one would follow in many other areas of the world. The customer takes a picture of their desired image to their local tattooist (in the North, they usually work out of their homes), or simply describe it.The biggest struggle for the mostly self-taught artists is finding the ink to draw the image. Tattoos in the DPRK are usually entirely monochrome and performed using sewing needles \u2013 tattooing needles also a rare luxury \u2013 dipped in ink and then applied to the area.The biggest struggle for the mostly self-taught artists is finding the ink to draw the imageIt seems that the tattooing industry is one area where international sanctions may have proved unintentionally effective. \u201cInk and medical swabs used to be imported by North Korea-supporting Koreans in Japan,\u201d says Sun Dong-hyun, who defected in the mid-2000s. The imports ended when sanctions were introduced. \u201cThat\u2019s all dried up and now a lot of it has to come in across the Sino-Korean border.\u201dDefectors have told me \u201cthere were lots of famous tattoo artists in North Korea,\u201d but \u201cthese days they are few and far between.\u201d Tattooing is a difficult way to make a living, given the struggle to find equipment. According to testimonies, tattoos have also become less common in civilian life, and mostly continues for those in the military. For men, tattoos brought back from military service are worn as badges of honour representing the camaraderie experienced during long service to the state. Tattooed women, however, are frowned upon. \u201cIf a woman has a tattoo it usually means she comes from a bad family,\u201d says Shin. For those who escape the DPRK, distinctive tattoos quickly take on a more pernicious meaning, changing the bearer from patriot to criminal.In China, designs written in Korean calling for \u201crevolution!\u201d or \u201creunification!\u201d identify a person as North Korean, and threaten to expose them to authorities who repatriate undocumented North Koreans found in their territory.In South Korea, these markings again transform the status of the wearer, this time from patriot to pariah. As such, North Koreans are told to have them removed by staff in Hanawon, the centre in which North Korean refugees learn how to live like a South Korean. In 2009, South Korea\u2019s Association for Assistance to North Korean Escapees announced it would pay 70% of the cost of tattoo removal, up to 500,000 won ($320).

A great deal, apparently. On 31 January 2015, a North Korean government-run website posted an 18-minute video titled The Human Rights Propaganda Puppet, Yeon-mi Park, which denounced the charismatic 21-year-old defector. It was the latest attack in a smear campaign aimed at silencing Yeon-mi, a human rights activist and outspoken critic of the world\u2019s most repressive and secretive regime.Attacks on prominent North Korean defectors are nothing new. These individuals regularly endure charges that they lie and exaggerate. Occasionally there are death threats. Park Sang-hak, who launches helium balloons laden with USB sticks and anti-regime leaflets into North Korean airspace, has been called \u201chuman scum\u201d who will \u201cpay for his crimes in blood\u201d. Sometimes the threats go beyond mere rhetoric: in 2011, a hitman with a poison-tipped needle was intercepted in South Korea on his way to kill Park Sang-hak. In 1997 the nephew of one of Kim Jong-il\u2019s mistresses was gunned down outside Seoul; he had recently published an expose about the dictator\u2019s family. But the regime\u2019s most common weapon against its critics is character assassination. Related: Journey of a North Korean defector: from escaping by bike to singing at Harvard \u201cOne of the very few growing industries in North Korea is this operation of trying to compromise defectors and witnesses,\u201d says Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the US Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. The smears and threats have ramped up in the wake of a UN report documenting crimes against humanity in North Korea and recommending that the case be referred to the International Criminal Court. The UN findings were based on the testimony of more than 300 defectors who painted a picture of institutionalised cruelty within the regime, including mass incarceration in forced labour camps. North Korea has tried \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to discredit the entire report because one of its well-known witnesses, Shin Dong-hyuk, later admitted to changing parts of his biography. \u201cThe fundamental building blocks of Shin\u2019s story remain the same,\u201d says Scarlatoiu. \u201cHe was still a political prisoner and still tortured.\u201d But the controversy highlights a tragic catch-22: sometimes the traumatic firsthand experiences that make defectors such powerful witnesses also make them vulnerable to assaults on their credibility.Yeon-mi did not testify before the UN inquiry, but became a YouTube sensation last autumn, following her emotional speech at the One Young World Summit in Dublin. Looking like a fragile porcelain doll dressed in a flowing pink hanbok (traditional Korean dress), Yeon-mi took the podium and, fighting to keep her composure, told a harrowing and heartbreaking story: \u201cNorth Korea is an unimaginable country,\u201d she began in halting English. \u201cWe aren\u2019t free to sing, say, wear or think what we want.\u201dShe said she believed the dictator could hear her thoughts, and she described the hideous punishments meted out to those who broke the rules or expressed doubt about the regime. When she was nine years old she saw her friend\u2019s mother publicly executed for a minor infraction. When she was 13, she fled into China, only to see her mother raped by a human trafficker. Her father later died in China, where she buried his ashes in secret. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even cry,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid to be sent back to North Korea.\u201dEventually Yeon-mi and her mother escaped into Mongolia by walking and crawling across the frozen Gobi desert, following the stars north to freedom. By the time Yeon-mi had finished with a plea to \u201cshed light on the darkest place in the world\u201d, the whole audience was in tears and on its feet.After her Dublin speech, Yeon-mi became the human face of North Korea\u2019s oppressed. The media clamoured for interviews. A book deal followed, which was where I came into the picture. As Yeon-mi\u2019s \u201ccollaborator\u201d \u2013 a publishing term for a writer who helps an author find her voice and turn her story into a narrative \u2013 I was immediately taken with the power of Yeon-mi\u2019s testimony, as well as the warmth of her personality and her playful sense of humour. It was hard to fathom how this vibrant young woman could have suffered such an ordeal.As soon as we began working together, I noticed there were some minor discrepancies in the articles written about Yeon-mi, a jumbling of dates and places and some inconsistent details about her family\u2019s escape. Most of these issues could be explained by a language barrier \u2013 Yeon-mi was giving interviews in English before she was fully fluent. But Yeon-mi was also protecting a secret, something she had tried to bury and forget from the moment she arrived in South Korea at age 15: like tens of thousands of other refugees, Yeon-mi had been trafficked in China. In South Korea \u2013 and many other societies \u2013 admitting to such a \u201cshameful\u201d past would destroy her prospects for marriage and any sort of normal life.She had hoped that by changing a few details about her escape she could avoid revealing the full story. But after she decided to plunge into human rights activism, she realised that without the whole truth, the story of her life would have no real power or meaning. She has apologised for any discrepancies in her public record, and is determined that her book be scrupulously accurate.With Yeon-mi\u2019s cooperation, I have been able to verify her story through family members and fellow defectors who knew her in North Korea and China. Sometimes Yeon-mi had forgotten or blocked out graphic details from her childhood, only to have the memories return in all their horror as we reviewed her recollections with other witnesses. It seemed that she wasn\u2019t just remembering these things, but actually reliving them.Countless scientific studies have shown that trauma changes how the brain processes memory. It turns out that scrambling details and confusing time frames is actually a sign that the trauma survivor is being truthful \u2013 they honestly can\u2019t remember things in sequence. Dr Judith Herman, clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard and author of Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence from Domestic Abuse to Political Terror, tells me: \u201cTraumatised people don\u2019t give you a perfect, complete narrative on the first go-round. You see this all the time with refugees seeking asylum. That doesn\u2019t mean their story isn\u2019t credible, because the gist of their story is consistent.\u201dAccording to Herman, more and more judges in US asylum hearings understand and accept the impact of trauma on memory. Unfortunately the general public can be less forgiving. Which is why North Korea, its sympathisers and dupes have been able to exploit the discrepancies in some defectors\u2019 stories as a weapon to attack their motives.A few days before Christmas last year I checked my inbox and found a mysterious email warning me not to write the book with Yeon-mi and help \u201cspread her lies\u201d. Then came the North Korean video. Despite having the production values of a Stalin-era newsreel, the footage was chilling: some of her uncles, aunts and cousins still living in North Korea were paraded in front of the camera to denounce her. The worst they could come up with was that Yeon-mi was an ambitious child. But it was horrifying for her to see them so vulnerable. At least she knew they were still alive.Yeon-mi continues to work on her book and to speak out for freedom in North Korea. On Human Rights Day last 10 December, Yeon-mi appeared on a panel at the US State Department with another outspoken defector named Joseph Kim. In many public forums, Kim has told how he watched his father wither and die from starvation, how his sister disappeared and his mother left home, and how he survived as a street kid, scrabbling for crusts of bread. \u201cHunger is humiliation,\u201d he says. \u201cHunger is helplessness.\u201d But on this day he added something new: his mother had sold his sister to a man in China, thinking it was better than sending her back to North Korea.\u201cThis is an important part of my story,\u201d said Kim, \u201cthat I hope illustrates how difficult and desperate the life is, and how many North Korean mothers were forced to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.\u201dDoes this fresh revelation in any way diminish this remarkable young man\u2019s credibility? Absolutely not. It only shows how traumatic narratives sometimes come out in fits and starts. The whole story does not emerge until the survivor finds a way to tell it. But for those who have the patience to listen closely, the stories gather and build to a heroic and truthful testimony of survival that cannot be silenced.\u2022 Author and journalist Maryanne Vollers has collaborated on several memoirs including Living History by Hillary Clinton.

The Russian foreign ministry said the agreement was designed to elevate ties \u201cin the political, economic, humanitarian and other areas to a new level\u201d.The Kremlin confirmed it had invited North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the end of the second word war in Europe.The trip would be Kim\u2019s first outside North Korea since he became leader of regime following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011. The older Kim visited Russia in August 2011 in his armoured train for a meeting with then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev.The friendship agreement was announced on the same day that officials in Berlin said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would not attend the ceremony in Moscow \u2013 a snub believed to be in retaliation for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine.The leaders in Moscow and Pyongyang appear to have much in the way of common cause. The UN has targeted North Korea with sanctions since it tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, and is applying pressure on the Kremlin to end its military involvement in Ukraine.The shift in North Korea\u2019s diplomatic focus towards Russia has been accelerated by tensions with China, Pyongyang\u2019s traditional ally and aid giver. China barely disguised its irritation with Kim after he ordered North Korea\u2019s third nuclear test in 2013 and the execution later that year of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had been instrumental in forging closer co-operation with Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping has yet to meet Kim; significantly, though, he has met South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, several times.In an apparent attempt to counter Russian influence, China has approved increased co-operation with North Korea along their border and indicated it would be willing to hold a bilateral summit.Xi and Kim could also find themselves face to face at the war commemorations in May.Putin would doubtless welcome the international opprobrium that would follow a public appearance alongside Kim in Moscow this spring. North Korea, meanwhile, stands to gain financially and militarily from closer ties with Russia. In 2014 Moscow cancelled almost US$10bn, or 90%, of North Korea\u2019s bilateral debt and said it would invest the remaining $1.09bn \u2013 to be paid back over 20 years \u2013 in infrastructure projects such as a cross-border gas pipeline between Russia and the North, and a rail link to South Korea.Russia has also offered to invest $25bn in North Korea\u2019s creaking rail network in return for access to mineral resources.It remains to be seen how a closer the Putin-Kim relationship will affect international attempts to end the North\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. Talks involving North Korea, Russia, the US, China, South Korea and Japan to reach a nuclear deal have been stalled since 2009.North Korea is believed to possess between 10 and 16 nuclear weapons developed using plutonium or weapons-grade uranium. A recent report by US researchers warned that Pyongyang was poised to expand its nuclear programme over the next five years. A worst-case scenario would see it armed with as many as 100 nuclear weapons by end of the decade, the report said.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Russia", "Ukraine", "World news"], "title": "North Korea and Russia forge \u2018year of friendship\u2019 pariah alliance"},{"date": "2015-01-31T05:00:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is making military service mandatory for young women in a bid to strengthen the nation\u2019s armed forces, sources inside the secretive state have told DailyNK.The measure is said to apply to women aged between 17 and 20, and has been handed down to mobilisation offices in each province, city, and county. Implementation is reported to be already underway.\u201cLate last year, we received orders for all women who have graduated from middle and high school to undergo mandatory military service,\u201d a source based in North Hamkyung Province told Daily NK this week.\u201cThe preliminary screening and physicals related to enlistment, which begins in April, are all complete and duty sectors have been organised,\u201d the source said.Screenings look for physical problems or contagious diseases. The minimum height requirement for women to serve was lowered to 142cm in 2012, but this standard is not strictly enforced, according to the source. The military is said to be hoping to make up for a shortfall in troop numbers in its \u201cmillion-man army\u201dCustomarily, enlistment in North Korea occurs twice a year in April and August, and up until now, women served on a voluntarily basis, while men invariably underwent mandatory service.School graduates (17-18 years-old) enlist in April, while the enlistment period for workers at or under the age of 20 takes place in August.This new policy, however, is not expected to compel women to serve the same length of time as men. \u201cUnlike men, who have to serve for 10 years, mandatory service for women is only up to the age of 23,\u201d the source said.The military is said to be hoping to make up for a shortfall in troop numbers in its \u201cmillion-man army\u201d, following the high child mortality rate and low birth rate stemming from the Arduous March, the name given to the North Korean famine in the 1990s.The source explained that this year\u2019s admission quotas for female applicants to universities and technical schools have yet to be announced, presumably \u201cto only recommend those who have completed their military service or exceptionally gifted students from special schools who may be exempt from service altogether.\u201d The new directive is said to have caused concern among the public; women tend to be key breadwinners for their families by engaging in various types of business. In March 2003, at the sixth session of the 10th Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, it was announced that military service was to be reduced to 10 years from 13 for men, and to seven from 10 for women. Only women signing up voluntarily were to serve, while men in some specialised units would still be required to fulfil 13 years of service. Translated by Jiyeon Lee.

In fact, Pyongyang appears to have confused the film festival, which commences on 5 February, with Germany\u2019s domestic release schedule: The Interview is due out in cinemas across the country the same day.The North Korean statement read: \u201cThe screening of the movie that hurts the dignity of the supreme leadership of North Korea and openly agitates state-sponsored terrorism has nothing to do with the \u2018freedom of expression\u2019 touted by Germany. It is evidently agitation of terrorism quite contrary to the purpose and nature of the Berlin International Film Festival.\u201dIt continued: \u201cThe US and Germany should immediately stop the farce of screening the anti-North Korean movie at the film festival. Those who attempt at terrorist acts and commit politically-motivated provocations and those who join them in violation of the sovereignty and dignity of North Korea will never be able to escape merciless punishment.\u201dFestival head Dieter Kosslick was reportedly forced to meet with the North Korean ambassador to Germany to explain. A spokesperson told Variety the situation was now resolved and Pyongyang understood the comedy was not being screened at the Berlinale.North Korea\u2019s ire over The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-un by two bumbling American journalists (Seth Rogen and James Franco), proved no laughing matter for Sony when a group linked by the FBI to Pyongyang began releasing embarrassing private emails online, as well as five upcoming movies, following a cyber attack in December. The studio appeared to bow to threats of further revelations when it cancelled the film\u2019s theatrical release, but was later forced into a U-turn after Barack Obama went public to suggest executives should not have caved into the demands.The Interview has since gone on to make more than $45m via on demand and a limited US release in cinemas, and could even be on course to recoup the lion\u2019s share of its $75m budget.

The programme, which offers a month-long teaching placement at Pyongyang Tourism College in the secretive country\u2019s capital city, is run by Juche Travel Services (JTS), a certified travel company which promises \u201cunparalleled levels of interaction and engagement with local Koreans.\u201d Volunteers will head up courses teaching English or tourism. The company says it is looking for people with a Tefl (teaching English as a foreign language) qualification or a background in tourism management, \u201cwho can contribute positively to growing the country\u2019s tourism industry\u201d.The scheme costs \u20ac1000 Euros (\u00a3765) for each volunteer which covers travel, accommodation and tourist excursions in the country. JTS says it is operating on a not-for-profit basis, with any excess funds to be spent on the tourism library at the college. The company says it is hoping to take up to five people on trips in May and November, but says it would consider alternative dates.Since 2009, western interest in travelling to North Korea has gathered momentum. An estimated 6,000 western tourists now visit every year through accredited tour companies, which includes US citizens, though their government \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d they do not travel there. Hundreds of thousands of tourists are estimated to come from neighbouring China each year. The ethics of travelling to North Korea are a subject of much debate. Some argue that greater interactions with the outside world is a positive development. Others have reservations about contributing financially to a regime accused of grave human rights abuses against its people, and travelling to a country where foreigners are escorted everywhere, and interactions with North Koreans are usually stage-managed with specially selected members of the public.Two of North Korea\u2019s biggest prestige projects in recent years have been the Masikryong ski resort and the \u2018tourist city\u2019 of Wonsan, and representatives promoting the country have begun to make themselves known on the world\u2019s travel forum circuit.\u201cThe country has made it clear that it is looking to grow its tourism sector in the coming years,\u201d said David Thompson from JTS. \u201cTo do so will require both international tourism expertise and foreign language skills.\u201dThompson said volunteers will be subject to the same limitations as other tourists in terms of where they can go inside North Korea, and who they can speak to. \u201cTo my knowledge there will not be the opportunity to wander freely,\u201d he said.21 year-old British student Ben Griffin was the first to sign up for a test trial for the volunteer programme last year in conjunction with North Korea\u2019s National Tourism Authority. He had travelled to North Korea on an official tour the year before and \u201cjumped on the chance\u201d to go again, he says. Griffin was not allowed freedom of movement, though he insists he did not feel closely monitored, and his guides were flexible with his itinerary if he made a request.In an enthusiastic account of his trip for Juche Travel he describes being driven around in luxury cars and using clips of the classic television show Only Fools and Horses to aide his English lessons. My students were on an advanced level although I\u2019m sure that they felt Del boy\u2019s cockney slang was almost a different language in itself.He says the show was a big hit: \u201cMy students were on an advanced level although I\u2019m sure that they felt Del boy\u2019s cockney slang was almost a different language in itself. Even so comedy scenes such as Del boy\u2019s \u2018falling through the bar\u2019 or \u2018the chandelier repair\u2019 transcended any language barrier.\u201d A screening of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy also went down well, he said.Griffin said what struck him most about his students was the fact that they \u201cwere just real people,\u201d interested in his life and travels but also preoccupied by the same worries as students the world over: from relationships to weekend plans.\u201cWe are obviously of the opinion that tourism has a positive impact,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cBy building bridges and engaging with the country, you are helping to break down mistrust and preconceptions that have persisted for the past 60-odd years. That can only be a good thing.\u201dChoson Exchange, an organisation working inside North Korea to educate young professionals in business, economic policy and law, has long-advocated for meaningful interaction with the country, especially through industry.

He reportedly added that it \u201chas proved to be efficacious against liver diseases like fatty liver and hepatitis.\u201dThe article cites the case of Choe Ryong from the Pothonggang District of the North Korean capital Pyongyang, who \u201cfeels no pain in his right side and digests well after taking it for nearly half a month.\u201d The medicine has been awarded the DPRK patent, the report said.Robert Winstanley-Chesters, director of research at Sino NK, a group of academics focused on North Korea, says the \u2018liver cure\u2019 is not as weird or wonderful as some might think \u201cbut one quite closely connected to east Asian, Chinese and Korean traditional medicine.\u201dBears gall and bile are regularly used in Chinese medicine so this should be seen as \u201cquite an expected medical development so far as North Korea is concerned\u201d, he says. Moreover, it is an example of \u201cself sufficiency and the creation or development of medical practice and technique that is specifically North Korean,\u201d he added.Winstanley-Chesters points to an article in Rodong Sinmun, the state newspaper, which says that doctors were hoping to cure what they called obstinate diseases with the \u2018Koryo Medical Method\u2019. The method is never explained but the reference to Korean history asserts an \u201cauthentic Koreaness\u201d, integral to any institution, development or technology coming out of North Korea, he says.The maackia amurensis, also known as amur maackia, is a deciduous shrub common in east Asia, China and Korea. A Canadian guide to complementary health care says that whilst the bark is commonly used in Korean medicine, in the west \u201cthe tree is primarily considered ornamental and planted for erosion control.\u201dBears are said to be resident at the Central Zoo, with four appearing in a promotional video in 2011. In the film, also put out by KCNA, Ju Kum-Chol \u2013 named as the head of the technical department \u2013 claims that animals enjoy \u201cnatural environments similar to their habitats.\u201d However, the bears are shown prowling around a concrete bowl with a patchy piece of grass at the centre.Hepatitis is the term used to describe the swelling of the liver as a result of a viral infection or exposure to harmful substances like alcohol. Fatty liver disease is also a symptom of alcohol abuse, and can affect people who are overweight or obese.This is not the first medical advancement North Korea has announced. In July KCNA revealed a \u201cnano gold injection\u201d for \u201cimmunity invigoration, inflammation, pain, neurosis, cerebration and blood circulation, promotion of metabolism and effacement of active oxygen. It also removes poisoning by medicine or chemicals.\u201d Nano-gold, which is gold broken down in to tiny particles is popular among some followers of alternative medicine, often ingested in a tea or as a tonic, and researchers at a Norwegian University are currently testing whether injecting it in to the body could help to combat cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s.KCNA said, it was developed at the Nano Technology Institute at Kim Il-sung University, but, as with the case with the liver medicine, gave no details on when it would made commonly available.In May 2014, KCNA also announced plans for a mushroom sports drink to enhance athletic prowess. \u201cThis natural drink is very effective in enhancing physical ability of sportspersons and recovering from their fatigues\u201d, a news report said. No independent media outlets exist in North Korea to help verify information released by the state media organisation.Analysts believe claims of medical advancement could be part of state attempts to deflect possible criticism of the general health care system, which is believed to be dire.A series of Guardian interviews with North Korean defectors painted a bleak picture of healthcare: a crumbling system where people are said to be taking methamphetamine as drugs are too expensive to buy. But Winstanley-Chesters points out that \u201cnot all aspects of the North Korean health service will be as decrepit as is the popular or media conception\u201d. Members of the party and army elite probably enjoy \u201cvery good health resources\u201d, he says.

Related: Gordon Brown: The truly patriotic British view on Europe? We must lead from within In a Guardian article before a House of Commons debate on the EU on Tuesday, in which he signals that he is prepared to speak out if a referendum is held on Britain\u2019s EU membership, Brown writes: \u201cWe must tell the truth about the 3m jobs, 25,000 companies, \u00a3200bn of annual exports and the \u00a3450bn of inward investment linked to Europe; and how the \u2018Britzerland\u2019 or Norwegian alternatives (even Norwegians oppose the Norwegian option) leave us subject to EU rules, but denied a vote in shaping them. And we must talk about how the Hong Kong option \u2013 \u2018leaving Europe to join the world\u2019 \u2013 is really the North Korea option, out in the cold with few friends, no influence, little new trade and even less new investment.\u201dThe intervention by the former prime minister comes as the Open Europe thinktank, which campaigns for a reformed EU, warned that Britain would face an uncertain future outside the EU.In the first of a series of reports examining the implications of a British exit, known as \u201cBrexit\u201d, the thinktank said that Britain would be able to negotiate trade deals with the EU on manufactured goods such as cars. But it warned that financial services could be damaged by \u201cbarriers to entering European markets [which] could be increased by new EU regulations over which the UK [would have] no votes\u201d.Brown makes a similar argument in stronger terms in his Guardian article as he warns that a British exit would amount to \u201csheer defeatism\u201d just as Britain is in course over the next few decades to overtake Germany as the EU\u2019s largest economy as its population declines. He writes: \u201cIt would be sheer defeatism to cast ourselves, as sceptics do, as helpless victim, impotent bystanders unable to influence events. Our destiny is not a bit player on someone else\u2019s stage, or a spectator hectoring from the wings, but always setting the agenda, bringing people together, and championing change.\u201dThe former prime minister indicates that the current government has already left Britain isolated as it flirts with an EU exit. \u201cBeing half-in half-out, a Britain that is semi-detached and disengaged \u2013 the Britain of the empty chair even when we are in the room \u2013 has made us weaker than ever: irrelevant on Greece, fringe player on climate change, mere spectator in the debate that could have shaped a European pro-growth policy, marginal on Ukraine, with ministers sounding ludicrous as simultaneously they say: \u2018Russia must be confronted with a more united Europe\u2019, and: \u2019By the way, we are thinking of leaving.\u2019\u201dThe main intellectual thrust of Brown\u2019s article is a warning that pro-Europeans risk giving the impression that the EU is an elitist project through their \u201cLondon establishment-led corporate-financed fact-based campaign of \u2018the great and the good\u2019\u201d. He feels the pro-Europeans are in danger of allowing the anti-Europeans to repeat the same trick that the SNP pulled off in the Scottish independence referendum in which Alex Salmond framed the argument as a choice between Scotland and Britain.

What should be a choice between two patriotic futures for Britain \u2013 one as part of Europe and one outside it \u2013 is already descending into a more basic emotional choice: are you for Britain, or are you for Europe?\u201dThe former prime minister is prepared to take a prominent public role campaigning in favour of the EU if a referendum is held.

Having a picture of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s smiling face emblazoned on your bicep would lead to swift punishment for all involved; while embodying the state with tattoos of government-approved images is tolerated, images of the ruling family are sacrosanct. The state holds the monopoly on the reproduction of such iconography. In North Korea, if a woman has a tattoo it usually means she comes from a bad familyIn many respects, getting a tattoo in North Korea is similar to the process one would follow in many other areas of the world. The customer takes a picture of their desired image to their local tattooist (in the North, they usually work out of their homes), or simply describe it.The biggest struggle for the mostly self-taught artists is finding the ink to draw the image. Tattoos in the DPRK are usually entirely monochrome and performed using sewing needles \u2013 tattooing needles also a rare luxury \u2013 dipped in ink and then applied to the area.The biggest struggle for the mostly self-taught artists is finding the ink to draw the imageIt seems that the tattooing industry is one area where international sanctions may have proved unintentionally effective. \u201cInk and medical swabs used to be imported by North Korea-supporting Koreans in Japan,\u201d says Sun Dong-hyun, who defected in the mid-2000s. The imports ended when sanctions were introduced. \u201cThat\u2019s all dried up and now a lot of it has to come in across the Sino-Korean border.\u201dDefectors have told me \u201cthere were lots of famous tattoo artists in North Korea,\u201d but \u201cthese days they are few and far between.\u201d Tattooing is a difficult way to make a living, given the struggle to find equipment. According to testimonies, tattoos have also become less common in civilian life, and mostly continues for those in the military. For men, tattoos brought back from military service are worn as badges of honour representing the camaraderie experienced during long service to the state. Tattooed women, however, are frowned upon. \u201cIf a woman has a tattoo it usually means she comes from a bad family,\u201d says Shin. For those who escape the DPRK, distinctive tattoos quickly take on a more pernicious meaning, changing the bearer from patriot to criminal.In China, designs written in Korean calling for \u201crevolution!\u201d or \u201creunification!\u201d identify a person as North Korean, and threaten to expose them to authorities who repatriate undocumented North Koreans found in their territory.In South Korea, these markings again transform the status of the wearer, this time from patriot to pariah. As such, North Koreans are told to have them removed by staff in Hanawon, the centre in which North Korean refugees learn how to live like a South Korean. In 2009, South Korea\u2019s Association for Assistance to North Korean Escapees announced it would pay 70% of the cost of tattoo removal, up to 500,000 won ($320).

A great deal, apparently. On 31 January 2015, a North Korean government-run website posted an 18-minute video titled The Human Rights Propaganda Puppet, Yeon-mi Park, which denounced the charismatic 21-year-old defector. It was the latest attack in a smear campaign aimed at silencing Yeon-mi, a human rights activist and outspoken critic of the world\u2019s most repressive and secretive regime.Attacks on prominent North Korean defectors are nothing new. These individuals regularly endure charges that they lie and exaggerate. Occasionally there are death threats. Park Sang-hak, who launches helium balloons laden with USB sticks and anti-regime leaflets into North Korean airspace, has been called \u201chuman scum\u201d who will \u201cpay for his crimes in blood\u201d. Sometimes the threats go beyond mere rhetoric: in 2011, a hitman with a poison-tipped needle was intercepted in South Korea on his way to kill Park Sang-hak. In 1997 the nephew of one of Kim Jong-il\u2019s mistresses was gunned down outside Seoul; he had recently published an expose about the dictator\u2019s family. But the regime\u2019s most common weapon against its critics is character assassination. Related: Journey of a North Korean defector: from escaping by bike to singing at Harvard \u201cOne of the very few growing industries in North Korea is this operation of trying to compromise defectors and witnesses,\u201d says Greg Scarlatoiu, executive director of the US Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. The smears and threats have ramped up in the wake of a UN report documenting crimes against humanity in North Korea and recommending that the case be referred to the International Criminal Court. The UN findings were based on the testimony of more than 300 defectors who painted a picture of institutionalised cruelty within the regime, including mass incarceration in forced labour camps. North Korea has tried \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to discredit the entire report because one of its well-known witnesses, Shin Dong-hyuk, later admitted to changing parts of his biography. \u201cThe fundamental building blocks of Shin\u2019s story remain the same,\u201d says Scarlatoiu. \u201cHe was still a political prisoner and still tortured.\u201d But the controversy highlights a tragic catch-22: sometimes the traumatic firsthand experiences that make defectors such powerful witnesses also make them vulnerable to assaults on their credibility.Yeon-mi did not testify before the UN inquiry, but became a YouTube sensation last autumn, following her emotional speech at the One Young World Summit in Dublin. Looking like a fragile porcelain doll dressed in a flowing pink hanbok (traditional Korean dress), Yeon-mi took the podium and, fighting to keep her composure, told a harrowing and heartbreaking story: \u201cNorth Korea is an unimaginable country,\u201d she began in halting English. \u201cWe aren\u2019t free to sing, say, wear or think what we want.\u201dShe said she believed the dictator could hear her thoughts, and she described the hideous punishments meted out to those who broke the rules or expressed doubt about the regime. When she was nine years old she saw her friend\u2019s mother publicly executed for a minor infraction. When she was 13, she fled into China, only to see her mother raped by a human trafficker. Her father later died in China, where she buried his ashes in secret. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even cry,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid to be sent back to North Korea.\u201dEventually Yeon-mi and her mother escaped into Mongolia by walking and crawling across the frozen Gobi desert, following the stars north to freedom. By the time Yeon-mi had finished with a plea to \u201cshed light on the darkest place in the world\u201d, the whole audience was in tears and on its feet.After her Dublin speech, Yeon-mi became the human face of North Korea\u2019s oppressed. The media clamoured for interviews. A book deal followed, which was where I came into the picture. As Yeon-mi\u2019s \u201ccollaborator\u201d \u2013 a publishing term for a writer who helps an author find her voice and turn her story into a narrative \u2013 I was immediately taken with the power of Yeon-mi\u2019s testimony, as well as the warmth of her personality and her playful sense of humour. It was hard to fathom how this vibrant young woman could have suffered such an ordeal.As soon as we began working together, I noticed there were some minor discrepancies in the articles written about Yeon-mi, a jumbling of dates and places and some inconsistent details about her family\u2019s escape. Most of these issues could be explained by a language barrier \u2013 Yeon-mi was giving interviews in English before she was fully fluent. But Yeon-mi was also protecting a secret, something she had tried to bury and forget from the moment she arrived in South Korea at age 15: like tens of thousands of other refugees, Yeon-mi had been trafficked in China. In South Korea \u2013 and many other societies \u2013 admitting to such a \u201cshameful\u201d past would destroy her prospects for marriage and any sort of normal life.She had hoped that by changing a few details about her escape she could avoid revealing the full story. But after she decided to plunge into human rights activism, she realised that without the whole truth, the story of her life would have no real power or meaning. She has apologised for any discrepancies in her public record, and is determined that her book be scrupulously accurate.With Yeon-mi\u2019s cooperation, I have been able to verify her story through family members and fellow defectors who knew her in North Korea and China. Sometimes Yeon-mi had forgotten or blocked out graphic details from her childhood, only to have the memories return in all their horror as we reviewed her recollections with other witnesses. It seemed that she wasn\u2019t just remembering these things, but actually reliving them.Countless scientific studies have shown that trauma changes how the brain processes memory. It turns out that scrambling details and confusing time frames is actually a sign that the trauma survivor is being truthful \u2013 they honestly can\u2019t remember things in sequence. Dr Judith Herman, clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard and author of Trauma and Recovery: The Aftermath of Violence from Domestic Abuse to Political Terror, tells me: \u201cTraumatised people don\u2019t give you a perfect, complete narrative on the first go-round. You see this all the time with refugees seeking asylum. That doesn\u2019t mean their story isn\u2019t credible, because the gist of their story is consistent.\u201dAccording to Herman, more and more judges in US asylum hearings understand and accept the impact of trauma on memory. Unfortunately the general public can be less forgiving. Which is why North Korea, its sympathisers and dupes have been able to exploit the discrepancies in some defectors\u2019 stories as a weapon to attack their motives.A few days before Christmas last year I checked my inbox and found a mysterious email warning me not to write the book with Yeon-mi and help \u201cspread her lies\u201d. Then came the North Korean video. Despite having the production values of a Stalin-era newsreel, the footage was chilling: some of her uncles, aunts and cousins still living in North Korea were paraded in front of the camera to denounce her. The worst they could come up with was that Yeon-mi was an ambitious child. But it was horrifying for her to see them so vulnerable. At least she knew they were still alive.Yeon-mi continues to work on her book and to speak out for freedom in North Korea. On Human Rights Day last 10 December, Yeon-mi appeared on a panel at the US State Department with another outspoken defector named Joseph Kim. In many public forums, Kim has told how he watched his father wither and die from starvation, how his sister disappeared and his mother left home, and how he survived as a street kid, scrabbling for crusts of bread. \u201cHunger is humiliation,\u201d he says. \u201cHunger is helplessness.\u201d But on this day he added something new: his mother had sold his sister to a man in China, thinking it was better than sending her back to North Korea.\u201cThis is an important part of my story,\u201d said Kim, \u201cthat I hope illustrates how difficult and desperate the life is, and how many North Korean mothers were forced to make this kind of heartbreaking decision.\u201dDoes this fresh revelation in any way diminish this remarkable young man\u2019s credibility? Absolutely not. It only shows how traumatic narratives sometimes come out in fits and starts. The whole story does not emerge until the survivor finds a way to tell it. But for those who have the patience to listen closely, the stories gather and build to a heroic and truthful testimony of survival that cannot be silenced.\u2022 Author and journalist Maryanne Vollers has collaborated on several memoirs including Living History by Hillary Clinton.

The Russian foreign ministry said the agreement was designed to elevate ties \u201cin the political, economic, humanitarian and other areas to a new level\u201d.The Kremlin confirmed it had invited North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the end of the second word war in Europe.The trip would be Kim\u2019s first outside North Korea since he became leader of regime following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in late 2011. The older Kim visited Russia in August 2011 in his armoured train for a meeting with then Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev.The friendship agreement was announced on the same day that officials in Berlin said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, would not attend the ceremony in Moscow \u2013 a snub believed to be in retaliation for Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in Ukraine.The leaders in Moscow and Pyongyang appear to have much in the way of common cause. The UN has targeted North Korea with sanctions since it tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, and is applying pressure on the Kremlin to end its military involvement in Ukraine.The shift in North Korea\u2019s diplomatic focus towards Russia has been accelerated by tensions with China, Pyongyang\u2019s traditional ally and aid giver. China barely disguised its irritation with Kim after he ordered North Korea\u2019s third nuclear test in 2013 and the execution later that year of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, who had been instrumental in forging closer co-operation with Beijing. Chinese President Xi Jinping has yet to meet Kim; significantly, though, he has met South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye, several times.In an apparent attempt to counter Russian influence, China has approved increased co-operation with North Korea along their border and indicated it would be willing to hold a bilateral summit.Xi and Kim could also find themselves face to face at the war commemorations in May.Putin would doubtless welcome the international opprobrium that would follow a public appearance alongside Kim in Moscow this spring. North Korea, meanwhile, stands to gain financially and militarily from closer ties with Russia. In 2014 Moscow cancelled almost US$10bn, or 90%, of North Korea\u2019s bilateral debt and said it would invest the remaining $1.09bn \u2013 to be paid back over 20 years \u2013 in infrastructure projects such as a cross-border gas pipeline between Russia and the North, and a rail link to South Korea.Russia has also offered to invest $25bn in North Korea\u2019s creaking rail network in return for access to mineral resources.It remains to be seen how a closer the Putin-Kim relationship will affect international attempts to end the North\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. Talks involving North Korea, Russia, the US, China, South Korea and Japan to reach a nuclear deal have been stalled since 2009.North Korea is believed to possess between 10 and 16 nuclear weapons developed using plutonium or weapons-grade uranium. A recent report by US researchers warned that Pyongyang was poised to expand its nuclear programme over the next five years. A worst-case scenario would see it armed with as many as 100 nuclear weapons by end of the decade, the report said.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "Russia", "Ukraine", "World news"], "title": "North Korea and Russia forge \u2018year of friendship\u2019 pariah alliance"},{"date": "2015-01-31T05:00:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea is making military service mandatory for young women in a bid to strengthen the nation\u2019s armed forces, sources inside the secretive state have told DailyNK.The measure is said to apply to women aged between 17 and 20, and has been handed down to mobilisation offices in each province, city, and county. Implementation is reported to be already underway.\u201cLate last year, we received orders for all women who have graduated from middle and high school to undergo mandatory military service,\u201d a source based in North Hamkyung Province told Daily NK this week.\u201cThe preliminary screening and physicals related to enlistment, which begins in April, are all complete and duty sectors have been organised,\u201d the source said.Screenings look for physical problems or contagious diseases. The minimum height requirement for women to serve was lowered to 142cm in 2012, but this standard is not strictly enforced, according to the source. The military is said to be hoping to make up for a shortfall in troop numbers in its \u201cmillion-man army\u201dCustomarily, enlistment in North Korea occurs twice a year in April and August, and up until now, women served on a voluntarily basis, while men invariably underwent mandatory service.School graduates (17-18 years-old) enlist in April, while the enlistment period for workers at or under the age of 20 takes place in August.This new policy, however, is not expected to compel women to serve the same length of time as men. \u201cUnlike men, who have to serve for 10 years, mandatory service for women is only up to the age of 23,\u201d the source said.The military is said to be hoping to make up for a shortfall in troop numbers in its \u201cmillion-man army\u201d, following the high child mortality rate and low birth rate stemming from the Arduous March, the name given to the North Korean famine in the 1990s.The source explained that this year\u2019s admission quotas for female applicants to universities and technical schools have yet to be announced, presumably \u201cto only recommend those who have completed their military service or exceptionally gifted students from special schools who may be exempt from service altogether.\u201d The new directive is said to have caused concern among the public; women tend to be key breadwinners for their families by engaging in various types of business. In March 2003, at the sixth session of the 10th Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, it was announced that military service was to be reduced to 10 years from 13 for men, and to seven from 10 for women. Only women signing up voluntarily were to serve, while men in some specialised units would still be required to fulfil 13 years of service. Translated by Jiyeon Lee.

In fact, Pyongyang appears to have confused the film festival, which commences on 5 February, with Germany\u2019s domestic release schedule: The Interview is due out in cinemas across the country the same day.The North Korean statement read: \u201cThe screening of the movie that hurts the dignity of the supreme leadership of North Korea and openly agitates state-sponsored terrorism has nothing to do with the \u2018freedom of expression\u2019 touted by Germany. It is evidently agitation of terrorism quite contrary to the purpose and nature of the Berlin International Film Festival.\u201dIt continued: \u201cThe US and Germany should immediately stop the farce of screening the anti-North Korean movie at the film festival. Those who attempt at terrorist acts and commit politically-motivated provocations and those who join them in violation of the sovereignty and dignity of North Korea will never be able to escape merciless punishment.\u201dFestival head Dieter Kosslick was reportedly forced to meet with the North Korean ambassador to Germany to explain. A spokesperson told Variety the situation was now resolved and Pyongyang understood the comedy was not being screened at the Berlinale.North Korea\u2019s ire over The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-un by two bumbling American journalists (Seth Rogen and James Franco), proved no laughing matter for Sony when a group linked by the FBI to Pyongyang began releasing embarrassing private emails online, as well as five upcoming movies, following a cyber attack in December. The studio appeared to bow to threats of further revelations when it cancelled the film\u2019s theatrical release, but was later forced into a U-turn after Barack Obama went public to suggest executives should not have caved into the demands.The Interview has since gone on to make more than $45m via on demand and a limited US release in cinemas, and could even be on course to recoup the lion\u2019s share of its $75m budget.

An estimated 6,000 western tourists now visit every year through accredited tour companies, which includes US citizens, though their government \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d they do not travel there. Hundreds of thousands of tourists are estimated to come from neighbouring China each year. The ethics of travelling to North Korea are a subject of much debate. Some argue that greater interactions with the outside world is a positive development. Others have reservations about contributing financially to a regime accused of grave human rights abuses against its people, and travelling to a country where foreigners are escorted everywhere, and interactions with North Koreans are usually stage-managed with specially selected members of the public.Two of North Korea\u2019s biggest prestige projects in recent years have been the Masikryong ski resort and the \u2018tourist city\u2019 of Wonsan, and representatives promoting the country have begun to make themselves known on the world\u2019s travel forum circuit.\u201cThe country has made it clear that it is looking to grow its tourism sector in the coming years,\u201d said David Thompson from JTS. \u201cTo do so will require both international tourism expertise and foreign language skills.\u201dThompson said volunteers will be subject to the same limitations as other tourists in terms of where they can go inside North Korea, and who they can speak to. \u201cTo my knowledge there will not be the opportunity to wander freely,\u201d he said.21 year-old British student Ben Griffin was the first to sign up for a test trial for the volunteer programme last year in conjunction with North Korea\u2019s National Tourism Authority. He had travelled to North Korea on an official tour the year before and \u201cjumped on the chance\u201d to go again, he says. Griffin was not allowed freedom of movement, though he insists he did not feel closely monitored, and his guides were flexible with his itinerary if he made a request.In an enthusiastic account of his trip for Juche Travel he describes being driven around in luxury cars and using clips of the classic television show Only Fools and Horses to aide his English lessons. My students were on an advanced level although I\u2019m sure that they felt Del boy\u2019s cockney slang was almost a different language in itself.He says the show was a big hit: \u201cMy students were on an advanced level although I\u2019m sure that they felt Del boy\u2019s cockney slang was almost a different language in itself.

He reportedly added that it \u201chas proved to be efficacious against liver diseases like fatty liver and hepatitis.\u201dThe article cites the case of Choe Ryong from the Pothonggang District of the North Korean capital Pyongyang, who \u201cfeels no pain in his right side and digests well after taking it for nearly half a month.\u201d The medicine has been awarded the DPRK patent, the report said.Robert Winstanley-Chesters, director of research at Sino NK, a group of academics focused on North Korea, says the \u2018liver cure\u2019 is not as weird or wonderful as some might think \u201cbut one quite closely connected to east Asian, Chinese and Korean traditional medicine.\u201dBears gall and bile are regularly used in Chinese medicine so this should be seen as \u201cquite an expected medical development so far as North Korea is concerned\u201d, he says. Moreover, it is an example of \u201cself sufficiency and the creation or development of medical practice and technique that is specifically North Korean,\u201d he added.Winstanley-Chesters points to an article in Rodong Sinmun, the state newspaper, which says that doctors were hoping to cure what they called obstinate diseases with the \u2018Koryo Medical Method\u2019. The method is never explained but the reference to Korean history asserts an \u201cauthentic Koreaness\u201d, integral to any institution, development or technology coming out of North Korea, he says.The maackia amurensis, also known as amur maackia, is a deciduous shrub common in east Asia, China and Korea. A Canadian guide to complementary health care says that whilst the bark is commonly used in Korean medicine, in the west \u201cthe tree is primarily considered ornamental and planted for erosion control.\u201dBears are said to be resident at the Central Zoo, with four appearing in a promotional video in 2011. In the film, also put out by KCNA, Ju Kum-Chol \u2013 named as the head of the technical department \u2013 claims that animals enjoy \u201cnatural environments similar to their habitats.\u201d However, the bears are shown prowling around a concrete bowl with a patchy piece of grass at the centre.Hepatitis is the term used to describe the swelling of the liver as a result of a viral infection or exposure to harmful substances like alcohol. Fatty liver disease is also a symptom of alcohol abuse, and can affect people who are overweight or obese.This is not the first medical advancement North Korea has announced. In July KCNA revealed a \u201cnano gold injection\u201d for \u201cimmunity invigoration, inflammation, pain, neurosis, cerebration and blood circulation, promotion of metabolism and effacement of active oxygen. It also removes poisoning by medicine or chemicals.\u201d Nano-gold, which is gold broken down in to tiny particles is popular among some followers of alternative medicine, often ingested in a tea or as a tonic, and researchers at a Norwegian University are currently testing whether injecting it in to the body could help to combat cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s.KCNA said, it was developed at the Nano Technology Institute at Kim Il-sung University, but, as with the case with the liver medicine, gave no details on when it would made commonly available.In May 2014, KCNA also announced plans for a mushroom sports drink to enhance athletic prowess. \u201cThis natural drink is very effective in enhancing physical ability of sportspersons and recovering from their fatigues\u201d, a news report said. No independent media outlets exist in North Korea to help verify information released by the state media organisation.Analysts believe claims of medical advancement could be part of state attempts to deflect possible criticism of the general health care system, which is believed to be dire.A series of Guardian interviews with North Korean defectors painted a bleak picture of healthcare: a crumbling system where people are said to be taking methamphetamine as drugs are too expensive to buy.

Related: Gordon Brown: The truly patriotic British view on Europe? We must lead from within In a Guardian article before a House of Commons debate on the EU on Tuesday, in which he signals that he is prepared to speak out if a referendum is held on Britain\u2019s EU membership, Brown writes: \u201cWe must tell the truth about the 3m jobs, 25,000 companies, \u00a3200bn of annual exports and the \u00a3450bn of inward investment linked to Europe; and how the \u2018Britzerland\u2019 or Norwegian alternatives (even Norwegians oppose the Norwegian option) leave us subject to EU rules, but denied a vote in shaping them. And we must talk about how the Hong Kong option \u2013 \u2018leaving Europe to join the world\u2019 \u2013 is really the North Korea option, out in the cold with few friends, no influence, little new trade and even less new investment.\u201dThe intervention by the former prime minister comes as the Open Europe thinktank, which campaigns for a reformed EU, warned that Britain would face an uncertain future outside the EU.In the first of a series of reports examining the implications of a British exit, known as \u201cBrexit\u201d, the thinktank said that Britain would be able to negotiate trade deals with the EU on manufactured goods such as cars. But it warned that financial services could be damaged by \u201cbarriers to entering European markets [which] could be increased by new EU regulations over which the UK [would have] no votes\u201d.Brown makes a similar argument in stronger terms in his Guardian article as he warns that a British exit would amount to \u201csheer defeatism\u201d just as Britain is in course over the next few decades to overtake Germany as the EU\u2019s largest economy as its population declines. He writes: \u201cIt would be sheer defeatism to cast ourselves, as sceptics do, as helpless victim, impotent bystanders unable to influence events. Our destiny is not a bit player on someone else\u2019s stage, or a spectator hectoring from the wings, but always setting the agenda, bringing people together, and championing change.\u201dThe former prime minister indicates that the current government has already left Britain isolated as it flirts with an EU exit. \u201cBeing half-in half-out, a Britain that is semi-detached and disengaged \u2013 the Britain of the empty chair even when we are in the room \u2013 has made us weaker than ever: irrelevant on Greece, fringe player on climate change, mere spectator in the debate that could have shaped a European pro-growth policy, marginal on Ukraine, with ministers sounding ludicrous as simultaneously they say: \u2018Russia must be confronted with a more united Europe\u2019, and: \u2019By the way, we are thinking of leaving.\u2019\u201dThe main intellectual thrust of Brown\u2019s article is a warning that pro-Europeans risk giving the impression that the EU is an elitist project through their \u201cLondon establishment-led corporate-financed fact-based campaign of \u2018the great and the good\u2019\u201d. He feels the pro-Europeans are in danger of allowing the anti-Europeans to repeat the same trick that the SNP pulled off in the Scottish independence referendum in which Alex Salmond framed the argument as a choice between Scotland and Britain. Brown believes the pro-UK side needs to frame the referendum as a contest about a \u201cpatriotic vision\u201d of Scotland\u2019s future \u2013 in or out of the UK.He writes: \u201cAnti-Europeans are slowly, and with surprisingly little public acknowledgment, pulling off the same trick by framing Europe \u2013 the subject of what could be the next referendum \u2013 in the same way. What should be a choice between two patriotic futures for Britain \u2013 one as part of Europe and one outside it \u2013 is already descending into a more basic emotional choice: are you for Britain, or are you for Europe?\u201dThe former prime minister is prepared to take a prominent public role campaigning in favour of the EU if a referendum is held.

Lippert received 80 stitches during two and a half hours of surgery and will remain under observation in hospital for at least three days, his doctors said.The US and South Korea condemned the attack, but North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency described it as a valid \u201cexpression of resistance\u201d. A brief statement referred to the weapon used to slash Lippert as the \u201cknife of justice\u201d.Lippert, 42, tweeted after the surgery: \u201cDoing well and in great spirits! Robyn, Sejun, Grigsby [his wife, son and dog] and I \u2013 deeply moved by the support! Will be back ASAP to advance US-ROK [Republic of Korea] alliance!\u201d Doing well&in great spirits!

He said Lippert had also sustained a cut to his left arm, damaging nerves connected to his little finger and tendons connected to his thumb, and might experience sensory problems in the hand for several months.The attacker was wrestled to the ground after lunging at Lippert with a fruit knife at a forum at the Sejong Cultural Institute, across the road from the US embassy. He loudly demanded the reunification of the Korean peninsula and condemned joint military exercises currently being held between the US and South Korea. \u201cI carried out an act of terror,\u201d he shouted as he was pinned to the floor.South Korean media said Kim, 55, was an anti-US and Japan activist. In 1985 he was part of a group that slashed and burned the US flag on the embassy grounds. He has also held one-man protests against Japanese claims to the Takeshima islands, known in Korea as Dokdo, which are administered by Seoul.In 2010, he received a three-year suspended prison sentence after throwing a piece of concrete at the Japanese ambassador to Seoul. In 2007, Kim reportedly tried to set himself on fire with petrol while protesting in front of the presidential Blue House, demanding a government investigation into an alleged 1988 rape in Kim\u2019s office, according to news reports.After his arrest on Thursday, Kim reportedly told police he had been planning the attack for 10 days. \u201cI made the sacrifice to stop Key Resolve,\u201d he said, referring to the name given to this year\u2019s US-South Korea military drills.Police are considering whether to charge him for attempted homicide, an official involved in the case said.In a blogpost, Kim said the annual military drills would ruin any attempts to bring about reconciliation between the two Koreas, more than six decades after the Korean peninsula was divided at the end of the 1950-53 Korean war.Unification ministry sources said Kim had visited North Korea at least six times in 2006-07, and had tried to erect a memorial to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il but was blocked by police and rightwing activists.South Korea\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye \u2013 herself the target of a knife attack in 2006 \u2013 condemned the incident as \u201cintolerable\u201d during a visit to the United Arab Emirates, calling it \u201cnot only a physical attack on the US ambassador in South Korea but also an attack on the South Korea-US alliance\u201d.The Korean Council for Reconciliation and Co-operation, a pro-unification group that hosted Thursday\u2019s event, condemned the attack and apologised to the governments of both countries.In Washington, the US state department spokeswoman Marie Harf said: \u201cWe strongly condemn this act of violence.\u201d The White House\u2019s National Security Council spokeswoman, Bernadette Meehan, said Barack Obama had spoken with Lippert after the attack. \u201cThe president called to tell him that he and his wife Robyn are in his thoughts and prayers, and to wish him the very best for a speedy recovery,\u201d Meehan said.Witnesses described how the attack unfolded too quickly to prevent Kim from reaching Lippert, who was seated at a table. \u201cThe guy comes in wearing traditional Korean brown and tan dress. He yells something, goes up to the ambassador and slashes him in the face,\u201d said Michael Lammbrau, who works at the Arirang Institute thinktank in Seoul. \u201cPeople wrestled the guy to the ground, the ambassador was still in his chair. The ambassador fought him from his seat. He was escorted out afterwards,\u201d Lammbrau added. \u201cThere was a trail of blood behind him. He had about a seven inch-long gash on the right side of his face.\u201d A stunned-looking Lippert was able to walk to his car to be taken to hospital. He was seen holding a handkerchief to a cut on his right cheek, and the wrist on his other arm appeared to be bleeding heavily.Lippert has proved a popular ambassador during his time in Seoul and is a regular poster on social media. His wife gave birth in the city and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name.South and North Korea have remained effectively at war since 1953, when the Korean war ended in a ceasefire but not a peace treaty. The two countries have remained divided by the demilitarised zone \u2013 the world\u2019s most heavily armed border \u2013 ever since.The annual military drills, the latest of which began last week and will continue until April, have been blamed for raising tensions on the peninsula. North Korea routinely condemns the exercises as provocative, claiming they are practice for an invasion of the North. Seoul and Washington insist the drills are purely defensive.During drills in 2013 the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, threatened nuclear strikes on Washington and Seoul.

Related: The Guardian view on North Korea: even its elite may pay the price | Editorial For instance, the 2013 execution for treason of Kim\u2019s uncle and second in command, Jang Song-thaek, is not doubted. But initial reports that he was fed to more than 100 hungry dogs have been discredited.This week, a high-ranking defector from the north claimed in an interview with CNN that Kim had his aunt (and Jang\u2019s wife) Kim Kyong-hui dispatched, cold war-style, with a dose of poison about a year ago. But neither method will have been as clinical as the one reportedly used in Kim\u2019s latest high-level purge, sketchy details of which emerged on Wednesday. The 32-year-old reportedly used anti-aircraft fire to execute his defence chief for disrespectful behaviour, including napping during a military rally attended by the leader. North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency has not confirmed the purge, which was revealed by an official from South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service (NIS)to a closed meeting of lawmakers. Hyon was executed by firing squad with an anti-aircraft gun, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency said, citing testimony to a parliamentary panel given by the IS deputy director, Han Ki-beom. Han reportedly told MPs that hundreds of people had witnessed Hyon\u2019s execution, which was reportedly carried out in late April at Kang Kon military academy in northern Pyongyang. Intelligence sources suggested Hyon was shot with 14.5mm calibre rounds \u2013 a method of execution said to be reserved for senior officials whom the leadership wishes to make examples of. Evidence that the North Korean leadership occasionally resorts to anti-aircraft fire to dispense with its enemies came last month when the US-based Committee for Human Rights in Korea released satellite imagery that analysts said showed a shooting range lined with anti-aircraft guns apparently primed for an execution last October. Aside from dozing off in Kim\u2019s presence, Hyon, who spoke at a security conference in Moscow last month, had reportedly voiced dissatisfaction with his leadership. There is also speculation that during his visit to Moscow, Hyon had failed to secure a weapons deal in return for Kim\u2019s presence at a recent event to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany 70 years ago. But given Hyon\u2019s proximity to Kim, reports of his execution shocked some analysts. \u201cHyon was seen as one of the three closest military officials to Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies. \u201cAn inexperienced leader like Kim can often display a tendency for overtly dramatic and brash moves ... and for me the situation looks quite worrisome,\u201d he added. \u201cIt also suggests Kim is politically frustrated.\u201d South Korea\u2019s intelligence service has a mixed record on correctly tracking major political developments over the border, leading other analysts to strike a note of caution about Hyon\u2019s rumoured death. With conventional means of verification practically impossible for those outside the country, observers resort to monitoring North Korean media for clues. Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute thinktank in Seoul questioned the authenticity of the NIS report, pointing out that Hyon was still making frequent appearances on state TV footage. North Korea typically removes executed and purged officials from TV documentaries, but Hyon appeared multiple times in a TV documentary on live fire drills between 30 April and 11 May, according to the unification ministry in Seoul.North Korean state media have not mentioned Hyon since 29 April, when it reported his presence at a music performance the previous day. Cheong said the NIS had been \u201crash\u201d in reporting the execution on the basis of \u201cshaky, unconfirmed intelligence\u201d. He added: \u201cIt needs to be verified, but is already being reported as fact by the media, which only adds to the confusion.\u201d Hyon\u2019s reported death fits a pattern, however, coming weeks after the NIS claimed Kim had ordered the execution of 15 senior officials so far this year, apparently for questioning his authority. In all, around 70 officials have been executed since Kim became leader, Yonhap quoted the NIS as saying.In January, he executed Gen Pyon In-son, head of operations in the army, for disagreeing with him. He also executed about 50 officials last year on charges ranging from corruption to watching South Korean soap operas. Kim\u2019s decision to cancel his much-anticipated appearance in Moscow last week, citing \u201cinternal issues\u201d, lends weight to the theory that he is in the midst of yet another round of purges. Initial doubts over whether Kim, a young and inexperienced leader when he succeeded his late father, Kim Jong-il, would be able to retain his grip on power persist more than three years after he became the third member of the Kim dynasty to rule the reclusive state. \u201cNorth Korean internal politics is very volatile these days,\u201d said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North thinktank. \u201cInternally, there does not seem to be any respect for Kim Jong-un within the core and middle levels of the North Korean leadership. \u201cThere is no clear or present danger to Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership or stability in North Korea, but if this continues to happen into next year, then we would seriously have to start looking at a contingency plan for the Korean peninsula.\u201d Hyon, a little-known general, was promoted to the rank of vice-marshal of the North Korean army in 2012. The South Korean spy agency told lawmakers that Ma Won-chun, known as North Korea\u2019s chief architect of new infrastructure under Kim, was also purged, local media reported. Andrei Lankov, a North Korea specialist at Kookmin University in Seoul, said that the reported purges in Pyongyang did not necessarily mean that Kim\u2019s grip on power was weakening. \u201cThe common assumption is that it\u2019s bad for stability, but I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Lankov said. \u201cThe young boy is not necessarily popular with the military, so he wants to show that he\u2019s in control and he\u2019s the boss.\u201d ", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un"], "title": "North Korea defence chief reportedly executed with anti-aircraft gun"},{"date": "2015-05-09T03:24:59Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea has fired three anti-ship cruise missiles into the country\u2019s eastern sea, South Korean military officials confirmed.

In the past three years, we\u2019ve learned that Kim 2.0 executed a Pyongyang traffic lady for sneezing (false); was voted 2012\u2019s \u201csexiest man alive\u201d (false); poisoned his aunt Kim Kyong-hui (false); assassinated his pop-singer girlfriend Hyon Song-wol for making porn (false); and oversaw the Sony Pictures hack in retaliation for the Kim Jong-un assassination spoof, The Interview (debatable). When he disappeared for a month in 2014, there was speculation he had been ousted by a coup (false); killed by his generals (false); contracted gout (who knows?); or broken his ankle after growing fat from eating cheese (he does appear to have gained weight).The malleability of digital media, and the speed with which consumers can embed and reframe North Korean content before passing it on, means even truthful accounts of Kim Jong-un\u2019s ruthless moves to shore up his inherited power are frequently embellished. When Kim executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, in late 2013 for insubordination, mainstream news feeds reported Jang and five aides had been stripped naked and fed to 120 starving dogs. The story went viral, before it was traced back to a Chinese satirist\u2019s blog on Tencent Weibo.Critical thinking just goes out the window on North KoreaOnly this month, South Korea\u2019s national intelligence agency reported Kim had publicly obliterated another insider, general Hyon Yong-chol, with an anti-aircraft gun. The story was widely circulated before the agency adjusted its claim: Hyon had been \u201cpurged\u201d for \u201cdozing off\u201d at official events, but might still be alive. \u201cCritical thinking just goes out the window on North Korea,\u201d observed Chad O\u2019Carroll, founder of the NK News website. David Straub of Stanford University identifies \u201can exponential increase\u201d in the number of people circulating anything \u201ceven remotely plausible about North Korea\u201d \u2013 and in established media passing it on. And with consumers happy to buy entertainment as news, \u201ckooky North Korea\u201d stories do a roaring trade.  Related: Unicorn lair 'discovered' in North Korea KCNA\u2019s 2012 announcement that archaeologists had discovered a unicorn lair in Pyongyang was gleefully circulated by western feeds, complete with a photoshopped horse. In 2014, the ABC on-sold Radio Free Asia\u2019s claim that Kim Jong-un\u2019s haircut is compulsory for Pyongyang university students; a year later, the blogosphere exploded with a recycled BBC report that long hair is banned in North Korea because it \u201csaps brain energy\u201d. The Toronto Sun\u2019s craziest rumours about North Korea post alleges that North Korean Olympians who fail to win a medal are sent to the gulags, and Pyongyang officials supported Scottish independence \u201cfor the Scotch alone\u201d.Stories that discredit these rumours are rarely given the same fanfare or weight. The revelation that the YouTube documentary about the Pyongyang traffic lady is fake is buried in the comments page; Kim Jong-un\u2019s pop-singer girlfriend\u2019s appearance on KCNA a year after reports of her grisly murder failed to reach the same million consumers who believed her dead; North Korean gulag survivor Shin Dong-hyuk\u2019s recent admission that parts of his bestselling memoir are false did little to dampen belief in its credibility; and in May, Seoul\u2019s Daily NK ran a discreet post contradicting CNN\u2019s widely publicised story about Kim Jong-un\u2019s poisoned aunt, stating Kyong-hui is alive in Pyongyang.The truth about North Korea is also a casualty when politics come into play. On 30 December 2014, when independent cyber analysts announced that disgruntled employees, not Kim Jong-un, were behind the Sony hack, the FBI had already found North Korea guilty. Senator John McCain labeled the hack an \u201cact of war\u201d; Sony released The Interview with President Obama\u2019s blessing; North Korea\u2019s limited internet capabilities were mysteriously \u201cblacked out\u201d in an unattributed strike; and, by 2 January 2015, the US had imposed new sanctions on North Korea and was considering reinstating it as a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d.Why does all this matter? Because if you have been to North Korea and spent time with the people who live and work there, the media\u2019s relentlessly recycled picture of North Koreans as brainwashed automatons, robotically enslaved to the despotic Kims, is simplistic, dehumanising and cruel. I went to North Korea twice in 2012: the only westerner granted total access to the country\u2019s powerful propaganda film industry. Despite being closely monitored by five North Koreans on my crew, I can dispel some crazier rumours doing the rounds.  Related: Do North Koreans know their country is the butt of so many jokes? Men are not forced to cut their hair like Kim Jong-un. Women can wear pants. It is safe to be a tourist, if you don\u2019t hand out bibles. It is forbidden to film portraits of the Kims soft-focus or cropped. People like to dance in public, not just when told to by the state. The country is poor, but not everyone is starving or in chains: an estimated 100,000 North Koreans are imprisoned, with a further 8.3m lacking adequate food and shelter. The remaining 16.6m rely on a growing black market economy and lead \u201cnormal\u201d enough lives to go to the movies.Vice\u2019s popular claim that North Korea no longer makes films is false: Pyongyang\u2019s five studios produce 20 to 30 rom-coms, thrillers, dramas, animations and documentaries a year. The film stars, directors and writers I met had never heard of Stanley Kubrick, but loved Bend it Like Beckham, The Sound of Music and Avatar. Like their southern cousins, they were resilient, warm and loved telling jokes, mostly about the Russians and Chinese. Resentment towards Kim Jong-un was evident but concealed: criticising him can lead to the gulags. My book about my experience featured Kim Jong-il on the cover \u2013 until my Pyongyang contact told me to remove him if I wanted my North Korean friends to survive. The Kims are considered too holy to physically depict on screen. A North Korean actor once had plastic surgery to portray founding founder Kim Il-sung in the drama, Star of Korea, then was permanently reassigned to a behind-the-scenes production role.

Related: The Guardian view on North Korea: even its elite may pay the price | Editorial For instance, the 2013 execution for treason of Kim\u2019s uncle and second in command, Jang Song-thaek, is not doubted. But initial reports that he was fed to more than 100 hungry dogs have been discredited.This week, a high-ranking defector from the north claimed in an interview with CNN that Kim had his aunt (and Jang\u2019s wife) Kim Kyong-hui dispatched, cold war-style, with a dose of poison about a year ago. But neither method will have been as clinical as the one reportedly used in Kim\u2019s latest high-level purge, sketchy details of which emerged on Wednesday. The 32-year-old reportedly used anti-aircraft fire to execute his defence chief for disrespectful behaviour, including napping during a military rally attended by the leader. North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency has not confirmed the purge, which was revealed by an official from South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service (NIS)to a closed meeting of lawmakers. Hyon was executed by firing squad with an anti-aircraft gun, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency said, citing testimony to a parliamentary panel given by the IS deputy director, Han Ki-beom. Han reportedly told MPs that hundreds of people had witnessed Hyon\u2019s execution, which was reportedly carried out in late April at Kang Kon military academy in northern Pyongyang. Intelligence sources suggested Hyon was shot with 14.5mm calibre rounds \u2013 a method of execution said to be reserved for senior officials whom the leadership wishes to make examples of. Evidence that the North Korean leadership occasionally resorts to anti-aircraft fire to dispense with its enemies came last month when the US-based Committee for Human Rights in Korea released satellite imagery that analysts said showed a shooting range lined with anti-aircraft guns apparently primed for an execution last October. Aside from dozing off in Kim\u2019s presence, Hyon, who spoke at a security conference in Moscow last month, had reportedly voiced dissatisfaction with his leadership. There is also speculation that during his visit to Moscow, Hyon had failed to secure a weapons deal in return for Kim\u2019s presence at a recent event to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany 70 years ago. But given Hyon\u2019s proximity to Kim, reports of his execution shocked some analysts. \u201cHyon was seen as one of the three closest military officials to Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies. \u201cAn inexperienced leader like Kim can often display a tendency for overtly dramatic and brash moves ... and for me the situation looks quite worrisome,\u201d he added. \u201cIt also suggests Kim is politically frustrated.\u201d South Korea\u2019s intelligence service has a mixed record on correctly tracking major political developments over the border, leading other analysts to strike a note of caution about Hyon\u2019s rumoured death. With conventional means of verification practically impossible for those outside the country, observers resort to monitoring North Korean media for clues. Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute thinktank in Seoul questioned the authenticity of the NIS report, pointing out that Hyon was still making frequent appearances on state TV footage. North Korea typically removes executed and purged officials from TV documentaries, but Hyon appeared multiple times in a TV documentary on live fire drills between 30 April and 11 May, according to the unification ministry in Seoul.North Korean state media have not mentioned Hyon since 29 April, when it reported his presence at a music performance the previous day. Cheong said the NIS had been \u201crash\u201d in reporting the execution on the basis of \u201cshaky, unconfirmed intelligence\u201d. He added: \u201cIt needs to be verified, but is already being reported as fact by the media, which only adds to the confusion.\u201d Hyon\u2019s reported death fits a pattern, however, coming weeks after the NIS claimed Kim had ordered the execution of 15 senior officials so far this year, apparently for questioning his authority. In all, around 70 officials have been executed since Kim became leader, Yonhap quoted the NIS as saying.In January, he executed Gen Pyon In-son, head of operations in the army, for disagreeing with him. He also executed about 50 officials last year on charges ranging from corruption to watching South Korean soap operas. Kim\u2019s decision to cancel his much-anticipated appearance in Moscow last week, citing \u201cinternal issues\u201d, lends weight to the theory that he is in the midst of yet another round of purges. Initial doubts over whether Kim, a young and inexperienced leader when he succeeded his late father, Kim Jong-il, would be able to retain his grip on power persist more than three years after he became the third member of the Kim dynasty to rule the reclusive state. \u201cNorth Korean internal politics is very volatile these days,\u201d said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North thinktank. \u201cInternally, there does not seem to be any respect for Kim Jong-un within the core and middle levels of the North Korean leadership. \u201cThere is no clear or present danger to Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership or stability in North Korea, but if this continues to happen into next year, then we would seriously have to start looking at a contingency plan for the Korean peninsula.\u201d Hyon, a little-known general, was promoted to the rank of vice-marshal of the North Korean army in 2012. The South Korean spy agency told lawmakers that Ma Won-chun, known as North Korea\u2019s chief architect of new infrastructure under Kim, was also purged, local media reported. Andrei Lankov, a North Korea specialist at Kookmin University in Seoul, said that the reported purges in Pyongyang did not necessarily mean that Kim\u2019s grip on power was weakening. \u201cThe common assumption is that it\u2019s bad for stability, but I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Lankov said. \u201cThe young boy is not necessarily popular with the military, so he wants to show that he\u2019s in control and he\u2019s the boss.\u201d ", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un"], "title": "North Korea defence chief reportedly executed with anti-aircraft gun"},{"date": "2015-05-09T03:24:59Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea has fired three anti-ship cruise missiles into the country\u2019s eastern sea, South Korean military officials confirmed.

Related: The Guardian view on North Korea: even its elite may pay the price | Editorial For instance, the 2013 execution for treason of Kim\u2019s uncle and second in command, Jang Song-thaek, is not doubted. But initial reports that he was fed to more than 100 hungry dogs have been discredited.This week, a high-ranking defector from the north claimed in an interview with CNN that Kim had his aunt (and Jang\u2019s wife) Kim Kyong-hui dispatched, cold war-style, with a dose of poison about a year ago. But neither method will have been as clinical as the one reportedly used in Kim\u2019s latest high-level purge, sketchy details of which emerged on Wednesday. The 32-year-old reportedly used anti-aircraft fire to execute his defence chief for disrespectful behaviour, including napping during a military rally attended by the leader. North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency has not confirmed the purge, which was revealed by an official from South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service (NIS)to a closed meeting of lawmakers. Hyon was executed by firing squad with an anti-aircraft gun, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency said, citing testimony to a parliamentary panel given by the IS deputy director, Han Ki-beom. Han reportedly told MPs that hundreds of people had witnessed Hyon\u2019s execution, which was reportedly carried out in late April at Kang Kon military academy in northern Pyongyang. Intelligence sources suggested Hyon was shot with 14.5mm calibre rounds \u2013 a method of execution said to be reserved for senior officials whom the leadership wishes to make examples of. Evidence that the North Korean leadership occasionally resorts to anti-aircraft fire to dispense with its enemies came last month when the US-based Committee for Human Rights in Korea released satellite imagery that analysts said showed a shooting range lined with anti-aircraft guns apparently primed for an execution last October. Aside from dozing off in Kim\u2019s presence, Hyon, who spoke at a security conference in Moscow last month, had reportedly voiced dissatisfaction with his leadership. There is also speculation that during his visit to Moscow, Hyon had failed to secure a weapons deal in return for Kim\u2019s presence at a recent event to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany 70 years ago. But given Hyon\u2019s proximity to Kim, reports of his execution shocked some analysts. \u201cHyon was seen as one of the three closest military officials to Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies. \u201cAn inexperienced leader like Kim can often display a tendency for overtly dramatic and brash moves ... and for me the situation looks quite worrisome,\u201d he added. \u201cIt also suggests Kim is politically frustrated.\u201d South Korea\u2019s intelligence service has a mixed record on correctly tracking major political developments over the border, leading other analysts to strike a note of caution about Hyon\u2019s rumoured death. With conventional means of verification practically impossible for those outside the country, observers resort to monitoring North Korean media for clues. Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute thinktank in Seoul questioned the authenticity of the NIS report, pointing out that Hyon was still making frequent appearances on state TV footage. North Korea typically removes executed and purged officials from TV documentaries, but Hyon appeared multiple times in a TV documentary on live fire drills between 30 April and 11 May, according to the unification ministry in Seoul.North Korean state media have not mentioned Hyon since 29 April, when it reported his presence at a music performance the previous day. Cheong said the NIS had been \u201crash\u201d in reporting the execution on the basis of \u201cshaky, unconfirmed intelligence\u201d. He added: \u201cIt needs to be verified, but is already being reported as fact by the media, which only adds to the confusion.\u201d Hyon\u2019s reported death fits a pattern, however, coming weeks after the NIS claimed Kim had ordered the execution of 15 senior officials so far this year, apparently for questioning his authority. In all, around 70 officials have been executed since Kim became leader, Yonhap quoted the NIS as saying.In January, he executed Gen Pyon In-son, head of operations in the army, for disagreeing with him. He also executed about 50 officials last year on charges ranging from corruption to watching South Korean soap operas. Kim\u2019s decision to cancel his much-anticipated appearance in Moscow last week, citing \u201cinternal issues\u201d, lends weight to the theory that he is in the midst of yet another round of purges. Initial doubts over whether Kim, a young and inexperienced leader when he succeeded his late father, Kim Jong-il, would be able to retain his grip on power persist more than three years after he became the third member of the Kim dynasty to rule the reclusive state. \u201cNorth Korean internal politics is very volatile these days,\u201d said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North thinktank. \u201cInternally, there does not seem to be any respect for Kim Jong-un within the core and middle levels of the North Korean leadership. \u201cThere is no clear or present danger to Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership or stability in North Korea, but if this continues to happen into next year, then we would seriously have to start looking at a contingency plan for the Korean peninsula.\u201d Hyon, a little-known general, was promoted to the rank of vice-marshal of the North Korean army in 2012. The South Korean spy agency told lawmakers that Ma Won-chun, known as North Korea\u2019s chief architect of new infrastructure under Kim, was also purged, local media reported. Andrei Lankov, a North Korea specialist at Kookmin University in Seoul, said that the reported purges in Pyongyang did not necessarily mean that Kim\u2019s grip on power was weakening. \u201cThe common assumption is that it\u2019s bad for stability, but I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Lankov said. \u201cThe young boy is not necessarily popular with the military, so he wants to show that he\u2019s in control and he\u2019s the boss.\u201d ", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un"], "title": "North Korea defence chief reportedly executed with anti-aircraft gun"},{"date": "2015-05-09T03:24:59Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea has fired three anti-ship cruise missiles into the country\u2019s eastern sea, South Korean military officials confirmed.

In the past three years, we\u2019ve learned that Kim 2.0 executed a Pyongyang traffic lady for sneezing (false); was voted 2012\u2019s \u201csexiest man alive\u201d (false); poisoned his aunt Kim Kyong-hui (false); assassinated his pop-singer girlfriend Hyon Song-wol for making porn (false); and oversaw the Sony Pictures hack in retaliation for the Kim Jong-un assassination spoof, The Interview (debatable). When he disappeared for a month in 2014, there was speculation he had been ousted by a coup (false); killed by his generals (false); contracted gout (who knows?); or broken his ankle after growing fat from eating cheese (he does appear to have gained weight).The malleability of digital media, and the speed with which consumers can embed and reframe North Korean content before passing it on, means even truthful accounts of Kim Jong-un\u2019s ruthless moves to shore up his inherited power are frequently embellished. When Kim executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, in late 2013 for insubordination, mainstream news feeds reported Jang and five aides had been stripped naked and fed to 120 starving dogs. The story went viral, before it was traced back to a Chinese satirist\u2019s blog on Tencent Weibo.Critical thinking just goes out the window on North KoreaOnly this month, South Korea\u2019s national intelligence agency reported Kim had publicly obliterated another insider, general Hyon Yong-chol, with an anti-aircraft gun. The story was widely circulated before the agency adjusted its claim: Hyon had been \u201cpurged\u201d for \u201cdozing off\u201d at official events, but might still be alive. \u201cCritical thinking just goes out the window on North Korea,\u201d observed Chad O\u2019Carroll, founder of the NK News website. David Straub of Stanford University identifies \u201can exponential increase\u201d in the number of people circulating anything \u201ceven remotely plausible about North Korea\u201d \u2013 and in established media passing it on.

Related: Unicorn lair 'discovered' in North Korea KCNA\u2019s 2012 announcement that archaeologists had discovered a unicorn lair in Pyongyang was gleefully circulated by western feeds, complete with a photoshopped horse. In 2014, the ABC on-sold Radio Free Asia\u2019s claim that Kim Jong-un\u2019s haircut is compulsory for Pyongyang university students; a year later, the blogosphere exploded with a recycled BBC report that long hair is banned in North Korea because it \u201csaps brain energy\u201d. The Toronto Sun\u2019s craziest rumours about North Korea post alleges that North Korean Olympians who fail to win a medal are sent to the gulags, and Pyongyang officials supported Scottish independence \u201cfor the Scotch alone\u201d.Stories that discredit these rumours are rarely given the same fanfare or weight. The revelation that the YouTube documentary about the Pyongyang traffic lady is fake is buried in the comments page; Kim Jong-un\u2019s pop-singer girlfriend\u2019s appearance on KCNA a year after reports of her grisly murder failed to reach the same million consumers who believed her dead; North Korean gulag survivor Shin Dong-hyuk\u2019s recent admission that parts of his bestselling memoir are false did little to dampen belief in its credibility; and in May, Seoul\u2019s Daily NK ran a discreet post contradicting CNN\u2019s widely publicised story about Kim Jong-un\u2019s poisoned aunt, stating Kyong-hui is alive in Pyongyang.The truth about North Korea is also a casualty when politics come into play. On 30 December 2014, when independent cyber analysts announced that disgruntled employees, not Kim Jong-un, were behind the Sony hack, the FBI had already found North Korea guilty. Senator John McCain labeled the hack an \u201cact of war\u201d; Sony released The Interview with President Obama\u2019s blessing; North Korea\u2019s limited internet capabilities were mysteriously \u201cblacked out\u201d in an unattributed strike; and, by 2 January 2015, the US had imposed new sanctions on North Korea and was considering reinstating it as a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d.Why does all this matter? Because if you have been to North Korea and spent time with the people who live and work there, the media\u2019s relentlessly recycled picture of North Koreans as brainwashed automatons, robotically enslaved to the despotic Kims, is simplistic, dehumanising and cruel. I went to North Korea twice in 2012: the only westerner granted total access to the country\u2019s powerful propaganda film industry. Despite being closely monitored by five North Koreans on my crew, I can dispel some crazier rumours doing the rounds.  Related: Do North Koreans know their country is the butt of so many jokes?

The country is poor, but not everyone is starving or in chains: an estimated 100,000 North Koreans are imprisoned, with a further 8.3m lacking adequate food and shelter. The remaining 16.6m rely on a growing black market economy and lead \u201cnormal\u201d enough lives to go to the movies.Vice\u2019s popular claim that North Korea no longer makes films is false: Pyongyang\u2019s five studios produce 20 to 30 rom-coms, thrillers, dramas, animations and documentaries a year. The film stars, directors and writers I met had never heard of Stanley Kubrick, but loved Bend it Like Beckham, The Sound of Music and Avatar. Like their southern cousins, they were resilient, warm and loved telling jokes, mostly about the Russians and Chinese. Resentment towards Kim Jong-un was evident but concealed: criticising him can lead to the gulags. My book about my experience featured Kim Jong-il on the cover \u2013 until my Pyongyang contact told me to remove him if I wanted my North Korean friends to survive. The Kims are considered too holy to physically depict on screen. A North Korean actor once had plastic surgery to portray founding founder Kim Il-sung in the drama, Star of Korea, then was permanently reassigned to a behind-the-scenes production role.

Though South Korean intelligence was sufficiently confident to report the allegation to lawmakers, the service has a patchy record on events across the 38th parallel.Sensational tales abound, such as reports that Kim Jong-un\u2019s aunt was variously poisoned on his orders, had a fatal stroke while rowing with him, killed herself, was left in a coma following surgery \u2013 or is still up and about. The regime confirmed the execution of Kim Jong-un\u2019s uncle Jang Song-thaek, but we know he was not torn apart by dogs, as some said. An ex-girlfriend of the young leader, supposedly killed after starring in a porn film, turned up alive and well. One analyst notes that the armed forces minister has yet to be removed from documentaries shown on state television, as one would expect of a disgraced and dead official.Totalitarian states run on fear, and Pyongyang is no exception. Last year, a UN inquiry concluded that it was committing systematic and appalling human rights abuses on a scale unparalleled in the modern world, citing torture, execution and arbitrary imprisonment, deliberate starvation and an almost complete lack of free thought and belief. Never mind the high-level victims, who have at least feasted at the top table: look to the tens of thousands held in political prison camps, in many cases not even for their actions, but those of a family member.Accounts of dramatic elite deaths, however, portray the regime as capricious and unstable as well as cruel. That suits the North\u2019s opponents; less often noted is that it suits the North too. Playing crazy has proved an astute strategy for a small, poor country that George W Bush called part of the axis of evil. The Kim family drew the obvious lesson: to avoid Saddam Hussein\u2019s fate, they should continue developing their nuclear programme and demonstrate they might be willing to use their weapons. The country\u2019s military spending and bellicose rhetoric reflect both its anxiety about external hostility and its calculation that the rational course is, paradoxically, to appear unhinged.All that said, the North may be seeing the purge of senior officials at a rate unknown since the early days of Kim Il-sung\u2019s rule in the 1950s. Whether his grandson is unnerved by possible internal challenges, or is acting from confidence, ousting top leaders could in itself create tensions he will struggle to control. The country must already contend with the disintegration of faith in the state and effect of tentative economic changes.Predictions of a North Korean collapse are largely a matter of wishful thinking, while calls for aggressive intervention have receded over the years.

Related: The Guardian view on North Korea: even its elite may pay the price | Editorial For instance, the 2013 execution for treason of Kim\u2019s uncle and second in command, Jang Song-thaek, is not doubted. But initial reports that he was fed to more than 100 hungry dogs have been discredited.This week, a high-ranking defector from the north claimed in an interview with CNN that Kim had his aunt (and Jang\u2019s wife) Kim Kyong-hui dispatched, cold war-style, with a dose of poison about a year ago. But neither method will have been as clinical as the one reportedly used in Kim\u2019s latest high-level purge, sketchy details of which emerged on Wednesday. The 32-year-old reportedly used anti-aircraft fire to execute his defence chief for disrespectful behaviour, including napping during a military rally attended by the leader. North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency has not confirmed the purge, which was revealed by an official from South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service (NIS)to a closed meeting of lawmakers. Hyon was executed by firing squad with an anti-aircraft gun, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency said, citing testimony to a parliamentary panel given by the IS deputy director, Han Ki-beom. Han reportedly told MPs that hundreds of people had witnessed Hyon\u2019s execution, which was reportedly carried out in late April at Kang Kon military academy in northern Pyongyang. Intelligence sources suggested Hyon was shot with 14.5mm calibre rounds \u2013 a method of execution said to be reserved for senior officials whom the leadership wishes to make examples of. Evidence that the North Korean leadership occasionally resorts to anti-aircraft fire to dispense with its enemies came last month when the US-based Committee for Human Rights in Korea released satellite imagery that analysts said showed a shooting range lined with anti-aircraft guns apparently primed for an execution last October. Aside from dozing off in Kim\u2019s presence, Hyon, who spoke at a security conference in Moscow last month, had reportedly voiced dissatisfaction with his leadership. There is also speculation that during his visit to Moscow, Hyon had failed to secure a weapons deal in return for Kim\u2019s presence at a recent event to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany 70 years ago. But given Hyon\u2019s proximity to Kim, reports of his execution shocked some analysts. \u201cHyon was seen as one of the three closest military officials to Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies. \u201cAn inexperienced leader like Kim can often display a tendency for overtly dramatic and brash moves ... and for me the situation looks quite worrisome,\u201d he added. \u201cIt also suggests Kim is politically frustrated.\u201d South Korea\u2019s intelligence service has a mixed record on correctly tracking major political developments over the border, leading other analysts to strike a note of caution about Hyon\u2019s rumoured death. With conventional means of verification practically impossible for those outside the country, observers resort to monitoring North Korean media for clues. Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute thinktank in Seoul questioned the authenticity of the NIS report, pointing out that Hyon was still making frequent appearances on state TV footage. North Korea typically removes executed and purged officials from TV documentaries, but Hyon appeared multiple times in a TV documentary on live fire drills between 30 April and 11 May, according to the unification ministry in Seoul.North Korean state media have not mentioned Hyon since 29 April, when it reported his presence at a music performance the previous day. Cheong said the NIS had been \u201crash\u201d in reporting the execution on the basis of \u201cshaky, unconfirmed intelligence\u201d. He added: \u201cIt needs to be verified, but is already being reported as fact by the media, which only adds to the confusion.\u201d Hyon\u2019s reported death fits a pattern, however, coming weeks after the NIS claimed Kim had ordered the execution of 15 senior officials so far this year, apparently for questioning his authority. In all, around 70 officials have been executed since Kim became leader, Yonhap quoted the NIS as saying.In January, he executed Gen Pyon In-son, head of operations in the army, for disagreeing with him. He also executed about 50 officials last year on charges ranging from corruption to watching South Korean soap operas. Kim\u2019s decision to cancel his much-anticipated appearance in Moscow last week, citing \u201cinternal issues\u201d, lends weight to the theory that he is in the midst of yet another round of purges. Initial doubts over whether Kim, a young and inexperienced leader when he succeeded his late father, Kim Jong-il, would be able to retain his grip on power persist more than three years after he became the third member of the Kim dynasty to rule the reclusive state. \u201cNorth Korean internal politics is very volatile these days,\u201d said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North thinktank. \u201cInternally, there does not seem to be any respect for Kim Jong-un within the core and middle levels of the North Korean leadership. \u201cThere is no clear or present danger to Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership or stability in North Korea, but if this continues to happen into next year, then we would seriously have to start looking at a contingency plan for the Korean peninsula.\u201d Hyon, a little-known general, was promoted to the rank of vice-marshal of the North Korean army in 2012. The South Korean spy agency told lawmakers that Ma Won-chun, known as North Korea\u2019s chief architect of new infrastructure under Kim, was also purged, local media reported. Andrei Lankov, a North Korea specialist at Kookmin University in Seoul, said that the reported purges in Pyongyang did not necessarily mean that Kim\u2019s grip on power was weakening. \u201cThe common assumption is that it\u2019s bad for stability, but I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Lankov said. \u201cThe young boy is not necessarily popular with the military, so he wants to show that he\u2019s in control and he\u2019s the boss.\u201d ", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un"], "title": "North Korea defence chief reportedly executed with anti-aircraft gun"},{"date": "2015-05-09T03:24:59Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea has fired three anti-ship cruise missiles into the country\u2019s eastern sea, South Korean military officials confirmed.

In the past three years, we\u2019ve learned that Kim 2.0 executed a Pyongyang traffic lady for sneezing (false); was voted 2012\u2019s \u201csexiest man alive\u201d (false); poisoned his aunt Kim Kyong-hui (false); assassinated his pop-singer girlfriend Hyon Song-wol for making porn (false); and oversaw the Sony Pictures hack in retaliation for the Kim Jong-un assassination spoof, The Interview (debatable). When he disappeared for a month in 2014, there was speculation he had been ousted by a coup (false); killed by his generals (false); contracted gout (who knows?); or broken his ankle after growing fat from eating cheese (he does appear to have gained weight).The malleability of digital media, and the speed with which consumers can embed and reframe North Korean content before passing it on, means even truthful accounts of Kim Jong-un\u2019s ruthless moves to shore up his inherited power are frequently embellished. When Kim executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, in late 2013 for insubordination, mainstream news feeds reported Jang and five aides had been stripped naked and fed to 120 starving dogs.

The story was widely circulated before the agency adjusted its claim: Hyon had been \u201cpurged\u201d for \u201cdozing off\u201d at official events, but might still be alive. \u201cCritical thinking just goes out the window on North Korea,\u201d observed Chad O\u2019Carroll, founder of the NK News website.

The revelation that the YouTube documentary about the Pyongyang traffic lady is fake is buried in the comments page; Kim Jong-un\u2019s pop-singer girlfriend\u2019s appearance on KCNA a year after reports of her grisly murder failed to reach the same million consumers who believed her dead; North Korean gulag survivor Shin Dong-hyuk\u2019s recent admission that parts of his bestselling memoir are false did little to dampen belief in its credibility; and in May, Seoul\u2019s Daily NK ran a discreet post contradicting CNN\u2019s widely publicised story about Kim Jong-un\u2019s poisoned aunt, stating Kyong-hui is alive in Pyongyang.The truth about North Korea is also a casualty when politics come into play. On 30 December 2014, when independent cyber analysts announced that disgruntled employees, not Kim Jong-un, were behind the Sony hack, the FBI had already found North Korea guilty. Senator John McCain labeled the hack an \u201cact of war\u201d; Sony released The Interview with President Obama\u2019s blessing; North Korea\u2019s limited internet capabilities were mysteriously \u201cblacked out\u201d in an unattributed strike; and, by 2 January 2015, the US had imposed new sanctions on North Korea and was considering reinstating it as a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d.Why does all this matter? Because if you have been to North Korea and spent time with the people who live and work there, the media\u2019s relentlessly recycled picture of North Koreans as brainwashed automatons, robotically enslaved to the despotic Kims, is simplistic, dehumanising and cruel. I went to North Korea twice in 2012: the only westerner granted total access to the country\u2019s powerful propaganda film industry.

There are also worries about North Korea after South Korea\u2019s spy agency said last week that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had his defence chief executed by anti-aircraft gun in late April.Lim Byeong Cheol, a spokesman for Seoul\u2019s unification ministry, expressed regret over the north\u2019s decision, saying the country must accept offers of dialogue and cooperation by the UN and other members of the international community instead of isolating itself.North Korea has sometimes invited high-profile figures such as the former US president Jimmy Carter under the expectation that they would listen to its concerns and mediate in standoffs with the outside world, including allegations of human rights abuse and its pursuit of nuclear armed missiles that could hit the US mainland.

Though South Korean intelligence was sufficiently confident to report the allegation to lawmakers, the service has a patchy record on events across the 38th parallel.Sensational tales abound, such as reports that Kim Jong-un\u2019s aunt was variously poisoned on his orders, had a fatal stroke while rowing with him, killed herself, was left in a coma following surgery \u2013 or is still up and about. The regime confirmed the execution of Kim Jong-un\u2019s uncle Jang Song-thaek, but we know he was not torn apart by dogs, as some said. An ex-girlfriend of the young leader, supposedly killed after starring in a porn film, turned up alive and well. One analyst notes that the armed forces minister has yet to be removed from documentaries shown on state television, as one would expect of a disgraced and dead official.Totalitarian states run on fear, and Pyongyang is no exception. Last year, a UN inquiry concluded that it was committing systematic and appalling human rights abuses on a scale unparalleled in the modern world, citing torture, execution and arbitrary imprisonment, deliberate starvation and an almost complete lack of free thought and belief. Never mind the high-level victims, who have at least feasted at the top table: look to the tens of thousands held in political prison camps, in many cases not even for their actions, but those of a family member.Accounts of dramatic elite deaths, however, portray the regime as capricious and unstable as well as cruel. That suits the North\u2019s opponents; less often noted is that it suits the North too. Playing crazy has proved an astute strategy for a small, poor country that George W Bush called part of the axis of evil. The Kim family drew the obvious lesson: to avoid Saddam Hussein\u2019s fate, they should continue developing their nuclear programme and demonstrate they might be willing to use their weapons. The country\u2019s military spending and bellicose rhetoric reflect both its anxiety about external hostility and its calculation that the rational course is, paradoxically, to appear unhinged.All that said, the North may be seeing the purge of senior officials at a rate unknown since the early days of Kim Il-sung\u2019s rule in the 1950s. Whether his grandson is unnerved by possible internal challenges, or is acting from confidence, ousting top leaders could in itself create tensions he will struggle to control. The country must already contend with the disintegration of faith in the state and effect of tentative economic changes.Predictions of a North Korean collapse are largely a matter of wishful thinking, while calls for aggressive intervention have receded over the years.

Northern media have yet to comment \u2013 but had last mentioned Hyon on 29 April. Related: The Guardian view on North Korea: even its elite may pay the price | Editorial The NIS is hardly a neutral source, and sometimes errs. But they called it right in December 2013, breaking the news of the young leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s dramatic purge of his uncle and mentor Jang Song-thaek almost a week before North Korea confirmed this. Seoul\u2019s spooks have been on the defensive recently over various issues, so it would not go public with this one unless it was absolutely sure. Hence I am inclined to believe it, including the method. (Unlike the notorious canard that Jang was torn apart by dogs \u2013 a Chinese blogger\u2019s fantasy, it turned out \u2013 there is satellite evidence for an earlier public execution using anti-aircraft guns.)What had Hyon done? His supposed crime was disloyalty and disrespect to Kim Jong-un, by dozing off at a military event and failing to carry out instructions. The latter might relate to a visit to Moscow in April, where at a security forum Hyon called US troops in South Korea a \u201ccancer growth\u201d. But he reportedly failed to clinch a missile and launcher deal, which in turn might be why Kim cancelled much-touted plans to attend Russia\u2019s VE Day jamboree last week.Supposed, might, reportedly. This cautionary smallprint reminds us that we speculate. Should Hyon reappear tomorrow, there will be egg on many faces. Nor can we expect the regime to confirm or deny his fate. Jang\u2019s high-profile purging was a rarity. In Pyongyang, elite figures sometimes fall \u201cill\u201d, or have accidents. But mostly they just cease to appear, without explanation.Hyon Yong-chol's supposed crime was disloyalty and disrespect to Kim Jong-unWhat do we know for sure? There has been a lot of churn in the years since Kim Jong-un took power after the death of his father Kim Jong-il in December 2011 \u2013 especially among the top brass. The two key posts of armed forces minister (ie defence) and chief of the general staff were stable for years, but Kim Jong-un has been rotating them every few months. Hyon Yong-chol had done both jobs in his few years at the top (he was unheard of before 2010).Why these military musical chairs? Kim Jong-il\u2019s army-first policy led to the Korean People\u2019s Army amassing great power, at the expense of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party. Now the party is back. At 32, Kim Jong-un may also feel a need to show cadres twice his age that he is as tough as his father and his grandfather Kim Il-sung, so they know who is boss.In that context, pulverising Hyon recalls Voltaire\u2019s famous quip on the execution of Admiral Byng: \u201cIn this country, it is good to kill an admiral from time to time to encourage the others.\u201d Yet rather than encourage, could this not backfire? North Korea has always been a brutal place, but in Kim Jong-il\u2019s day the nomenklatura were usually safe \u2013 unless actively disloyal or wildly incompetent. Hence there was no top-level dissent, nor discernible factions. Related: The execution of Kim Jong-un's uncle signals the hardliners are back | Jasper Becker Kim Jong-un has changed the rules. Evidently he wants no one to feel safe. Purging his uncle was a gamble, but caused no detectable wider instability. Eliminating Hyon may also leave no trace, politically as literally. But it risks a backlash. If loyal cadres feel they could be next, at any time and for no reason, that undermines loyalty and could even be an incentive to defect.True, Stalin ran a fear-based court for years.

Related: The Guardian view on North Korea: even its elite may pay the price | Editorial For instance, the 2013 execution for treason of Kim\u2019s uncle and second in command, Jang Song-thaek, is not doubted. But initial reports that he was fed to more than 100 hungry dogs have been discredited.This week, a high-ranking defector from the north claimed in an interview with CNN that Kim had his aunt (and Jang\u2019s wife) Kim Kyong-hui dispatched, cold war-style, with a dose of poison about a year ago. But neither method will have been as clinical as the one reportedly used in Kim\u2019s latest high-level purge, sketchy details of which emerged on Wednesday. The 32-year-old reportedly used anti-aircraft fire to execute his defence chief for disrespectful behaviour, including napping during a military rally attended by the leader. North Korea\u2019s official KCNA news agency has not confirmed the purge, which was revealed by an official from South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service (NIS)to a closed meeting of lawmakers. Hyon was executed by firing squad with an anti-aircraft gun, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency said, citing testimony to a parliamentary panel given by the IS deputy director, Han Ki-beom. Han reportedly told MPs that hundreds of people had witnessed Hyon\u2019s execution, which was reportedly carried out in late April at Kang Kon military academy in northern Pyongyang. Intelligence sources suggested Hyon was shot with 14.5mm calibre rounds \u2013 a method of execution said to be reserved for senior officials whom the leadership wishes to make examples of. Evidence that the North Korean leadership occasionally resorts to anti-aircraft fire to dispense with its enemies came last month when the US-based Committee for Human Rights in Korea released satellite imagery that analysts said showed a shooting range lined with anti-aircraft guns apparently primed for an execution last October. Aside from dozing off in Kim\u2019s presence, Hyon, who spoke at a security conference in Moscow last month, had reportedly voiced dissatisfaction with his leadership. There is also speculation that during his visit to Moscow, Hyon had failed to secure a weapons deal in return for Kim\u2019s presence at a recent event to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany 70 years ago. But given Hyon\u2019s proximity to Kim, reports of his execution shocked some analysts. \u201cHyon was seen as one of the three closest military officials to Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies. \u201cAn inexperienced leader like Kim can often display a tendency for overtly dramatic and brash moves ... and for me the situation looks quite worrisome,\u201d he added. \u201cIt also suggests Kim is politically frustrated.\u201d South Korea\u2019s intelligence service has a mixed record on correctly tracking major political developments over the border, leading other analysts to strike a note of caution about Hyon\u2019s rumoured death. With conventional means of verification practically impossible for those outside the country, observers resort to monitoring North Korean media for clues. Cheong Seong-chang of the Sejong Institute thinktank in Seoul questioned the authenticity of the NIS report, pointing out that Hyon was still making frequent appearances on state TV footage. North Korea typically removes executed and purged officials from TV documentaries, but Hyon appeared multiple times in a TV documentary on live fire drills between 30 April and 11 May, according to the unification ministry in Seoul.North Korean state media have not mentioned Hyon since 29 April, when it reported his presence at a music performance the previous day. Cheong said the NIS had been \u201crash\u201d in reporting the execution on the basis of \u201cshaky, unconfirmed intelligence\u201d. He added: \u201cIt needs to be verified, but is already being reported as fact by the media, which only adds to the confusion.\u201d Hyon\u2019s reported death fits a pattern, however, coming weeks after the NIS claimed Kim had ordered the execution of 15 senior officials so far this year, apparently for questioning his authority. In all, around 70 officials have been executed since Kim became leader, Yonhap quoted the NIS as saying.In January, he executed Gen Pyon In-son, head of operations in the army, for disagreeing with him. He also executed about 50 officials last year on charges ranging from corruption to watching South Korean soap operas. Kim\u2019s decision to cancel his much-anticipated appearance in Moscow last week, citing \u201cinternal issues\u201d, lends weight to the theory that he is in the midst of yet another round of purges. Initial doubts over whether Kim, a young and inexperienced leader when he succeeded his late father, Kim Jong-il, would be able to retain his grip on power persist more than three years after he became the third member of the Kim dynasty to rule the reclusive state. \u201cNorth Korean internal politics is very volatile these days,\u201d said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North thinktank. \u201cInternally, there does not seem to be any respect for Kim Jong-un within the core and middle levels of the North Korean leadership. \u201cThere is no clear or present danger to Kim Jong-un\u2019s leadership or stability in North Korea, but if this continues to happen into next year, then we would seriously have to start looking at a contingency plan for the Korean peninsula.\u201d Hyon, a little-known general, was promoted to the rank of vice-marshal of the North Korean army in 2012. The South Korean spy agency told lawmakers that Ma Won-chun, known as North Korea\u2019s chief architect of new infrastructure under Kim, was also purged, local media reported. Andrei Lankov, a North Korea specialist at Kookmin University in Seoul, said that the reported purges in Pyongyang did not necessarily mean that Kim\u2019s grip on power was weakening. \u201cThe common assumption is that it\u2019s bad for stability, but I\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Lankov said. \u201cThe young boy is not necessarily popular with the military, so he wants to show that he\u2019s in control and he\u2019s the boss.\u201d ", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un"], "title": "North Korea defence chief reportedly executed with anti-aircraft gun"},{"date": "2015-05-09T03:24:59Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea has fired three anti-ship cruise missiles into the country\u2019s eastern sea, South Korean military officials confirmed.

In the past three years, we\u2019ve learned that Kim 2.0 executed a Pyongyang traffic lady for sneezing (false); was voted 2012\u2019s \u201csexiest man alive\u201d (false); poisoned his aunt Kim Kyong-hui (false); assassinated his pop-singer girlfriend Hyon Song-wol for making porn (false); and oversaw the Sony Pictures hack in retaliation for the Kim Jong-un assassination spoof, The Interview (debatable). When he disappeared for a month in 2014, there was speculation he had been ousted by a coup (false); killed by his generals (false); contracted gout (who knows?); or broken his ankle after growing fat from eating cheese (he does appear to have gained weight).The malleability of digital media, and the speed with which consumers can embed and reframe North Korean content before passing it on, means even truthful accounts of Kim Jong-un\u2019s ruthless moves to shore up his inherited power are frequently embellished. When Kim executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, in late 2013 for insubordination, mainstream news feeds reported Jang and five aides had been stripped naked and fed to 120 starving dogs.

The revelation that the YouTube documentary about the Pyongyang traffic lady is fake is buried in the comments page; Kim Jong-un\u2019s pop-singer girlfriend\u2019s appearance on KCNA a year after reports of her grisly murder failed to reach the same million consumers who believed her dead; North Korean gulag survivor Shin Dong-hyuk\u2019s recent admission that parts of his bestselling memoir are false did little to dampen belief in its credibility; and in May, Seoul\u2019s Daily NK ran a discreet post contradicting CNN\u2019s widely publicised story about Kim Jong-un\u2019s poisoned aunt, stating Kyong-hui is alive in Pyongyang.The truth about North Korea is also a casualty when politics come into play. On 30 December 2014, when independent cyber analysts announced that disgruntled employees, not Kim Jong-un, were behind the Sony hack, the FBI had already found North Korea guilty. Senator John McCain labeled the hack an \u201cact of war\u201d; Sony released The Interview with President Obama\u2019s blessing; North Korea\u2019s limited internet capabilities were mysteriously \u201cblacked out\u201d in an unattributed strike; and, by 2 January 2015, the US had imposed new sanctions on North Korea and was considering reinstating it as a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d.Why does all this matter? Because if you have been to North Korea and spent time with the people who live and work there, the media\u2019s relentlessly recycled picture of North Koreans as brainwashed automatons, robotically enslaved to the despotic Kims, is simplistic, dehumanising and cruel.

Though South Korean intelligence was sufficiently confident to report the allegation to lawmakers, the service has a patchy record on events across the 38th parallel.Sensational tales abound, such as reports that Kim Jong-un\u2019s aunt was variously poisoned on his orders, had a fatal stroke while rowing with him, killed herself, was left in a coma following surgery \u2013 or is still up and about. The regime confirmed the execution of Kim Jong-un\u2019s uncle Jang Song-thaek, but we know he was not torn apart by dogs, as some said. An ex-girlfriend of the young leader, supposedly killed after starring in a porn film, turned up alive and well. One analyst notes that the armed forces minister has yet to be removed from documentaries shown on state television, as one would expect of a disgraced and dead official.Totalitarian states run on fear, and Pyongyang is no exception. Last year, a UN inquiry concluded that it was committing systematic and appalling human rights abuses on a scale unparalleled in the modern world, citing torture, execution and arbitrary imprisonment, deliberate starvation and an almost complete lack of free thought and belief. Never mind the high-level victims, who have at least feasted at the top table: look to the tens of thousands held in political prison camps, in many cases not even for their actions, but those of a family member.Accounts of dramatic elite deaths, however, portray the regime as capricious and unstable as well as cruel. That suits the North\u2019s opponents; less often noted is that it suits the North too. Playing crazy has proved an astute strategy for a small, poor country that George W Bush called part of the axis of evil. The Kim family drew the obvious lesson: to avoid Saddam Hussein\u2019s fate, they should continue developing their nuclear programme and demonstrate they might be willing to use their weapons. The country\u2019s military spending and bellicose rhetoric reflect both its anxiety about external hostility and its calculation that the rational course is, paradoxically, to appear unhinged.All that said, the North may be seeing the purge of senior officials at a rate unknown since the early days of Kim Il-sung\u2019s rule in the 1950s. Whether his grandson is unnerved by possible internal challenges, or is acting from confidence, ousting top leaders could in itself create tensions he will struggle to control. The country must already contend with the disintegration of faith in the state and effect of tentative economic changes.Predictions of a North Korean collapse are largely a matter of wishful thinking, while calls for aggressive intervention have receded over the years. Even so, closer attention to the North and contingency planning for its potential futures is essential.

Related: The Guardian view on North Korea: even its elite may pay the price | Editorial The NIS is hardly a neutral source, and sometimes errs. But they called it right in December 2013, breaking the news of the young leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s dramatic purge of his uncle and mentor Jang Song-thaek almost a week before North Korea confirmed this. Seoul\u2019s spooks have been on the defensive recently over various issues, so it would not go public with this one unless it was absolutely sure. Hence I am inclined to believe it, including the method. (Unlike the notorious canard that Jang was torn apart by dogs \u2013 a Chinese blogger\u2019s fantasy, it turned out \u2013 there is satellite evidence for an earlier public execution using anti-aircraft guns.)What had Hyon done? His supposed crime was disloyalty and disrespect to Kim Jong-un, by dozing off at a military event and failing to carry out instructions. The latter might relate to a visit to Moscow in April, where at a security forum Hyon called US troops in South Korea a \u201ccancer growth\u201d. But he reportedly failed to clinch a missile and launcher deal, which in turn might be why Kim cancelled much-touted plans to attend Russia\u2019s VE Day jamboree last week.Supposed, might, reportedly. This cautionary smallprint reminds us that we speculate. Should Hyon reappear tomorrow, there will be egg on many faces. Nor can we expect the regime to confirm or deny his fate. Jang\u2019s high-profile purging was a rarity. In Pyongyang, elite figures sometimes fall \u201cill\u201d, or have accidents. But mostly they just cease to appear, without explanation.Hyon Yong-chol's supposed crime was disloyalty and disrespect to Kim Jong-unWhat do we know for sure? There has been a lot of churn in the years since Kim Jong-un took power after the death of his father Kim Jong-il in December 2011 \u2013 especially among the top brass. The two key posts of armed forces minister (ie defence) and chief of the general staff were stable for years, but Kim Jong-un has been rotating them every few months. Hyon Yong-chol had done both jobs in his few years at the top (he was unheard of before 2010).Why these military musical chairs? Kim Jong-il\u2019s army-first policy led to the Korean People\u2019s Army amassing great power, at the expense of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party. Now the party is back. At 32, Kim Jong-un may also feel a need to show cadres twice his age that he is as tough as his father and his grandfather Kim Il-sung, so they know who is boss.In that context, pulverising Hyon recalls Voltaire\u2019s famous quip on the execution of Admiral Byng: \u201cIn this country, it is good to kill an admiral from time to time to encourage the others.\u201d Yet rather than encourage, could this not backfire? North Korea has always been a brutal place, but in Kim Jong-il\u2019s day the nomenklatura were usually safe \u2013 unless actively disloyal or wildly incompetent. Hence there was no top-level dissent, nor discernible factions. Related: The execution of Kim Jong-un's uncle signals the hardliners are back | Jasper Becker Kim Jong-un has changed the rules. Evidently he wants no one to feel safe. Purging his uncle was a gamble, but caused no detectable wider instability. Eliminating Hyon may also leave no trace, politically as literally. But it risks a backlash. If loyal cadres feel they could be next, at any time and for no reason, that undermines loyalty and could even be an incentive to defect.True, Stalin ran a fear-based court for years.

Norway and the UK toughened their stance on asylum requests from Eritrea earlier this year, controversially citing a Danish report, Eritrea \u2013 Drivers and Root Causes of Emigration, which suggested many Eritreans were fleeing for economic reasons. The report caused outrage and was widely discredited; two of its authors resigned. Leslie Lefkow of Human Rights Watch attacked it as \u201ca political effort to stem migration\u201d.But the UK issued new guidance on Eritrea, citing the Danish report, and since then the refusal rate for asylum applications from Eritreans has risen from 13% in 2014 to 23% so far this year.\u201cKey European figures have been heading to Asmara and it\u2019s clear there is a real political will to solve the migrant crisis by getting the borders shut from the Eritrean side \u2013 it\u2019s a very dangerous tactic,\u201d said one UN insider.

It\u2019s this: I have more than a residual fondness for the North Koreans. You have to admire the stoicism of a people who, in the grand lottery of nations that get to be ruled by despotic tyrants, drew by far the shortest straw. While other countries got debonair bampots such as Saddam Hussein, Muamarr Gaddafi and Dom Mintoff, the poor North Koreans got a wee bloke whom you imagine Chucky the demonic doll to look like if he were to adopt human form.Just the other month, he caught one of his generals falling asleep during a meeting.

For a start, the offending general is probably a man who believes in first-strike nuclear capability. And second, at least the North Korean strongman didn\u2019t have his subordinates eaten alive by starving lions, copyright Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi monocrat was Britain\u2019s former ally in the Middle East until he annexed the medieval hand-and head-removing kingdom of Kuwait.Nor did he have political opponents dropped from a great height out of helicopters into crocodile-infested rivers, as General Pinochet was wont to do after the Americans had given him Chile to rape.I once gently had to persuade a Scottish national Sunday newspaper\u2019s resident rightwing columnist, who occupied a place at the gibbering end of the reactionary index, not to start his column one week with the sentence: \u201cViva General Pinochet\u201d. This was at the time when Margaret Thatcher was trying to grant the prince of South America\u2019s genocidal psychopaths political asylum.Western media outlets have long used news coming out of North Korea in the \u201c\u2026 and finally\u201d category, a slot reserved mainly for English eccentrics who stookie their neighbours in disputes about over-zealous leylandii growth. Either that, or it\u2019s an unsourced report from the US State Department that they are monitoring activity along the 38th parallel because of an illicit nuclear test by North Korea. This, of course, is US diplomatic code for announcing that it\u2019s moving the country on to its favoured security status of Defcon 3, otherwise known as \u201cCan we not just bomb the commie bastards?\u201dWe like to poke fun at North Korea for making up its foreign policy as it goes along and for favouring a vivid approach in its expressions of diplomatic displeasure: \u201cWe, the peace-loving and fragrant paradise of North Korea will not bend the knee to Obama, whom all men and women of goodwill acknowledge to be a warmongering, Satan-worshipping baby-eater.\u201dWe in the sophisticated west also like to disparage the apparent gullibility of its people. We show pictures of them cheering wildly when state television tells them that the pope is to canonise Kim Jong-un. Last year, there was a cruel spoof showing scenes of joy at the news North Korea were about to play the hated Portuguese in the World Cup final.Yet that would work for me. What if we floated a story that Scotland had really won the World Cup in 1966 and that England\u2019s triumph was really an elaborate unionist confidence trick to quell rising nationalist fervour? And that the usual unionist lickspittles in the press and BBC, together with a lapdog Scottish Office, had helped spread the lie? Last week, we were at it again as we struggled to suppress a condescending titter at news of North Korea creating its own time zone.I hope that the North Korean people also have a right good laugh when they see footage depicting us as naive, sleepwalking simpletons. All they have to do is click on to any UK news outlet. Then they would find out that for centuries the UK has been governed by a tiny elite drawn from some of the most privileged families in the UK and that we, the idiot punters, all think we\u2019re in a democracy.They would discover that, despite possessing riches beyond the imagination of North Korea, we have one of the most unequal societies in the world. To their horror, they would also discover that hundreds of thousands of UK children live in grinding poverty.They would wonder why we\u2019ve never risen up against a regime that spends billions on nuclear weapons and has been in a state of perpetual war for more than 300 years. They would gasp that the UK government imposes a levy of \u00a32K on every UK family to help banks whose greed and avarice in recent years almost ruined the entire western economy.They would jeer when it was revealed that, after all this, the poorest families received even less money to pay for something called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d. And they would marvel at how the UK establishment agrees to grant its royal family a millionaire lifestyle in return for them keeping our eyes averted with an endless soap opera of births, deaths, marriages and divorces.They would draw their children close when it was revealed that we allow the United States, the most reactionary country in the world and one that gives its police officers carte blanche to execute black people, to dictate our foreign policy and to torture horribly some of our own citizens on trumped-up charges of terrorism.

North Korea is a country which denies basic rights to its people and has an economy teetering on the edge of collapse. Instead of settling for maintaining the status quo, ignoring the suffering of millions and simply hoping the crisis doesn\u2019t spill over the border, here\u2019s what the west should do about North Korea: Related: North Korea says it has restarted all its nuclear bomb fuel plants The DPRK isn\u2019t interested in getting rid of its nuclear capacity; the west has tried sanctions, the threat of military force, and (unfulfilled) promises of alternative energy assistance for 20 years with no significant effect. Given that North Korea watched as Libya denuclearised in 2003 and was invaded in 2011, this should come as no surprise.It\u2019s time to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and shift the focus from deterrence politics to human security. If anything, diplomatic efforts should go towards encouraging North Korea to sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to regular IAEA inspections rather than stubbornly insisting that disarmament is a hard prerequisite for engagement. Related: North Korea's renewed nuclear threat keeps experts guessing The diplomatic utility of the annual exercises is two-fold: to remind the North (and China) of the US presence on the peninsula and to reassure western allies in the region (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines). At the most basic level, military exercises maintain operational readiness and ensure effective integration between participating forces. Yet the war games are disproportionate and overly theatrical when compared to the potential threat posed by North Korea \u2013 and offer all stick but no carrot.Here\u2019s the carrot: economic aid in exchange for human rights improvements. Avoiding the DPRK\u2019s economic collapse is ultimately in the interests of western governments \u2013 not only to avoid a human rights crisis but also to prevent an influx of refugees to China and South Korea. The aid should be targeted at meeting civilians\u2019 basic needs, for example food and healthcare. Economic aid is the other side of diplomacy, inverse to the use of military force, and would increase western influence over the North. North Korean diplomats are actually quite sane and reasonable. They have personal and national interests like any other diplomats; engaging with them would be mutually beneficial.The last high-profile attempt at so-called track two diplomacy was in 2013, when Dennis Rodman went to the North to try to secure the release of Korean-American Kenneth Bae who was in prison on charges amounting to propagating Christianity. He failed (although Bae has since been released). The lesson is that celebrity athletes are not reliable sources of diplomacy and future track two efforts should be coordinated with government-level engagement. Related: Why have North Korean defections dropped? Refugees offer the most reliable insight into life beyond the DMZ, the conditions within prisons, and the activities of the regime. Unfortunately the western media rewards sensationalist stories and some defectors have taken to fabricating elaborate tales of espionage and involvement with secret organs of the North\u2019s government. This contributes to an already severe information deficit, silencing defectors who are telling the truth and hindering efforts at understanding the North. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is the DPRK\u2019s state news outlet and one of only two printed news sources in the country, the other being Rodong Sinmun. KCNA offers unique insight into the official party line within North Korea. Many \u201cNorth Korea watchers\u201d read the English version online and scoff at how ridiculous the government makes itself sound with its petty and combative insults \u2013 but these readers fail to realise that they aren\u2019t the KCNA\u2019s target audience. The state news is directed toward citizens who have no access to outside news sources. It is not indicative of what the government thinks, rather it\u2019s a daily dose of Kimist propaganda and should be read accordingly. Interpreting the KCNA superficially would be to underestimate the sophistication of the government. International governments are not the only relevant players in international security. NGOs are potentially able to access and assist vulnerable people where states are not. Support groups which facilitate the agency of North Koreans, help amplify their voices and give them access to resources; avoid those who claim to speak on their behalf.Morgan Potts is a North Korean scholar and production editor for the British Association For Korean Studies academic journal, BAKS Papers.

It\u2019s this: I have more than a residual fondness for the North Koreans. You have to admire the stoicism of a people who, in the grand lottery of nations that get to be ruled by despotic tyrants, drew by far the shortest straw. While other countries got debonair bampots such as Saddam Hussein, Muamarr Gaddafi and Dom Mintoff, the poor North Koreans got a wee bloke whom you imagine Chucky the demonic doll to look like if he were to adopt human form.Just the other month, he caught one of his generals falling asleep during a meeting. The president promptly had him marched out to a field and shot at close range with an anti-aircaft gun. Admittedly, this seems, at first glance, to be excessively barbaric. And, in fact, some folk later began to doubt the veracity of the tale.But let\u2019s assume it was true and ask yourself this question: if you had the choice, would you like to be blown to bits by a howitzer that can knock out a plane or by a few blokes with rifles? What if the firing squad, fresh from a night on the Don Revie to calm their anxieties at being asked to shoot you, are a bit wobbly and shaky in their aim? You could end up dying in agony of partial gunshot wounds weeks later. Let\u2019s face it: even a partial hit by an anti-aircraft gun would leave you absolutely, securely and instantly\u2026deid.It doesn\u2019t do, though, to get too fey and Edinburgh festival about Kim Jong-un\u2019s disciplinary methods. For a start, the offending general is probably a man who believes in first-strike nuclear capability. And second, at least the North Korean strongman didn\u2019t have his subordinates eaten alive by starving lions, copyright Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi monocrat was Britain\u2019s former ally in the Middle East until he annexed the medieval hand-and head-removing kingdom of Kuwait.Nor did he have political opponents dropped from a great height out of helicopters into crocodile-infested rivers, as General Pinochet was wont to do after the Americans had given him Chile to rape.I once gently had to persuade a Scottish national Sunday newspaper\u2019s resident rightwing columnist, who occupied a place at the gibbering end of the reactionary index, not to start his column one week with the sentence: \u201cViva General Pinochet\u201d. This was at the time when Margaret Thatcher was trying to grant the prince of South America\u2019s genocidal psychopaths political asylum.Western media outlets have long used news coming out of North Korea in the \u201c\u2026 and finally\u201d category, a slot reserved mainly for English eccentrics who stookie their neighbours in disputes about over-zealous leylandii growth. Either that, or it\u2019s an unsourced report from the US State Department that they are monitoring activity along the 38th parallel because of an illicit nuclear test by North Korea. This, of course, is US diplomatic code for announcing that it\u2019s moving the country on to its favoured security status of Defcon 3, otherwise known as \u201cCan we not just bomb the commie bastards?\u201dWe like to poke fun at North Korea for making up its foreign policy as it goes along and for favouring a vivid approach in its expressions of diplomatic displeasure: \u201cWe, the peace-loving and fragrant paradise of North Korea will not bend the knee to Obama, whom all men and women of goodwill acknowledge to be a warmongering, Satan-worshipping baby-eater.\u201dWe in the sophisticated west also like to disparage the apparent gullibility of its people. We show pictures of them cheering wildly when state television tells them that the pope is to canonise Kim Jong-un. Last year, there was a cruel spoof showing scenes of joy at the news North Korea were about to play the hated Portuguese in the World Cup final.Yet that would work for me. What if we floated a story that Scotland had really won the World Cup in 1966 and that England\u2019s triumph was really an elaborate unionist confidence trick to quell rising nationalist fervour? And that the usual unionist lickspittles in the press and BBC, together with a lapdog Scottish Office, had helped spread the lie? Last week, we were at it again as we struggled to suppress a condescending titter at news of North Korea creating its own time zone.I hope that the North Korean people also have a right good laugh when they see footage depicting us as naive, sleepwalking simpletons. All they have to do is click on to any UK news outlet. Then they would find out that for centuries the UK has been governed by a tiny elite drawn from some of the most privileged families in the UK and that we, the idiot punters, all think we\u2019re in a democracy.They would discover that, despite possessing riches beyond the imagination of North Korea, we have one of the most unequal societies in the world. To their horror, they would also discover that hundreds of thousands of UK children live in grinding poverty.They would wonder why we\u2019ve never risen up against a regime that spends billions on nuclear weapons and has been in a state of perpetual war for more than 300 years. They would gasp that the UK government imposes a levy of \u00a32K on every UK family to help banks whose greed and avarice in recent years almost ruined the entire western economy.They would jeer when it was revealed that, after all this, the poorest families received even less money to pay for something called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d. And they would marvel at how the UK establishment agrees to grant its royal family a millionaire lifestyle in return for them keeping our eyes averted with an endless soap opera of births, deaths, marriages and divorces.They would draw their children close when it was revealed that we allow the United States, the most reactionary country in the world and one that gives its police officers carte blanche to execute black people, to dictate our foreign policy and to torture horribly some of our own citizens on trumped-up charges of terrorism. And they would immediately dismiss it as a spoof. For how could any people in the so-called civilised west allow their government to treat them in such a fashion?", "tags": ["Kim Jong-un", "North Korea", "World news", "Scotland", "Asia Pacific", "UK news"], "title": "Say what you will about Kim Jong-un\u2026 | Kevin McKenna"},{"date": "2015-09-16T06:00:19Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea\u2019s announcement that it has restarted its atomic bomb fuel production has sparked a now-familiar chorus of outrage and concern around the world.It seems that the west, governments and civilians alike, is more concerned with a possible military threat than with the myriad human rights violations taking place inside the country. North Korea is a country which denies basic rights to its people and has an economy teetering on the edge of collapse. Instead of settling for maintaining the status quo, ignoring the suffering of millions and simply hoping the crisis doesn\u2019t spill over the border, here\u2019s what the west should do about North Korea: Related: North Korea says it has restarted all its nuclear bomb fuel plants The DPRK isn\u2019t interested in getting rid of its nuclear capacity; the west has tried sanctions, the threat of military force, and (unfulfilled) promises of alternative energy assistance for 20 years with no significant effect. Given that North Korea watched as Libya denuclearised in 2003 and was invaded in 2011, this should come as no surprise.It\u2019s time to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and shift the focus from deterrence politics to human security. If anything, diplomatic efforts should go towards encouraging North Korea to sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to regular IAEA inspections rather than stubbornly insisting that disarmament is a hard prerequisite for engagement. Related: North Korea's renewed nuclear threat keeps experts guessing The diplomatic utility of the annual exercises is two-fold: to remind the North (and China) of the US presence on the peninsula and to reassure western allies in the region (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines). At the most basic level, military exercises maintain operational readiness and ensure effective integration between participating forces. Yet the war games are disproportionate and overly theatrical when compared to the potential threat posed by North Korea \u2013 and offer all stick but no carrot.Here\u2019s the carrot: economic aid in exchange for human rights improvements. Avoiding the DPRK\u2019s economic collapse is ultimately in the interests of western governments \u2013 not only to avoid a human rights crisis but also to prevent an influx of refugees to China and South Korea. The aid should be targeted at meeting civilians\u2019 basic needs, for example food and healthcare. Economic aid is the other side of diplomacy, inverse to the use of military force, and would increase western influence over the North. North Korean diplomats are actually quite sane and reasonable. They have personal and national interests like any other diplomats; engaging with them would be mutually beneficial.The last high-profile attempt at so-called track two diplomacy was in 2013, when Dennis Rodman went to the North to try to secure the release of Korean-American Kenneth Bae who was in prison on charges amounting to propagating Christianity. He failed (although Bae has since been released). The lesson is that celebrity athletes are not reliable sources of diplomacy and future track two efforts should be coordinated with government-level engagement. Related: Why have North Korean defections dropped? Refugees offer the most reliable insight into life beyond the DMZ, the conditions within prisons, and the activities of the regime. Unfortunately the western media rewards sensationalist stories and some defectors have taken to fabricating elaborate tales of espionage and involvement with secret organs of the North\u2019s government. This contributes to an already severe information deficit, silencing defectors who are telling the truth and hindering efforts at understanding the North. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is the DPRK\u2019s state news outlet and one of only two printed news sources in the country, the other being Rodong Sinmun. KCNA offers unique insight into the official party line within North Korea. Many \u201cNorth Korea watchers\u201d read the English version online and scoff at how ridiculous the government makes itself sound with its petty and combative insults \u2013 but these readers fail to realise that they aren\u2019t the KCNA\u2019s target audience. The state news is directed toward citizens who have no access to outside news sources. It is not indicative of what the government thinks, rather it\u2019s a daily dose of Kimist propaganda and should be read accordingly. Interpreting the KCNA superficially would be to underestimate the sophistication of the government. International governments are not the only relevant players in international security. NGOs are potentially able to access and assist vulnerable people where states are not. Support groups which facilitate the agency of North Koreans, help amplify their voices and give them access to resources; avoid those who claim to speak on their behalf.Morgan Potts is a North Korean scholar and production editor for the British Association For Korean Studies academic journal, BAKS Papers.

It\u2019s this: I have more than a residual fondness for the North Koreans. You have to admire the stoicism of a people who, in the grand lottery of nations that get to be ruled by despotic tyrants, drew by far the shortest straw. While other countries got debonair bampots such as Saddam Hussein, Muamarr Gaddafi and Dom Mintoff, the poor North Koreans got a wee bloke whom you imagine Chucky the demonic doll to look like if he were to adopt human form.Just the other month, he caught one of his generals falling asleep during a meeting. The president promptly had him marched out to a field and shot at close range with an anti-aircaft gun. Admittedly, this seems, at first glance, to be excessively barbaric. And, in fact, some folk later began to doubt the veracity of the tale.But let\u2019s assume it was true and ask yourself this question: if you had the choice, would you like to be blown to bits by a howitzer that can knock out a plane or by a few blokes with rifles? What if the firing squad, fresh from a night on the Don Revie to calm their anxieties at being asked to shoot you, are a bit wobbly and shaky in their aim? You could end up dying in agony of partial gunshot wounds weeks later. Let\u2019s face it: even a partial hit by an anti-aircraft gun would leave you absolutely, securely and instantly\u2026deid.It doesn\u2019t do, though, to get too fey and Edinburgh festival about Kim Jong-un\u2019s disciplinary methods. For a start, the offending general is probably a man who believes in first-strike nuclear capability. And second, at least the North Korean strongman didn\u2019t have his subordinates eaten alive by starving lions, copyright Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi monocrat was Britain\u2019s former ally in the Middle East until he annexed the medieval hand-and head-removing kingdom of Kuwait.Nor did he have political opponents dropped from a great height out of helicopters into crocodile-infested rivers, as General Pinochet was wont to do after the Americans had given him Chile to rape.I once gently had to persuade a Scottish national Sunday newspaper\u2019s resident rightwing columnist, who occupied a place at the gibbering end of the reactionary index, not to start his column one week with the sentence: \u201cViva General Pinochet\u201d. This was at the time when Margaret Thatcher was trying to grant the prince of South America\u2019s genocidal psychopaths political asylum.Western media outlets have long used news coming out of North Korea in the \u201c\u2026 and finally\u201d category, a slot reserved mainly for English eccentrics who stookie their neighbours in disputes about over-zealous leylandii growth. Either that, or it\u2019s an unsourced report from the US State Department that they are monitoring activity along the 38th parallel because of an illicit nuclear test by North Korea. This, of course, is US diplomatic code for announcing that it\u2019s moving the country on to its favoured security status of Defcon 3, otherwise known as \u201cCan we not just bomb the commie bastards?\u201dWe like to poke fun at North Korea for making up its foreign policy as it goes along and for favouring a vivid approach in its expressions of diplomatic displeasure: \u201cWe, the peace-loving and fragrant paradise of North Korea will not bend the knee to Obama, whom all men and women of goodwill acknowledge to be a warmongering, Satan-worshipping baby-eater.\u201dWe in the sophisticated west also like to disparage the apparent gullibility of its people. We show pictures of them cheering wildly when state television tells them that the pope is to canonise Kim Jong-un. Last year, there was a cruel spoof showing scenes of joy at the news North Korea were about to play the hated Portuguese in the World Cup final.Yet that would work for me. What if we floated a story that Scotland had really won the World Cup in 1966 and that England\u2019s triumph was really an elaborate unionist confidence trick to quell rising nationalist fervour? And that the usual unionist lickspittles in the press and BBC, together with a lapdog Scottish Office, had helped spread the lie? Last week, we were at it again as we struggled to suppress a condescending titter at news of North Korea creating its own time zone.I hope that the North Korean people also have a right good laugh when they see footage depicting us as naive, sleepwalking simpletons. All they have to do is click on to any UK news outlet. Then they would find out that for centuries the UK has been governed by a tiny elite drawn from some of the most privileged families in the UK and that we, the idiot punters, all think we\u2019re in a democracy.They would discover that, despite possessing riches beyond the imagination of North Korea, we have one of the most unequal societies in the world. To their horror, they would also discover that hundreds of thousands of UK children live in grinding poverty.They would wonder why we\u2019ve never risen up against a regime that spends billions on nuclear weapons and has been in a state of perpetual war for more than 300 years. They would gasp that the UK government imposes a levy of \u00a32K on every UK family to help banks whose greed and avarice in recent years almost ruined the entire western economy.They would jeer when it was revealed that, after all this, the poorest families received even less money to pay for something called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d. And they would marvel at how the UK establishment agrees to grant its royal family a millionaire lifestyle in return for them keeping our eyes averted with an endless soap opera of births, deaths, marriages and divorces.They would draw their children close when it was revealed that we allow the United States, the most reactionary country in the world and one that gives its police officers carte blanche to execute black people, to dictate our foreign policy and to torture horribly some of our own citizens on trumped-up charges of terrorism. And they would immediately dismiss it as a spoof. For how could any people in the so-called civilised west allow their government to treat them in such a fashion?", "tags": ["Kim Jong-un", "North Korea", "World news", "Scotland", "Asia Pacific", "UK news"], "title": "Say what you will about Kim Jong-un\u2026 | Kevin McKenna"},{"date": "2015-09-16T06:00:19Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korea\u2019s announcement that it has restarted its atomic bomb fuel production has sparked a now-familiar chorus of outrage and concern around the world.It seems that the west, governments and civilians alike, is more concerned with a possible military threat than with the myriad human rights violations taking place inside the country. North Korea is a country which denies basic rights to its people and has an economy teetering on the edge of collapse. Instead of settling for maintaining the status quo, ignoring the suffering of millions and simply hoping the crisis doesn\u2019t spill over the border, here\u2019s what the west should do about North Korea: Related: North Korea says it has restarted all its nuclear bomb fuel plants The DPRK isn\u2019t interested in getting rid of its nuclear capacity; the west has tried sanctions, the threat of military force, and (unfulfilled) promises of alternative energy assistance for 20 years with no significant effect. Given that North Korea watched as Libya denuclearised in 2003 and was invaded in 2011, this should come as no surprise.It\u2019s time to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and shift the focus from deterrence politics to human security. If anything, diplomatic efforts should go towards encouraging North Korea to sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to regular IAEA inspections rather than stubbornly insisting that disarmament is a hard prerequisite for engagement. Related: North Korea's renewed nuclear threat keeps experts guessing The diplomatic utility of the annual exercises is two-fold: to remind the North (and China) of the US presence on the peninsula and to reassure western allies in the region (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines). At the most basic level, military exercises maintain operational readiness and ensure effective integration between participating forces. Yet the war games are disproportionate and overly theatrical when compared to the potential threat posed by North Korea \u2013 and offer all stick but no carrot.Here\u2019s the carrot: economic aid in exchange for human rights improvements. Avoiding the DPRK\u2019s economic collapse is ultimately in the interests of western governments \u2013 not only to avoid a human rights crisis but also to prevent an influx of refugees to China and South Korea. The aid should be targeted at meeting civilians\u2019 basic needs, for example food and healthcare. Economic aid is the other side of diplomacy, inverse to the use of military force, and would increase western influence over the North. North Korean diplomats are actually quite sane and reasonable. They have personal and national interests like any other diplomats; engaging with them would be mutually beneficial.The last high-profile attempt at so-called track two diplomacy was in 2013, when Dennis Rodman went to the North to try to secure the release of Korean-American Kenneth Bae who was in prison on charges amounting to propagating Christianity. He failed (although Bae has since been released). The lesson is that celebrity athletes are not reliable sources of diplomacy and future track two efforts should be coordinated with government-level engagement. Related: Why have North Korean defections dropped? Refugees offer the most reliable insight into life beyond the DMZ, the conditions within prisons, and the activities of the regime. Unfortunately the western media rewards sensationalist stories and some defectors have taken to fabricating elaborate tales of espionage and involvement with secret organs of the North\u2019s government. This contributes to an already severe information deficit, silencing defectors who are telling the truth and hindering efforts at understanding the North. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is the DPRK\u2019s state news outlet and one of only two printed news sources in the country, the other being Rodong Sinmun. KCNA offers unique insight into the official party line within North Korea. Many \u201cNorth Korea watchers\u201d read the English version online and scoff at how ridiculous the government makes itself sound with its petty and combative insults \u2013 but these readers fail to realise that they aren\u2019t the KCNA\u2019s target audience. The state news is directed toward citizens who have no access to outside news sources. It is not indicative of what the government thinks, rather it\u2019s a daily dose of Kimist propaganda and should be read accordingly. Interpreting the KCNA superficially would be to underestimate the sophistication of the government. International governments are not the only relevant players in international security. NGOs are potentially able to access and assist vulnerable people where states are not. Support groups which facilitate the agency of North Koreans, help amplify their voices and give them access to resources; avoid those who claim to speak on their behalf.Morgan Potts is a North Korean scholar and production editor for the British Association For Korean Studies academic journal, BAKS Papers.

Interviews with defectors reveal that many listen to news from shortwave radios, despite fear of severe punishment, and there is a new $50 portable media device providing a window to the outside world \u2013 despite the government\u2019s best efforts to isolate its population.Critics of the state even rely on hot-air balloons to carry anti-regime information across the border, but it\u2019s not enough.During the second world war, the BBC broadcast to Nazi-occupied Europe and, when that war was won, to Soviet-occupied Eastern Europe. Today, the BBC, hard-pressed as it is, must seriously consider broadcasting into North Korea, just as it is doing in Burma.According to BBC internal estimates a Korean service \u2013 absent of the regime\u2019s narcoleptic guff \u2013 would cost around \u00a31m a year to run and a shortwave transmitter would cost about \u00a3300,000 a year. The outside world are regularly bombarded with information about North Korea \u2013 culture, sport and news the nefarious workings of the state \u2013 but its citizens need to understand more about the true working of their own country too.So, if the BBC are able to get it up and running, here\u2019s where I suggest they start:North Korean statistics may not be reliable but tape measures, that show defectors to be between three and eight centimetres shorter than their South Korean couterparts, are.

In 1978 a Romanian artist, Doina Bumbea, was taken from Italy and forced to travel to North Korea. The best guess for the insane rash of kidnaps was to enhance the regime\u2019s intelligence efforts. .

It has to be a national priority. Other news outlets are growing globally and many do not share our traditions and values. We have a strong commitment to uphold global democracy through accurate, impartial and independent news. There should no longer be any no-go countries for the World Service.\u201dThe proposals include looking at a satellite TV service for Russian speakers or ramping up digital presence on YouTube or Rutube, the Russian equivalent, and TV bulletins for neighbouring eastern European states. In addition, the corporation intends to extend its digital and mobile offerings for the Indian and Nigerian markets.The BBC was forced to take on the \u00a3245m annual cost of the World Service, which had been funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, from last year as part of the 2010 licence fee settlement with the government.In an ironic twist, the BBC is to seek financial support from the government for the expansion. The BBC will offer to match any increase in public funding for the World Service if it can be allowed to more heavily-commercialise its Global News operation outside the UK, which generates more than \u00a3100m in revenues annually from sources including advertising and sponsorship.Earlier this year, the BBC published its Future of News report, which warned the government that cuts to the World Service would reduce the UK\u2019s global \u201csoft power\u201d in the face of the growth of rivals such as RT and al-Jazeera.\u201cThe World Service faces a choice between decline and growth,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf the UK wants the BBC to remain valued and respected, an ambassador of Britain\u2019s values and an agent of soft power in the world, then the BBC is going to have to commit to growing the World Service and the government will have to recognise this.\u201d", "tags": ["BBC World Service", "BBC", "Media", "Radio industry", "Television industry", "Russia Today", "Al-Jazeera", "TV news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Russia", "North Korea", "World news", "UK news", "Tony Hall"], "title": "BBC plans TV and radio services for Russia and North Korea"},{"date": "2015-08-15T23:04:00Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "I simply cannot hold on to my dirty little geopolitical secret any longer.

For a start, the offending general is probably a man who believes in first-strike nuclear capability. And second, at least the North Korean strongman didn\u2019t have his subordinates eaten alive by starving lions, copyright Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi monocrat was Britain\u2019s former ally in the Middle East until he annexed the medieval hand-and head-removing kingdom of Kuwait.Nor did he have political opponents dropped from a great height out of helicopters into crocodile-infested rivers, as General Pinochet was wont to do after the Americans had given him Chile to rape.I once gently had to persuade a Scottish national Sunday newspaper\u2019s resident rightwing columnist, who occupied a place at the gibbering end of the reactionary index, not to start his column one week with the sentence: \u201cViva General Pinochet\u201d. This was at the time when Margaret Thatcher was trying to grant the prince of South America\u2019s genocidal psychopaths political asylum.Western media outlets have long used news coming out of North Korea in the \u201c\u2026 and finally\u201d category, a slot reserved mainly for English eccentrics who stookie their neighbours in disputes about over-zealous leylandii growth. Either that, or it\u2019s an unsourced report from the US State Department that they are monitoring activity along the 38th parallel because of an illicit nuclear test by North Korea. This, of course, is US diplomatic code for announcing that it\u2019s moving the country on to its favoured security status of Defcon 3, otherwise known as \u201cCan we not just bomb the commie bastards?\u201dWe like to poke fun at North Korea for making up its foreign policy as it goes along and for favouring a vivid approach in its expressions of diplomatic displeasure: \u201cWe, the peace-loving and fragrant paradise of North Korea will not bend the knee to Obama, whom all men and women of goodwill acknowledge to be a warmongering, Satan-worshipping baby-eater.\u201dWe in the sophisticated west also like to disparage the apparent gullibility of its people. We show pictures of them cheering wildly when state television tells them that the pope is to canonise Kim Jong-un. Last year, there was a cruel spoof showing scenes of joy at the news North Korea were about to play the hated Portuguese in the World Cup final.Yet that would work for me. What if we floated a story that Scotland had really won the World Cup in 1966 and that England\u2019s triumph was really an elaborate unionist confidence trick to quell rising nationalist fervour? And that the usual unionist lickspittles in the press and BBC, together with a lapdog Scottish Office, had helped spread the lie? Last week, we were at it again as we struggled to suppress a condescending titter at news of North Korea creating its own time zone.I hope that the North Korean people also have a right good laugh when they see footage depicting us as naive, sleepwalking simpletons. All they have to do is click on to any UK news outlet. Then they would find out that for centuries the UK has been governed by a tiny elite drawn from some of the most privileged families in the UK and that we, the idiot punters, all think we\u2019re in a democracy.They would discover that, despite possessing riches beyond the imagination of North Korea, we have one of the most unequal societies in the world. To their horror, they would also discover that hundreds of thousands of UK children live in grinding poverty.They would wonder why we\u2019ve never risen up against a regime that spends billions on nuclear weapons and has been in a state of perpetual war for more than 300 years. They would gasp that the UK government imposes a levy of \u00a32K on every UK family to help banks whose greed and avarice in recent years almost ruined the entire western economy.They would jeer when it was revealed that, after all this, the poorest families received even less money to pay for something called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d. And they would marvel at how the UK establishment agrees to grant its royal family a millionaire lifestyle in return for them keeping our eyes averted with an endless soap opera of births, deaths, marriages and divorces.They would draw their children close when it was revealed that we allow the United States, the most reactionary country in the world and one that gives its police officers carte blanche to execute black people, to dictate our foreign policy and to torture horribly some of our own citizens on trumped-up charges of terrorism. And they would immediately dismiss it as a spoof.

North Korea is a country which denies basic rights to its people and has an economy teetering on the edge of collapse. Instead of settling for maintaining the status quo, ignoring the suffering of millions and simply hoping the crisis doesn\u2019t spill over the border, here\u2019s what the west should do about North Korea: Related: North Korea says it has restarted all its nuclear bomb fuel plants The DPRK isn\u2019t interested in getting rid of its nuclear capacity; the west has tried sanctions, the threat of military force, and (unfulfilled) promises of alternative energy assistance for 20 years with no significant effect. Given that North Korea watched as Libya denuclearised in 2003 and was invaded in 2011, this should come as no surprise.It\u2019s time to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and shift the focus from deterrence politics to human security. If anything, diplomatic efforts should go towards encouraging North Korea to sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to regular IAEA inspections rather than stubbornly insisting that disarmament is a hard prerequisite for engagement. Related: North Korea's renewed nuclear threat keeps experts guessing The diplomatic utility of the annual exercises is two-fold: to remind the North (and China) of the US presence on the peninsula and to reassure western allies in the region (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines). At the most basic level, military exercises maintain operational readiness and ensure effective integration between participating forces. Yet the war games are disproportionate and overly theatrical when compared to the potential threat posed by North Korea \u2013 and offer all stick but no carrot.Here\u2019s the carrot: economic aid in exchange for human rights improvements. Avoiding the DPRK\u2019s economic collapse is ultimately in the interests of western governments \u2013 not only to avoid a human rights crisis but also to prevent an influx of refugees to China and South Korea. The aid should be targeted at meeting civilians\u2019 basic needs, for example food and healthcare. Economic aid is the other side of diplomacy, inverse to the use of military force, and would increase western influence over the North. North Korean diplomats are actually quite sane and reasonable. They have personal and national interests like any other diplomats; engaging with them would be mutually beneficial.The last high-profile attempt at so-called track two diplomacy was in 2013, when Dennis Rodman went to the North to try to secure the release of Korean-American Kenneth Bae who was in prison on charges amounting to propagating Christianity. He failed (although Bae has since been released). The lesson is that celebrity athletes are not reliable sources of diplomacy and future track two efforts should be coordinated with government-level engagement. Related: Why have North Korean defections dropped? Refugees offer the most reliable insight into life beyond the DMZ, the conditions within prisons, and the activities of the regime. Unfortunately the western media rewards sensationalist stories and some defectors have taken to fabricating elaborate tales of espionage and involvement with secret organs of the North\u2019s government. This contributes to an already severe information deficit, silencing defectors who are telling the truth and hindering efforts at understanding the North. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is the DPRK\u2019s state news outlet and one of only two printed news sources in the country, the other being Rodong Sinmun. KCNA offers unique insight into the official party line within North Korea. Many \u201cNorth Korea watchers\u201d read the English version online and scoff at how ridiculous the government makes itself sound with its petty and combative insults \u2013 but these readers fail to realise that they aren\u2019t the KCNA\u2019s target audience. The state news is directed toward citizens who have no access to outside news sources. It is not indicative of what the government thinks, rather it\u2019s a daily dose of Kimist propaganda and should be read accordingly. Interpreting the KCNA superficially would be to underestimate the sophistication of the government. International governments are not the only relevant players in international security. NGOs are potentially able to access and assist vulnerable people where states are not. Support groups which facilitate the agency of North Koreans, help amplify their voices and give them access to resources; avoid those who claim to speak on their behalf.Morgan Potts is a North Korean scholar and production editor for the British Association For Korean Studies academic journal, BAKS Papers.

Related: North Korea nuclear reactor showing signs of ramp-up, says\u00a0thinktank In the announcement, made via state media, the North claimed that its plutonium and highly enriched uranium facilities at the main Yongbyon nuclear complex had been \u201crearranged, changed or readjusted and they started normal operation\u201d.The claim came a day after the North threatened to launch \u201csatellites\u201d that many believe are covers for long-range missile tests.The expected missile launches will coincide with celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers\u2019 party on 10 October.North Korea insists its rocket launches are intended to put peaceful satellites into orbit, but the US, Japan and other countries regard them as covers for ballistic missile tests, which are banned under UN security council resolutions.The fear is that North Korea is moving closer to being able to combine nuclear weapons with missile delivery systems. This would make it a credible threat to targets as far away as the US mainland.Last year, a senior US general claimed that North Korea already possessed the expertise to build a nuclear warhead that could be mounted on a ballistic missile.The director of the North\u2019s atomic energy institute told the official KCNA news agency that the country was fully ready to cope with US hostility with \u201cnuclear weapons any time\u201d.He said that all of the facilities at the Yongbyon complex, including a five-megawatt reactor, had resumed normal operations.While it is often difficult to verify North Korean claims about its nuclear programme, satellite images taken in recent years suggested the partial and intermittent restarting of the Yongbyon reactor, with military experts reporting definite signs of uranium enrichment at the complex.Experts say that when fully operational, the reactor is capable of producing around 6kg of plutonium a year, or enough for one nuclear bomb.North Korea shut the Yongbyon reactor in 2007 as part of an aid-for-disarmament deal, but preparations started for a full resumption of operations after its last nuclear weapons test in February 2013.The atomic energy institute\u2019s director said of the planned satellite launches: \u201cSpace development for peaceful purposes is a sovereign state\u2019s legitimate right ... and the people of (North Korea) are fully determined to exercise this right no matter what others may say about it.\u201dThe world, he said, would \u201cclearly see a series of satellites soaring into the sky at times and locations determined\u201d by the ruling party.South Korea\u2019s defence ministry said on Tuesday that the firing of a long-range missile would represent a \u201cserious\u201d violation of UN resolutions, but added it had not detected any signs indicating North Korea was preparing such a launch.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Nuclear weapons"], "title": "North Korea says it has restarted all its nuclear bomb fuel plants"},{"date": "2015-09-04T23:01:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The BBC is set to unveil proposals for a significant expansion of the BBC World Service, including potentially a satellite TV service for Russian speakers and a daily radio news programme for North Korea.The proposals, which will be announced by director general Tony Hall on Monday, include beefing up the BBC Arabic service to offer more regional content, with increased coverage of north Africa and the Middle East.The BBC argues that the expansion is about \u201cdemocracy and the free press\u201d at a time which has seen the rise of big state-sponsored rivals, such as al-Jazeera and RT (previously Russia Today), both of which now have UK operations, and China Central Television.\u201cThis is about Britain\u2019s place in the world,\u201d said a BBC source. \u201cIt is above the politics of the debates about the BBC\u2019s future. It has to be a national priority. Other news outlets are growing globally and many do not share our traditions and values. We have a strong commitment to uphold global democracy through accurate, impartial and independent news. There should no longer be any no-go countries for the World Service.\u201dThe proposals include looking at a satellite TV service for Russian speakers or ramping up digital presence on YouTube or Rutube, the Russian equivalent, and TV bulletins for neighbouring eastern European states. In addition, the corporation intends to extend its digital and mobile offerings for the Indian and Nigerian markets.The BBC was forced to take on the \u00a3245m annual cost of the World Service, which had been funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, from last year as part of the 2010 licence fee settlement with the government.In an ironic twist, the BBC is to seek financial support from the government for the expansion. The BBC will offer to match any increase in public funding for the World Service if it can be allowed to more heavily-commercialise its Global News operation outside the UK, which generates more than \u00a3100m in revenues annually from sources including advertising and sponsorship.Earlier this year, the BBC published its Future of News report, which warned the government that cuts to the World Service would reduce the UK\u2019s global \u201csoft power\u201d in the face of the growth of rivals such as RT and al-Jazeera.\u201cThe World Service faces a choice between decline and growth,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf the UK wants the BBC to remain valued and respected, an ambassador of Britain\u2019s values and an agent of soft power in the world, then the BBC is going to have to commit to growing the World Service and the government will have to recognise this.\u201d", "tags": ["BBC World Service", "BBC", "Media", "Radio industry", "Television industry", "Russia Today", "Al-Jazeera", "TV news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Russia", "North Korea", "World news", "UK news", "Tony Hall"], "title": "BBC plans TV and radio services for Russia and North Korea"},{"date": "2015-08-28T21:00:18Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Growing up in North Korea, I thought we were the greatest people in the world, led by our Dear Leader. Because North Korea was so totally cut off, we didn\u2019t hear anything of the outside world. We had only one TV channel, which showed only propaganda, and we believed everything.In 1995 there was a terrible famine. I saw people dying on the streets in front of me. Their dead bodies would just be left under bridges or at railway stations. The smell of decomposing bodies was everywhere. I was very sad, but we didn\u2019t know our suffering was because of the government. I thought all the world was suffering as we did.I lived in Hyesan, very near the border with China. I was lucky as that\u2019s how I found out the truth. We could pick up Chinese TV channels but were too far away for the authorities to detect. When we had power, I would lock myself in my room, use thick blankets to prevent light escaping, and watch Chinese TV. Everything I saw was so colourful, developed, commercial and totally different to what we had been told. But I didn\u2019t know if what I was seeing was real or not. I thought maybe this was propaganda too.In my village we had a good relationship with the border guards, they were like uncles. They helped me escape in 1997 and I went to live with my relatives in China, a 10-hour drive from the border. I was very naive, I was 17 and didn\u2019t have a definition of \u201cescape\u201d. I just wanted to know the truth. I studied hard to learn Chinese, everyday for three years. I learnt for survival \u2013 that\u2019s very motivating. When I was caught and interrogated by the police, I convinced them I was Chinese.Later I got a real Chinese ID card by buying the identity of a mentally disabled woman. But whenever I saw a police car I was scared. I was traumatised. Most defectors have no idea where to go and are often sold as sex slaves into China. For years my Chinese family supported me, but they wanted me to have an arranged marriage so I ran away and worked as a waitress. It was a tiny salary but I was so happy, it was the first time I\u2019d accomplished something. Finally I escaped to South Korea, and later helped my immediate family escape too.My favourite place in South Korea is Jeju island, it\u2019s a tropical paradise with sandy beaches, turquoise waters, and the magnificent Geomunoreum lava tube system of underground caves.I love hiking to Mt Halla and Seongsan Ilchulbong peak, which has 99 sharp rocks surrounding a crater at the top, making it look like a gigantic crown.The tradition of the haenyeo \u2013 \u201cKorean mermaids\u201d is unique to Jeju. These Jeju women dive into the ocean to gather shellfish and seaweed in a basket, without using any diving equipment.My favourite Korean food is delicious black five-layered pork belly, cooked over a charcoal grill. And Jeju chocolate, in citrus fruits and green tea flavour, which is famous throughout Korea.I\u2019m very happy in South Korea, I have freedom, I can travel. But I paid a huge price. I lost my hometown, some of my family, my friends. When millions of people are in living in a prison in North Korea I often stop myself and think \u201cOh my gosh, how can I be happy right now?\u201d.

The Iraqi monocrat was Britain\u2019s former ally in the Middle East until he annexed the medieval hand-and head-removing kingdom of Kuwait.Nor did he have political opponents dropped from a great height out of helicopters into crocodile-infested rivers, as General Pinochet was wont to do after the Americans had given him Chile to rape.I once gently had to persuade a Scottish national Sunday newspaper\u2019s resident rightwing columnist, who occupied a place at the gibbering end of the reactionary index, not to start his column one week with the sentence: \u201cViva General Pinochet\u201d. This was at the time when Margaret Thatcher was trying to grant the prince of South America\u2019s genocidal psychopaths political asylum.Western media outlets have long used news coming out of North Korea in the \u201c\u2026 and finally\u201d category, a slot reserved mainly for English eccentrics who stookie their neighbours in disputes about over-zealous leylandii growth. Either that, or it\u2019s an unsourced report from the US State Department that they are monitoring activity along the 38th parallel because of an illicit nuclear test by North Korea. This, of course, is US diplomatic code for announcing that it\u2019s moving the country on to its favoured security status of Defcon 3, otherwise known as \u201cCan we not just bomb the commie bastards?\u201dWe like to poke fun at North Korea for making up its foreign policy as it goes along and for favouring a vivid approach in its expressions of diplomatic displeasure: \u201cWe, the peace-loving and fragrant paradise of North Korea will not bend the knee to Obama, whom all men and women of goodwill acknowledge to be a warmongering, Satan-worshipping baby-eater.\u201dWe in the sophisticated west also like to disparage the apparent gullibility of its people. We show pictures of them cheering wildly when state television tells them that the pope is to canonise Kim Jong-un. Last year, there was a cruel spoof showing scenes of joy at the news North Korea were about to play the hated Portuguese in the World Cup final.Yet that would work for me. What if we floated a story that Scotland had really won the World Cup in 1966 and that England\u2019s triumph was really an elaborate unionist confidence trick to quell rising nationalist fervour? And that the usual unionist lickspittles in the press and BBC, together with a lapdog Scottish Office, had helped spread the lie? Last week, we were at it again as we struggled to suppress a condescending titter at news of North Korea creating its own time zone.I hope that the North Korean people also have a right good laugh when they see footage depicting us as naive, sleepwalking simpletons. All they have to do is click on to any UK news outlet. Then they would find out that for centuries the UK has been governed by a tiny elite drawn from some of the most privileged families in the UK and that we, the idiot punters, all think we\u2019re in a democracy.They would discover that, despite possessing riches beyond the imagination of North Korea, we have one of the most unequal societies in the world. To their horror, they would also discover that hundreds of thousands of UK children live in grinding poverty.They would wonder why we\u2019ve never risen up against a regime that spends billions on nuclear weapons and has been in a state of perpetual war for more than 300 years. They would gasp that the UK government imposes a levy of \u00a32K on every UK family to help banks whose greed and avarice in recent years almost ruined the entire western economy.They would jeer when it was revealed that, after all this, the poorest families received even less money to pay for something called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d. And they would marvel at how the UK establishment agrees to grant its royal family a millionaire lifestyle in return for them keeping our eyes averted with an endless soap opera of births, deaths, marriages and divorces.They would draw their children close when it was revealed that we allow the United States, the most reactionary country in the world and one that gives its police officers carte blanche to execute black people, to dictate our foreign policy and to torture horribly some of our own citizens on trumped-up charges of terrorism. And they would immediately dismiss it as a spoof.

North Korea is a country which denies basic rights to its people and has an economy teetering on the edge of collapse. Instead of settling for maintaining the status quo, ignoring the suffering of millions and simply hoping the crisis doesn\u2019t spill over the border, here\u2019s what the west should do about North Korea: Related: North Korea says it has restarted all its nuclear bomb fuel plants The DPRK isn\u2019t interested in getting rid of its nuclear capacity; the west has tried sanctions, the threat of military force, and (unfulfilled) promises of alternative energy assistance for 20 years with no significant effect. Given that North Korea watched as Libya denuclearised in 2003 and was invaded in 2011, this should come as no surprise.It\u2019s time to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and shift the focus from deterrence politics to human security. If anything, diplomatic efforts should go towards encouraging North Korea to sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to regular IAEA inspections rather than stubbornly insisting that disarmament is a hard prerequisite for engagement. Related: North Korea's renewed nuclear threat keeps experts guessing The diplomatic utility of the annual exercises is two-fold: to remind the North (and China) of the US presence on the peninsula and to reassure western allies in the region (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines). At the most basic level, military exercises maintain operational readiness and ensure effective integration between participating forces. Yet the war games are disproportionate and overly theatrical when compared to the potential threat posed by North Korea \u2013 and offer all stick but no carrot.Here\u2019s the carrot: economic aid in exchange for human rights improvements. Avoiding the DPRK\u2019s economic collapse is ultimately in the interests of western governments \u2013 not only to avoid a human rights crisis but also to prevent an influx of refugees to China and South Korea. The aid should be targeted at meeting civilians\u2019 basic needs, for example food and healthcare. Economic aid is the other side of diplomacy, inverse to the use of military force, and would increase western influence over the North. North Korean diplomats are actually quite sane and reasonable. They have personal and national interests like any other diplomats; engaging with them would be mutually beneficial.The last high-profile attempt at so-called track two diplomacy was in 2013, when Dennis Rodman went to the North to try to secure the release of Korean-American Kenneth Bae who was in prison on charges amounting to propagating Christianity. He failed (although Bae has since been released). The lesson is that celebrity athletes are not reliable sources of diplomacy and future track two efforts should be coordinated with government-level engagement. Related: Why have North Korean defections dropped? Refugees offer the most reliable insight into life beyond the DMZ, the conditions within prisons, and the activities of the regime. Unfortunately the western media rewards sensationalist stories and some defectors have taken to fabricating elaborate tales of espionage and involvement with secret organs of the North\u2019s government. This contributes to an already severe information deficit, silencing defectors who are telling the truth and hindering efforts at understanding the North. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is the DPRK\u2019s state news outlet and one of only two printed news sources in the country, the other being Rodong Sinmun. KCNA offers unique insight into the official party line within North Korea. Many \u201cNorth Korea watchers\u201d read the English version online and scoff at how ridiculous the government makes itself sound with its petty and combative insults \u2013 but these readers fail to realise that they aren\u2019t the KCNA\u2019s target audience. The state news is directed toward citizens who have no access to outside news sources. It is not indicative of what the government thinks, rather it\u2019s a daily dose of Kimist propaganda and should be read accordingly. Interpreting the KCNA superficially would be to underestimate the sophistication of the government. International governments are not the only relevant players in international security. NGOs are potentially able to access and assist vulnerable people where states are not. Support groups which facilitate the agency of North Koreans, help amplify their voices and give them access to resources; avoid those who claim to speak on their behalf.Morgan Potts is a North Korean scholar and production editor for the British Association For Korean Studies academic journal, BAKS Papers.

Related: North Korea nuclear reactor showing signs of ramp-up, says\u00a0thinktank In the announcement, made via state media, the North claimed that its plutonium and highly enriched uranium facilities at the main Yongbyon nuclear complex had been \u201crearranged, changed or readjusted and they started normal operation\u201d.The claim came a day after the North threatened to launch \u201csatellites\u201d that many believe are covers for long-range missile tests.The expected missile launches will coincide with celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers\u2019 party on 10 October.North Korea insists its rocket launches are intended to put peaceful satellites into orbit, but the US, Japan and other countries regard them as covers for ballistic missile tests, which are banned under UN security council resolutions.The fear is that North Korea is moving closer to being able to combine nuclear weapons with missile delivery systems. This would make it a credible threat to targets as far away as the US mainland.Last year, a senior US general claimed that North Korea already possessed the expertise to build a nuclear warhead that could be mounted on a ballistic missile.The director of the North\u2019s atomic energy institute told the official KCNA news agency that the country was fully ready to cope with US hostility with \u201cnuclear weapons any time\u201d.He said that all of the facilities at the Yongbyon complex, including a five-megawatt reactor, had resumed normal operations.While it is often difficult to verify North Korean claims about its nuclear programme, satellite images taken in recent years suggested the partial and intermittent restarting of the Yongbyon reactor, with military experts reporting definite signs of uranium enrichment at the complex.Experts say that when fully operational, the reactor is capable of producing around 6kg of plutonium a year, or enough for one nuclear bomb.North Korea shut the Yongbyon reactor in 2007 as part of an aid-for-disarmament deal, but preparations started for a full resumption of operations after its last nuclear weapons test in February 2013.The atomic energy institute\u2019s director said of the planned satellite launches: \u201cSpace development for peaceful purposes is a sovereign state\u2019s legitimate right ... and the people of (North Korea) are fully determined to exercise this right no matter what others may say about it.\u201dThe world, he said, would \u201cclearly see a series of satellites soaring into the sky at times and locations determined\u201d by the ruling party.South Korea\u2019s defence ministry said on Tuesday that the firing of a long-range missile would represent a \u201cserious\u201d violation of UN resolutions, but added it had not detected any signs indicating North Korea was preparing such a launch.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Nuclear weapons"], "title": "North Korea says it has restarted all its nuclear bomb fuel plants"},{"date": "2015-09-04T23:01:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The BBC is set to unveil proposals for a significant expansion of the BBC World Service, including potentially a satellite TV service for Russian speakers and a daily radio news programme for North Korea.The proposals, which will be announced by director general Tony Hall on Monday, include beefing up the BBC Arabic service to offer more regional content, with increased coverage of north Africa and the Middle East.The BBC argues that the expansion is about \u201cdemocracy and the free press\u201d at a time which has seen the rise of big state-sponsored rivals, such as al-Jazeera and RT (previously Russia Today), both of which now have UK operations, and China Central Television.\u201cThis is about Britain\u2019s place in the world,\u201d said a BBC source. \u201cIt is above the politics of the debates about the BBC\u2019s future. It has to be a national priority. Other news outlets are growing globally and many do not share our traditions and values. We have a strong commitment to uphold global democracy through accurate, impartial and independent news. There should no longer be any no-go countries for the World Service.\u201dThe proposals include looking at a satellite TV service for Russian speakers or ramping up digital presence on YouTube or Rutube, the Russian equivalent, and TV bulletins for neighbouring eastern European states. In addition, the corporation intends to extend its digital and mobile offerings for the Indian and Nigerian markets.The BBC was forced to take on the \u00a3245m annual cost of the World Service, which had been funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, from last year as part of the 2010 licence fee settlement with the government.In an ironic twist, the BBC is to seek financial support from the government for the expansion. The BBC will offer to match any increase in public funding for the World Service if it can be allowed to more heavily-commercialise its Global News operation outside the UK, which generates more than \u00a3100m in revenues annually from sources including advertising and sponsorship.Earlier this year, the BBC published its Future of News report, which warned the government that cuts to the World Service would reduce the UK\u2019s global \u201csoft power\u201d in the face of the growth of rivals such as RT and al-Jazeera.\u201cThe World Service faces a choice between decline and growth,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf the UK wants the BBC to remain valued and respected, an ambassador of Britain\u2019s values and an agent of soft power in the world, then the BBC is going to have to commit to growing the World Service and the government will have to recognise this.\u201d", "tags": ["BBC World Service", "BBC", "Media", "Radio industry", "Television industry", "Russia Today", "Al-Jazeera", "TV news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Russia", "North Korea", "World news", "UK news", "Tony Hall"], "title": "BBC plans TV and radio services for Russia and North Korea"},{"date": "2015-08-28T21:00:18Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Growing up in North Korea, I thought we were the greatest people in the world, led by our Dear Leader. Because North Korea was so totally cut off, we didn\u2019t hear anything of the outside world. We had only one TV channel, which showed only propaganda, and we believed everything.In 1995 there was a terrible famine. I saw people dying on the streets in front of me. Their dead bodies would just be left under bridges or at railway stations. The smell of decomposing bodies was everywhere. I was very sad, but we didn\u2019t know our suffering was because of the government. I thought all the world was suffering as we did.I lived in Hyesan, very near the border with China. I was lucky as that\u2019s how I found out the truth. We could pick up Chinese TV channels but were too far away for the authorities to detect. When we had power, I would lock myself in my room, use thick blankets to prevent light escaping, and watch Chinese TV. Everything I saw was so colourful, developed, commercial and totally different to what we had been told. But I didn\u2019t know if what I was seeing was real or not. I thought maybe this was propaganda too.In my village we had a good relationship with the border guards, they were like uncles. They helped me escape in 1997 and I went to live with my relatives in China, a 10-hour drive from the border. I was very naive, I was 17 and didn\u2019t have a definition of \u201cescape\u201d. I just wanted to know the truth. I studied hard to learn Chinese, everyday for three years. I learnt for survival \u2013 that\u2019s very motivating. When I was caught and interrogated by the police, I convinced them I was Chinese.Later I got a real Chinese ID card by buying the identity of a mentally disabled woman. But whenever I saw a police car I was scared. I was traumatised. Most defectors have no idea where to go and are often sold as sex slaves into China. For years my Chinese family supported me, but they wanted me to have an arranged marriage so I ran away and worked as a waitress. It was a tiny salary but I was so happy, it was the first time I\u2019d accomplished something. Finally I escaped to South Korea, and later helped my immediate family escape too.My favourite place in South Korea is Jeju island, it\u2019s a tropical paradise with sandy beaches, turquoise waters, and the magnificent Geomunoreum lava tube system of underground caves.I love hiking to Mt Halla and Seongsan Ilchulbong peak, which has 99 sharp rocks surrounding a crater at the top, making it look like a gigantic crown.The tradition of the haenyeo \u2013 \u201cKorean mermaids\u201d is unique to Jeju. These Jeju women dive into the ocean to gather shellfish and seaweed in a basket, without using any diving equipment.My favourite Korean food is delicious black five-layered pork belly, cooked over a charcoal grill. And Jeju chocolate, in citrus fruits and green tea flavour, which is famous throughout Korea.I\u2019m very happy in South Korea, I have freedom, I can travel. But I paid a huge price. I lost my hometown, some of my family, my friends. When millions of people are in living in a prison in North Korea I often stop myself and think \u201cOh my gosh, how can I be happy right now?\u201d.

It\u2019s this: I have more than a residual fondness for the North Koreans. You have to admire the stoicism of a people who, in the grand lottery of nations that get to be ruled by despotic tyrants, drew by far the shortest straw. While other countries got debonair bampots such as Saddam Hussein, Muamarr Gaddafi and Dom Mintoff, the poor North Koreans got a wee bloke whom you imagine Chucky the demonic doll to look like if he were to adopt human form.Just the other month, he caught one of his generals falling asleep during a meeting. The president promptly had him marched out to a field and shot at close range with an anti-aircaft gun. Admittedly, this seems, at first glance, to be excessively barbaric. And, in fact, some folk later began to doubt the veracity of the tale.But let\u2019s assume it was true and ask yourself this question: if you had the choice, would you like to be blown to bits by a howitzer that can knock out a plane or by a few blokes with rifles? What if the firing squad, fresh from a night on the Don Revie to calm their anxieties at being asked to shoot you, are a bit wobbly and shaky in their aim? You could end up dying in agony of partial gunshot wounds weeks later. Let\u2019s face it: even a partial hit by an anti-aircraft gun would leave you absolutely, securely and instantly\u2026deid.It doesn\u2019t do, though, to get too fey and Edinburgh festival about Kim Jong-un\u2019s disciplinary methods. For a start, the offending general is probably a man who believes in first-strike nuclear capability. And second, at least the North Korean strongman didn\u2019t have his subordinates eaten alive by starving lions, copyright Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi monocrat was Britain\u2019s former ally in the Middle East until he annexed the medieval hand-and head-removing kingdom of Kuwait.Nor did he have political opponents dropped from a great height out of helicopters into crocodile-infested rivers, as General Pinochet was wont to do after the Americans had given him Chile to rape.I once gently had to persuade a Scottish national Sunday newspaper\u2019s resident rightwing columnist, who occupied a place at the gibbering end of the reactionary index, not to start his column one week with the sentence: \u201cViva General Pinochet\u201d. This was at the time when Margaret Thatcher was trying to grant the prince of South America\u2019s genocidal psychopaths political asylum.Western media outlets have long used news coming out of North Korea in the \u201c\u2026 and finally\u201d category, a slot reserved mainly for English eccentrics who stookie their neighbours in disputes about over-zealous leylandii growth. Either that, or it\u2019s an unsourced report from the US State Department that they are monitoring activity along the 38th parallel because of an illicit nuclear test by North Korea. This, of course, is US diplomatic code for announcing that it\u2019s moving the country on to its favoured security status of Defcon 3, otherwise known as \u201cCan we not just bomb the commie bastards?\u201dWe like to poke fun at North Korea for making up its foreign policy as it goes along and for favouring a vivid approach in its expressions of diplomatic displeasure: \u201cWe, the peace-loving and fragrant paradise of North Korea will not bend the knee to Obama, whom all men and women of goodwill acknowledge to be a warmongering, Satan-worshipping baby-eater.\u201dWe in the sophisticated west also like to disparage the apparent gullibility of its people. We show pictures of them cheering wildly when state television tells them that the pope is to canonise Kim Jong-un. Last year, there was a cruel spoof showing scenes of joy at the news North Korea were about to play the hated Portuguese in the World Cup final.Yet that would work for me. What if we floated a story that Scotland had really won the World Cup in 1966 and that England\u2019s triumph was really an elaborate unionist confidence trick to quell rising nationalist fervour? And that the usual unionist lickspittles in the press and BBC, together with a lapdog Scottish Office, had helped spread the lie? Last week, we were at it again as we struggled to suppress a condescending titter at news of North Korea creating its own time zone.I hope that the North Korean people also have a right good laugh when they see footage depicting us as naive, sleepwalking simpletons. All they have to do is click on to any UK news outlet. Then they would find out that for centuries the UK has been governed by a tiny elite drawn from some of the most privileged families in the UK and that we, the idiot punters, all think we\u2019re in a democracy.They would discover that, despite possessing riches beyond the imagination of North Korea, we have one of the most unequal societies in the world. To their horror, they would also discover that hundreds of thousands of UK children live in grinding poverty.They would wonder why we\u2019ve never risen up against a regime that spends billions on nuclear weapons and has been in a state of perpetual war for more than 300 years. They would gasp that the UK government imposes a levy of \u00a32K on every UK family to help banks whose greed and avarice in recent years almost ruined the entire western economy.They would jeer when it was revealed that, after all this, the poorest families received even less money to pay for something called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d. And they would marvel at how the UK establishment agrees to grant its royal family a millionaire lifestyle in return for them keeping our eyes averted with an endless soap opera of births, deaths, marriages and divorces.They would draw their children close when it was revealed that we allow the United States, the most reactionary country in the world and one that gives its police officers carte blanche to execute black people, to dictate our foreign policy and to torture horribly some of our own citizens on trumped-up charges of terrorism. And they would immediately dismiss it as a spoof.

North Korea is a country which denies basic rights to its people and has an economy teetering on the edge of collapse. Instead of settling for maintaining the status quo, ignoring the suffering of millions and simply hoping the crisis doesn\u2019t spill over the border, here\u2019s what the west should do about North Korea: Related: North Korea says it has restarted all its nuclear bomb fuel plants The DPRK isn\u2019t interested in getting rid of its nuclear capacity; the west has tried sanctions, the threat of military force, and (unfulfilled) promises of alternative energy assistance for 20 years with no significant effect. Given that North Korea watched as Libya denuclearised in 2003 and was invaded in 2011, this should come as no surprise.It\u2019s time to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and shift the focus from deterrence politics to human security. If anything, diplomatic efforts should go towards encouraging North Korea to sign up to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and submit to regular IAEA inspections rather than stubbornly insisting that disarmament is a hard prerequisite for engagement. Related: North Korea's renewed nuclear threat keeps experts guessing The diplomatic utility of the annual exercises is two-fold: to remind the North (and China) of the US presence on the peninsula and to reassure western allies in the region (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines). At the most basic level, military exercises maintain operational readiness and ensure effective integration between participating forces. Yet the war games are disproportionate and overly theatrical when compared to the potential threat posed by North Korea \u2013 and offer all stick but no carrot.Here\u2019s the carrot: economic aid in exchange for human rights improvements. Avoiding the DPRK\u2019s economic collapse is ultimately in the interests of western governments \u2013 not only to avoid a human rights crisis but also to prevent an influx of refugees to China and South Korea. The aid should be targeted at meeting civilians\u2019 basic needs, for example food and healthcare. Economic aid is the other side of diplomacy, inverse to the use of military force, and would increase western influence over the North. North Korean diplomats are actually quite sane and reasonable. They have personal and national interests like any other diplomats; engaging with them would be mutually beneficial.The last high-profile attempt at so-called track two diplomacy was in 2013, when Dennis Rodman went to the North to try to secure the release of Korean-American Kenneth Bae who was in prison on charges amounting to propagating Christianity. He failed (although Bae has since been released). The lesson is that celebrity athletes are not reliable sources of diplomacy and future track two efforts should be coordinated with government-level engagement. Related: Why have North Korean defections dropped? Refugees offer the most reliable insight into life beyond the DMZ, the conditions within prisons, and the activities of the regime. Unfortunately the western media rewards sensationalist stories and some defectors have taken to fabricating elaborate tales of espionage and involvement with secret organs of the North\u2019s government. This contributes to an already severe information deficit, silencing defectors who are telling the truth and hindering efforts at understanding the North. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) is the DPRK\u2019s state news outlet and one of only two printed news sources in the country, the other being Rodong Sinmun. KCNA offers unique insight into the official party line within North Korea. Many \u201cNorth Korea watchers\u201d read the English version online and scoff at how ridiculous the government makes itself sound with its petty and combative insults \u2013 but these readers fail to realise that they aren\u2019t the KCNA\u2019s target audience. The state news is directed toward citizens who have no access to outside news sources. It is not indicative of what the government thinks, rather it\u2019s a daily dose of Kimist propaganda and should be read accordingly. Interpreting the KCNA superficially would be to underestimate the sophistication of the government. International governments are not the only relevant players in international security. NGOs are potentially able to access and assist vulnerable people where states are not. Support groups which facilitate the agency of North Koreans, help amplify their voices and give them access to resources; avoid those who claim to speak on their behalf.Morgan Potts is a North Korean scholar and production editor for the British Association For Korean Studies academic journal, BAKS Papers.

Related: North Korea nuclear reactor showing signs of ramp-up, says\u00a0thinktank In the announcement, made via state media, the North claimed that its plutonium and highly enriched uranium facilities at the main Yongbyon nuclear complex had been \u201crearranged, changed or readjusted and they started normal operation\u201d.The claim came a day after the North threatened to launch \u201csatellites\u201d that many believe are covers for long-range missile tests.The expected missile launches will coincide with celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers\u2019 party on 10 October.North Korea insists its rocket launches are intended to put peaceful satellites into orbit, but the US, Japan and other countries regard them as covers for ballistic missile tests, which are banned under UN security council resolutions.The fear is that North Korea is moving closer to being able to combine nuclear weapons with missile delivery systems. This would make it a credible threat to targets as far away as the US mainland.Last year, a senior US general claimed that North Korea already possessed the expertise to build a nuclear warhead that could be mounted on a ballistic missile.The director of the North\u2019s atomic energy institute told the official KCNA news agency that the country was fully ready to cope with US hostility with \u201cnuclear weapons any time\u201d.He said that all of the facilities at the Yongbyon complex, including a five-megawatt reactor, had resumed normal operations.While it is often difficult to verify North Korean claims about its nuclear programme, satellite images taken in recent years suggested the partial and intermittent restarting of the Yongbyon reactor, with military experts reporting definite signs of uranium enrichment at the complex.Experts say that when fully operational, the reactor is capable of producing around 6kg of plutonium a year, or enough for one nuclear bomb.North Korea shut the Yongbyon reactor in 2007 as part of an aid-for-disarmament deal, but preparations started for a full resumption of operations after its last nuclear weapons test in February 2013.The atomic energy institute\u2019s director said of the planned satellite launches: \u201cSpace development for peaceful purposes is a sovereign state\u2019s legitimate right ... and the people of (North Korea) are fully determined to exercise this right no matter what others may say about it.\u201dThe world, he said, would \u201cclearly see a series of satellites soaring into the sky at times and locations determined\u201d by the ruling party.South Korea\u2019s defence ministry said on Tuesday that the firing of a long-range missile would represent a \u201cserious\u201d violation of UN resolutions, but added it had not detected any signs indicating North Korea was preparing such a launch.", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Nuclear weapons"], "title": "North Korea says it has restarted all its nuclear bomb fuel plants"},{"date": "2015-09-04T23:01:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "The BBC is set to unveil proposals for a significant expansion of the BBC World Service, including potentially a satellite TV service for Russian speakers and a daily radio news programme for North Korea.The proposals, which will be announced by director general Tony Hall on Monday, include beefing up the BBC Arabic service to offer more regional content, with increased coverage of north Africa and the Middle East.The BBC argues that the expansion is about \u201cdemocracy and the free press\u201d at a time which has seen the rise of big state-sponsored rivals, such as al-Jazeera and RT (previously Russia Today), both of which now have UK operations, and China Central Television.\u201cThis is about Britain\u2019s place in the world,\u201d said a BBC source. \u201cIt is above the politics of the debates about the BBC\u2019s future. It has to be a national priority. Other news outlets are growing globally and many do not share our traditions and values. We have a strong commitment to uphold global democracy through accurate, impartial and independent news. There should no longer be any no-go countries for the World Service.\u201dThe proposals include looking at a satellite TV service for Russian speakers or ramping up digital presence on YouTube or Rutube, the Russian equivalent, and TV bulletins for neighbouring eastern European states. In addition, the corporation intends to extend its digital and mobile offerings for the Indian and Nigerian markets.The BBC was forced to take on the \u00a3245m annual cost of the World Service, which had been funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, from last year as part of the 2010 licence fee settlement with the government.In an ironic twist, the BBC is to seek financial support from the government for the expansion. The BBC will offer to match any increase in public funding for the World Service if it can be allowed to more heavily-commercialise its Global News operation outside the UK, which generates more than \u00a3100m in revenues annually from sources including advertising and sponsorship.Earlier this year, the BBC published its Future of News report, which warned the government that cuts to the World Service would reduce the UK\u2019s global \u201csoft power\u201d in the face of the growth of rivals such as RT and al-Jazeera.\u201cThe World Service faces a choice between decline and growth,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf the UK wants the BBC to remain valued and respected, an ambassador of Britain\u2019s values and an agent of soft power in the world, then the BBC is going to have to commit to growing the World Service and the government will have to recognise this.\u201d", "tags": ["BBC World Service", "BBC", "Media", "Radio industry", "Television industry", "Russia Today", "Al-Jazeera", "TV news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Russia", "North Korea", "World news", "UK news", "Tony Hall"], "title": "BBC plans TV and radio services for Russia and North Korea"},{"date": "2015-08-28T21:00:18Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Growing up in North Korea, I thought we were the greatest people in the world, led by our Dear Leader. Because North Korea was so totally cut off, we didn\u2019t hear anything of the outside world. We had only one TV channel, which showed only propaganda, and we believed everything.In 1995 there was a terrible famine. I saw people dying on the streets in front of me. Their dead bodies would just be left under bridges or at railway stations. The smell of decomposing bodies was everywhere. I was very sad, but we didn\u2019t know our suffering was because of the government. I thought all the world was suffering as we did.I lived in Hyesan, very near the border with China. I was lucky as that\u2019s how I found out the truth. We could pick up Chinese TV channels but were too far away for the authorities to detect. When we had power, I would lock myself in my room, use thick blankets to prevent light escaping, and watch Chinese TV. Everything I saw was so colourful, developed, commercial and totally different to what we had been told. But I didn\u2019t know if what I was seeing was real or not. I thought maybe this was propaganda too.In my village we had a good relationship with the border guards, they were like uncles. They helped me escape in 1997 and I went to live with my relatives in China, a 10-hour drive from the border. I was very naive, I was 17 and didn\u2019t have a definition of \u201cescape\u201d. I just wanted to know the truth. I studied hard to learn Chinese, everyday for three years. I learnt for survival \u2013 that\u2019s very motivating. When I was caught and interrogated by the police, I convinced them I was Chinese.Later I got a real Chinese ID card by buying the identity of a mentally disabled woman. But whenever I saw a police car I was scared. I was traumatised. Most defectors have no idea where to go and are often sold as sex slaves into China. For years my Chinese family supported me, but they wanted me to have an arranged marriage so I ran away and worked as a waitress. It was a tiny salary but I was so happy, it was the first time I\u2019d accomplished something. Finally I escaped to South Korea, and later helped my immediate family escape too.My favourite place in South Korea is Jeju island, it\u2019s a tropical paradise with sandy beaches, turquoise waters, and the magnificent Geomunoreum lava tube system of underground caves.I love hiking to Mt Halla and Seongsan Ilchulbong peak, which has 99 sharp rocks surrounding a crater at the top, making it look like a gigantic crown.The tradition of the haenyeo \u2013 \u201cKorean mermaids\u201d is unique to Jeju.

Related: North and South Korea hold high-level talks amid military standoff  In reporting events the authoritarian regime defaulted to its usual bellicose rhetoric. Since Friday, KCNA Watch, a media tracking service operated by NK News, has been dominated by stories littered with overblown statements and calls for retribution that have become North Korean media\u2019s trademark.On Friday South Korean \u201cwar maniacs\u201d were issued a warning to behave with discretion, or risk the \u201cretaliatory spirit running high among the angry servicepersons of the KPA [Korean People\u2019s Army]\u201d.A second editorial put out by state media went on to warn that the peninsula was on \u201cthe brink of war\u201d, describing the propaganda broadcast by the South via loudspeakers near the border as an act of \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d. Accompanying photos showed Kim Jong-un chairing an emergency meeting with the military arm of the Korean workers party.As talks continued without resolution on Monday, commentary from KCNA lashed out at the \u201csmear campaign\u201d at the hands of South Korean conservative media bent on \u201ctarnishing the image of the dignified DPRK\u201d, with Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the Koreans Workers Party, accusing South Korean president Park Geun-hye of \u201cconfrontation hysteria\u201d.Other articles went on to describe how North Korea was preparing for war. One reported that the Women\u2019s Union had met in the capital, Pyongyang to discuss and confirm their dedication to the army.It described how Kim Kum-nyo, a resident from Chungsong-dong, has reportedly \u201crenewed her resolution to bring up all her children to be human bullet and bomb fighters devotedly defending the leader.\u201d Another article claimed that news of the tensions had led \u201cservicepersons and civilians... [to] harden their will to take thousand-fold revenge\u201d on the South. Others claimed the country had increased its productivity, motivated by the spirit of retaliation. In a piece published on Sunday, coal miners in Toksan were said to have increased their yield by 200% spurred on by \u201chatred\u201d, while the Kaesong Songdo Garment Factory topped their daily output by 150%. By Sunday the media agency claimed that \u201cmore than one million young people\u201d were joining the army, a volunteer rate which was \u201cincreasing hourly\u201d. Accompanying pictures purported to show the enthusiastic young fighters signing up, carrying DPRK flags and lifting guns in defiance. Another piece charted the history of the army\u2019s achievements against the South, also reported to be readying troops for battle.KCNA readers have also been informed of widespread support from outside the country. One report stated that the Party for Peace and Unity of Russia and the Socialist party in Benin had both issued supportive statements, before going on to claim that the United States and South Korea had been \u201cbitterly denounced by the world\u201d for their extreme acts of provocation. No independent media outlets exist in North Korea to help verify information released by state media, but according to the Associated Press, which has a bureau in Pyongyang, the inflated rhetoric \u2013 not unusual for KCNA \u2013 has not yet resulted in any palpable changes or visible tensions in the city. Meanwhile, the rest of the KCNA media machine continued to update citizens on other events: an article about a woman\u2019s football match between the two Koreas in China was reported without mentioning the tensions (North Korea won); an exhibition of the history of \u201cRussian-North Korea friendship\u201d opened in in Vladivostok and commemorative stamps were issued to mark Tuesday\u2019s Songun celebrations, a national holiday established in 2010 to mark the achievements of former leader Kim Jong-il.

The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too.Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern.For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast.Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets.They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. Related: 'North Korean' boats carrying dead bodies wash ashore in Japan In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast.Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201dMost of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. Related: A life of luxury and adulation for Kim Jong-un impersonators With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants.In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind.But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths.Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance. If they had been found alive we would have done everything we could to help them.\u201dJiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, believes Kim sent out an order in the summer that more seafood should be provided to the army. \u201cThe problem is that the North Korean fishing industry is no longer run on socialist principles,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe fishermen realised that if they donated their catch to the military they would end up losing money, so they started allowing soldiers to go out and catch their own fish.\u201dThat meant bigger hauls, and allowed civilian fishermen to continue earning money for themselves and foreign currency for the regime under Kim\u2019s quasi-capitalist reforms.Ishimaru, who discussed the boat disappearances with contacts by phone in North Korea earlier this week, believes that large numbers of boats carrying soldiers who knew nothing about fishing or navigation left ports in North Korea soon after Kim\u2019s exhortation to increase catches.Typically small, with tiny engines and no GPS navigation instruments or VHF radios, the boats would easily have lost their way in a storm or a strong current and quickly run out of food and fuel.\u201cWhen Kim Jong-un issues an order no one can ignore it, even if he is asking them to do the impossible,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThat means inexperienced soldiers go out to sea, even in terrible conditions and with no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that they are soldiers, so they wear civilian clothes, which is why none of the bodies found in Japan was in uniform.\u201dIn Fukui, concern about the arrival of vessels from North Korea is mixed with sympathy for the people who met such wretched ends, in freezing seas many miles from home. \u201cI expect they were ordered to catch fish by the North Korean government, but of course no one there will take any responsibility for what happened to them,\u201d said Mitsumasa Sakashita, a 67-year-old fisherman in Fukui. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, because they were just like us: fishermen trying to make a living from the sea.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Fishing"], "title": "Mystery of Japan sea's ghost ships points to North Korea"},{"date": "2015-10-09T14:59:49Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "So you want to go to North Korea?

Koryo Tours, which is used by 40% of all tourists to North Korea, is charging \u00a31,140 for five nights. Most tour companies will help customers arrange their visas but it is also possible to apply for one through your nearest North Korean embassy. According to the listings site Embassy Pages, Pyongyang has diplomatic missions in 48 countries, from Syria to Berne in Switzerland, where the teenage Kim went to boarding school.While entry by train through the border of China is possible, most people travel in on Air Koryo\u2019s Soviet-era fleet of planes. North Korea\u2019s national carrier, which was recently voted the world\u2019s worst airline for the fourth time in a row, is banned from entering European airspace owing to safety concerns.Testimonies from tourists are revealing: \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough seats, so they made the locals share two seats between three with insufficient seat belts. The cabin crew all stood up on take off and clung on for dear life. They then served glasses of beer to everyone at 8am and gave out copies of the Pyongyang Times,\u201d said one traveller on Koryo Tours\u2019 Facebook account. Another talked of officials with no assigned seats smoking through the journey. \u201cThe inflight videos were also huge propaganda movies about war and sporting achievements.\u201d Air China also flies into Pyongyang, which has recently had a revamp, although the internet room at the airport was found to be missing a key element: the internet. North Korea is technically still at war with the South and simmering tensions on the peninsula can erupt at a moment\u2019s notice, though visitors are not usually affected. In August an escalation of events \u2013 sparked by a landmine explosion near the border between the two \u2013 led Kim to announce that North Korea was on an official war footing. Blustering tensions were ultimately resolved through marathon diplomatic talks. Through all this, a group of South Korean footballers was in Pyongyang for a tournament and the avant-garde Slovenian rockers Laibach was there performing, becoming the first western band to play in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).There are isolated cases of western tourists being arrested, such as the Americans Matthew Miller, who ripped up his passport and tried to \u201cclaim asylum\u201d, and Jeffrey Fowle, who left a Bible in a nightclub. Tourists should note that Bibles are banned in North Korea and although its constitution guarantees freedom of religion, the reality is a county ranked as the worst in the world in terms of persecution of Christians, with those who practise openly facing heavy penalties. But as tour companies state on their webistes, they regularly take people without incident.The US State Department strongly recommends against all travel to North Korea and the UK Foreign Office warns of the unpredictability of the country. The FCO ask all British citizens to register with the British embassy in Pyongyang and warn that it has limited reach outside the capital. You\u2019ve got the money sorted and completed your personal risk assessment but there is a bigger issue at stake: is it ethical? Yes, you fulfil your garish ambitions but are you also complicit in propping up a monstrous regime? Related: Tourists are propaganda: how ethical is your North Korean holiday? Hyeonseo Lee, a defector who escaped North Korea in 1997, finds it hard to fathom why tour companies fully aware of the regime\u2019s atrocities would take people there. Tour companies and others organisations that run exchanges with North Korea argue that gradual interaction with the outside world may be effective in opening up the country and poking holes in the regime.You can get around the ethical conundrum by keeping an eye on the job vacancies of development organisations that operate in the country. However, you\u2019ll have your work cut out: North Korea is not only politically oppressed but it is also blighted by natural disaster and famine. The United Nations has six agencies based there, working with the government to \u201cimprove the quality of life of the people [and] ensure sustainable development\u201d. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), for example, runs a midwifery programme and helped the country carry out its last national census in 2008. There are also 24 other organisations operating there, including Save the Children and the Red Cross. Development jobs are not the only option. Last year the government announced that they wanted foreign volunteers to help teach English to North Korean tour guides at Pyongyang Tourism College. However, best to think of it as a gap year, in that you have to pay for the privilege: \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3740) a person. Juche Travel Services, which runs the service, says it is hoping to take up to five people a year.  Related: Ping pong, beach trips and intermittent Wi-Fi: life in privileged Pyongyang There are also diplomatic missions in Pyongyang, though two Europeans recently surveyed by NK News gave differing accounts on how much they were able to change during their time there. It\u2019s also possible to tick North Korea off your list without going through the rigmarole of visas and expensive tour companies by visiting the demilitarised zone (DMZ) through South Korea. The buffer between the two country has been described as a \u201cbizarre theme park\u201d on one of the most tense borders in the world. Those braving the zone will find a small blue building where it is possible to stand on North Korean soil, if only for a moment.If all else fails, you have a few other options. Use your talents: the band Laibach and the New York Philharmonic have been invited on cultural exchanges; the former NBA star Dennis Rodman has been invited to play basketball numerous times and the pro-wrestlers Jon \u201cStrongman\u201d Andersen and Bob \u201cThe Beast\u201d Sapp were invited to a event last April. You could rely on nepotism like Alessandro Ford, who became the first western student to study at Kim Il-Sung University, all arranged by his father, the former MEP Glyn Ford, who had ties with the country.

The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too.Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern.For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast.Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets.They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. Related: 'North Korean' boats carrying dead bodies wash ashore in Japan In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast.Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201dMost of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. Related: A life of luxury and adulation for Kim Jong-un impersonators With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants.In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind.But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths.Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance. If they had been found alive we would have done everything we could to help them.\u201dJiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, believes Kim sent out an order in the summer that more seafood should be provided to the army. \u201cThe problem is that the North Korean fishing industry is no longer run on socialist principles,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe fishermen realised that if they donated their catch to the military they would end up losing money, so they started allowing soldiers to go out and catch their own fish.\u201dThat meant bigger hauls, and allowed civilian fishermen to continue earning money for themselves and foreign currency for the regime under Kim\u2019s quasi-capitalist reforms.Ishimaru, who discussed the boat disappearances with contacts by phone in North Korea earlier this week, believes that large numbers of boats carrying soldiers who knew nothing about fishing or navigation left ports in North Korea soon after Kim\u2019s exhortation to increase catches.Typically small, with tiny engines and no GPS navigation instruments or VHF radios, the boats would easily have lost their way in a storm or a strong current and quickly run out of food and fuel.\u201cWhen Kim Jong-un issues an order no one can ignore it, even if he is asking them to do the impossible,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThat means inexperienced soldiers go out to sea, even in terrible conditions and with no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that they are soldiers, so they wear civilian clothes, which is why none of the bodies found in Japan was in uniform.\u201dIn Fukui, concern about the arrival of vessels from North Korea is mixed with sympathy for the people who met such wretched ends, in freezing seas many miles from home. \u201cI expect they were ordered to catch fish by the North Korean government, but of course no one there will take any responsibility for what happened to them,\u201d said Mitsumasa Sakashita, a 67-year-old fisherman in Fukui. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, because they were just like us: fishermen trying to make a living from the sea.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Fishing"], "title": "Mystery of Japan sea's ghost ships points to North Korea"},{"date": "2015-11-12T10:30:39Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A Japanese newspaper claims it has uncovered evidence that North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens under its former leader, Kim Jong-il.The Tokyo Shimbun said it had acquired a secret manual, thought to have been written in the late 1990s, that instructs spies how to carry out abductions on foreign soil and evade capture.The newspaper\u2019s report, published this week, lends weight to claims by Japan that the regime had a well-organised network of spies trained to seize foreigners, including dozens of Japanese, and that the abductions were not the work of rogue agents.Japan suspects that 17 of its citizens were snatched in the 1970s and 80s, and taken to North Korea to teach their language and customs to help agents blend in while on assignment in Japan. Related: Don't betray abductees, Tokyo warned The 356-page classified document was used at the Kim Jong-il Political-Military University, a secretive North Korean intelligence institute, the newspaper reported.According to NK News, one section coaches spies on how to conduct overseas abductions, advising them: \u201cTo abduct the target, one has to know the target\u2019s address, where the target enters and exits, day-to-day traffic routes, means of transportation and their timeline as well.\u201dIt goes on to recommend \u201cterminating\u201d targets who resist, adding that agents should not leave \u201ca single trace\u201d of evidence at the scene.The Tokyo Shimbun says the document is the first physical evidence that overseas abductions were carried out with the full knowledge and blessing of North Korea\u2019s leadership.Some, however, have questioned the document\u2019s authenticity, pointing out that the Korean word for \u201cabduction\u201d is written in a style used in South, not North, Korea. In response, the newspaper said it believed the manual was written that way to help its operatives assimilate, as South Korea was the prime target for abductions at the time.\u201cThe people involved in the story are in no doubt that the document is genuine,\u201d a Tokyo Shimbun journalist who reports on North Korea said.The Japanese government is seeking information about at least 12 people it says were abducted by North Korea. In 2002, the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, secured the release of five other abductees, who were later joined by their families, after a summit in Pyongyang with his counterpart Kim Jong-il.Japan refuses to believe North Korean claims that eight of the remaining 12 have died, some in mysterious accidents, and the other four had never entered the country. The missing abductees include Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she was snatched on her way home from school in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, in 1977.North Korea claimed that Yokota had killed herself in 1994 while being treated in hospital for depression. But tests on her alleged remains conducted in Japan in 2004 showed they contained someone else\u2019s DNA. Japanese experts also found inconsistencies in her death certificate.Yokota is thought to have been taken to a spy training facility in Pyongyang soon after she arrived in North Korea. Kyodo News recently quoted a South Korean source as saying that she studied Korean for about three years and then taught Japanese until the mid-1980s. She married a South Korean abductee, with whom she had a daughter.Talks between the two countries on resolving the remaining abductions broke down after making no progress. Japan says it will not normalise diplomatic ties with Pyongyang until the abductions have been resolved. It is unclear how the manual could help Japanese negotiators at any future talks, however, as it was written at least 15 years ago.\u201cBut the families of the abductees and their supporters can now point to this document as proof that North Korea systematically organised the abductions,\u201d the Tokyo Shimbun reporter said. \u201cThat will enable them to put pressure on the Japanese government to do more to settle the matter.\u201d ", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens, Japanese paper claims"},{"date": "2015-10-09T14:59:49Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "So you want to go to North Korea?

Believe it or not, it is not that hard to visit one of the most repressive, hermetically sealed countries in the world.Unlike Eritrea, Sudan and to a certain extent Angola, North Korea has a modest but established market catering for tourists. Culture vultures can choose from an array of architecture- or film-based trips. Adrenaline junkies can try their hand at extreme sports. The regime opened a multimillion-pound ski resort last year \u2013 commemorated with its own stamp collection \u2013 and this summer the first tourists rode the waves of the country\u2019s east coast beaches. Want to run a marathon with a difference? This is also possible in North Korea, where tourists were permitted to enter the Pyongyang Marathon for the second year in a row, as long as they completed the course under four hours.There are also specific excursions tailored around moments of civic pride such as the 70th anniversary of the formation of the Korean Workers\u2019 party, this Saturday. Young Pioneer Tours, which specialises in \u201cbudget tours to destinations your mother wants you stay away from\u201d, promises \u201cmass dancing, fireworks and a military parade\u201d.The Arirang Mass Games, used to be another show-stopping fixture in the country. But the event has not taken place for the last few years, reportedly because North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, wants to improve the country\u2019s sporting prowess first. For football fans, the time to start thinking about World Cup 2026 could be now \u2013 North Korea also has ambitions to host the Olympics. The first thing to say about North Korean travel is that it isn\u2019t cheap, with the average tour costing about \u00a31,000. Young Pioneer Tours, the budget end of the market, was charging \u00a3700 for a seven-day tour during the party\u2019s 70th anniversary celebrations. Koryo Tours, which is used by 40% of all tourists to North Korea, is charging \u00a31,140 for five nights. Most tour companies will help customers arrange their visas but it is also possible to apply for one through your nearest North Korean embassy. According to the listings site Embassy Pages, Pyongyang has diplomatic missions in 48 countries, from Syria to Berne in Switzerland, where the teenage Kim went to boarding school.While entry by train through the border of China is possible, most people travel in on Air Koryo\u2019s Soviet-era fleet of planes. North Korea\u2019s national carrier, which was recently voted the world\u2019s worst airline for the fourth time in a row, is banned from entering European airspace owing to safety concerns.Testimonies from tourists are revealing: \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough seats, so they made the locals share two seats between three with insufficient seat belts. The cabin crew all stood up on take off and clung on for dear life. They then served glasses of beer to everyone at 8am and gave out copies of the Pyongyang Times,\u201d said one traveller on Koryo Tours\u2019 Facebook account. Another talked of officials with no assigned seats smoking through the journey. \u201cThe inflight videos were also huge propaganda movies about war and sporting achievements.\u201d Air China also flies into Pyongyang, which has recently had a revamp, although the internet room at the airport was found to be missing a key element: the internet. North Korea is technically still at war with the South and simmering tensions on the peninsula can erupt at a moment\u2019s notice, though visitors are not usually affected. In August an escalation of events \u2013 sparked by a landmine explosion near the border between the two \u2013 led Kim to announce that North Korea was on an official war footing. Blustering tensions were ultimately resolved through marathon diplomatic talks. Through all this, a group of South Korean footballers was in Pyongyang for a tournament and the avant-garde Slovenian rockers Laibach was there performing, becoming the first western band to play in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).There are isolated cases of western tourists being arrested, such as the Americans Matthew Miller, who ripped up his passport and tried to \u201cclaim asylum\u201d, and Jeffrey Fowle, who left a Bible in a nightclub. Tourists should note that Bibles are banned in North Korea and although its constitution guarantees freedom of religion, the reality is a county ranked as the worst in the world in terms of persecution of Christians, with those who practise openly facing heavy penalties. But as tour companies state on their webistes, they regularly take people without incident.The US State Department strongly recommends against all travel to North Korea and the UK Foreign Office warns of the unpredictability of the country. The FCO ask all British citizens to register with the British embassy in Pyongyang and warn that it has limited reach outside the capital. You\u2019ve got the money sorted and completed your personal risk assessment but there is a bigger issue at stake: is it ethical? Yes, you fulfil your garish ambitions but are you also complicit in propping up a monstrous regime? Related: Tourists are propaganda: how ethical is your North Korean holiday? Hyeonseo Lee, a defector who escaped North Korea in 1997, finds it hard to fathom why tour companies fully aware of the regime\u2019s atrocities would take people there. Tour companies and others organisations that run exchanges with North Korea argue that gradual interaction with the outside world may be effective in opening up the country and poking holes in the regime.You can get around the ethical conundrum by keeping an eye on the job vacancies of development organisations that operate in the country. However, you\u2019ll have your work cut out: North Korea is not only politically oppressed but it is also blighted by natural disaster and famine. The United Nations has six agencies based there, working with the government to \u201cimprove the quality of life of the people [and] ensure sustainable development\u201d. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), for example, runs a midwifery programme and helped the country carry out its last national census in 2008. There are also 24 other organisations operating there, including Save the Children and the Red Cross. Development jobs are not the only option. Last year the government announced that they wanted foreign volunteers to help teach English to North Korean tour guides at Pyongyang Tourism College. However, best to think of it as a gap year, in that you have to pay for the privilege: \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3740) a person. Juche Travel Services, which runs the service, says it is hoping to take up to five people a year.  Related: Ping pong, beach trips and intermittent Wi-Fi: life in privileged Pyongyang There are also diplomatic missions in Pyongyang, though two Europeans recently surveyed by NK News gave differing accounts on how much they were able to change during their time there. It\u2019s also possible to tick North Korea off your list without going through the rigmarole of visas and expensive tour companies by visiting the demilitarised zone (DMZ) through South Korea. The buffer between the two country has been described as a \u201cbizarre theme park\u201d on one of the most tense borders in the world. Those braving the zone will find a small blue building where it is possible to stand on North Korean soil, if only for a moment.If all else fails, you have a few other options. Use your talents: the band Laibach and the New York Philharmonic have been invited on cultural exchanges; the former NBA star Dennis Rodman has been invited to play basketball numerous times and the pro-wrestlers Jon \u201cStrongman\u201d Andersen and Bob \u201cThe Beast\u201d Sapp were invited to a event last April. You could rely on nepotism like Alessandro Ford, who became the first western student to study at Kim Il-Sung University, all arranged by his father, the former MEP Glyn Ford, who had ties with the country.

The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too.Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern.For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast.Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets.They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. Related: 'North Korean' boats carrying dead bodies wash ashore in Japan In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast.Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201dMost of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. Related: A life of luxury and adulation for Kim Jong-un impersonators With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants.In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind.But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths.Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance.

Her images hint at the reality of everyday life for women in the secretive state. \u201cWhen you hear things about North Korea it is always political,\u201d Noroc explains. \u201cBut my idea was to show another side, to show regular people.\u201dNoroc entered the country via Sinuiju, on the border with China, on a trip organised by Young Pioneer Tours, a company offering visits for foreigners on a tight budget. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice big differences between the people living in the capital and people in other cities \u2013 but of course in Pyongyang, with its large boulevards, there were more people, and so I discovered many more interesting faces.\u201dNoroc explains: \u201cI approached women in the street, accompanied by my two female guides, who helped me explain my project \u2013 this was the routine for most of the portraits.\u201cIn most countries I\u2019ve observed that women smile in front of the camera and that tended to be the case when I shot women in North Korea \u2013 but I here I tried to find something more profound, to get them to open up and reveal something more authentic, to see a story in their eyes.\u201dThough women in North Korea might be unfamiliar with global fashion and beauty because of the regime\u2019s tight control on the flow of information, Noroc noted that this doesn\u2019t mean they are not concerned with their appearance: high heels and conservative outfits \u2013 accessorised with a pin of the chest of their country\u2019s leader \u2013 are common.\u201cWomen [in the DPRK] are definitely more concerned about their looks.\u201cOf course, you could say that is the case in many countries, but in North Korea I felt the gap was much wider in how men and women relate to their physical appearance.\u201d Access to the internet or foreign television is almost nonexistent in the country \u2013 so entertainment must take different forms. Noroc noted that people loved to sing and dance, with concerts in public squares and mass dances for celebrations. The Moranbong Band, an all-female music group whose members were selected by the country\u2019s supreme leader Kim Jong-un, are \u201chugely popular, a phenomenon,\u201d the photographer says. \u201cYou hear their songs everywhere and everyone knows their lyrics \u2013 this singer [pictured below] also sang some of their songs. I also saw a military marching band performing one of their songs.\u201dNoroc was in the country for nine days, and was accompanied by guides most of the time \u2013 \u201cbut not on trains or inside hotels.\u201cI did see other tourists, not many, but since you visit the same places and sleep at the same hotels, you inevitably do see some. My tour was different in that I was able to walk in the streets a lot, and meet many regular North Korean people.\u201d Uniforms are also a very common sight on both men and women. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s army is huge, so it\u2019s common to see military workers on the streets. Soldiers are sometimes involved in other activities such as construction work, for example, so they\u2019re really everywhere.\u201d\u201cEverybody was telling us that in North Korea they have a saying: \u2018North Korea has the most beautiful women in the peninsula, while South Korea [has] the most beautiful men\u2019.\u201dDespite the unusual nature of Noroc\u2019s project \u2013 and the restrictions placed on North Korean citizens \u2013 the photographer found that women were remarkably willing to take part and seemed happy to have their picture taken. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for them to have their picture taken by foreigners. They were really excited when I was showing them the photos on the screen of my camera.\u201d  Noroc is currently travelling in Nepal for her next series of photographs.

Believe it or not, it is not that hard to visit one of the most repressive, hermetically sealed countries in the world.Unlike Eritrea, Sudan and to a certain extent Angola, North Korea has a modest but established market catering for tourists. Culture vultures can choose from an array of architecture- or film-based trips. Adrenaline junkies can try their hand at extreme sports. The regime opened a multimillion-pound ski resort last year \u2013 commemorated with its own stamp collection \u2013 and this summer the first tourists rode the waves of the country\u2019s east coast beaches. Want to run a marathon with a difference? This is also possible in North Korea, where tourists were permitted to enter the Pyongyang Marathon for the second year in a row, as long as they completed the course under four hours.There are also specific excursions tailored around moments of civic pride such as the 70th anniversary of the formation of the Korean Workers\u2019 party, this Saturday. Young Pioneer Tours, which specialises in \u201cbudget tours to destinations your mother wants you stay away from\u201d, promises \u201cmass dancing, fireworks and a military parade\u201d.The Arirang Mass Games, used to be another show-stopping fixture in the country. But the event has not taken place for the last few years, reportedly because North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, wants to improve the country\u2019s sporting prowess first. For football fans, the time to start thinking about World Cup 2026 could be now \u2013 North Korea also has ambitions to host the Olympics. The first thing to say about North Korean travel is that it isn\u2019t cheap, with the average tour costing about \u00a31,000. Young Pioneer Tours, the budget end of the market, was charging \u00a3700 for a seven-day tour during the party\u2019s 70th anniversary celebrations. Koryo Tours, which is used by 40% of all tourists to North Korea, is charging \u00a31,140 for five nights. Most tour companies will help customers arrange their visas but it is also possible to apply for one through your nearest North Korean embassy. According to the listings site Embassy Pages, Pyongyang has diplomatic missions in 48 countries, from Syria to Berne in Switzerland, where the teenage Kim went to boarding school.While entry by train through the border of China is possible, most people travel in on Air Koryo\u2019s Soviet-era fleet of planes. North Korea\u2019s national carrier, which was recently voted the world\u2019s worst airline for the fourth time in a row, is banned from entering European airspace owing to safety concerns.Testimonies from tourists are revealing: \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough seats, so they made the locals share two seats between three with insufficient seat belts. The cabin crew all stood up on take off and clung on for dear life. They then served glasses of beer to everyone at 8am and gave out copies of the Pyongyang Times,\u201d said one traveller on Koryo Tours\u2019 Facebook account. Another talked of officials with no assigned seats smoking through the journey. \u201cThe inflight videos were also huge propaganda movies about war and sporting achievements.\u201d Air China also flies into Pyongyang, which has recently had a revamp, although the internet room at the airport was found to be missing a key element: the internet. North Korea is technically still at war with the South and simmering tensions on the peninsula can erupt at a moment\u2019s notice, though visitors are not usually affected. In August an escalation of events \u2013 sparked by a landmine explosion near the border between the two \u2013 led Kim to announce that North Korea was on an official war footing. Blustering tensions were ultimately resolved through marathon diplomatic talks. Through all this, a group of South Korean footballers was in Pyongyang for a tournament and the avant-garde Slovenian rockers Laibach was there performing, becoming the first western band to play in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).There are isolated cases of western tourists being arrested, such as the Americans Matthew Miller, who ripped up his passport and tried to \u201cclaim asylum\u201d, and Jeffrey Fowle, who left a Bible in a nightclub. Tourists should note that Bibles are banned in North Korea and although its constitution guarantees freedom of religion, the reality is a county ranked as the worst in the world in terms of persecution of Christians, with those who practise openly facing heavy penalties. But as tour companies state on their webistes, they regularly take people without incident.The US State Department strongly recommends against all travel to North Korea and the UK Foreign Office warns of the unpredictability of the country. The FCO ask all British citizens to register with the British embassy in Pyongyang and warn that it has limited reach outside the capital. You\u2019ve got the money sorted and completed your personal risk assessment but there is a bigger issue at stake: is it ethical? Yes, you fulfil your garish ambitions but are you also complicit in propping up a monstrous regime? Related: Tourists are propaganda: how ethical is your North Korean holiday? Hyeonseo Lee, a defector who escaped North Korea in 1997, finds it hard to fathom why tour companies fully aware of the regime\u2019s atrocities would take people there. Tour companies and others organisations that run exchanges with North Korea argue that gradual interaction with the outside world may be effective in opening up the country and poking holes in the regime.You can get around the ethical conundrum by keeping an eye on the job vacancies of development organisations that operate in the country. However, you\u2019ll have your work cut out: North Korea is not only politically oppressed but it is also blighted by natural disaster and famine. The United Nations has six agencies based there, working with the government to \u201cimprove the quality of life of the people [and] ensure sustainable development\u201d. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), for example, runs a midwifery programme and helped the country carry out its last national census in 2008. There are also 24 other organisations operating there, including Save the Children and the Red Cross. Development jobs are not the only option. Last year the government announced that they wanted foreign volunteers to help teach English to North Korean tour guides at Pyongyang Tourism College. However, best to think of it as a gap year, in that you have to pay for the privilege: \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3740) a person. Juche Travel Services, which runs the service, says it is hoping to take up to five people a year.  Related: Ping pong, beach trips and intermittent Wi-Fi: life in privileged Pyongyang There are also diplomatic missions in Pyongyang, though two Europeans recently surveyed by NK News gave differing accounts on how much they were able to change during their time there. It\u2019s also possible to tick North Korea off your list without going through the rigmarole of visas and expensive tour companies by visiting the demilitarised zone (DMZ) through South Korea. The buffer between the two country has been described as a \u201cbizarre theme park\u201d on one of the most tense borders in the world. Those braving the zone will find a small blue building where it is possible to stand on North Korean soil, if only for a moment.If all else fails, you have a few other options. Use your talents: the band Laibach and the New York Philharmonic have been invited on cultural exchanges; the former NBA star Dennis Rodman has been invited to play basketball numerous times and the pro-wrestlers Jon \u201cStrongman\u201d Andersen and Bob \u201cThe Beast\u201d Sapp were invited to a event last April. You could rely on nepotism like Alessandro Ford, who became the first western student to study at Kim Il-Sung University, all arranged by his father, the former MEP Glyn Ford, who had ties with the country. Or try to arrange a tour through one of the small Korean Friendship Associations dotted around the world. It\u2019s the \u201conly gate[way] for successful and effective commerce with [the] government guarantee[d]\u201d, says the website. The catch? You might have to pledge allegiance to the Kim regime.

The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too.Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern.For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast.Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets.They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. Related: 'North Korean' boats carrying dead bodies wash ashore in Japan In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast.Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201dMost of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. Related: A life of luxury and adulation for Kim Jong-un impersonators With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants.In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind.But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths.Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance. If they had been found alive we would have done everything we could to help them.\u201dJiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, believes Kim sent out an order in the summer that more seafood should be provided to the army. \u201cThe problem is that the North Korean fishing industry is no longer run on socialist principles,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe fishermen realised that if they donated their catch to the military they would end up losing money, so they started allowing soldiers to go out and catch their own fish.\u201dThat meant bigger hauls, and allowed civilian fishermen to continue earning money for themselves and foreign currency for the regime under Kim\u2019s quasi-capitalist reforms.Ishimaru, who discussed the boat disappearances with contacts by phone in North Korea earlier this week, believes that large numbers of boats carrying soldiers who knew nothing about fishing or navigation left ports in North Korea soon after Kim\u2019s exhortation to increase catches.Typically small, with tiny engines and no GPS navigation instruments or VHF radios, the boats would easily have lost their way in a storm or a strong current and quickly run out of food and fuel.\u201cWhen Kim Jong-un issues an order no one can ignore it, even if he is asking them to do the impossible,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThat means inexperienced soldiers go out to sea, even in terrible conditions and with no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that they are soldiers, so they wear civilian clothes, which is why none of the bodies found in Japan was in uniform.\u201dIn Fukui, concern about the arrival of vessels from North Korea is mixed with sympathy for the people who met such wretched ends, in freezing seas many miles from home. \u201cI expect they were ordered to catch fish by the North Korean government, but of course no one there will take any responsibility for what happened to them,\u201d said Mitsumasa Sakashita, a 67-year-old fisherman in Fukui. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, because they were just like us: fishermen trying to make a living from the sea.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Fishing"], "title": "Mystery of Japan sea's ghost ships points to North Korea"},{"date": "2015-11-12T10:30:39Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A Japanese newspaper claims it has uncovered evidence that North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens under its former leader, Kim Jong-il.The Tokyo Shimbun said it had acquired a secret manual, thought to have been written in the late 1990s, that instructs spies how to carry out abductions on foreign soil and evade capture.The newspaper\u2019s report, published this week, lends weight to claims by Japan that the regime had a well-organised network of spies trained to seize foreigners, including dozens of Japanese, and that the abductions were not the work of rogue agents.Japan suspects that 17 of its citizens were snatched in the 1970s and 80s, and taken to North Korea to teach their language and customs to help agents blend in while on assignment in Japan. Related: Don't betray abductees, Tokyo warned The 356-page classified document was used at the Kim Jong-il Political-Military University, a secretive North Korean intelligence institute, the newspaper reported.According to NK News, one section coaches spies on how to conduct overseas abductions, advising them: \u201cTo abduct the target, one has to know the target\u2019s address, where the target enters and exits, day-to-day traffic routes, means of transportation and their timeline as well.\u201dIt goes on to recommend \u201cterminating\u201d targets who resist, adding that agents should not leave \u201ca single trace\u201d of evidence at the scene.The Tokyo Shimbun says the document is the first physical evidence that overseas abductions were carried out with the full knowledge and blessing of North Korea\u2019s leadership.Some, however, have questioned the document\u2019s authenticity, pointing out that the Korean word for \u201cabduction\u201d is written in a style used in South, not North, Korea. In response, the newspaper said it believed the manual was written that way to help its operatives assimilate, as South Korea was the prime target for abductions at the time.\u201cThe people involved in the story are in no doubt that the document is genuine,\u201d a Tokyo Shimbun journalist who reports on North Korea said.The Japanese government is seeking information about at least 12 people it says were abducted by North Korea. In 2002, the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, secured the release of five other abductees, who were later joined by their families, after a summit in Pyongyang with his counterpart Kim Jong-il.Japan refuses to believe North Korean claims that eight of the remaining 12 have died, some in mysterious accidents, and the other four had never entered the country. The missing abductees include Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she was snatched on her way home from school in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, in 1977.North Korea claimed that Yokota had killed herself in 1994 while being treated in hospital for depression. But tests on her alleged remains conducted in Japan in 2004 showed they contained someone else\u2019s DNA. Japanese experts also found inconsistencies in her death certificate.Yokota is thought to have been taken to a spy training facility in Pyongyang soon after she arrived in North Korea. Kyodo News recently quoted a South Korean source as saying that she studied Korean for about three years and then taught Japanese until the mid-1980s. She married a South Korean abductee, with whom she had a daughter.Talks between the two countries on resolving the remaining abductions broke down after making no progress. Japan says it will not normalise diplomatic ties with Pyongyang until the abductions have been resolved. It is unclear how the manual could help Japanese negotiators at any future talks, however, as it was written at least 15 years ago.\u201cBut the families of the abductees and their supporters can now point to this document as proof that North Korea systematically organised the abductions,\u201d the Tokyo Shimbun reporter said. \u201cThat will enable them to put pressure on the Japanese government to do more to settle the matter.\u201d ", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens, Japanese paper claims"},{"date": "2015-11-10T06:00:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korean households are facing a winter without their traditional supply of kimchi after a year in which droughts and then floods have affected vegetable harvests. As the kimjang season begins, when the fermented cabbage dish is made to last families though the winter, market prices for radishes and cabbages are escalating. Even ingredients such as chillies, garlic, onions and salt used for seasoning are in short supply, say sources inside the country.Harvests from collective farms are expected to have halved because of the effects of the adverse weather conditions, a source said, with residents fearing that household allocations will be considerably lower than last year. \u201cAt Chongjin\u2019s Sunam Market, 1kg of cabbage now goes for 3,000 North Korean won ($0.35), which is up 1,000 won from before,\u201d a source said. \u201cRadish prices have climbed by 500 won but they\u2019re still selling at a rapid pace,\u201d the source added. \u201cIf people see someone with radishes and cabbages on an ox cart going by, they will chase after it and offer a higher price to buy the produce, creating a scene.\u201d \u201cBack in August, a lot of vegetable fields in the Hamgyong Provinces and parts of Yanggang were lost to extreme downpours,\u201d she said, \u201cso a lot of households are giving up on kimjang for the year.\u201dCentral authorities have prioritised supply for the Rason area, which was particularly hit hard by devastatingly torrential rains, meaning some other regions have not received a single head of cabbage.

If we assume each of the estimated 26,000 North Korean refugees has left behind a four-member household, 104,000 people could benefit. The refugee participants are already able to raise the necessary funds through local humanitarian groups. All that is needed is for the international community, including NGOs and civil societies, to advocate for both Korean governments to authorise this project.The North Korean government may not want to include any refugees in these projects, which will lead some in South Korea to argue that they should not be pursued. But we should persist. The refugees are integral. There is no group of people more saddened by the situation in North Korea, and no group more willing to take part.Obstacles are to be expected, but this project represents the kinds of exchanges that should be actively promoted.Dr Kim Kwang-cheol is a former researcher at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a South Korean government institute which studies/creates policy for inter-Korean affairsDuring my first trip to Pyongyang in 2005, there was insignificant incident that taught me volumes about North Korea\u2019s attitudes to the outside world.My travelling companion stopped to take a photograph of two young children walking along the side of the road. He then leaned over to show them the photos on the digital camera screen (this was pre-smartphones).The North Korean minders escorting us were furious, which perplexed me because the children were well-dressed and well-fed and obviously delighted to see their own images on screen for what was probably the first time.I realised later that the North Korean guides didn\u2019t mind us seeing the children as much as the children seeing us. Here we were two American journalists, unintimidating and in possession of what North Koreans at the time looked like magic \u2013 seeing us irreparably corrupted them.Among the many falsehoods in the North Korean firmament is that they are an advanced, prosperous nation. \u201cWe have nothing to envy in this world,\u201d goes an old ditty sung in nurseries . Anything that belies the claim is corrosive to the regime.And anti-Americanism is the force that gives meaning to the North Korea\u2019s very existence. Americans are supposed to be the great enemy Meeguk nom , \u201cAmerican bastards,\u201d as they say in the state media.But whenever North Koreans meet real live Americans (or other foreigners, as American applies broadly to Europeans), a good impression can chip away at a lifetime of brainwashing.I get frequent emails from western tourists wondering if it is unethical to support a repressive regime by visiting North Korea.I give them always an unequivocal answer. By all means, yes, go. If you are sympathetic to North Korea, visiting the place is the best way to engage. If you hate the regime and wish to hasten its demise, the advice is the same. Go to North Korea. Either way, it is a no-lose proposition.Barbara Demick is the author of the critcally acclaimed novel Nothing to Envy, which charts the lives of six North Korean citizens living in the north-eastern city of ChongjinEuropean states, including the UK, have had a policy of \u201ccritical engagement\u201d with North Korea for the last decade, actively engaging the country but criticising its behaviour at the same time.But what difference has it made? The nuclear issue remains unresolved and the human rights crisis continues to deteriorate. Nor did it engage with North Korea\u2019s informal market economy, which has fed the people since the ruling party\u2019s economy collapsed in the 90s. This developed, in spite of any diplomatic policy, as North Koreans acted spontaneously in an attempt to survive.The problem with \u201ccritical engagement\u201d is that it engaged with a totalitarian regime, and chose not to engage with the people and nation underneath it. North Korea was approached as if it was a single entity, and the political administration was prioritised over the individual. By doing so, it sided with the oppressor.Even the threat of sanctions and other forms of \u201cpressure\u201d have not induced change. To be effective, they need to target the regime\u2019s internal raison d\u2019etre and source of power. This is the deliberate prioritisation of resources, and manpower, to maintain the cult of the Supreme Leader \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s the political elite who manage this cult.The frenzied response from North Korean diplomats to the suggestion that the Supreme Leader be referred to the international criminal court for crimes against humanity confirmed that this regime\u2019s institutional sensitivity \u2013 and vulnerability \u2013 is to protecting the cult of Kim at all costs. As such, future North Korean policy must rest on the premise of \u201cseparative engagement\u201d, recognising that the state and people have not been of one interest, and that those maintaining the current political administration are not the only North Koreans with a stake in North Korea. Jang Jin-sung was one of Kim Jong-il\u2019s favourite propaganda poets until his high profile defection from North Korea in 2004Michael P Spavor: \u2018Dennis Rodman\u2019s basketball trips help\u2019Basketball player Dennis Rodman\u2019s 2013 and 2014 visits to the DPRK, in which I played a coordinating role, some might consider, are the best-known recent examples of cultural engagement with the country. Like most things involving the DPRK they were certainly not free from controversy.  Critics said the presence of Rodman was an exercise designed to burnish the reputation of the leadership and raised questions over the wider impact of such visits. But if one understands how the country operates, you\u2019ll see that even high-level contact can have positive effects. As a regular traveller to many parts of the DPRK, through my work arranging cultural, academic and business exchanges, I have been able to assess how the Rodman visits went down amongst the wider population. It went far beyond the larger-than-life personalities covered by the media. The fact that their leader Kim Jong-un was widely seen in national media spending time with an American caught young people\u2019s imagination. \u201cOur leader wants peace and made friends with Mr Rodman, an American, I also would like to be friends with Americans some day,\u201d one 13-year-old said to me in rural North Korea, not far from the Chinese border. This statement \u2013 and I have heard similar opinions voiced across the country in the past two years \u2013 is instructive in two regards, one specific and one general. Firstly, it is important to recognise that young people in the DPRK are raised with, to put it mildly, a negative view of the US and it western allies, making an expression friendship with an American is far more significant than if it came from elsewhere. Related: Dennis Rodman to go back to North Korea \u2013 again  The second broader point is about the impact of meetings between the country\u2019s leadership and representatives from western countries, be it in sport or business \u2013 and I attest that the former can serve as a springboard for the latter. The DPRK is a country where the symbolic activities of the leadership serve a vital role in public life. This is not to say that Koreans are robots who can simply be told what to think (another common misconception) but if they see positive events, such as a friendly symbolic basketball game between the DRPK and an American team, then these conclusions are very likely to be mostly positive. At present we are limited in the ways we can engage. But an understanding of how the DPRK operates should encourage us to provide the country, and most importantly its young people, with clear signs of our positive intentions.Michael Spavor runs cultural exchanges and business tours to North Korea and is known to be close with Kim Jong-unPeople either think that nothing is happening in North Korea, or there is a single monolith of activity that controls everything. The reality is, of course, more complicated.I would love it if people could start thinking about North Korea less as a single system and more as a country with 24 million individuals, many of whom are pragmatic people, keen to run things more efficiently \u2013 either at a micro or macro level. It isn\u2019t really up to us how the country develops \u2013 it\u2019s up to the North Koreans. But if we are able to support the right people, their voices become more prominent and can help improve the range of options in the mix.The non-profit I work for, Choson Exchange, has trained more than 1,000 North Koreans since 2010, who have an insatiable thirst for business and economics knowledge. We\u2019ve taught participants how to improve communications and marketing; we\u2019ve worked with women interested in developing business skills and advised the country\u2019s economists on the special economic zone policy \u2013 a good idea, but missing key elements to make it attractive investment destination.If these exchanges didn\u2019t exist the North Koreans we work with would lack the context to evaluate their own situation and internal discussions would be narrower.It\u2019s still a very challenging environment to operate in, but the other option \u2013 ignoring or actively trying to isolate them, leads to worse outcomes. It is, after all, already a country very good at turning inward.Andray Abrahamian is director of Choson Exchange, a Singaporean non-profit that trains North Koreans in entrepreneurship, economic policy and law.Gareth Johnson: \u2018Tourism can change perceptions and prejudices\u2019We get a lot of flak for taking tourists into North Korea, criticism we\u2019ve received online ranges from reasonable debate to name calling and threats. The question of whether there should be tourism in the DPRK is something we regularly think about and a question we\u2019re often required to answer.The most common charge against tourism is that it \u201cprops up the regime\u201d. This is wrong. Tourism accounts for a minuscule portion of the national economy. If tourism stops, as it did during last year\u2019s Ebola scare, the country still functions as normal. Other critics argue that all the money from tourism goes to the government, but the DPRK is a socialist country and almost all its inhabitants are employed by the state. The money from tourism doesn\u2019t employ soldiers, it supports tour guides, waiters and hotel staff \u2013 normal people with everyday aspirations. Personally, I believe that social, personal and cultural interaction between people of different countries \u2013 particularly when their governments don\u2019t get along \u2013 is always a positive. Since its division from the South, the DPRK has been on a war footing, with all the government-led propaganda that comes with such a situation. When I bring tourists into the DPRK, I feel proud to see them interacting with local people, breaking down barriers and learning about each others\u2019 cultures. This is the real deal, changing deeply ingrained perceptions and prejudices at the grassroots. In addition, while people are happy to use phrases such as \u201chermit kingdom\u201d and the \u201cmost isolated place on earth\u201d when the country tries to slightly open up, for things like the recent Laibach concert, it\u2019s criticised for it not being enough. If we want North Korea to join the global community, we have to embrace any steps the country takes, and accept that tourism is part of that process. You can\u2019t have it both ways.Gareth Johnson is the director of Young Pioneer tours, specialists in budget travel to North Korea", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Dennis Rodman"], "title": "How should the world engage with North Korea?"},{"date": "2015-10-09T14:59:49Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "So you want to go to North Korea? Believe it or not, it is not that hard to visit one of the most repressive, hermetically sealed countries in the world.Unlike Eritrea, Sudan and to a certain extent Angola, North Korea has a modest but established market catering for tourists. Culture vultures can choose from an array of architecture- or film-based trips. Adrenaline junkies can try their hand at extreme sports. The regime opened a multimillion-pound ski resort last year \u2013 commemorated with its own stamp collection \u2013 and this summer the first tourists rode the waves of the country\u2019s east coast beaches. Want to run a marathon with a difference? This is also possible in North Korea, where tourists were permitted to enter the Pyongyang Marathon for the second year in a row, as long as they completed the course under four hours.There are also specific excursions tailored around moments of civic pride such as the 70th anniversary of the formation of the Korean Workers\u2019 party, this Saturday. Young Pioneer Tours, which specialises in \u201cbudget tours to destinations your mother wants you stay away from\u201d, promises \u201cmass dancing, fireworks and a military parade\u201d.The Arirang Mass Games, used to be another show-stopping fixture in the country. But the event has not taken place for the last few years, reportedly because North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, wants to improve the country\u2019s sporting prowess first. For football fans, the time to start thinking about World Cup 2026 could be now \u2013 North Korea also has ambitions to host the Olympics. The first thing to say about North Korean travel is that it isn\u2019t cheap, with the average tour costing about \u00a31,000. Young Pioneer Tours, the budget end of the market, was charging \u00a3700 for a seven-day tour during the party\u2019s 70th anniversary celebrations. Koryo Tours, which is used by 40% of all tourists to North Korea, is charging \u00a31,140 for five nights. Most tour companies will help customers arrange their visas but it is also possible to apply for one through your nearest North Korean embassy. According to the listings site Embassy Pages, Pyongyang has diplomatic missions in 48 countries, from Syria to Berne in Switzerland, where the teenage Kim went to boarding school.While entry by train through the border of China is possible, most people travel in on Air Koryo\u2019s Soviet-era fleet of planes. North Korea\u2019s national carrier, which was recently voted the world\u2019s worst airline for the fourth time in a row, is banned from entering European airspace owing to safety concerns.Testimonies from tourists are revealing: \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough seats, so they made the locals share two seats between three with insufficient seat belts. The cabin crew all stood up on take off and clung on for dear life. They then served glasses of beer to everyone at 8am and gave out copies of the Pyongyang Times,\u201d said one traveller on Koryo Tours\u2019 Facebook account. Another talked of officials with no assigned seats smoking through the journey. \u201cThe inflight videos were also huge propaganda movies about war and sporting achievements.\u201d Air China also flies into Pyongyang, which has recently had a revamp, although the internet room at the airport was found to be missing a key element: the internet. North Korea is technically still at war with the South and simmering tensions on the peninsula can erupt at a moment\u2019s notice, though visitors are not usually affected. In August an escalation of events \u2013 sparked by a landmine explosion near the border between the two \u2013 led Kim to announce that North Korea was on an official war footing. Blustering tensions were ultimately resolved through marathon diplomatic talks. Through all this, a group of South Korean footballers was in Pyongyang for a tournament and the avant-garde Slovenian rockers Laibach was there performing, becoming the first western band to play in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).There are isolated cases of western tourists being arrested, such as the Americans Matthew Miller, who ripped up his passport and tried to \u201cclaim asylum\u201d, and Jeffrey Fowle, who left a Bible in a nightclub. Tourists should note that Bibles are banned in North Korea and although its constitution guarantees freedom of religion, the reality is a county ranked as the worst in the world in terms of persecution of Christians, with those who practise openly facing heavy penalties. But as tour companies state on their webistes, they regularly take people without incident.The US State Department strongly recommends against all travel to North Korea and the UK Foreign Office warns of the unpredictability of the country. The FCO ask all British citizens to register with the British embassy in Pyongyang and warn that it has limited reach outside the capital. You\u2019ve got the money sorted and completed your personal risk assessment but there is a bigger issue at stake: is it ethical? Yes, you fulfil your garish ambitions but are you also complicit in propping up a monstrous regime? Related: Tourists are propaganda: how ethical is your North Korean holiday? Hyeonseo Lee, a defector who escaped North Korea in 1997, finds it hard to fathom why tour companies fully aware of the regime\u2019s atrocities would take people there. Tour companies and others organisations that run exchanges with North Korea argue that gradual interaction with the outside world may be effective in opening up the country and poking holes in the regime.You can get around the ethical conundrum by keeping an eye on the job vacancies of development organisations that operate in the country. However, you\u2019ll have your work cut out: North Korea is not only politically oppressed but it is also blighted by natural disaster and famine. The United Nations has six agencies based there, working with the government to \u201cimprove the quality of life of the people [and] ensure sustainable development\u201d. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), for example, runs a midwifery programme and helped the country carry out its last national census in 2008. There are also 24 other organisations operating there, including Save the Children and the Red Cross. Development jobs are not the only option. Last year the government announced that they wanted foreign volunteers to help teach English to North Korean tour guides at Pyongyang Tourism College. However, best to think of it as a gap year, in that you have to pay for the privilege: \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3740) a person. Juche Travel Services, which runs the service, says it is hoping to take up to five people a year.  Related: Ping pong, beach trips and intermittent Wi-Fi: life in privileged Pyongyang There are also diplomatic missions in Pyongyang, though two Europeans recently surveyed by NK News gave differing accounts on how much they were able to change during their time there. It\u2019s also possible to tick North Korea off your list without going through the rigmarole of visas and expensive tour companies by visiting the demilitarised zone (DMZ) through South Korea. The buffer between the two country has been described as a \u201cbizarre theme park\u201d on one of the most tense borders in the world. Those braving the zone will find a small blue building where it is possible to stand on North Korean soil, if only for a moment.If all else fails, you have a few other options. Use your talents: the band Laibach and the New York Philharmonic have been invited on cultural exchanges; the former NBA star Dennis Rodman has been invited to play basketball numerous times and the pro-wrestlers Jon \u201cStrongman\u201d Andersen and Bob \u201cThe Beast\u201d Sapp were invited to a event last April.

The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too.Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern.For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast.Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets.They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. Related: 'North Korean' boats carrying dead bodies wash ashore in Japan In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast.Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201dMost of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. Related: A life of luxury and adulation for Kim Jong-un impersonators With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants.In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind.But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths.Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance. If they had been found alive we would have done everything we could to help them.\u201dJiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, believes Kim sent out an order in the summer that more seafood should be provided to the army. \u201cThe problem is that the North Korean fishing industry is no longer run on socialist principles,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe fishermen realised that if they donated their catch to the military they would end up losing money, so they started allowing soldiers to go out and catch their own fish.\u201dThat meant bigger hauls, and allowed civilian fishermen to continue earning money for themselves and foreign currency for the regime under Kim\u2019s quasi-capitalist reforms.Ishimaru, who discussed the boat disappearances with contacts by phone in North Korea earlier this week, believes that large numbers of boats carrying soldiers who knew nothing about fishing or navigation left ports in North Korea soon after Kim\u2019s exhortation to increase catches.Typically small, with tiny engines and no GPS navigation instruments or VHF radios, the boats would easily have lost their way in a storm or a strong current and quickly run out of food and fuel.\u201cWhen Kim Jong-un issues an order no one can ignore it, even if he is asking them to do the impossible,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThat means inexperienced soldiers go out to sea, even in terrible conditions and with no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that they are soldiers, so they wear civilian clothes, which is why none of the bodies found in Japan was in uniform.\u201dIn Fukui, concern about the arrival of vessels from North Korea is mixed with sympathy for the people who met such wretched ends, in freezing seas many miles from home. \u201cI expect they were ordered to catch fish by the North Korean government, but of course no one there will take any responsibility for what happened to them,\u201d said Mitsumasa Sakashita, a 67-year-old fisherman in Fukui. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, because they were just like us: fishermen trying to make a living from the sea.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Fishing"], "title": "Mystery of Japan sea's ghost ships points to North Korea"},{"date": "2015-11-12T10:30:39Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A Japanese newspaper claims it has uncovered evidence that North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens under its former leader, Kim Jong-il.The Tokyo Shimbun said it had acquired a secret manual, thought to have been written in the late 1990s, that instructs spies how to carry out abductions on foreign soil and evade capture.The newspaper\u2019s report, published this week, lends weight to claims by Japan that the regime had a well-organised network of spies trained to seize foreigners, including dozens of Japanese, and that the abductions were not the work of rogue agents.Japan suspects that 17 of its citizens were snatched in the 1970s and 80s, and taken to North Korea to teach their language and customs to help agents blend in while on assignment in Japan. Related: Don't betray abductees, Tokyo warned The 356-page classified document was used at the Kim Jong-il Political-Military University, a secretive North Korean intelligence institute, the newspaper reported.According to NK News, one section coaches spies on how to conduct overseas abductions, advising them: \u201cTo abduct the target, one has to know the target\u2019s address, where the target enters and exits, day-to-day traffic routes, means of transportation and their timeline as well.\u201dIt goes on to recommend \u201cterminating\u201d targets who resist, adding that agents should not leave \u201ca single trace\u201d of evidence at the scene.The Tokyo Shimbun says the document is the first physical evidence that overseas abductions were carried out with the full knowledge and blessing of North Korea\u2019s leadership.Some, however, have questioned the document\u2019s authenticity, pointing out that the Korean word for \u201cabduction\u201d is written in a style used in South, not North, Korea. In response, the newspaper said it believed the manual was written that way to help its operatives assimilate, as South Korea was the prime target for abductions at the time.\u201cThe people involved in the story are in no doubt that the document is genuine,\u201d a Tokyo Shimbun journalist who reports on North Korea said.The Japanese government is seeking information about at least 12 people it says were abducted by North Korea. In 2002, the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, secured the release of five other abductees, who were later joined by their families, after a summit in Pyongyang with his counterpart Kim Jong-il.Japan refuses to believe North Korean claims that eight of the remaining 12 have died, some in mysterious accidents, and the other four had never entered the country. The missing abductees include Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she was snatched on her way home from school in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, in 1977.North Korea claimed that Yokota had killed herself in 1994 while being treated in hospital for depression. But tests on her alleged remains conducted in Japan in 2004 showed they contained someone else\u2019s DNA. Japanese experts also found inconsistencies in her death certificate.Yokota is thought to have been taken to a spy training facility in Pyongyang soon after she arrived in North Korea. Kyodo News recently quoted a South Korean source as saying that she studied Korean for about three years and then taught Japanese until the mid-1980s. She married a South Korean abductee, with whom she had a daughter.Talks between the two countries on resolving the remaining abductions broke down after making no progress. Japan says it will not normalise diplomatic ties with Pyongyang until the abductions have been resolved. It is unclear how the manual could help Japanese negotiators at any future talks, however, as it was written at least 15 years ago.\u201cBut the families of the abductees and their supporters can now point to this document as proof that North Korea systematically organised the abductions,\u201d the Tokyo Shimbun reporter said. \u201cThat will enable them to put pressure on the Japanese government to do more to settle the matter.\u201d ", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens, Japanese paper claims"},{"date": "2015-11-10T06:00:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korean households are facing a winter without their traditional supply of kimchi after a year in which droughts and then floods have affected vegetable harvests.

Usually, this amount of kimchi would cost roughly 1.5m North Korean won, but the source put this year\u2019s estimated cost at 3m , adding that even with this money it is hard to secure the right supplies.A version of this article first appeared on Daily NK, part of the Unification Media Group", "tags": ["North Korea", "Food", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Food & drink"], "title": "North Korea runs short of ingredients for winter kimchi supplies"},{"date": "2015-10-28T11:16:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Over the last two years, 30-year-old Romanian photographer Mihaela Noroc has travelled the world with a backpack and camera shooting portraits of women. So far she\u2019s visited 45 countries for The Atlas of Beauty, a project she hopes will offer insight into how social, cultural and political values shape and define women\u2019s roles and femininity.Noroc\u2019s latest journey took her to North Korea, where she was able to take almost 30 portraits. Her images hint at the reality of everyday life for women in the secretive state. \u201cWhen you hear things about North Korea it is always political,\u201d Noroc explains. \u201cBut my idea was to show another side, to show regular people.\u201dNoroc entered the country via Sinuiju, on the border with China, on a trip organised by Young Pioneer Tours, a company offering visits for foreigners on a tight budget. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice big differences between the people living in the capital and people in other cities \u2013 but of course in Pyongyang, with its large boulevards, there were more people, and so I discovered many more interesting faces.\u201dNoroc explains: \u201cI approached women in the street, accompanied by my two female guides, who helped me explain my project \u2013 this was the routine for most of the portraits.\u201cIn most countries I\u2019ve observed that women smile in front of the camera and that tended to be the case when I shot women in North Korea \u2013 but I here I tried to find something more profound, to get them to open up and reveal something more authentic, to see a story in their eyes.\u201dThough women in North Korea might be unfamiliar with global fashion and beauty because of the regime\u2019s tight control on the flow of information, Noroc noted that this doesn\u2019t mean they are not concerned with their appearance: high heels and conservative outfits \u2013 accessorised with a pin of the chest of their country\u2019s leader \u2013 are common.\u201cWomen [in the DPRK] are definitely more concerned about their looks.\u201cOf course, you could say that is the case in many countries, but in North Korea I felt the gap was much wider in how men and women relate to their physical appearance.\u201d Access to the internet or foreign television is almost nonexistent in the country \u2013 so entertainment must take different forms. Noroc noted that people loved to sing and dance, with concerts in public squares and mass dances for celebrations. The Moranbong Band, an all-female music group whose members were selected by the country\u2019s supreme leader Kim Jong-un, are \u201chugely popular, a phenomenon,\u201d the photographer says. \u201cYou hear their songs everywhere and everyone knows their lyrics \u2013 this singer [pictured below] also sang some of their songs. I also saw a military marching band performing one of their songs.\u201dNoroc was in the country for nine days, and was accompanied by guides most of the time \u2013 \u201cbut not on trains or inside hotels.\u201cI did see other tourists, not many, but since you visit the same places and sleep at the same hotels, you inevitably do see some. My tour was different in that I was able to walk in the streets a lot, and meet many regular North Korean people.\u201d Uniforms are also a very common sight on both men and women. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s army is huge, so it\u2019s common to see military workers on the streets. Soldiers are sometimes involved in other activities such as construction work, for example, so they\u2019re really everywhere.\u201d\u201cEverybody was telling us that in North Korea they have a saying: \u2018North Korea has the most beautiful women in the peninsula, while South Korea [has] the most beautiful men\u2019.\u201dDespite the unusual nature of Noroc\u2019s project \u2013 and the restrictions placed on North Korean citizens \u2013 the photographer found that women were remarkably willing to take part and seemed happy to have their picture taken. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for them to have their picture taken by foreigners. They were really excited when I was showing them the photos on the screen of my camera.\u201d  Noroc is currently travelling in Nepal for her next series of photographs.

They want to be allowed to visit their hometown and to deliver food personally. The action is premised on humanitarian grounds and can, I believe, do more to help those suffering from acute food shortages than any other initiative to date.If successful, similar activities could follow drawing participants drawn from an estimated 26,000 North Korean refugees and family members separated by the Korean War. This does not require grandiose slogans such as \u201cpeace on the peninsula\u201d or \u201cKorean unification\u201d. Conceptualising it in simple terms, for example \u201clet me help my family, let me see them again\u201d, would be sufficient.The positive humanitarian impact could be huge. If we assume each of the estimated 26,000 North Korean refugees has left behind a four-member household, 104,000 people could benefit. The refugee participants are already able to raise the necessary funds through local humanitarian groups. All that is needed is for the international community, including NGOs and civil societies, to advocate for both Korean governments to authorise this project.The North Korean government may not want to include any refugees in these projects, which will lead some in South Korea to argue that they should not be pursued. But we should persist. The refugees are integral. There is no group of people more saddened by the situation in North Korea, and no group more willing to take part.Obstacles are to be expected, but this project represents the kinds of exchanges that should be actively promoted.Dr Kim Kwang-cheol is a former researcher at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a South Korean government institute which studies/creates policy for inter-Korean affairsDuring my first trip to Pyongyang in 2005, there was insignificant incident that taught me volumes about North Korea\u2019s attitudes to the outside world.My travelling companion stopped to take a photograph of two young children walking along the side of the road. He then leaned over to show them the photos on the digital camera screen (this was pre-smartphones).The North Korean minders escorting us were furious, which perplexed me because the children were well-dressed and well-fed and obviously delighted to see their own images on screen for what was probably the first time.I realised later that the North Korean guides didn\u2019t mind us seeing the children as much as the children seeing us. Here we were two American journalists, unintimidating and in possession of what North Koreans at the time looked like magic \u2013 seeing us irreparably corrupted them.Among the many falsehoods in the North Korean firmament is that they are an advanced, prosperous nation. \u201cWe have nothing to envy in this world,\u201d goes an old ditty sung in nurseries . Anything that belies the claim is corrosive to the regime.And anti-Americanism is the force that gives meaning to the North Korea\u2019s very existence. Americans are supposed to be the great enemy Meeguk nom , \u201cAmerican bastards,\u201d as they say in the state media.But whenever North Koreans meet real live Americans (or other foreigners, as American applies broadly to Europeans), a good impression can chip away at a lifetime of brainwashing.I get frequent emails from western tourists wondering if it is unethical to support a repressive regime by visiting North Korea.I give them always an unequivocal answer. By all means, yes, go. If you are sympathetic to North Korea, visiting the place is the best way to engage. If you hate the regime and wish to hasten its demise, the advice is the same. Go to North Korea. Either way, it is a no-lose proposition.Barbara Demick is the author of the critcally acclaimed novel Nothing to Envy, which charts the lives of six North Korean citizens living in the north-eastern city of ChongjinEuropean states, including the UK, have had a policy of \u201ccritical engagement\u201d with North Korea for the last decade, actively engaging the country but criticising its behaviour at the same time.But what difference has it made? The nuclear issue remains unresolved and the human rights crisis continues to deteriorate. Nor did it engage with North Korea\u2019s informal market economy, which has fed the people since the ruling party\u2019s economy collapsed in the 90s. This developed, in spite of any diplomatic policy, as North Koreans acted spontaneously in an attempt to survive.The problem with \u201ccritical engagement\u201d is that it engaged with a totalitarian regime, and chose not to engage with the people and nation underneath it. North Korea was approached as if it was a single entity, and the political administration was prioritised over the individual. By doing so, it sided with the oppressor.Even the threat of sanctions and other forms of \u201cpressure\u201d have not induced change. To be effective, they need to target the regime\u2019s internal raison d\u2019etre and source of power. This is the deliberate prioritisation of resources, and manpower, to maintain the cult of the Supreme Leader \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s the political elite who manage this cult.The frenzied response from North Korean diplomats to the suggestion that the Supreme Leader be referred to the international criminal court for crimes against humanity confirmed that this regime\u2019s institutional sensitivity \u2013 and vulnerability \u2013 is to protecting the cult of Kim at all costs. As such, future North Korean policy must rest on the premise of \u201cseparative engagement\u201d, recognising that the state and people have not been of one interest, and that those maintaining the current political administration are not the only North Koreans with a stake in North Korea. Jang Jin-sung was one of Kim Jong-il\u2019s favourite propaganda poets until his high profile defection from North Korea in 2004Michael P Spavor: \u2018Dennis Rodman\u2019s basketball trips help\u2019Basketball player Dennis Rodman\u2019s 2013 and 2014 visits to the DPRK, in which I played a coordinating role, some might consider, are the best-known recent examples of cultural engagement with the country. Like most things involving the DPRK they were certainly not free from controversy.  Critics said the presence of Rodman was an exercise designed to burnish the reputation of the leadership and raised questions over the wider impact of such visits. But if one understands how the country operates, you\u2019ll see that even high-level contact can have positive effects. As a regular traveller to many parts of the DPRK, through my work arranging cultural, academic and business exchanges, I have been able to assess how the Rodman visits went down amongst the wider population. It went far beyond the larger-than-life personalities covered by the media. The fact that their leader Kim Jong-un was widely seen in national media spending time with an American caught young people\u2019s imagination. \u201cOur leader wants peace and made friends with Mr Rodman, an American, I also would like to be friends with Americans some day,\u201d one 13-year-old said to me in rural North Korea, not far from the Chinese border. This statement \u2013 and I have heard similar opinions voiced across the country in the past two years \u2013 is instructive in two regards, one specific and one general. Firstly, it is important to recognise that young people in the DPRK are raised with, to put it mildly, a negative view of the US and it western allies, making an expression friendship with an American is far more significant than if it came from elsewhere. Related: Dennis Rodman to go back to North Korea \u2013 again  The second broader point is about the impact of meetings between the country\u2019s leadership and representatives from western countries, be it in sport or business \u2013 and I attest that the former can serve as a springboard for the latter. The DPRK is a country where the symbolic activities of the leadership serve a vital role in public life. This is not to say that Koreans are robots who can simply be told what to think (another common misconception) but if they see positive events, such as a friendly symbolic basketball game between the DRPK and an American team, then these conclusions are very likely to be mostly positive. At present we are limited in the ways we can engage. But an understanding of how the DPRK operates should encourage us to provide the country, and most importantly its young people, with clear signs of our positive intentions.Michael Spavor runs cultural exchanges and business tours to North Korea and is known to be close with Kim Jong-unPeople either think that nothing is happening in North Korea, or there is a single monolith of activity that controls everything. The reality is, of course, more complicated.I would love it if people could start thinking about North Korea less as a single system and more as a country with 24 million individuals, many of whom are pragmatic people, keen to run things more efficiently \u2013 either at a micro or macro level. It isn\u2019t really up to us how the country develops \u2013 it\u2019s up to the North Koreans. But if we are able to support the right people, their voices become more prominent and can help improve the range of options in the mix.The non-profit I work for, Choson Exchange, has trained more than 1,000 North Koreans since 2010, who have an insatiable thirst for business and economics knowledge. We\u2019ve taught participants how to improve communications and marketing; we\u2019ve worked with women interested in developing business skills and advised the country\u2019s economists on the special economic zone policy \u2013 a good idea, but missing key elements to make it attractive investment destination.If these exchanges didn\u2019t exist the North Koreans we work with would lack the context to evaluate their own situation and internal discussions would be narrower.It\u2019s still a very challenging environment to operate in, but the other option \u2013 ignoring or actively trying to isolate them, leads to worse outcomes. It is, after all, already a country very good at turning inward.Andray Abrahamian is director of Choson Exchange, a Singaporean non-profit that trains North Koreans in entrepreneurship, economic policy and law.Gareth Johnson: \u2018Tourism can change perceptions and prejudices\u2019We get a lot of flak for taking tourists into North Korea, criticism we\u2019ve received online ranges from reasonable debate to name calling and threats. The question of whether there should be tourism in the DPRK is something we regularly think about and a question we\u2019re often required to answer.The most common charge against tourism is that it \u201cprops up the regime\u201d. This is wrong. Tourism accounts for a minuscule portion of the national economy. If tourism stops, as it did during last year\u2019s Ebola scare, the country still functions as normal. Other critics argue that all the money from tourism goes to the government, but the DPRK is a socialist country and almost all its inhabitants are employed by the state. The money from tourism doesn\u2019t employ soldiers, it supports tour guides, waiters and hotel staff \u2013 normal people with everyday aspirations. Personally, I believe that social, personal and cultural interaction between people of different countries \u2013 particularly when their governments don\u2019t get along \u2013 is always a positive. Since its division from the South, the DPRK has been on a war footing, with all the government-led propaganda that comes with such a situation. When I bring tourists into the DPRK, I feel proud to see them interacting with local people, breaking down barriers and learning about each others\u2019 cultures. This is the real deal, changing deeply ingrained perceptions and prejudices at the grassroots. In addition, while people are happy to use phrases such as \u201chermit kingdom\u201d and the \u201cmost isolated place on earth\u201d when the country tries to slightly open up, for things like the recent Laibach concert, it\u2019s criticised for it not being enough. If we want North Korea to join the global community, we have to embrace any steps the country takes, and accept that tourism is part of that process. You can\u2019t have it both ways.Gareth Johnson is the director of Young Pioneer tours, specialists in budget travel to North Korea", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Dennis Rodman"], "title": "How should the world engage with North Korea?"},{"date": "2015-10-07T05:00:01Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "On Saturday North Korea is throwing a party.

There have been mounting concerns that the North Korea may use the occasion to boost national morale by launching a long-range missile or a fourth nuclear test.The country recently announced plans to restart a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon and officials have boasted about being in the \u201cfinal phase\u201d of developing a new geo-stationary satellite.\u201cThe world will clearly see a series of satellites \u2026 soaring into the sky at the times and locations determined by the [Workers\u2019 party] central committee,\u201d the director of the National Aerospace Development Administration told official state media.To increase tensions even further, the North Korean ambassador to the UK warned last week that the DPRK would not hesitate to launch long-range nuclear missiles \u201cat any time and any place\u201d.

Believe it or not, it is not that hard to visit one of the most repressive, hermetically sealed countries in the world.Unlike Eritrea, Sudan and to a certain extent Angola, North Korea has a modest but established market catering for tourists. Culture vultures can choose from an array of architecture- or film-based trips. Adrenaline junkies can try their hand at extreme sports. The regime opened a multimillion-pound ski resort last year \u2013 commemorated with its own stamp collection \u2013 and this summer the first tourists rode the waves of the country\u2019s east coast beaches. Want to run a marathon with a difference? This is also possible in North Korea, where tourists were permitted to enter the Pyongyang Marathon for the second year in a row, as long as they completed the course under four hours.There are also specific excursions tailored around moments of civic pride such as the 70th anniversary of the formation of the Korean Workers\u2019 party, this Saturday. Young Pioneer Tours, which specialises in \u201cbudget tours to destinations your mother wants you stay away from\u201d, promises \u201cmass dancing, fireworks and a military parade\u201d.The Arirang Mass Games, used to be another show-stopping fixture in the country. But the event has not taken place for the last few years, reportedly because North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, wants to improve the country\u2019s sporting prowess first. For football fans, the time to start thinking about World Cup 2026 could be now \u2013 North Korea also has ambitions to host the Olympics. The first thing to say about North Korean travel is that it isn\u2019t cheap, with the average tour costing about \u00a31,000. Young Pioneer Tours, the budget end of the market, was charging \u00a3700 for a seven-day tour during the party\u2019s 70th anniversary celebrations. Koryo Tours, which is used by 40% of all tourists to North Korea, is charging \u00a31,140 for five nights. Most tour companies will help customers arrange their visas but it is also possible to apply for one through your nearest North Korean embassy. According to the listings site Embassy Pages, Pyongyang has diplomatic missions in 48 countries, from Syria to Berne in Switzerland, where the teenage Kim went to boarding school.While entry by train through the border of China is possible, most people travel in on Air Koryo\u2019s Soviet-era fleet of planes. North Korea\u2019s national carrier, which was recently voted the world\u2019s worst airline for the fourth time in a row, is banned from entering European airspace owing to safety concerns.Testimonies from tourists are revealing: \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough seats, so they made the locals share two seats between three with insufficient seat belts. The cabin crew all stood up on take off and clung on for dear life. They then served glasses of beer to everyone at 8am and gave out copies of the Pyongyang Times,\u201d said one traveller on Koryo Tours\u2019 Facebook account. Another talked of officials with no assigned seats smoking through the journey. \u201cThe inflight videos were also huge propaganda movies about war and sporting achievements.\u201d Air China also flies into Pyongyang, which has recently had a revamp, although the internet room at the airport was found to be missing a key element: the internet. North Korea is technically still at war with the South and simmering tensions on the peninsula can erupt at a moment\u2019s notice, though visitors are not usually affected. In August an escalation of events \u2013 sparked by a landmine explosion near the border between the two \u2013 led Kim to announce that North Korea was on an official war footing. Blustering tensions were ultimately resolved through marathon diplomatic talks. Through all this, a group of South Korean footballers was in Pyongyang for a tournament and the avant-garde Slovenian rockers Laibach was there performing, becoming the first western band to play in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).There are isolated cases of western tourists being arrested, such as the Americans Matthew Miller, who ripped up his passport and tried to \u201cclaim asylum\u201d, and Jeffrey Fowle, who left a Bible in a nightclub. Tourists should note that Bibles are banned in North Korea and although its constitution guarantees freedom of religion, the reality is a county ranked as the worst in the world in terms of persecution of Christians, with those who practise openly facing heavy penalties. But as tour companies state on their webistes, they regularly take people without incident.The US State Department strongly recommends against all travel to North Korea and the UK Foreign Office warns of the unpredictability of the country. The FCO ask all British citizens to register with the British embassy in Pyongyang and warn that it has limited reach outside the capital. You\u2019ve got the money sorted and completed your personal risk assessment but there is a bigger issue at stake: is it ethical? Yes, you fulfil your garish ambitions but are you also complicit in propping up a monstrous regime? Related: Tourists are propaganda: how ethical is your North Korean holiday? Hyeonseo Lee, a defector who escaped North Korea in 1997, finds it hard to fathom why tour companies fully aware of the regime\u2019s atrocities would take people there. Tour companies and others organisations that run exchanges with North Korea argue that gradual interaction with the outside world may be effective in opening up the country and poking holes in the regime.You can get around the ethical conundrum by keeping an eye on the job vacancies of development organisations that operate in the country. However, you\u2019ll have your work cut out: North Korea is not only politically oppressed but it is also blighted by natural disaster and famine. The United Nations has six agencies based there, working with the government to \u201cimprove the quality of life of the people [and] ensure sustainable development\u201d. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), for example, runs a midwifery programme and helped the country carry out its last national census in 2008. There are also 24 other organisations operating there, including Save the Children and the Red Cross. Development jobs are not the only option. Last year the government announced that they wanted foreign volunteers to help teach English to North Korean tour guides at Pyongyang Tourism College. However, best to think of it as a gap year, in that you have to pay for the privilege: \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3740) a person. Juche Travel Services, which runs the service, says it is hoping to take up to five people a year.  Related: Ping pong, beach trips and intermittent Wi-Fi: life in privileged Pyongyang There are also diplomatic missions in Pyongyang, though two Europeans recently surveyed by NK News gave differing accounts on how much they were able to change during their time there. It\u2019s also possible to tick North Korea off your list without going through the rigmarole of visas and expensive tour companies by visiting the demilitarised zone (DMZ) through South Korea. The buffer between the two country has been described as a \u201cbizarre theme park\u201d on one of the most tense borders in the world. Those braving the zone will find a small blue building where it is possible to stand on North Korean soil, if only for a moment.If all else fails, you have a few other options. Use your talents: the band Laibach and the New York Philharmonic have been invited on cultural exchanges; the former NBA star Dennis Rodman has been invited to play basketball numerous times and the pro-wrestlers Jon \u201cStrongman\u201d Andersen and Bob \u201cThe Beast\u201d Sapp were invited to a event last April. You could rely on nepotism like Alessandro Ford, who became the first western student to study at Kim Il-Sung University, all arranged by his father, the former MEP Glyn Ford, who had ties with the country.

The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too.Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern.For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast.Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets.They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. Related: 'North Korean' boats carrying dead bodies wash ashore in Japan In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast.Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201dMost of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. Related: A life of luxury and adulation for Kim Jong-un impersonators With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants.In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind.But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths.Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance. If they had been found alive we would have done everything we could to help them.\u201dJiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, believes Kim sent out an order in the summer that more seafood should be provided to the army. \u201cThe problem is that the North Korean fishing industry is no longer run on socialist principles,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe fishermen realised that if they donated their catch to the military they would end up losing money, so they started allowing soldiers to go out and catch their own fish.\u201dThat meant bigger hauls, and allowed civilian fishermen to continue earning money for themselves and foreign currency for the regime under Kim\u2019s quasi-capitalist reforms.Ishimaru, who discussed the boat disappearances with contacts by phone in North Korea earlier this week, believes that large numbers of boats carrying soldiers who knew nothing about fishing or navigation left ports in North Korea soon after Kim\u2019s exhortation to increase catches.Typically small, with tiny engines and no GPS navigation instruments or VHF radios, the boats would easily have lost their way in a storm or a strong current and quickly run out of food and fuel.\u201cWhen Kim Jong-un issues an order no one can ignore it, even if he is asking them to do the impossible,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThat means inexperienced soldiers go out to sea, even in terrible conditions and with no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that they are soldiers, so they wear civilian clothes, which is why none of the bodies found in Japan was in uniform.\u201dIn Fukui, concern about the arrival of vessels from North Korea is mixed with sympathy for the people who met such wretched ends, in freezing seas many miles from home. \u201cI expect they were ordered to catch fish by the North Korean government, but of course no one there will take any responsibility for what happened to them,\u201d said Mitsumasa Sakashita, a 67-year-old fisherman in Fukui. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, because they were just like us: fishermen trying to make a living from the sea.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Fishing"], "title": "Mystery of Japan sea's ghost ships points to North Korea"},{"date": "2015-11-12T10:30:39Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A Japanese newspaper claims it has uncovered evidence that North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens under its former leader, Kim Jong-il.The Tokyo Shimbun said it had acquired a secret manual, thought to have been written in the late 1990s, that instructs spies how to carry out abductions on foreign soil and evade capture.The newspaper\u2019s report, published this week, lends weight to claims by Japan that the regime had a well-organised network of spies trained to seize foreigners, including dozens of Japanese, and that the abductions were not the work of rogue agents.Japan suspects that 17 of its citizens were snatched in the 1970s and 80s, and taken to North Korea to teach their language and customs to help agents blend in while on assignment in Japan. Related: Don't betray abductees, Tokyo warned The 356-page classified document was used at the Kim Jong-il Political-Military University, a secretive North Korean intelligence institute, the newspaper reported.According to NK News, one section coaches spies on how to conduct overseas abductions, advising them: \u201cTo abduct the target, one has to know the target\u2019s address, where the target enters and exits, day-to-day traffic routes, means of transportation and their timeline as well.\u201dIt goes on to recommend \u201cterminating\u201d targets who resist, adding that agents should not leave \u201ca single trace\u201d of evidence at the scene.The Tokyo Shimbun says the document is the first physical evidence that overseas abductions were carried out with the full knowledge and blessing of North Korea\u2019s leadership.Some, however, have questioned the document\u2019s authenticity, pointing out that the Korean word for \u201cabduction\u201d is written in a style used in South, not North, Korea. In response, the newspaper said it believed the manual was written that way to help its operatives assimilate, as South Korea was the prime target for abductions at the time.\u201cThe people involved in the story are in no doubt that the document is genuine,\u201d a Tokyo Shimbun journalist who reports on North Korea said.The Japanese government is seeking information about at least 12 people it says were abducted by North Korea. In 2002, the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, secured the release of five other abductees, who were later joined by their families, after a summit in Pyongyang with his counterpart Kim Jong-il.Japan refuses to believe North Korean claims that eight of the remaining 12 have died, some in mysterious accidents, and the other four had never entered the country. The missing abductees include Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she was snatched on her way home from school in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, in 1977.North Korea claimed that Yokota had killed herself in 1994 while being treated in hospital for depression. But tests on her alleged remains conducted in Japan in 2004 showed they contained someone else\u2019s DNA. Japanese experts also found inconsistencies in her death certificate.Yokota is thought to have been taken to a spy training facility in Pyongyang soon after she arrived in North Korea. Kyodo News recently quoted a South Korean source as saying that she studied Korean for about three years and then taught Japanese until the mid-1980s. She married a South Korean abductee, with whom she had a daughter.Talks between the two countries on resolving the remaining abductions broke down after making no progress. Japan says it will not normalise diplomatic ties with Pyongyang until the abductions have been resolved. It is unclear how the manual could help Japanese negotiators at any future talks, however, as it was written at least 15 years ago.\u201cBut the families of the abductees and their supporters can now point to this document as proof that North Korea systematically organised the abductions,\u201d the Tokyo Shimbun reporter said. \u201cThat will enable them to put pressure on the Japanese government to do more to settle the matter.\u201d ", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens, Japanese paper claims"},{"date": "2015-11-10T06:00:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korean households are facing a winter without their traditional supply of kimchi after a year in which droughts and then floods have affected vegetable harvests. As the kimjang season begins, when the fermented cabbage dish is made to last families though the winter, market prices for radishes and cabbages are escalating. Even ingredients such as chillies, garlic, onions and salt used for seasoning are in short supply, say sources inside the country.Harvests from collective farms are expected to have halved because of the effects of the adverse weather conditions, a source said, with residents fearing that household allocations will be considerably lower than last year. \u201cAt Chongjin\u2019s Sunam Market, 1kg of cabbage now goes for 3,000 North Korean won ($0.35), which is up 1,000 won from before,\u201d a source said. \u201cRadish prices have climbed by 500 won but they\u2019re still selling at a rapid pace,\u201d the source added. \u201cIf people see someone with radishes and cabbages on an ox cart going by, they will chase after it and offer a higher price to buy the produce, creating a scene.\u201d \u201cBack in August, a lot of vegetable fields in the Hamgyong Provinces and parts of Yanggang were lost to extreme downpours,\u201d she said, \u201cso a lot of households are giving up on kimjang for the year.\u201dCentral authorities have prioritised supply for the Rason area, which was particularly hit hard by devastatingly torrential rains, meaning some other regions have not received a single head of cabbage. Farmers ordered to send supplies to military bases and flood-hit areasare worried about procuring their own kimjang supplies.The source said that North Koreans are reliant on kimchi as a staple food during the winter, and there are already fears of widespread hunger. Related: Kimchi \u2013\u00a0why everyone is going crazy for fiery fermented foods For an average four-person family, a minimum 350kg of cabbages and 200kg of radishes are required during kimjang.

Usually, this amount of kimchi would cost roughly 1.5m North Korean won, but the source put this year\u2019s estimated cost at 3m , adding that even with this money it is hard to secure the right supplies.A version of this article first appeared on Daily NK, part of the Unification Media Group", "tags": ["North Korea", "Food", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Food & drink"], "title": "North Korea runs short of ingredients for winter kimchi supplies"},{"date": "2015-10-28T11:16:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Over the last two years, 30-year-old Romanian photographer Mihaela Noroc has travelled the world with a backpack and camera shooting portraits of women. So far she\u2019s visited 45 countries for The Atlas of Beauty, a project she hopes will offer insight into how social, cultural and political values shape and define women\u2019s roles and femininity.Noroc\u2019s latest journey took her to North Korea, where she was able to take almost 30 portraits. Her images hint at the reality of everyday life for women in the secretive state. \u201cWhen you hear things about North Korea it is always political,\u201d Noroc explains. \u201cBut my idea was to show another side, to show regular people.\u201dNoroc entered the country via Sinuiju, on the border with China, on a trip organised by Young Pioneer Tours, a company offering visits for foreigners on a tight budget. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice big differences between the people living in the capital and people in other cities \u2013 but of course in Pyongyang, with its large boulevards, there were more people, and so I discovered many more interesting faces.\u201dNoroc explains: \u201cI approached women in the street, accompanied by my two female guides, who helped me explain my project \u2013 this was the routine for most of the portraits.\u201cIn most countries I\u2019ve observed that women smile in front of the camera and that tended to be the case when I shot women in North Korea \u2013 but I here I tried to find something more profound, to get them to open up and reveal something more authentic, to see a story in their eyes.\u201dThough women in North Korea might be unfamiliar with global fashion and beauty because of the regime\u2019s tight control on the flow of information, Noroc noted that this doesn\u2019t mean they are not concerned with their appearance: high heels and conservative outfits \u2013 accessorised with a pin of the chest of their country\u2019s leader \u2013 are common.\u201cWomen [in the DPRK] are definitely more concerned about their looks.\u201cOf course, you could say that is the case in many countries, but in North Korea I felt the gap was much wider in how men and women relate to their physical appearance.\u201d Access to the internet or foreign television is almost nonexistent in the country \u2013 so entertainment must take different forms. Noroc noted that people loved to sing and dance, with concerts in public squares and mass dances for celebrations. The Moranbong Band, an all-female music group whose members were selected by the country\u2019s supreme leader Kim Jong-un, are \u201chugely popular, a phenomenon,\u201d the photographer says. \u201cYou hear their songs everywhere and everyone knows their lyrics \u2013 this singer [pictured below] also sang some of their songs. I also saw a military marching band performing one of their songs.\u201dNoroc was in the country for nine days, and was accompanied by guides most of the time \u2013 \u201cbut not on trains or inside hotels.\u201cI did see other tourists, not many, but since you visit the same places and sleep at the same hotels, you inevitably do see some. My tour was different in that I was able to walk in the streets a lot, and meet many regular North Korean people.\u201d Uniforms are also a very common sight on both men and women. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s army is huge, so it\u2019s common to see military workers on the streets. Soldiers are sometimes involved in other activities such as construction work, for example, so they\u2019re really everywhere.\u201d\u201cEverybody was telling us that in North Korea they have a saying: \u2018North Korea has the most beautiful women in the peninsula, while South Korea [has] the most beautiful men\u2019.\u201dDespite the unusual nature of Noroc\u2019s project \u2013 and the restrictions placed on North Korean citizens \u2013 the photographer found that women were remarkably willing to take part and seemed happy to have their picture taken. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for them to have their picture taken by foreigners.

They want to be allowed to visit their hometown and to deliver food personally. The action is premised on humanitarian grounds and can, I believe, do more to help those suffering from acute food shortages than any other initiative to date.If successful, similar activities could follow drawing participants drawn from an estimated 26,000 North Korean refugees and family members separated by the Korean War. This does not require grandiose slogans such as \u201cpeace on the peninsula\u201d or \u201cKorean unification\u201d. Conceptualising it in simple terms, for example \u201clet me help my family, let me see them again\u201d, would be sufficient.The positive humanitarian impact could be huge. If we assume each of the estimated 26,000 North Korean refugees has left behind a four-member household, 104,000 people could benefit. The refugee participants are already able to raise the necessary funds through local humanitarian groups. All that is needed is for the international community, including NGOs and civil societies, to advocate for both Korean governments to authorise this project.The North Korean government may not want to include any refugees in these projects, which will lead some in South Korea to argue that they should not be pursued. But we should persist. The refugees are integral. There is no group of people more saddened by the situation in North Korea, and no group more willing to take part.Obstacles are to be expected, but this project represents the kinds of exchanges that should be actively promoted.Dr Kim Kwang-cheol is a former researcher at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a South Korean government institute which studies/creates policy for inter-Korean affairsDuring my first trip to Pyongyang in 2005, there was insignificant incident that taught me volumes about North Korea\u2019s attitudes to the outside world.My travelling companion stopped to take a photograph of two young children walking along the side of the road. He then leaned over to show them the photos on the digital camera screen (this was pre-smartphones).The North Korean minders escorting us were furious, which perplexed me because the children were well-dressed and well-fed and obviously delighted to see their own images on screen for what was probably the first time.I realised later that the North Korean guides didn\u2019t mind us seeing the children as much as the children seeing us. Here we were two American journalists, unintimidating and in possession of what North Koreans at the time looked like magic \u2013 seeing us irreparably corrupted them.Among the many falsehoods in the North Korean firmament is that they are an advanced, prosperous nation. \u201cWe have nothing to envy in this world,\u201d goes an old ditty sung in nurseries . Anything that belies the claim is corrosive to the regime.And anti-Americanism is the force that gives meaning to the North Korea\u2019s very existence. Americans are supposed to be the great enemy Meeguk nom , \u201cAmerican bastards,\u201d as they say in the state media.But whenever North Koreans meet real live Americans (or other foreigners, as American applies broadly to Europeans), a good impression can chip away at a lifetime of brainwashing.I get frequent emails from western tourists wondering if it is unethical to support a repressive regime by visiting North Korea.I give them always an unequivocal answer. By all means, yes, go. If you are sympathetic to North Korea, visiting the place is the best way to engage. If you hate the regime and wish to hasten its demise, the advice is the same. Go to North Korea. Either way, it is a no-lose proposition.Barbara Demick is the author of the critcally acclaimed novel Nothing to Envy, which charts the lives of six North Korean citizens living in the north-eastern city of ChongjinEuropean states, including the UK, have had a policy of \u201ccritical engagement\u201d with North Korea for the last decade, actively engaging the country but criticising its behaviour at the same time.But what difference has it made? The nuclear issue remains unresolved and the human rights crisis continues to deteriorate. Nor did it engage with North Korea\u2019s informal market economy, which has fed the people since the ruling party\u2019s economy collapsed in the 90s. This developed, in spite of any diplomatic policy, as North Koreans acted spontaneously in an attempt to survive.The problem with \u201ccritical engagement\u201d is that it engaged with a totalitarian regime, and chose not to engage with the people and nation underneath it. North Korea was approached as if it was a single entity, and the political administration was prioritised over the individual. By doing so, it sided with the oppressor.Even the threat of sanctions and other forms of \u201cpressure\u201d have not induced change. To be effective, they need to target the regime\u2019s internal raison d\u2019etre and source of power. This is the deliberate prioritisation of resources, and manpower, to maintain the cult of the Supreme Leader \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s the political elite who manage this cult.The frenzied response from North Korean diplomats to the suggestion that the Supreme Leader be referred to the international criminal court for crimes against humanity confirmed that this regime\u2019s institutional sensitivity \u2013 and vulnerability \u2013 is to protecting the cult of Kim at all costs. As such, future North Korean policy must rest on the premise of \u201cseparative engagement\u201d, recognising that the state and people have not been of one interest, and that those maintaining the current political administration are not the only North Koreans with a stake in North Korea. Jang Jin-sung was one of Kim Jong-il\u2019s favourite propaganda poets until his high profile defection from North Korea in 2004Michael P Spavor: \u2018Dennis Rodman\u2019s basketball trips help\u2019Basketball player Dennis Rodman\u2019s 2013 and 2014 visits to the DPRK, in which I played a coordinating role, some might consider, are the best-known recent examples of cultural engagement with the country. Like most things involving the DPRK they were certainly not free from controversy.  Critics said the presence of Rodman was an exercise designed to burnish the reputation of the leadership and raised questions over the wider impact of such visits. But if one understands how the country operates, you\u2019ll see that even high-level contact can have positive effects. As a regular traveller to many parts of the DPRK, through my work arranging cultural, academic and business exchanges, I have been able to assess how the Rodman visits went down amongst the wider population. It went far beyond the larger-than-life personalities covered by the media. The fact that their leader Kim Jong-un was widely seen in national media spending time with an American caught young people\u2019s imagination. \u201cOur leader wants peace and made friends with Mr Rodman, an American, I also would like to be friends with Americans some day,\u201d one 13-year-old said to me in rural North Korea, not far from the Chinese border. This statement \u2013 and I have heard similar opinions voiced across the country in the past two years \u2013 is instructive in two regards, one specific and one general. Firstly, it is important to recognise that young people in the DPRK are raised with, to put it mildly, a negative view of the US and it western allies, making an expression friendship with an American is far more significant than if it came from elsewhere. Related: Dennis Rodman to go back to North Korea \u2013 again  The second broader point is about the impact of meetings between the country\u2019s leadership and representatives from western countries, be it in sport or business \u2013 and I attest that the former can serve as a springboard for the latter. The DPRK is a country where the symbolic activities of the leadership serve a vital role in public life. This is not to say that Koreans are robots who can simply be told what to think (another common misconception) but if they see positive events, such as a friendly symbolic basketball game between the DRPK and an American team, then these conclusions are very likely to be mostly positive. At present we are limited in the ways we can engage. But an understanding of how the DPRK operates should encourage us to provide the country, and most importantly its young people, with clear signs of our positive intentions.Michael Spavor runs cultural exchanges and business tours to North Korea and is known to be close with Kim Jong-unPeople either think that nothing is happening in North Korea, or there is a single monolith of activity that controls everything. The reality is, of course, more complicated.I would love it if people could start thinking about North Korea less as a single system and more as a country with 24 million individuals, many of whom are pragmatic people, keen to run things more efficiently \u2013 either at a micro or macro level. It isn\u2019t really up to us how the country develops \u2013 it\u2019s up to the North Koreans. But if we are able to support the right people, their voices become more prominent and can help improve the range of options in the mix.The non-profit I work for, Choson Exchange, has trained more than 1,000 North Koreans since 2010, who have an insatiable thirst for business and economics knowledge. We\u2019ve taught participants how to improve communications and marketing; we\u2019ve worked with women interested in developing business skills and advised the country\u2019s economists on the special economic zone policy \u2013 a good idea, but missing key elements to make it attractive investment destination.If these exchanges didn\u2019t exist the North Koreans we work with would lack the context to evaluate their own situation and internal discussions would be narrower.It\u2019s still a very challenging environment to operate in, but the other option \u2013 ignoring or actively trying to isolate them, leads to worse outcomes. It is, after all, already a country very good at turning inward.Andray Abrahamian is director of Choson Exchange, a Singaporean non-profit that trains North Koreans in entrepreneurship, economic policy and law.Gareth Johnson: \u2018Tourism can change perceptions and prejudices\u2019We get a lot of flak for taking tourists into North Korea, criticism we\u2019ve received online ranges from reasonable debate to name calling and threats. The question of whether there should be tourism in the DPRK is something we regularly think about and a question we\u2019re often required to answer.The most common charge against tourism is that it \u201cprops up the regime\u201d. This is wrong. Tourism accounts for a minuscule portion of the national economy. If tourism stops, as it did during last year\u2019s Ebola scare, the country still functions as normal. Other critics argue that all the money from tourism goes to the government, but the DPRK is a socialist country and almost all its inhabitants are employed by the state. The money from tourism doesn\u2019t employ soldiers, it supports tour guides, waiters and hotel staff \u2013 normal people with everyday aspirations. Personally, I believe that social, personal and cultural interaction between people of different countries \u2013 particularly when their governments don\u2019t get along \u2013 is always a positive. Since its division from the South, the DPRK has been on a war footing, with all the government-led propaganda that comes with such a situation. When I bring tourists into the DPRK, I feel proud to see them interacting with local people, breaking down barriers and learning about each others\u2019 cultures. This is the real deal, changing deeply ingrained perceptions and prejudices at the grassroots. In addition, while people are happy to use phrases such as \u201chermit kingdom\u201d and the \u201cmost isolated place on earth\u201d when the country tries to slightly open up, for things like the recent Laibach concert, it\u2019s criticised for it not being enough. If we want North Korea to join the global community, we have to embrace any steps the country takes, and accept that tourism is part of that process. You can\u2019t have it both ways.Gareth Johnson is the director of Young Pioneer tours, specialists in budget travel to North Korea", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Dennis Rodman"], "title": "How should the world engage with North Korea?"},{"date": "2015-10-07T05:00:01Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "On Saturday North Korea is throwing a party.

Believe it or not, it is not that hard to visit one of the most repressive, hermetically sealed countries in the world.Unlike Eritrea, Sudan and to a certain extent Angola, North Korea has a modest but established market catering for tourists. Culture vultures can choose from an array of architecture- or film-based trips. Adrenaline junkies can try their hand at extreme sports. The regime opened a multimillion-pound ski resort last year \u2013 commemorated with its own stamp collection \u2013 and this summer the first tourists rode the waves of the country\u2019s east coast beaches. Want to run a marathon with a difference? This is also possible in North Korea, where tourists were permitted to enter the Pyongyang Marathon for the second year in a row, as long as they completed the course under four hours.There are also specific excursions tailored around moments of civic pride such as the 70th anniversary of the formation of the Korean Workers\u2019 party, this Saturday. Young Pioneer Tours, which specialises in \u201cbudget tours to destinations your mother wants you stay away from\u201d, promises \u201cmass dancing, fireworks and a military parade\u201d.The Arirang Mass Games, used to be another show-stopping fixture in the country. But the event has not taken place for the last few years, reportedly because North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, wants to improve the country\u2019s sporting prowess first. For football fans, the time to start thinking about World Cup 2026 could be now \u2013 North Korea also has ambitions to host the Olympics. The first thing to say about North Korean travel is that it isn\u2019t cheap, with the average tour costing about \u00a31,000. Young Pioneer Tours, the budget end of the market, was charging \u00a3700 for a seven-day tour during the party\u2019s 70th anniversary celebrations. Koryo Tours, which is used by 40% of all tourists to North Korea, is charging \u00a31,140 for five nights. Most tour companies will help customers arrange their visas but it is also possible to apply for one through your nearest North Korean embassy. According to the listings site Embassy Pages, Pyongyang has diplomatic missions in 48 countries, from Syria to Berne in Switzerland, where the teenage Kim went to boarding school.While entry by train through the border of China is possible, most people travel in on Air Koryo\u2019s Soviet-era fleet of planes. North Korea\u2019s national carrier, which was recently voted the world\u2019s worst airline for the fourth time in a row, is banned from entering European airspace owing to safety concerns.Testimonies from tourists are revealing: \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough seats, so they made the locals share two seats between three with insufficient seat belts. The cabin crew all stood up on take off and clung on for dear life. They then served glasses of beer to everyone at 8am and gave out copies of the Pyongyang Times,\u201d said one traveller on Koryo Tours\u2019 Facebook account. Another talked of officials with no assigned seats smoking through the journey. \u201cThe inflight videos were also huge propaganda movies about war and sporting achievements.\u201d Air China also flies into Pyongyang, which has recently had a revamp, although the internet room at the airport was found to be missing a key element: the internet. North Korea is technically still at war with the South and simmering tensions on the peninsula can erupt at a moment\u2019s notice, though visitors are not usually affected. In August an escalation of events \u2013 sparked by a landmine explosion near the border between the two \u2013 led Kim to announce that North Korea was on an official war footing. Blustering tensions were ultimately resolved through marathon diplomatic talks. Through all this, a group of South Korean footballers was in Pyongyang for a tournament and the avant-garde Slovenian rockers Laibach was there performing, becoming the first western band to play in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).There are isolated cases of western tourists being arrested, such as the Americans Matthew Miller, who ripped up his passport and tried to \u201cclaim asylum\u201d, and Jeffrey Fowle, who left a Bible in a nightclub. Tourists should note that Bibles are banned in North Korea and although its constitution guarantees freedom of religion, the reality is a county ranked as the worst in the world in terms of persecution of Christians, with those who practise openly facing heavy penalties. But as tour companies state on their webistes, they regularly take people without incident.The US State Department strongly recommends against all travel to North Korea and the UK Foreign Office warns of the unpredictability of the country. The FCO ask all British citizens to register with the British embassy in Pyongyang and warn that it has limited reach outside the capital. You\u2019ve got the money sorted and completed your personal risk assessment but there is a bigger issue at stake: is it ethical? Yes, you fulfil your garish ambitions but are you also complicit in propping up a monstrous regime? Related: Tourists are propaganda: how ethical is your North Korean holiday? Hyeonseo Lee, a defector who escaped North Korea in 1997, finds it hard to fathom why tour companies fully aware of the regime\u2019s atrocities would take people there. Tour companies and others organisations that run exchanges with North Korea argue that gradual interaction with the outside world may be effective in opening up the country and poking holes in the regime.You can get around the ethical conundrum by keeping an eye on the job vacancies of development organisations that operate in the country. However, you\u2019ll have your work cut out: North Korea is not only politically oppressed but it is also blighted by natural disaster and famine. The United Nations has six agencies based there, working with the government to \u201cimprove the quality of life of the people [and] ensure sustainable development\u201d. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), for example, runs a midwifery programme and helped the country carry out its last national census in 2008. There are also 24 other organisations operating there, including Save the Children and the Red Cross. Development jobs are not the only option. Last year the government announced that they wanted foreign volunteers to help teach English to North Korean tour guides at Pyongyang Tourism College. However, best to think of it as a gap year, in that you have to pay for the privilege: \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3740) a person. Juche Travel Services, which runs the service, says it is hoping to take up to five people a year.  Related: Ping pong, beach trips and intermittent Wi-Fi: life in privileged Pyongyang There are also diplomatic missions in Pyongyang, though two Europeans recently surveyed by NK News gave differing accounts on how much they were able to change during their time there. It\u2019s also possible to tick North Korea off your list without going through the rigmarole of visas and expensive tour companies by visiting the demilitarised zone (DMZ) through South Korea. The buffer between the two country has been described as a \u201cbizarre theme park\u201d on one of the most tense borders in the world. Those braving the zone will find a small blue building where it is possible to stand on North Korean soil, if only for a moment.If all else fails, you have a few other options. Use your talents: the band Laibach and the New York Philharmonic have been invited on cultural exchanges; the former NBA star Dennis Rodman has been invited to play basketball numerous times and the pro-wrestlers Jon \u201cStrongman\u201d Andersen and Bob \u201cThe Beast\u201d Sapp were invited to a event last April.

The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too.Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern.For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast.Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets.They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. Related: 'North Korean' boats carrying dead bodies wash ashore in Japan In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast.Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201dMost of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. Related: A life of luxury and adulation for Kim Jong-un impersonators With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants.In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind.But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths.Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance. If they had been found alive we would have done everything we could to help them.\u201dJiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, believes Kim sent out an order in the summer that more seafood should be provided to the army. \u201cThe problem is that the North Korean fishing industry is no longer run on socialist principles,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe fishermen realised that if they donated their catch to the military they would end up losing money, so they started allowing soldiers to go out and catch their own fish.\u201dThat meant bigger hauls, and allowed civilian fishermen to continue earning money for themselves and foreign currency for the regime under Kim\u2019s quasi-capitalist reforms.Ishimaru, who discussed the boat disappearances with contacts by phone in North Korea earlier this week, believes that large numbers of boats carrying soldiers who knew nothing about fishing or navigation left ports in North Korea soon after Kim\u2019s exhortation to increase catches.Typically small, with tiny engines and no GPS navigation instruments or VHF radios, the boats would easily have lost their way in a storm or a strong current and quickly run out of food and fuel.\u201cWhen Kim Jong-un issues an order no one can ignore it, even if he is asking them to do the impossible,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThat means inexperienced soldiers go out to sea, even in terrible conditions and with no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that they are soldiers, so they wear civilian clothes, which is why none of the bodies found in Japan was in uniform.\u201dIn Fukui, concern about the arrival of vessels from North Korea is mixed with sympathy for the people who met such wretched ends, in freezing seas many miles from home. \u201cI expect they were ordered to catch fish by the North Korean government, but of course no one there will take any responsibility for what happened to them,\u201d said Mitsumasa Sakashita, a 67-year-old fisherman in Fukui. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, because they were just like us: fishermen trying to make a living from the sea.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Fishing"], "title": "Mystery of Japan sea's ghost ships points to North Korea"},{"date": "2015-11-12T10:30:39Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A Japanese newspaper claims it has uncovered evidence that North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens under its former leader, Kim Jong-il.The Tokyo Shimbun said it had acquired a secret manual, thought to have been written in the late 1990s, that instructs spies how to carry out abductions on foreign soil and evade capture.The newspaper\u2019s report, published this week, lends weight to claims by Japan that the regime had a well-organised network of spies trained to seize foreigners, including dozens of Japanese, and that the abductions were not the work of rogue agents.Japan suspects that 17 of its citizens were snatched in the 1970s and 80s, and taken to North Korea to teach their language and customs to help agents blend in while on assignment in Japan. Related: Don't betray abductees, Tokyo warned The 356-page classified document was used at the Kim Jong-il Political-Military University, a secretive North Korean intelligence institute, the newspaper reported.According to NK News, one section coaches spies on how to conduct overseas abductions, advising them: \u201cTo abduct the target, one has to know the target\u2019s address, where the target enters and exits, day-to-day traffic routes, means of transportation and their timeline as well.\u201dIt goes on to recommend \u201cterminating\u201d targets who resist, adding that agents should not leave \u201ca single trace\u201d of evidence at the scene.The Tokyo Shimbun says the document is the first physical evidence that overseas abductions were carried out with the full knowledge and blessing of North Korea\u2019s leadership.Some, however, have questioned the document\u2019s authenticity, pointing out that the Korean word for \u201cabduction\u201d is written in a style used in South, not North, Korea. In response, the newspaper said it believed the manual was written that way to help its operatives assimilate, as South Korea was the prime target for abductions at the time.\u201cThe people involved in the story are in no doubt that the document is genuine,\u201d a Tokyo Shimbun journalist who reports on North Korea said.The Japanese government is seeking information about at least 12 people it says were abducted by North Korea. In 2002, the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, secured the release of five other abductees, who were later joined by their families, after a summit in Pyongyang with his counterpart Kim Jong-il.Japan refuses to believe North Korean claims that eight of the remaining 12 have died, some in mysterious accidents, and the other four had never entered the country. The missing abductees include Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she was snatched on her way home from school in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, in 1977.North Korea claimed that Yokota had killed herself in 1994 while being treated in hospital for depression. But tests on her alleged remains conducted in Japan in 2004 showed they contained someone else\u2019s DNA. Japanese experts also found inconsistencies in her death certificate.Yokota is thought to have been taken to a spy training facility in Pyongyang soon after she arrived in North Korea. Kyodo News recently quoted a South Korean source as saying that she studied Korean for about three years and then taught Japanese until the mid-1980s. She married a South Korean abductee, with whom she had a daughter.Talks between the two countries on resolving the remaining abductions broke down after making no progress. Japan says it will not normalise diplomatic ties with Pyongyang until the abductions have been resolved. It is unclear how the manual could help Japanese negotiators at any future talks, however, as it was written at least 15 years ago.\u201cBut the families of the abductees and their supporters can now point to this document as proof that North Korea systematically organised the abductions,\u201d the Tokyo Shimbun reporter said. \u201cThat will enable them to put pressure on the Japanese government to do more to settle the matter.\u201d ", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Kim Jong-il", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens, Japanese paper claims"},{"date": "2015-11-10T06:00:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "North Korean households are facing a winter without their traditional supply of kimchi after a year in which droughts and then floods have affected vegetable harvests. As the kimjang season begins, when the fermented cabbage dish is made to last families though the winter, market prices for radishes and cabbages are escalating. Even ingredients such as chillies, garlic, onions and salt used for seasoning are in short supply, say sources inside the country.Harvests from collective farms are expected to have halved because of the effects of the adverse weather conditions, a source said, with residents fearing that household allocations will be considerably lower than last year. \u201cAt Chongjin\u2019s Sunam Market, 1kg of cabbage now goes for 3,000 North Korean won ($0.35), which is up 1,000 won from before,\u201d a source said. \u201cRadish prices have climbed by 500 won but they\u2019re still selling at a rapid pace,\u201d the source added. \u201cIf people see someone with radishes and cabbages on an ox cart going by, they will chase after it and offer a higher price to buy the produce, creating a scene.\u201d \u201cBack in August, a lot of vegetable fields in the Hamgyong Provinces and parts of Yanggang were lost to extreme downpours,\u201d she said, \u201cso a lot of households are giving up on kimjang for the year.\u201dCentral authorities have prioritised supply for the Rason area, which was particularly hit hard by devastatingly torrential rains, meaning some other regions have not received a single head of cabbage.

So far she\u2019s visited 45 countries for The Atlas of Beauty, a project she hopes will offer insight into how social, cultural and political values shape and define women\u2019s roles and femininity.Noroc\u2019s latest journey took her to North Korea, where she was able to take almost 30 portraits. Her images hint at the reality of everyday life for women in the secretive state. \u201cWhen you hear things about North Korea it is always political,\u201d Noroc explains. \u201cBut my idea was to show another side, to show regular people.\u201dNoroc entered the country via Sinuiju, on the border with China, on a trip organised by Young Pioneer Tours, a company offering visits for foreigners on a tight budget. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice big differences between the people living in the capital and people in other cities \u2013 but of course in Pyongyang, with its large boulevards, there were more people, and so I discovered many more interesting faces.\u201dNoroc explains: \u201cI approached women in the street, accompanied by my two female guides, who helped me explain my project \u2013 this was the routine for most of the portraits.\u201cIn most countries I\u2019ve observed that women smile in front of the camera and that tended to be the case when I shot women in North Korea \u2013 but I here I tried to find something more profound, to get them to open up and reveal something more authentic, to see a story in their eyes.\u201dThough women in North Korea might be unfamiliar with global fashion and beauty because of the regime\u2019s tight control on the flow of information, Noroc noted that this doesn\u2019t mean they are not concerned with their appearance: high heels and conservative outfits \u2013 accessorised with a pin of the chest of their country\u2019s leader \u2013 are common.\u201cWomen [in the DPRK] are definitely more concerned about their looks.\u201cOf course, you could say that is the case in many countries, but in North Korea I felt the gap was much wider in how men and women relate to their physical appearance.\u201d Access to the internet or foreign television is almost nonexistent in the country \u2013 so entertainment must take different forms. Noroc noted that people loved to sing and dance, with concerts in public squares and mass dances for celebrations. The Moranbong Band, an all-female music group whose members were selected by the country\u2019s supreme leader Kim Jong-un, are \u201chugely popular, a phenomenon,\u201d the photographer says. \u201cYou hear their songs everywhere and everyone knows their lyrics \u2013 this singer [pictured below] also sang some of their songs. I also saw a military marching band performing one of their songs.\u201dNoroc was in the country for nine days, and was accompanied by guides most of the time \u2013 \u201cbut not on trains or inside hotels.\u201cI did see other tourists, not many, but since you visit the same places and sleep at the same hotels, you inevitably do see some. My tour was different in that I was able to walk in the streets a lot, and meet many regular North Korean people.\u201d Uniforms are also a very common sight on both men and women. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s army is huge, so it\u2019s common to see military workers on the streets. Soldiers are sometimes involved in other activities such as construction work, for example, so they\u2019re really everywhere.\u201d\u201cEverybody was telling us that in North Korea they have a saying: \u2018North Korea has the most beautiful women in the peninsula, while South Korea [has] the most beautiful men\u2019.\u201dDespite the unusual nature of Noroc\u2019s project \u2013 and the restrictions placed on North Korean citizens \u2013 the photographer found that women were remarkably willing to take part and seemed happy to have their picture taken. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for them to have their picture taken by foreigners.

They want to be allowed to visit their hometown and to deliver food personally. The action is premised on humanitarian grounds and can, I believe, do more to help those suffering from acute food shortages than any other initiative to date.If successful, similar activities could follow drawing participants drawn from an estimated 26,000 North Korean refugees and family members separated by the Korean War. This does not require grandiose slogans such as \u201cpeace on the peninsula\u201d or \u201cKorean unification\u201d. Conceptualising it in simple terms, for example \u201clet me help my family, let me see them again\u201d, would be sufficient.The positive humanitarian impact could be huge. If we assume each of the estimated 26,000 North Korean refugees has left behind a four-member household, 104,000 people could benefit. The refugee participants are already able to raise the necessary funds through local humanitarian groups. All that is needed is for the international community, including NGOs and civil societies, to advocate for both Korean governments to authorise this project.The North Korean government may not want to include any refugees in these projects, which will lead some in South Korea to argue that they should not be pursued. But we should persist. The refugees are integral. There is no group of people more saddened by the situation in North Korea, and no group more willing to take part.Obstacles are to be expected, but this project represents the kinds of exchanges that should be actively promoted.Dr Kim Kwang-cheol is a former researcher at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a South Korean government institute which studies/creates policy for inter-Korean affairsDuring my first trip to Pyongyang in 2005, there was insignificant incident that taught me volumes about North Korea\u2019s attitudes to the outside world.My travelling companion stopped to take a photograph of two young children walking along the side of the road. He then leaned over to show them the photos on the digital camera screen (this was pre-smartphones).The North Korean minders escorting us were furious, which perplexed me because the children were well-dressed and well-fed and obviously delighted to see their own images on screen for what was probably the first time.I realised later that the North Korean guides didn\u2019t mind us seeing the children as much as the children seeing us. Here we were two American journalists, unintimidating and in possession of what North Koreans at the time looked like magic \u2013 seeing us irreparably corrupted them.Among the many falsehoods in the North Korean firmament is that they are an advanced, prosperous nation. \u201cWe have nothing to envy in this world,\u201d goes an old ditty sung in nurseries . Anything that belies the claim is corrosive to the regime.And anti-Americanism is the force that gives meaning to the North Korea\u2019s very existence. Americans are supposed to be the great enemy Meeguk nom , \u201cAmerican bastards,\u201d as they say in the state media.But whenever North Koreans meet real live Americans (or other foreigners, as American applies broadly to Europeans), a good impression can chip away at a lifetime of brainwashing.I get frequent emails from western tourists wondering if it is unethical to support a repressive regime by visiting North Korea.I give them always an unequivocal answer. By all means, yes, go. If you are sympathetic to North Korea, visiting the place is the best way to engage. If you hate the regime and wish to hasten its demise, the advice is the same. Go to North Korea. Either way, it is a no-lose proposition.Barbara Demick is the author of the critcally acclaimed novel Nothing to Envy, which charts the lives of six North Korean citizens living in the north-eastern city of ChongjinEuropean states, including the UK, have had a policy of \u201ccritical engagement\u201d with North Korea for the last decade, actively engaging the country but criticising its behaviour at the same time.But what difference has it made? The nuclear issue remains unresolved and the human rights crisis continues to deteriorate. Nor did it engage with North Korea\u2019s informal market economy, which has fed the people since the ruling party\u2019s economy collapsed in the 90s. This developed, in spite of any diplomatic policy, as North Koreans acted spontaneously in an attempt to survive.The problem with \u201ccritical engagement\u201d is that it engaged with a totalitarian regime, and chose not to engage with the people and nation underneath it. North Korea was approached as if it was a single entity, and the political administration was prioritised over the individual. By doing so, it sided with the oppressor.Even the threat of sanctions and other forms of \u201cpressure\u201d have not induced change. To be effective, they need to target the regime\u2019s internal raison d\u2019etre and source of power. This is the deliberate prioritisation of resources, and manpower, to maintain the cult of the Supreme Leader \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s the political elite who manage this cult.The frenzied response from North Korean diplomats to the suggestion that the Supreme Leader be referred to the international criminal court for crimes against humanity confirmed that this regime\u2019s institutional sensitivity \u2013 and vulnerability \u2013 is to protecting the cult of Kim at all costs. As such, future North Korean policy must rest on the premise of \u201cseparative engagement\u201d, recognising that the state and people have not been of one interest, and that those maintaining the current political administration are not the only North Koreans with a stake in North Korea. Jang Jin-sung was one of Kim Jong-il\u2019s favourite propaganda poets until his high profile defection from North Korea in 2004Michael P Spavor: \u2018Dennis Rodman\u2019s basketball trips help\u2019Basketball player Dennis Rodman\u2019s 2013 and 2014 visits to the DPRK, in which I played a coordinating role, some might consider, are the best-known recent examples of cultural engagement with the country. Like most things involving the DPRK they were certainly not free from controversy.  Critics said the presence of Rodman was an exercise designed to burnish the reputation of the leadership and raised questions over the wider impact of such visits. But if one understands how the country operates, you\u2019ll see that even high-level contact can have positive effects. As a regular traveller to many parts of the DPRK, through my work arranging cultural, academic and business exchanges, I have been able to assess how the Rodman visits went down amongst the wider population. It went far beyond the larger-than-life personalities covered by the media. The fact that their leader Kim Jong-un was widely seen in national media spending time with an American caught young people\u2019s imagination. \u201cOur leader wants peace and made friends with Mr Rodman, an American, I also would like to be friends with Americans some day,\u201d one 13-year-old said to me in rural North Korea, not far from the Chinese border. This statement \u2013 and I have heard similar opinions voiced across the country in the past two years \u2013 is instructive in two regards, one specific and one general. Firstly, it is important to recognise that young people in the DPRK are raised with, to put it mildly, a negative view of the US and it western allies, making an expression friendship with an American is far more significant than if it came from elsewhere. Related: Dennis Rodman to go back to North Korea \u2013 again  The second broader point is about the impact of meetings between the country\u2019s leadership and representatives from western countries, be it in sport or business \u2013 and I attest that the former can serve as a springboard for the latter. The DPRK is a country where the symbolic activities of the leadership serve a vital role in public life. This is not to say that Koreans are robots who can simply be told what to think (another common misconception) but if they see positive events, such as a friendly symbolic basketball game between the DRPK and an American team, then these conclusions are very likely to be mostly positive. At present we are limited in the ways we can engage. But an understanding of how the DPRK operates should encourage us to provide the country, and most importantly its young people, with clear signs of our positive intentions.Michael Spavor runs cultural exchanges and business tours to North Korea and is known to be close with Kim Jong-unPeople either think that nothing is happening in North Korea, or there is a single monolith of activity that controls everything. The reality is, of course, more complicated.I would love it if people could start thinking about North Korea less as a single system and more as a country with 24 million individuals, many of whom are pragmatic people, keen to run things more efficiently \u2013 either at a micro or macro level. It isn\u2019t really up to us how the country develops \u2013 it\u2019s up to the North Koreans. But if we are able to support the right people, their voices become more prominent and can help improve the range of options in the mix.The non-profit I work for, Choson Exchange, has trained more than 1,000 North Koreans since 2010, who have an insatiable thirst for business and economics knowledge. We\u2019ve taught participants how to improve communications and marketing; we\u2019ve worked with women interested in developing business skills and advised the country\u2019s economists on the special economic zone policy \u2013 a good idea, but missing key elements to make it attractive investment destination.If these exchanges didn\u2019t exist the North Koreans we work with would lack the context to evaluate their own situation and internal discussions would be narrower.It\u2019s still a very challenging environment to operate in, but the other option \u2013 ignoring or actively trying to isolate them, leads to worse outcomes. It is, after all, already a country very good at turning inward.Andray Abrahamian is director of Choson Exchange, a Singaporean non-profit that trains North Koreans in entrepreneurship, economic policy and law.Gareth Johnson: \u2018Tourism can change perceptions and prejudices\u2019We get a lot of flak for taking tourists into North Korea, criticism we\u2019ve received online ranges from reasonable debate to name calling and threats. The question of whether there should be tourism in the DPRK is something we regularly think about and a question we\u2019re often required to answer.The most common charge against tourism is that it \u201cprops up the regime\u201d. This is wrong. Tourism accounts for a minuscule portion of the national economy. If tourism stops, as it did during last year\u2019s Ebola scare, the country still functions as normal. Other critics argue that all the money from tourism goes to the government, but the DPRK is a socialist country and almost all its inhabitants are employed by the state. The money from tourism doesn\u2019t employ soldiers, it supports tour guides, waiters and hotel staff \u2013 normal people with everyday aspirations. Personally, I believe that social, personal and cultural interaction between people of different countries \u2013 particularly when their governments don\u2019t get along \u2013 is always a positive. Since its division from the South, the DPRK has been on a war footing, with all the government-led propaganda that comes with such a situation. When I bring tourists into the DPRK, I feel proud to see them interacting with local people, breaking down barriers and learning about each others\u2019 cultures. This is the real deal, changing deeply ingrained perceptions and prejudices at the grassroots. In addition, while people are happy to use phrases such as \u201chermit kingdom\u201d and the \u201cmost isolated place on earth\u201d when the country tries to slightly open up, for things like the recent Laibach concert, it\u2019s criticised for it not being enough. If we want North Korea to join the global community, we have to embrace any steps the country takes, and accept that tourism is part of that process. You can\u2019t have it both ways.Gareth Johnson is the director of Young Pioneer tours, specialists in budget travel to North Korea", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Dennis Rodman"], "title": "How should the world engage with North Korea?"},{"date": "2015-10-07T05:00:01Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "On Saturday North Korea is throwing a party.

Believe it or not, it is not that hard to visit one of the most repressive, hermetically sealed countries in the world.Unlike Eritrea, Sudan and to a certain extent Angola, North Korea has a modest but established market catering for tourists.

The regime opened a multimillion-pound ski resort last year \u2013 commemorated with its own stamp collection \u2013 and this summer the first tourists rode the waves of the country\u2019s east coast beaches. Want to run a marathon with a difference? This is also possible in North Korea, where tourists were permitted to enter the Pyongyang Marathon for the second year in a row, as long as they completed the course under four hours.There are also specific excursions tailored around moments of civic pride such as the 70th anniversary of the formation of the Korean Workers\u2019 party, this Saturday. Young Pioneer Tours, which specialises in \u201cbudget tours to destinations your mother wants you stay away from\u201d, promises \u201cmass dancing, fireworks and a military parade\u201d.The Arirang Mass Games, used to be another show-stopping fixture in the country. But the event has not taken place for the last few years, reportedly because North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, wants to improve the country\u2019s sporting prowess first. For football fans, the time to start thinking about World Cup 2026 could be now \u2013 North Korea also has ambitions to host the Olympics. The first thing to say about North Korean travel is that it isn\u2019t cheap, with the average tour costing about \u00a31,000. Young Pioneer Tours, the budget end of the market, was charging \u00a3700 for a seven-day tour during the party\u2019s 70th anniversary celebrations. Koryo Tours, which is used by 40% of all tourists to North Korea, is charging \u00a31,140 for five nights. Most tour companies will help customers arrange their visas but it is also possible to apply for one through your nearest North Korean embassy. According to the listings site Embassy Pages, Pyongyang has diplomatic missions in 48 countries, from Syria to Berne in Switzerland, where the teenage Kim went to boarding school.While entry by train through the border of China is possible, most people travel in on Air Koryo\u2019s Soviet-era fleet of planes. North Korea\u2019s national carrier, which was recently voted the world\u2019s worst airline for the fourth time in a row, is banned from entering European airspace owing to safety concerns.Testimonies from tourists are revealing: \u201cThere weren\u2019t enough seats, so they made the locals share two seats between three with insufficient seat belts. The cabin crew all stood up on take off and clung on for dear life. They then served glasses of beer to everyone at 8am and gave out copies of the Pyongyang Times,\u201d said one traveller on Koryo Tours\u2019 Facebook account. Another talked of officials with no assigned seats smoking through the journey. \u201cThe inflight videos were also huge propaganda movies about war and sporting achievements.\u201d Air China also flies into Pyongyang, which has recently had a revamp, although the internet room at the airport was found to be missing a key element: the internet. North Korea is technically still at war with the South and simmering tensions on the peninsula can erupt at a moment\u2019s notice, though visitors are not usually affected. In August an escalation of events \u2013 sparked by a landmine explosion near the border between the two \u2013 led Kim to announce that North Korea was on an official war footing.

Through all this, a group of South Korean footballers was in Pyongyang for a tournament and the avant-garde Slovenian rockers Laibach was there performing, becoming the first western band to play in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).There are isolated cases of western tourists being arrested, such as the Americans Matthew Miller, who ripped up his passport and tried to \u201cclaim asylum\u201d, and Jeffrey Fowle, who left a Bible in a nightclub. Tourists should note that Bibles are banned in North Korea and although its constitution guarantees freedom of religion, the reality is a county ranked as the worst in the world in terms of persecution of Christians, with those who practise openly facing heavy penalties.

You\u2019ve got the money sorted and completed your personal risk assessment but there is a bigger issue at stake: is it ethical? Yes, you fulfil your garish ambitions but are you also complicit in propping up a monstrous regime? Related: Tourists are propaganda: how ethical is your North Korean holiday? Hyeonseo Lee, a defector who escaped North Korea in 1997, finds it hard to fathom why tour companies fully aware of the regime\u2019s atrocities would take people there. Tour companies and others organisations that run exchanges with North Korea argue that gradual interaction with the outside world may be effective in opening up the country and poking holes in the regime.You can get around the ethical conundrum by keeping an eye on the job vacancies of development organisations that operate in the country. However, you\u2019ll have your work cut out: North Korea is not only politically oppressed but it is also blighted by natural disaster and famine. The United Nations has six agencies based there, working with the government to \u201cimprove the quality of life of the people [and] ensure sustainable development\u201d. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA), for example, runs a midwifery programme and helped the country carry out its last national census in 2008. There are also 24 other organisations operating there, including Save the Children and the Red Cross. Development jobs are not the only option. Last year the government announced that they wanted foreign volunteers to help teach English to North Korean tour guides at Pyongyang Tourism College. However, best to think of it as a gap year, in that you have to pay for the privilege: \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3740) a person.

The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too.Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern.For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast.Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets.They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. Related: 'North Korean' boats carrying dead bodies wash ashore in Japan In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast.Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201dMost of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. Related: A life of luxury and adulation for Kim Jong-un impersonators With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants.In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind.But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths.Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance. If they had been found alive we would have done everything we could to help them.\u201dJiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, believes Kim sent out an order in the summer that more seafood should be provided to the army. \u201cThe problem is that the North Korean fishing industry is no longer run on socialist principles,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe fishermen realised that if they donated their catch to the military they would end up losing money, so they started allowing soldiers to go out and catch their own fish.\u201dThat meant bigger hauls, and allowed civilian fishermen to continue earning money for themselves and foreign currency for the regime under Kim\u2019s quasi-capitalist reforms.Ishimaru, who discussed the boat disappearances with contacts by phone in North Korea earlier this week, believes that large numbers of boats carrying soldiers who knew nothing about fishing or navigation left ports in North Korea soon after Kim\u2019s exhortation to increase catches.Typically small, with tiny engines and no GPS navigation instruments or VHF radios, the boats would easily have lost their way in a storm or a strong current and quickly run out of food and fuel.\u201cWhen Kim Jong-un issues an order no one can ignore it, even if he is asking them to do the impossible,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThat means inexperienced soldiers go out to sea, even in terrible conditions and with no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that they are soldiers, so they wear civilian clothes, which is why none of the bodies found in Japan was in uniform.\u201dIn Fukui, concern about the arrival of vessels from North Korea is mixed with sympathy for the people who met such wretched ends, in freezing seas many miles from home. \u201cI expect they were ordered to catch fish by the North Korean government, but of course no one there will take any responsibility for what happened to them,\u201d said Mitsumasa Sakashita, a 67-year-old fisherman in Fukui. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, because they were just like us: fishermen trying to make a living from the sea.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Fishing"], "title": "Mystery of Japan sea's ghost ships points to North Korea"},{"date": "2015-11-12T10:30:39Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "A Japanese newspaper claims it has uncovered evidence that North Korea systematically abducted foreign citizens under its former leader, Kim Jong-il.The Tokyo Shimbun said it had acquired a secret manual, thought to have been written in the late 1990s, that instructs spies how to carry out abductions on foreign soil and evade capture.The newspaper\u2019s report, published this week, lends weight to claims by Japan that the regime had a well-organised network of spies trained to seize foreigners, including dozens of Japanese, and that the abductions were not the work of rogue agents.Japan suspects that 17 of its citizens were snatched in the 1970s and 80s, and taken to North Korea to teach their language and customs to help agents blend in while on assignment in Japan. Related: Don't betray abductees, Tokyo warned The 356-page classified document was used at the Kim Jong-il Political-Military University, a secretive North Korean intelligence institute, the newspaper reported.According to NK News, one section coaches spies on how to conduct overseas abductions, advising them: \u201cTo abduct the target, one has to know the target\u2019s address, where the target enters and exits, day-to-day traffic routes, means of transportation and their timeline as well.\u201dIt goes on to recommend \u201cterminating\u201d targets who resist, adding that agents should not leave \u201ca single trace\u201d of evidence at the scene.The Tokyo Shimbun says the document is the first physical evidence that overseas abductions were carried out with the full knowledge and blessing of North Korea\u2019s leadership.Some, however, have questioned the document\u2019s authenticity, pointing out that the Korean word for \u201cabduction\u201d is written in a style used in South, not North, Korea. In response, the newspaper said it believed the manual was written that way to help its operatives assimilate, as South Korea was the prime target for abductions at the time.\u201cThe people involved in the story are in no doubt that the document is genuine,\u201d a Tokyo Shimbun journalist who reports on North Korea said.The Japanese government is seeking information about at least 12 people it says were abducted by North Korea. In 2002, the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, secured the release of five other abductees, who were later joined by their families, after a summit in Pyongyang with his counterpart Kim Jong-il.Japan refuses to believe North Korean claims that eight of the remaining 12 have died, some in mysterious accidents, and the other four had never entered the country. The missing abductees include Megumi Yokota, who was 13 when she was snatched on her way home from school in Niigata, on the Japan Sea coast, in 1977.North Korea claimed that Yokota had killed herself in 1994 while being treated in hospital for depression. But tests on her alleged remains conducted in Japan in 2004 showed they contained someone else\u2019s DNA. Japanese experts also found inconsistencies in her death certificate.Yokota is thought to have been taken to a spy training facility in Pyongyang soon after she arrived in North Korea. Kyodo News recently quoted a South Korean source as saying that she studied Korean for about three years and then taught Japanese until the mid-1980s. She married a South Korean abductee, with whom she had a daughter.Talks between the two countries on resolving the remaining abductions broke down after making no progress. Japan says it will not normalise diplomatic ties with Pyongyang until the abductions have been resolved.

Even ingredients such as chillies, garlic, onions and salt used for seasoning are in short supply, say sources inside the country.Harvests from collective farms are expected to have halved because of the effects of the adverse weather conditions, a source said, with residents fearing that household allocations will be considerably lower than last year. \u201cAt Chongjin\u2019s Sunam Market, 1kg of cabbage now goes for 3,000 North Korean won ($0.35), which is up 1,000 won from before,\u201d a source said. \u201cRadish prices have climbed by 500 won but they\u2019re still selling at a rapid pace,\u201d the source added. \u201cIf people see someone with radishes and cabbages on an ox cart going by, they will chase after it and offer a higher price to buy the produce, creating a scene.\u201d \u201cBack in August, a lot of vegetable fields in the Hamgyong Provinces and parts of Yanggang were lost to extreme downpours,\u201d she said, \u201cso a lot of households are giving up on kimjang for the year.\u201dCentral authorities have prioritised supply for the Rason area, which was particularly hit hard by devastatingly torrential rains, meaning some other regions have not received a single head of cabbage. Farmers ordered to send supplies to military bases and flood-hit areasare worried about procuring their own kimjang supplies.The source said that North Koreans are reliant on kimchi as a staple food during the winter, and there are already fears of widespread hunger. Related: Kimchi \u2013\u00a0why everyone is going crazy for fiery fermented foods For an average four-person family, a minimum 350kg of cabbages and 200kg of radishes are required during kimjang. A winter\u2019s supply of the fermented cabbage dish also requires 3kg of garlic and 18kg of salt. Usually, this amount of kimchi would cost roughly 1.5m North Korean won, but the source put this year\u2019s estimated cost at 3m , adding that even with this money it is hard to secure the right supplies.A version of this article first appeared on Daily NK, part of the Unification Media Group", "tags": ["North Korea", "Food", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Food & drink"], "title": "North Korea runs short of ingredients for winter kimchi supplies"},{"date": "2015-10-28T11:16:03Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "Over the last two years, 30-year-old Romanian photographer Mihaela Noroc has travelled the world with a backpack and camera shooting portraits of women. So far she\u2019s visited 45 countries for The Atlas of Beauty, a project she hopes will offer insight into how social, cultural and political values shape and define women\u2019s roles and femininity.Noroc\u2019s latest journey took her to North Korea, where she was able to take almost 30 portraits. Her images hint at the reality of everyday life for women in the secretive state. \u201cWhen you hear things about North Korea it is always political,\u201d Noroc explains. \u201cBut my idea was to show another side, to show regular people.\u201dNoroc entered the country via Sinuiju, on the border with China, on a trip organised by Young Pioneer Tours, a company offering visits for foreigners on a tight budget. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice big differences between the people living in the capital and people in other cities \u2013 but of course in Pyongyang, with its large boulevards, there were more people, and so I discovered many more interesting faces.\u201dNoroc explains: \u201cI approached women in the street, accompanied by my two female guides, who helped me explain my project \u2013 this was the routine for most of the portraits.\u201cIn most countries I\u2019ve observed that women smile in front of the camera and that tended to be the case when I shot women in North Korea \u2013 but I here I tried to find something more profound, to get them to open up and reveal something more authentic, to see a story in their eyes.\u201dThough women in North Korea might be unfamiliar with global fashion and beauty because of the regime\u2019s tight control on the flow of information, Noroc noted that this doesn\u2019t mean they are not concerned with their appearance: high heels and conservative outfits \u2013 accessorised with a pin of the chest of their country\u2019s leader \u2013 are common.\u201cWomen [in the DPRK] are definitely more concerned about their looks.\u201cOf course, you could say that is the case in many countries, but in North Korea I felt the gap was much wider in how men and women relate to their physical appearance.\u201d Access to the internet or foreign television is almost nonexistent in the country \u2013 so entertainment must take different forms. Noroc noted that people loved to sing and dance, with concerts in public squares and mass dances for celebrations. The Moranbong Band, an all-female music group whose members were selected by the country\u2019s supreme leader Kim Jong-un, are \u201chugely popular, a phenomenon,\u201d the photographer says. \u201cYou hear their songs everywhere and everyone knows their lyrics \u2013 this singer [pictured below] also sang some of their songs. I also saw a military marching band performing one of their songs.\u201dNoroc was in the country for nine days, and was accompanied by guides most of the time \u2013 \u201cbut not on trains or inside hotels.\u201cI did see other tourists, not many, but since you visit the same places and sleep at the same hotels, you inevitably do see some. My tour was different in that I was able to walk in the streets a lot, and meet many regular North Korean people.\u201d Uniforms are also a very common sight on both men and women. \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s army is huge, so it\u2019s common to see military workers on the streets. Soldiers are sometimes involved in other activities such as construction work, for example, so they\u2019re really everywhere.\u201d\u201cEverybody was telling us that in North Korea they have a saying: \u2018North Korea has the most beautiful women in the peninsula, while South Korea [has] the most beautiful men\u2019.\u201dDespite the unusual nature of Noroc\u2019s project \u2013 and the restrictions placed on North Korean citizens \u2013 the photographer found that women were remarkably willing to take part and seemed happy to have their picture taken. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for them to have their picture taken by foreigners. They were really excited when I was showing them the photos on the screen of my camera.\u201d  Noroc is currently travelling in Nepal for her next series of photographs.

They want to be allowed to visit their hometown and to deliver food personally. The action is premised on humanitarian grounds and can, I believe, do more to help those suffering from acute food shortages than any other initiative to date.If successful, similar activities could follow drawing participants drawn from an estimated 26,000 North Korean refugees and family members separated by the Korean War. This does not require grandiose slogans such as \u201cpeace on the peninsula\u201d or \u201cKorean unification\u201d. Conceptualising it in simple terms, for example \u201clet me help my family, let me see them again\u201d, would be sufficient.The positive humanitarian impact could be huge. If we assume each of the estimated 26,000 North Korean refugees has left behind a four-member household, 104,000 people could benefit. The refugee participants are already able to raise the necessary funds through local humanitarian groups. All that is needed is for the international community, including NGOs and civil societies, to advocate for both Korean governments to authorise this project.The North Korean government may not want to include any refugees in these projects, which will lead some in South Korea to argue that they should not be pursued. But we should persist. The refugees are integral. There is no group of people more saddened by the situation in North Korea, and no group more willing to take part.Obstacles are to be expected, but this project represents the kinds of exchanges that should be actively promoted.Dr Kim Kwang-cheol is a former researcher at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a South Korean government institute which studies/creates policy for inter-Korean affairsDuring my first trip to Pyongyang in 2005, there was insignificant incident that taught me volumes about North Korea\u2019s attitudes to the outside world.My travelling companion stopped to take a photograph of two young children walking along the side of the road. He then leaned over to show them the photos on the digital camera screen (this was pre-smartphones).The North Korean minders escorting us were furious, which perplexed me because the children were well-dressed and well-fed and obviously delighted to see their own images on screen for what was probably the first time.I realised later that the North Korean guides didn\u2019t mind us seeing the children as much as the children seeing us. Here we were two American journalists, unintimidating and in possession of what North Koreans at the time looked like magic \u2013 seeing us irreparably corrupted them.Among the many falsehoods in the North Korean firmament is that they are an advanced, prosperous nation. \u201cWe have nothing to envy in this world,\u201d goes an old ditty sung in nurseries . Anything that belies the claim is corrosive to the regime.And anti-Americanism is the force that gives meaning to the North Korea\u2019s very existence. Americans are supposed to be the great enemy Meeguk nom , \u201cAmerican bastards,\u201d as they say in the state media.But whenever North Koreans meet real live Americans (or other foreigners, as American applies broadly to Europeans), a good impression can chip away at a lifetime of brainwashing.I get frequent emails from western tourists wondering if it is unethical to support a repressive regime by visiting North Korea.I give them always an unequivocal answer. By all means, yes, go. If you are sympathetic to North Korea, visiting the place is the best way to engage. If you hate the regime and wish to hasten its demise, the advice is the same. Go to North Korea. Either way, it is a no-lose proposition.Barbara Demick is the author of the critcally acclaimed novel Nothing to Envy, which charts the lives of six North Korean citizens living in the north-eastern city of ChongjinEuropean states, including the UK, have had a policy of \u201ccritical engagement\u201d with North Korea for the last decade, actively engaging the country but criticising its behaviour at the same time.But what difference has it made? The nuclear issue remains unresolved and the human rights crisis continues to deteriorate. Nor did it engage with North Korea\u2019s informal market economy, which has fed the people since the ruling party\u2019s economy collapsed in the 90s. This developed, in spite of any diplomatic policy, as North Koreans acted spontaneously in an attempt to survive.The problem with \u201ccritical engagement\u201d is that it engaged with a totalitarian regime, and chose not to engage with the people and nation underneath it. North Korea was approached as if it was a single entity, and the political administration was prioritised over the individual. By doing so, it sided with the oppressor.Even the threat of sanctions and other forms of \u201cpressure\u201d have not induced change. To be effective, they need to target the regime\u2019s internal raison d\u2019etre and source of power. This is the deliberate prioritisation of resources, and manpower, to maintain the cult of the Supreme Leader \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s the political elite who manage this cult.The frenzied response from North Korean diplomats to the suggestion that the Supreme Leader be referred to the international criminal court for crimes against humanity confirmed that this regime\u2019s institutional sensitivity \u2013 and vulnerability \u2013 is to protecting the cult of Kim at all costs. As such, future North Korean policy must rest on the premise of \u201cseparative engagement\u201d, recognising that the state and people have not been of one interest, and that those maintaining the current political administration are not the only North Koreans with a stake in North Korea. Jang Jin-sung was one of Kim Jong-il\u2019s favourite propaganda poets until his high profile defection from North Korea in 2004Michael P Spavor: \u2018Dennis Rodman\u2019s basketball trips help\u2019Basketball player Dennis Rodman\u2019s 2013 and 2014 visits to the DPRK, in which I played a coordinating role, some might consider, are the best-known recent examples of cultural engagement with the country. Like most things involving the DPRK they were certainly not free from controversy.  Critics said the presence of Rodman was an exercise designed to burnish the reputation of the leadership and raised questions over the wider impact of such visits. But if one understands how the country operates, you\u2019ll see that even high-level contact can have positive effects. As a regular traveller to many parts of the DPRK, through my work arranging cultural, academic and business exchanges, I have been able to assess how the Rodman visits went down amongst the wider population. It went far beyond the larger-than-life personalities covered by the media. The fact that their leader Kim Jong-un was widely seen in national media spending time with an American caught young people\u2019s imagination. \u201cOur leader wants peace and made friends with Mr Rodman, an American, I also would like to be friends with Americans some day,\u201d one 13-year-old said to me in rural North Korea, not far from the Chinese border. This statement \u2013 and I have heard similar opinions voiced across the country in the past two years \u2013 is instructive in two regards, one specific and one general. Firstly, it is important to recognise that young people in the DPRK are raised with, to put it mildly, a negative view of the US and it western allies, making an expression friendship with an American is far more significant than if it came from elsewhere. Related: Dennis Rodman to go back to North Korea \u2013 again  The second broader point is about the impact of meetings between the country\u2019s leadership and representatives from western countries, be it in sport or business \u2013 and I attest that the former can serve as a springboard for the latter. The DPRK is a country where the symbolic activities of the leadership serve a vital role in public life. This is not to say that Koreans are robots who can simply be told what to think (another common misconception) but if they see positive events, such as a friendly symbolic basketball game between the DRPK and an American team, then these conclusions are very likely to be mostly positive. At present we are limited in the ways we can engage. But an understanding of how the DPRK operates should encourage us to provide the country, and most importantly its young people, with clear signs of our positive intentions.Michael Spavor runs cultural exchanges and business tours to North Korea and is known to be close with Kim Jong-unPeople either think that nothing is happening in North Korea, or there is a single monolith of activity that controls everything. The reality is, of course, more complicated.I would love it if people could start thinking about North Korea less as a single system and more as a country with 24 million individuals, many of whom are pragmatic people, keen to run things more efficiently \u2013 either at a micro or macro level. It isn\u2019t really up to us how the country develops \u2013 it\u2019s up to the North Koreans. But if we are able to support the right people, their voices become more prominent and can help improve the range of options in the mix.The non-profit I work for, Choson Exchange, has trained more than 1,000 North Koreans since 2010, who have an insatiable thirst for business and economics knowledge. We\u2019ve taught participants how to improve communications and marketing; we\u2019ve worked with women interested in developing business skills and advised the country\u2019s economists on the special economic zone policy \u2013 a good idea, but missing key elements to make it attractive investment destination.If these exchanges didn\u2019t exist the North Koreans we work with would lack the context to evaluate their own situation and internal discussions would be narrower.It\u2019s still a very challenging environment to operate in, but the other option \u2013 ignoring or actively trying to isolate them, leads to worse outcomes. It is, after all, already a country very good at turning inward.Andray Abrahamian is director of Choson Exchange, a Singaporean non-profit that trains North Koreans in entrepreneurship, economic policy and law.Gareth Johnson: \u2018Tourism can change perceptions and prejudices\u2019We get a lot of flak for taking tourists into North Korea, criticism we\u2019ve received online ranges from reasonable debate to name calling and threats. The question of whether there should be tourism in the DPRK is something we regularly think about and a question we\u2019re often required to answer.The most common charge against tourism is that it \u201cprops up the regime\u201d. This is wrong. Tourism accounts for a minuscule portion of the national economy. If tourism stops, as it did during last year\u2019s Ebola scare, the country still functions as normal. Other critics argue that all the money from tourism goes to the government, but the DPRK is a socialist country and almost all its inhabitants are employed by the state. The money from tourism doesn\u2019t employ soldiers, it supports tour guides, waiters and hotel staff \u2013 normal people with everyday aspirations. Personally, I believe that social, personal and cultural interaction between people of different countries \u2013 particularly when their governments don\u2019t get along \u2013 is always a positive. Since its division from the South, the DPRK has been on a war footing, with all the government-led propaganda that comes with such a situation. When I bring tourists into the DPRK, I feel proud to see them interacting with local people, breaking down barriers and learning about each others\u2019 cultures. This is the real deal, changing deeply ingrained perceptions and prejudices at the grassroots. In addition, while people are happy to use phrases such as \u201chermit kingdom\u201d and the \u201cmost isolated place on earth\u201d when the country tries to slightly open up, for things like the recent Laibach concert, it\u2019s criticised for it not being enough. If we want North Korea to join the global community, we have to embrace any steps the country takes, and accept that tourism is part of that process. You can\u2019t have it both ways.Gareth Johnson is the director of Young Pioneer tours, specialists in budget travel to North Korea", "tags": ["North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Dennis Rodman"], "title": "How should the world engage with North Korea?"},{"date": "2015-10-07T05:00:01Z", "country": "north%20korea", "content": "On Saturday North Korea is throwing a party.

Related: Dennis Rodman in North Korea: who are the members of his ex-NBA team? But it doesn\u2019t all go according to plan. The film follows the events as \u2013 amid massive press coverage and criticism of Rodman \u2013 sponsors pull out and tempers fray. It\u2019s a tragicomedy, balancing the absurdity of the Rodman\u2019s friendship with the leader of the secretive state with a sympathetic and nuanced eye not usually seen in documentaries about the DPRK.Offland says he first stumbled on the story in 2013, when Rodman, in collaboration with gambling company Paddy Power, announced he was returning to North Korea to put on a basketball game. He\u2019d been to the country before, in February 2013 with Vice and the Harlem Globetrotters (an exhibition basketball team), and having befriended the great leader on his first trip, Rodman was going back to train the national team and organise a US-North Korea game.\u201c[When] I read that announcement, I was sitting at breakfast with my children, and for some reason I said to them \u2018I\u2019m gonna make a film of that\u2019,\u201d he recalls.Offland had also visited North Korea in the past as a tourist and followed developments in the country closely. He felt that his understanding of the place made him the perfect film-maker to chronicle the trip. \u201cI just came in and told [Rodman\u2019s team] \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get away with taking a big crew in there, especially Americans\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cSo then I gave them a proposal, what I thought the documentary was about, and eventually between [Paddy Power] and Rodman they granted me the rights to it. It was a scoop, actually.\u201dThe purpose of the first trip was for Rodman to train and choose the North Korean players who would face-off against the NBA players, but for Offland and his crew it was a chance to build trust.\u201cI think actually the film was used as leverage to make the event happen, weirdly, so I\u2019m on the back of the train and then later I\u2019m driving this thing.\u201dAfter a relatively low-key initial trip to North Korea, Rodman and the crew arrived back in Beijing to a press fanfare. In a particularly memorable scene, they are mobbed at the airport, having to fight their way through a media scrum to escape. Much of the media coverage at the time was condemning the basketball player for his apparent friendship with Kim. We were at the mercy of Dennis\u2019s behaviour much more than I\u2019d anticipatedThis is also when things are shown to start going wrong. With the cold reality of media criticism bearing down on them, Paddy Power pulls out of the event, and under extreme stress, Rodman begins binge drinking and starts behaving erratically. By their first evening back in Pyongyang \u2013 this time with the ex-NBA stars in tow \u2013 it\u2019s clear that Rodman is no longer in control. In a particularly disturbing scene, he gets intoxicated at a state banquet held in his honour on the first night, and begins veering between singing jovial karaoke one minute and angry hollering the next.\u201cWhen he was going off I was thinking \u2018Oh my god we\u2019re at the mercy of Dennis\u2019s behaviour here much more than I\u2019d anticipated\u2019,\u201d says Offland. Rodman\u2019s behaviour is seen to take its toll on the team. In another scene the other NBA players suggest they might pack it all in and go home. It\u2019s around this point in the film\u2019s chronology that Rodman makes his now infamous appearance on CNN, where he rejected calls to assist in the release of American prisoner Kenneth Bae and shouted at interviewer Chris Cuomo.Offland, however, says he never worried his project would be jeopardised. \u201cAnything that was gonna happen was going to be interesting,\u201d he says. The game itself is the highlight of the film. The NBA players dramatically underestimated the speed and skill of their opponents, and are narrowly defeated by the North Koreans in an exhilarating match. At the end of play, Kim himself makes an appearance. \u201cI\u2019ve been to European cup finals, world cup finals, some of the biggest sporting events ever,\u201d Offland says. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced that atmosphere before. It was hair raising, that feeling was absolutely incredible.\u201dAmid the jubilation after the game, the possibility arises to interview the great leader. Rodman and the crew are invited to spend the next few days at the Masikryong Ski Resort \u2013 with the possibly that Kim might attend. Related: How should the world engage with North Korea? \u201cDennis was going to be the one hoping to ask the questions,\u201d says Offland. \u201c You know, that would have been the biggest scoop of all time.\u201cDennis had asked me what I\u2019d ask [Kim]. My question would have been: \u2018Why did you want this event?\u2019 I wasn\u2019t going for anything more in depth than that \u2013 any question I was going to ask was going to be in the context of the match.\u201dBut the interview didn\u2019t happen.
