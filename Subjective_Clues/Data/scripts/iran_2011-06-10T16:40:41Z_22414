Iran has claimed that one of its spies acted as a double agent and infiltrated the Iranian opposition movement as well as foreign intelligence units.Iran's state television has broadcast a documentary showing a man, identified as Mohammad Reza Madhi, who it said worked his way into the heart of the opposition outside the country and even succeeded in meeting western officials including the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the vice president, Joe Biden.Some opposition groups have questioned the veracity of the claims, raising the possibility that Madhi had been arrested or forced to return to Iran as a result of pressure put on his family at home.Meanwhile, the Irna state news agency described the programme, in a report published prior to its broadcast, as the confessions of a man deceived by the CIA.The documentary, called A Diamond for Deception, showed a middle-aged man with a grey-streaked beard who spoke about his undercover mission to collect information from Iran's enemies.The documentary coincides with the second anniversary this weekend of Tehran's popular unrest in the aftermath of Iran's 2009 disputed presidential election, which gave President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a second term in office.The programme's narrator claimed Michael Ledeen, a former consultant to the US national security council and James Woolsey, a former director of the CIA, together with members of the Foundation of Defense of Democracies, a non-partisan policy institute founded after the September 11 attacks, were assigned to foment Tehran's disturbances and form "the Iranian government in exile".According to the programme, Madhi initially introduced himself to the opposition as "a diamond dealer" and approached foreign governments under the guise of a top official wanting to defect from the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard and claiming thousands of his colleagues were ready to join him."We had meeting and discussions, they [US officials] said that we could rely on their help," Madhi said in the programme."They introduced me to Hillary Clinton and [in Saudi Arabia] I had a meeting with her where she was accompanied by [the Saudi Arabian foreign minister] Saud al-Faisal and a translator."Madhi claimed that he later visited Washington after an invitation from Clinton and met other senior US officials, including Biden and the diplomat Dennis Ross.During his time outside Iran, Madhi joined Amir Jahanchahi, an exiled Iranian businessman, who formed a group called Green Wave which is allied with a number of Iranian diplomats who defected after the 2009 unrest.At the same time, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency interviewed an unnamed Iranian intelligence official who said Madhi spent time in a military base in Israel, where he worked with the country's secret services.Further confusion was cast over Madhi's claims after Keyhan – an ultra-conservative newspaper under the direct control of Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran – said he had in fact been arrested and that his remarks were his confessions.Keyhan carried an article about Madhi under the headline: "Confessions of an arrested member of the anti-revolutionaries."He first attracted attention in the west in 2009 when he claimed he had inside information about the Iranian regime, and the Guardian was among a number of media organisations that conducted interviews with him.Nikahang Kowsar, the editor of the opposition Khodnevis website, who had been in touch with Madhi in the past and has published some of his articles, told the Guardian: "It is too soon to release the truth about Madhi."He might have acted as a double agent and it might be similar to the case of Shahram Amiri, the nuclear scientist who Iran claimed was their man, but some others said he returned to Iran after the government threatened his family in Iran."As the anniversary of Tehran's unrest approaches, Iran is once again targeting the green [opposition] movement and wants to boast that it has brought it under its control."The opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi have been placed under house arrest since mid-February.Last year, on the first anniversary of the 2009 election, Iran broadcast a documentary about Neda Agha-Soltan – the young woman whose death was captured by amateur footage and became a symbol of the protest movement – promoting its own version of the events surrounding her death.
