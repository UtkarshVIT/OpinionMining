"Fatigue is likely to be a factor," he said.Next of kin have been informed.New Brighton is a popular tourist destination thanks to its bird life and long sandy beachfront.Maggie Leak, from New Zealand police, told the BBC last night that conditions were clear when the crash happened."It's just a suburban locality and it would have been a beautiful evening in Christchurch last night. It's spring here and it's really still light at that time. It was a beautiful still, clear evening," she said.
