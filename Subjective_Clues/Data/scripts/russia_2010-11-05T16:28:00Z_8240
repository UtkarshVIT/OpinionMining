Georgia and Russia were today heading towards a new crisis after Tbilisi announced it had dismantled a Moscow-run spy ring, arresting four Russians and nine Georgians.The Russian government rejected the charges, denouncing them as a "provocation" timed to disrupt the Russian-Nato summit in Portugal later this month.The crisis comes little more than two years after the countries went to war, with bilateral relations still extremely tense.The interior ministry in Tbilisi said the 13 people arrested were part of a conspiracy inside the Georgian air force and were passing secrets to the Russian GRU military intelligence. In a statement issued today, the ministry said the detainees included six Georgian military pilots accused of passing on secret information about air force operations.Georgian officials alleged that they were recruited by the GRU a decade ago, at the time they were stationed next to a Russian military base in Batumi, on the Black Sea coast.A radio specialist in the Georgian navy was also arrested on charges of giving "secret information to the GRU on military communications and radio call signs".Bakur Kiguradze, a prominent businessman, is one of the Georgian civilians detained. He has been charged with giving the GRU secrets "on military cooperation between Georgia and other countries".Officials said three of the Russian detainees are civilians, including the director and deputy director of Saybolt Georgia, a subsidiary of a Texas-owned oil services company. The fourth is alleged to be their GRU handler.Government officials said the spy ring involved "dozens" of others who have not so far been detained. They said the ring was broken by a Georgian double agent who "gained the trust of Russian military intelligence and started working for this agency as a liaison officer".The statement added: "In order to carry out espionage activities, Russians gave him special computer hardware and software for encrypting the exchanged information."The mole then passed on the equipment to Georgian counter-intelligence, allowing them to break GRU codes, it said.Russia's foreign ministry dismissed the account as fantasy, saying the Georgian government "suffers from chronic spy mania and an anti-Russian bias".But another foreign ministry source told Interfax: "We are deeply outraged over the detention of Russian citizens in Georgia. We are investigating the situation at the moment."Obviously, it was done ahead of the Russia-Nato summit in Lisbon and the OSCE summit in Astana in order to draw as much attention as possible [to Georgia] and to harm Russia."A source in the Russian security services added: "This is the latest invention of Georgia's leadership designed to aggravate the already difficult relations between our countries. Anti-Russian hysteria is gathering tempo in Georgia, and this 'spy scandal' is Tbilisi's latest provocation."The last major spy crisis between the countries erupted after Georgia arrested four Russian military officers in 2006. Moscow recalled its ambassador, evacuated its embassy staff, and cut off air, road and sea links to the former Soviet republic.Shota Utiashvili, the head of analysis at the Georgian interior ministry, insisted the arrests were the result of a careful investigation. "We think it is one of the most serious spy rings we have caught in the country," he said. Thirteen people have been detained over the past year, and there are dozens of others we know that have been connected to the ring," Utiashvili told the Guardian."We know they have been transferring very sensitive information, including military information, to the GRU â€“ unfortunately some of it during the war."Georgian officials said messages were exchanged via picture and music files, sent as emails, which could only be decoded using other picture or music files.According to the Georgian account, the pilots were apparently not well paid for their espionage, and in some cases compensation amounted to little more than a guaranteed military pension.In return, they allegedly signed secret 25-year contracts with the GRU as far back as 2000.At that time, the political landscape in the Caucasus looked very different. There was a powerful Russian military presence in Batumi, where the two countries controlled neighbouring bases, and the surrounding Adzharia region was run by a secessionist warlord, Aslan Abashidze. Abashidze was ousted in 2004, and Adzharia was put back under Tbilisi's rule.Since a week-long war in August 2008 over control of the pro-Russian South Ossetia enclave, Russian forces have withdrawn from most of Georgia, but Moscow retains control of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.Relations between Tbilisi and Moscow have wavered between tense and hostile since the 2003 rose revolution in Georgia brought down Eduard Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign minister, and brought to power a young, nationalist, government under the current president, Mikheil Saakashvilli.
