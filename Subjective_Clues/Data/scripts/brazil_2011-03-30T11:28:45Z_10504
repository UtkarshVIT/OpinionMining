Brazil is considering offering financial support to Portugal to help its former colonial power avoid being sucked even deeper into its debt crisis.Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff said on Wednesday that her government was studying ways in which it could buy Portuguese government debt. Another option would be to give Portugal a cash injection by buying back some of the Brazilian government debt it currently owns."One of the possibilities is buying part of Portugal's sovereign debt," Rousseff told the Diário Económico newspaper. "We are also examining other alternatives such as early buyback of Brazilian bonds held by the Portuguese government."Brazil broke away from Portugal in 1822, but the countries enjoy close political and economic ties. According to the International Monetary Fund, the Brazilian economy is now almost 10 times larger than that of Portugal.Any lifeline from Brazil would be welcome for Portugal, whose debt costs have spiked to record highs this week. Its credit rating was lowered to the brink of "junk" status on Tuesday and many City economists believe a rescue package is becoming inevitable."With Portugal being one false step away from losing investment-grade status, it is only going to make it more difficult for them to fund themselves in the market and it is possible that this downgrade is the tipping point that leads to an EU bailout," said Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income research at Evolution Securities.But Jenkins was not convinced that Rousseff's suggestion, made during an official visit to Portugal, would actually result in financial support for the Lisbon government.Uwe Parpart, Cantor Fitzgerald's chief economist in Asia, agreed that Portugal was "closer to having to go to Brussels, begging bowl in hand, and ask for a bailout".On Tuesday, Rousseff's predecessor as president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, urged Portugal to resist a rescue package. "Whenever the IMF tried to take care of countries' debts, it created more problems than solutions," he said.The yield, or effective interest rate, on Portuguese two-year government bonds rose to about 7.6% on Wednesday, closer to the 10-year bonds which broke through the 8% barrier this week."As the two-year yield jumps and catches up with the 10-year, Portugal is now priced to fail," Parpart said.
