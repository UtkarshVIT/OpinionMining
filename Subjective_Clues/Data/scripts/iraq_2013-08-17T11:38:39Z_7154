It is a picture all too familiar from Syria: the slender green span of a newly constructed pontoon bridge crossing the Tigris river from the Syrian bank to the Iraqi province of Dohuk almost invisible beneath the weight of refugees.They stretch at least a dozen deep for hundreds of metres back into the evening light, the dust from the feet of the milling crowd on the far side, waiting to cross, lit up by the setting sun.The first group to cross was small, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva. On Thursday at lunchtime 750 crossed into Iraq. By afternoon thousands had followed them."The factors allowing this sudden movement are not fully clear to us," UNHCR spokesperson Adrian Edwards told reporters in Geneva. Some of the Syrians had reportedly been waiting near the Tigris river for two to three days, camped at a makeshift site. UNHCR monitors at the border saw scores of buses arriving on the Syrian side dropping off more people seeking to cross. Edwards added that both the Syrian and Iraqi sides of the frontier at the Peshkhabour crossing are normally tightly controlled.According to the UN many of the new arrivals, largely families, had travelled to border from Aleppo, Efrin, Hassake and Qamishly. Some families told UNHCR they had relatives residing in northern Iraq."UNHCR and partner agency teams, together with local authorities, worked into the early hours of this morning to aid the new arrivals," Edwards said.With refugee numbers from the war in Syria totalling some 3 million in the region, the latest arrivals in Iraq, which increasingly been destabilised by the war in its neighbour, have raised renewed concern about Baghdad's ability to deal with the fallout from the conflict.On Friday Baghdad requested new help to fight extremists less than two years after the withdrawal of US combat troops.The Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, told reporters he had asked for a US assistance package including advisers, intelligence analysis and surveillance assets including lethal drones."There is greater realisation in the Iraq government that we should not shy away from coming and asking for some help and assistance," Zebari told reporters on Friday in Washington.He described US interest in Iraq after the 2011 troop withdrawal as "indifferent, completely" but said that seemed to shift as the White House realised al-Qaida's resurrection there."Recently I noticed, and during this visit specifically, there is a renewed interest because of the seriousness of the situation and the challenges," Zebari said. "I think that is because of the threat of terrorism, the threat of the renewal of al-Qaida and its affiliates has become a serious, serious concern to the US."American troops left Iraq in December 2011 as required under a 2008 security agreement. Both countries tried to negotiate plans, but failed, to keep at least several thousand US forces in Iraq beyond the deadline to maintain security. But the proposal fell through after Baghdad refused to give the troops immunity from legal charges, as Washington demanded.Zebari attributed the insurgency's comeback to its partnerships with al-Qaida fighters in neighboring Syria and outlawed Ba'ath party extremists in Iraq's south.Intelligence experts have described the terror group's footing in Iraq and Syria as a new al-Qaida hub in the Middle East, one that has sought for years to underscore Baghdad's inability to protect its people.
