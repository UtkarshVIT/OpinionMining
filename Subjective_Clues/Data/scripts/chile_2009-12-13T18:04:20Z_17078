Rodrigo García Pinochet, a grandson of Augusto Pinochet, attempted to revive the family's political dynasty by running for congress today.Images of the late dictator were used in the 33-year-old economist's campaign in one of Santiago's richest and most conservative districts. The general's widow, Lucía Hiriart, said her husband would have been proud of his favourite grandson.Many conservative voters still revere the surname but the main centre-right alliance snubbed him as an embarrassing reminder of a fraught past. He ran as an independent.The Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón complicated the campaign by threatening to seize up to $100m from Banco de Chile as part of an investigation into Pinochet family funds.Rodrigo Pinochet was the last relative to see the dictator alive, in December 2006 as the 91-year-old general lay dying in his hospital bed. He was also the only relative to accompany his grandfather on the ill-fated flight to London in 1998 that led to the dictator's arrest and protracted extradition case.
