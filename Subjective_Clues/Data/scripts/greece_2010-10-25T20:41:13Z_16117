For hundreds of thousands of migrants hoping to reach Europe from Turkey, the journey comes to an abrupt end in a Greek internment centre.Conditions in the centres are so harsh that last week the UN's special rapporteur on torture, Manfred Nowak, described them as inhuman.On islands such as Samos and Lesbos, which border the Turkish coast, it is not uncommon for as many as 30 men to be kept in a room sharing a single toilet and filthy mattresses. Basic commodities such as soap and razor blades are rare. Without interpreters, bewildered refugees, mostly from Africa, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere in Asia, are unable to communicate with officials.Concerned locals do their best, handing out food and clothes, but despite the election of a socialist government which has taken a more sympathetic approach to migrants, observers say the conditions have brought shame on Greece.Last year, amid chaotic scenes, hundreds of migrants in a detention centre on Lesbos demonstrated against their treatment. Children on hunger strike protested by setting fire to mattresses and attacking guards.Since assuming office last October, George Papandreou's government has made efforts to sensitise local authorities, particularly border and coastguard officials long accused of forced expulsions and pushing migrants back across the porous frontiers Greece shares with Turkey.But coping with the influx is far from easy. With a coastline that stretches for more than 10,000 miles, Greece has become Europe's front line. As its emergency request this week revealed, it is desperately in need of help.Helena Smith
