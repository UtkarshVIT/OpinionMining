Chinese anti-corruption authorities have placed Ling Jihua, a top aide to the former president Hu Jintao, under investigation for graft, state media reported.Ling, 58, is under investigation for “suspected serious disciplinary violation” – almost always shorthand for corruption – the state newswire Xinhua said in a terse report, without giving further details.Ling, 58, is one of the highest-ranking Communist party officials to be caught up in President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption drive, the most intense and wide-ranging in China’s recent history.Analysts say the campaign has allowed Xi to consolidate power by undermining rivals while concurrently improving the party’s public image. This month, anti-corruption authorities formally arrested the former security tsar Zhou Yongkang, the country’s highest-ranking official to be prosecuted in more than three decades.In the spring of 2012, months before Xi would replace Hu in a once-in-a-decade leadership transition, Ling’s 23 year-old son Ling Gu crashed a Ferrari while joyriding in Beijing, killing himself and seriously injuring two women. Ling allegedly attempted to engineer a coverup, and fallout from the scandal changed the dynamics of the transition, allowing Xi to replace many of Hu’s top allies with his own.From 2007 until 2012, Ling directed the party’s general office, an administrative body with close ties to China’s top leaders. Analysts believed that Hu was grooming him for advancement to the party’s seven-person politburo standing committee, its highest decision-making body. After the crash, Ling was given a less-vaunted post as head of the United Front Work Department, a government agency that oversees ethnic minority relations, crushing his chances of promotion.Ling was born in a coalmining region of northern China’s Shanxi province, and joined the party when he was 20. He quickly ascended the ranks as Hu’s protege and a member of the Communist Youth League, a prominent party faction.“The question is not so much why Ling Jihua was in trouble, it’s why it took so long for Ling Jihua to get into trouble,” said Steve Tsang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Nottingham. “And I think the most likely explanation was that Xi Jinping needed the support of the Communist Youth League and Hu Jintao [to bring down Zhou Yongkang], so basically left Ling Jihua alone. It was a very pragmatic move.”Anti-graft authorities tightened the net around Ling in recent months, placing several of his former associates and two of his brothers under investigation. One of the brothers, Ling Zhengce, was a high-ranking official in Shanxi; the other, Ling Wancheng, was an elite businessman and amateur golfer.
