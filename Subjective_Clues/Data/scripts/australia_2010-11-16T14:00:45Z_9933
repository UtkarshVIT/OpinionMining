In the night, there had been yowls, growls and screams, so I expected that, in the morning, I would find some good film of our nocturnal visitors.The Tasmanian devil monitoring team had come to our house in north-west Tasmania, and had left me with an infra-red camera. We had skewered a fresh, large bone into the earth, a couple of metres from the camera. Each morning, I collected the camera's card and on my computer viewed some of the noisy characters who had tackled the bone.There were all sizes of devils, from a big male to youngsters born this year, and females, one appearing with her pouch so large it dragged on the ground, and on a later visit, the pouch was empty. Each devil has an individual pattern of white patches in the black fur, so, when viewed from all angles, it is possible to identify individuals.The monitoring team had caught many of these animals over the previous three nights, and had weighed, microchipped, sexed, estimated ages from their teeth and, crucially, had looked for signs of the Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD).First described in the far north-east in 1996, it is so virulent that more than 90% of the devil population has been lost in the affected areas. However, the spread of the disease has slowed, leaving the south-west and the north-west disease-free so far.DFTD is a highly infectious cancer, that is transmitted through biting, which occurs in fighting, mating and play. Tumours grow rapidly around the face and jaws, which become ulcerated, bleeding and so large that they prevent feeding, so the animal starves to death. It is a terrible sight to see an affected mother, still feeding her pups in her pouch.The Tasmanian devil, (Sarcophilus harrisii) does not deserve its ferocious reputation. Since the extinction of the Tasmanian Thylacine, it is the last large carnivorous marsupial in the world. It mainly eats carrion, but is threatened by loss of habitat, by land-clearance, by death on the roads and now DFTD.The Save the Tasmanian Devil Programme, co-ordinated through the University of Tasmania, includes laboratory research, isolation of quarantined devils in sanctuaries and zoos, monitoring teams and public education.If all this fails, the Tasmanian devil goes the way of the Thylacine, and we are all impoverished.
