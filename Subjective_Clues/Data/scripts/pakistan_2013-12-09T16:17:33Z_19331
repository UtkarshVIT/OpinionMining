Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel attempted to bolster the US's fraught relationship with Pakistan during a rare visit to the country – the first by a US defence secretary in more than three years.With Pakistan running dangerously low on foreign exchange, and the US wanting Islamabad's assistance to help wind down the 12-year war in Afghanistan, both sides are keen for strong ties.But Hagel's trip was overshadowed by yet another row over CIA drone strikes, which has led to the suspension of trucks carrying vital supplies to troops in Afghanistan along certain roads in Pakistan. A government statement did not say Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, demanded an end to US attacks.But he conveyed Pakistan's "deep concern over continuing US drone strikes", stressing that they were "counter-productive to our efforts to combat terrorism and extremism on an enduring basis".There are continued suspicions that Pakistan's army, and perhaps even civilian leaders, continue to give some level of consent to the officially clandestine CIA programme, which the US regards as the only effective way to tackle militant groups holed up on Pakistan's unruly western border. But sporadic air strikes continue to cause intense anger and dismay in Pakistan.One was the killing of Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, on 1 November. Although his violent campaign against the Pakistani state meant he had long been regarded as public enemy number one, his death came at a time when the government had been attempting to initiate peace talks with militants.Another attack on 21 November on a site associated with the feared Afghan insurgent group the Haqqani Network, caused further outrage, in part because it took place inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the province where opposition politician Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leads the ruling coalition government.The attack prompted Khan to order an unofficial blockade of Nato convoys travelling through the province.Although it was unclear how effective the protest had been, last week Nato announced that it had suspended all cargo travelling along that route to ensure the safety of drivers.A statement released by the US embassy in Islamabad said Hagel had "raised the importance of keeping the ground supply routes out of Afghanistan open", in addition to discussing the problems of Afghan insurgents hiding in Pakistan."The secretary stressed that as International Security Assistance Forces draw down over the course of 2014, US and coalition partners remain resolved to not let militants destabilise the region," the statement said.Hagel also met Raheel Sharif, the recently appointed head of Pakistan's army, which has a significant say in national policy towards Afghanistan.Pakistan has attempted to improve relations with the US for several months. But, with foreign currency reserves shrinking fast, it is in a weak position to make demands of the US.In a sign of growing desperation, the finance minister last week asked the US ambassador for cash payments under the "Coalition Support Fund" programme that is designed to help Pakistan recoup the costs of supporting the US-led effort in Afghanistan.But CSF funds have been held up in the past during low points in the relationship between the two sides, particularly during a seven-month ban on Nato supplies in 2012 following the killing by US aircraft of Pakistani soldiers on the Afghan border.
