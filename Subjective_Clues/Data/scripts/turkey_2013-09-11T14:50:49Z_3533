The family of a British woman shot dead in Turkey said on Wednesday that they could not understand why she was targeted.Catherine Anne Bury, who was known as Anne, died when she was gunned down at the family's holiday villa in Dalyan, in the south-west of the country, on Monday morning, while celebrating her 56th birthday. Her son Alex, 24, and mother Cecillia, 87, were also injured in the attack.On Wednesday, her family released a statement thanking people for their warm wishes and messages of condolence."Although our family are still deeply shocked and grieving for Anne, we are pleased to say that both Anne's mother and son are recovering from their injuries and have both been given wonderful care, treatment and support by hospital and consulate staff and many other local people," it said."It appears that the person that Anne employed as a general gardener/handyman, to look after her holiday villas, has committed this terrible crime. We cannot comprehend the mentality of somebody who would do this to three lovely people who would never harm anybody."We would like once again to thank everyone for their kindness and offers of help â€“ they are a great source of strength to us."The family asked that their peace and privacy be respected. A 46-year-old man has appeared in court and been detained in prison.Cecillia Bury was released from the Fethiye state hospital on Tuesday. Alex Bury, who lived with his mother, remains in hospital in a stable condition after being shot in the leg during the attack. Speaking from his bed at the Mugla University hospital, he told the Times he recognised the gunman as Veil Acar, their gardener.According to the local authorities, Acar, whom they have identified only by his initials, had an argument with Anne Bury on Friday during which he threatened her and her family. Police were called but he was released in the early hours of Sunday morning as police had insufficient proof that he had committed a crime.Alex Bury, who was taking a year out of university but hoping to restart his studies in medicine, said: "I tried to reason with him. I told him it didn't have to be this way."He lifted the gun to his shoulder and gestured for me to go through to my mother and grandmother's room."Prayers were said for Anne Bury in her home village of Swainby, in North Yorkshire, on Tuesday.
