Australia is the "the only mature market in the western world where more money is spent on newspaper advertising than any other medium", says Mark Hollands, ceo of the Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers' Association. On that basis he told a PANPA conference: "This is possibly the most exciting time to be in newspapers because... every day we have to face the challenge of thinking about things differently, working collaboratively and trying techniques we've never tried before."Australia's prime minister Kevin Rudd told the same conference that he is the only person in his family who still reads a newsprint paper. "I am the 'last of the Mohicans' in our family," he said. "Neither my wife or any of my three kids read a newspaper. They read it all online. And that's just the way it's been for the last several years." (Sources: FollowTheMedia/Gold Coast Bulletin/ABC)
