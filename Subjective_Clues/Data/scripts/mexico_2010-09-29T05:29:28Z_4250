Eleven people are missing after a mudslide hit a remote town in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, officials said this morning.Hundreds of people were believed to have been buried in the slide, which hit the town of Santa Maria de Tlahuitoltepec early yesterday, but Mexico's interior minister, Francisco Blake, and the governor of Oaxaca, Ulises Ruiz, both said the slide was not the catastrophe first feared."So far no one is confirmed dead, only 11 missing who we hope ... will be found," Ruiz said..Initial reports the rural mountain town 373 miles (600km) south-east of Mexico City said a hillside collapsed on hundreds of sleeping residents after several days of heavy rains in the aftermath of a hurricane and tropical storm that hit Mexico and Central America.Civil protection authorities first reported seven people killed and at least 100 missing, but Ruiz later reported casualties as four dead and 12 missing.Jose Alfredo Garcia, spokesman for Mexico's interior department, said initial reports were based on the number of homes hit by the mudslide, but at the time no federal or state officials had reached the site to check the estimates.Communications with the town were difficult after the pre-dawn slide. Soldiers and civil protection and Red Cross workers couldn't reach the area for nearly 10 hours because mud and rocks blocked roads and a bridge was damaged, while bad weather prevented helicopters from being used.Mexican president Felipe Calderon yesterday reported on his Twitter account that an army commander and 30 soldiers had reached the town by foot and that there was a lot of damage, but "perhaps not of the magnitude initially reported".Donato Vargas, an official in Santa Maria de Tlahuitoltepec reached by a satellite telephone, had said as many as 300 homes were believed to buried, and residents who made it out early in the morning said they had no success digging out neighbours."We have been using a backhoe but there is a lot of mud. We can't even see the homes, we can't hear shouts, we can't hear anything," Vargas said, adding that the slide had dragged houses packed with sleeping families some 1,300 feet (400 meters) down the hillside along with cars, livestock and light poles."We were all sleeping and all I heard was a loud noise and when I left the house I saw that the hill had fallen," Vargas said. "We were left without electricity, without telephone and we couldn't help them. There was no way to move the mud."One person was reported killed in a mudslide in another Oaxaca community, Villa Hidalgo, and 30 people were killed Monday in a slide in Colombia. Heavy rains, including some delivered by the remnants of Hurricane Karl and then Tropical Storm Matthew, also have produced deadly floods in southern Mexico and Central America.Oaxaca Civil Protection operations coordinator Luis Marin said the state had seen three days straight of intense rain. The state government warned residents south of the city of Oaxaca of flooding from overflowing rivers and opened shelters in other parts of the state.
