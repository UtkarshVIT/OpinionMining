Switzerland's press council has upheld a complaint against a magazine that used a cover picture of a Roma boy waving a gun with the headline "The Roma are coming: raids in Switzerland."The council censured the Zurich weekly Weltwoche for "distortion" and "discrimination". It was revealed that the picture, which showed the boy playing with a toy gun on a garbage dump, was taken in Kosovo in 2008.European Roma and Sinti groups condemned the cover as likely to fuel prejudice against members of the two ethnic minorities, also called Gypsies.Source: AP via ABC
