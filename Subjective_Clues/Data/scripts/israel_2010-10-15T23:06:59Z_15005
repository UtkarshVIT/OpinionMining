The letter published about the activities of the Jewish National Fund (7 October) was misconceived in its approach and inaccurate in its content. Since its creation, JNF's focus has been on developing and sustaining the environment in Israel. This has involved planting trees, addressing the water shortage and building the infrastructure Israel needs to prosper. Our current focus on the Negev region clearly reflects these aims. To accuse the JNF of being "actively complicit in the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians" represents a distortion of the truth on the grandest of scales. Our environmental and humanitarian work is not based on any political or religious affiliation, but rather on supporting Israel and its population â€“ whatever their background. This was the case before the modern state of Israel was created and will continue to be the case long into the future.Samuel HayekChairman, JNF UK
