Updated 6pm: A new conflict... but the same tragic story for journalists. Kurdish photographer Kamaran Najm Ibrahim was shot dead yesterday covering clashes between Kurdish security forces and the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) in Kirkuk.It is not known whether he was targeted by a sniper or killed in crossfire. The Kurdish forces prevailed over ISIS, an al-Qaida splinter group by seizing Kirkuk and Mosul. Both had been abandoned by the Iraqi army."As the fighting in Iraq escalates, it is imperative that journalists be allowed to cover the news unharmed and without threat," said Sherif Mansour, of the Committee to Protect Journalists. "Journalists are civilians and must be treated as such."Update: Ibrahim, 27, was a co-founder of MetroGraphy, an agency representing more than 100 Iraq-based photographers and photojournalists, reports Time magazine.Ibrahim's work has been published in the Washington Post, Vanity Fair, The Times and Financial Times.Sources: Source: CPJ/Time
