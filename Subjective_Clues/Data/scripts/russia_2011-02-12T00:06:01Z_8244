Luke Harding's expulsion from Russia (Editorial, 8 February) is another sign of the shrinking space for free speech in the country. Russia is becoming synonymous with intimidation of journalists, as well as a spate of murders. It is already the third most deadly country in the world for journalists. Last year Amnesty supported an appeal by Russian journalists to President Medvedev for increased protection, thorough investigations into unsolved attacks, and full implementation of Article 144 of the penal code, which criminalises the obstruction of lawful activity by journalists. Next week the UK hosts a visit by Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov. Ministers here must tell him that journalists in Russia must be able to do their jobs without fear and without being summarily ejected.Graham JonesRussia country co-ordinator, Amnesty International UK
