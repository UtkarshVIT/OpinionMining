London-based property site Nestoria has expanded again, this time starting out in Europe's biggest internet market, Germany with Nestoria.de. Ed Freyfogle - who we profiled on the site in January - said the site has partnered with some heavyweights in German classified advertising, including the newspaper publishers Sueddeutsche and Kalaydo, Deutsche Telekom's ImmobilienScout24, AxelSpringer's Immonet and some web specialists MyImmoWorld, S-Immobilien and 1a-immobilienmarkt... and those are just for starters.It's a very simple property search service, very sensibly taking more than a few leaves from Google's style book. Rather than setting up deals with estate agents, which makes for those swathes of very samey property sites, Nestoria trawls the web for the latest properties, both for sale and rent, and indexes those in that familiar search engine manner. It's the simplicity and technical competence of this site which has got it attention - and these partnership deals, which see them white labelling their property search for these ad and media sites; just as they have for the Independent and Channel 4 in UK and property industry blog immobilienportale in Germany.And this follows Nestoria's last launch for the Italian market in July. Great to see a startup concentrate on the EU, despite the language issues. Freyfogle said that each of those are very different and there will be inevitable fine tuning of the German site over the next few months.One day Elevator Pitch - the next day the world!
