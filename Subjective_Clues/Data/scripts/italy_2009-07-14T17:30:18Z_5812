Of all wedding customs, the bouquet toss is arguably the most controversial. Described on marthastewart.com as the "suspenseful moment when the single women gather behind the bride - to see who will be the next to get married", it is scarcely a favourite with feminists.No one, though, has argued it could prompt life-threatening injuries. Until now. Isidoro Pensieri, 44, was today recovering at a hospital in Pisa from serious facial and head injuries and two broken legs, sustained when the ultra-light aircraft in which he was travelling crashed near a restaurant at which a wedding reception was being held.Martha Stewart recommends that to "get the blossoms to the wallflowers", the bride should stand "on a balcony, the top of a staircase or a chair". But at this particular wedding in the Tuscan countryside, it was decided to make what proved to be an imprudent break with tradition.Pensieri was entrusted with the bouquet so that he could cast it dashingly into the outstretched arms of the unmarried female guests as the plane swooped by. According to Italian news agency reports, however, the flowers disappeared into the tail rotor, causing an explosion in the motor and pitching the ultra-light into a dive. After just missing a hostel in which some 50 young people were gathered, the aircraft plunged to earth in a wood.The pilot, 61 year-old Luciano Nannelli, escaped unhurt from the crash, which happened near the town of Suvereto, near Livorno.
