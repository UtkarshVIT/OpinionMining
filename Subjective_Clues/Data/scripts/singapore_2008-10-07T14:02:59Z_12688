Shares in British Land have been lifted by news that the Singaporean government has increased its stake in the property group.The country's GIC sovereign wealth fund, which first declared a stake in January, has bought 500,000 more shares to take its holding to 6.16%. The news saw British Land climb 9p to 739p.In January, the company's shares were north of 900p but have fallen back in the wake of severe declines in property prices.Perhaps the Singapore fund believes an upturn is on the way.
