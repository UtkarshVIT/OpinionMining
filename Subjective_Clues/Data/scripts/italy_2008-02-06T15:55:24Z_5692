The cabinet of the caretaker prime minister, Romano Prodi, who co-signed the dissolution decree, announced an election for April 13-14.The former prime minister, media magnate and chief opposition rival, Silvio Berlusconi, had been clamouring for a snap election.The president said he made the decision to dissolve parliament with "regret", adding that it "was made necessary by the negative outcome" of efforts by senate speaker Franco Marini to form an interim government tasked with reforming Italy's electoral system.Marini's efforts stumbled on the refusal of Berlusconi and his allies to countenance anything but a return an election.Napolitano said that calling early elections was as "anomaly which will not be without consequences for the governability of the country".After Prodi's centre-left government was brought down by the defection of a tiny centrist party after 20 months in power, much of the political class as well as the electorate called for an overhaul of the voting system before any new elections.The poll will be held just over two years after Prodi defeated Berlusconi in the closest election in modern Italian history. This time around the media billionaire will be up against Walter Veltroni, the popular 52-year-old mayor of Rome and poster boy for the left.
