Nato will continue to meet Russian government officials but will halt all other cooperation to send a "very clear message to Russia", said secretary general of the alliance, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, in Brussels last week.Moves that have been stopped included a proposed joint mission with Russia involving the destruction of Syrian chemical weapons.But what about the sale of conventional weapons by the west to Russia?In the House of Commons on Monday, David Cameron, the UK prime minister confirmed what the department for business had already suggested- namely, that the government would review all outstanding British arms export licences to Russia.More than £80m of licences for arms to Russia were granted last year alone, for a wide range of equipment.They included ammunition, and equipment for military aircraft and helicopters, according to official figures.One licence was for an unlimited number of parts for military aircraft, including helicopters.Britain has sold more than £400m worth of arms to Russia since 2008, compared to just £24m to Ukraine, official figures show.The licences were granted though the Foreign Office listed Russia as one of the countries about which it had human rights concerns. It warned, in its latest annual report, of "a marked deterioration [in human rights], characterised by attempts to control civil society, restrict political opposition and marginalise minority groups".Sir Malcolm Bruce, chairman of the Commons on arms export controls, said on Monday: "We should only really be doing military trade with our allies and friends."He said he recognised the need for the arms industry but that "in situations like this, we finish up selling weapons to people who, if they do not use them against us, they use them against our friends."Bruce said Britain should be very sceptical when it came to "selling to people we can't trust or where there is a risk of misuse". Russia certainly fell into that category, he said.He is to raise the issue with members of his Commons arms controls committee. Andrew Smith, spokesman for the Campaign Against Arms Trade, described the case as an example of a UK foreign policy that all too often failed to take regional tensions into account and "prioritises short term arms sales above the safety of citizens."Britain should stop selling arms to the region and, instead, promote stability and human rights there.Agreeing an EU-wide arms embargo - or any other sanctions - on Russia will not be easy given the extent of their trade, Germany's in particular, with that country. • Sir Peter Tapsell, Father of the House (of Commons) asked David Cameron why it was acceptable to allow the Scots to have a referendum on constitutional arrangements established in 1707 while it was not acceptable for Russian nationalists to have a vote on constitutional arrangements dating from 1954 - the year Nikita Krushchev, then Soviet leader, gave Crimea to Ukraine as a "gift".Western governments condemn the proposed referendum in Crimea while insisting that the people of Ukraine should be allowed to express their views. The difference, Cameron said, was that the Scottish referendum was legal. I remain puzzled.
