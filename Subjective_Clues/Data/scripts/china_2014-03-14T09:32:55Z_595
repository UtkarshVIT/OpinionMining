 Five people were hacked to death and one fatally shot at a market in the southern city of Changsha on Friday morning, according to local police.A fight between two peddlers ended when one stabbed the other to death, and “in the process of fleeing,” hacked at four pedestrians before police arrived and shot him dead on the scene, the Changsha public security bureau announced via its official microblog. Two victims died at the scene and the other two died in hospital.A Hunan traffic radio station said via its verified microblog feed that the man was a breadseller, and had worked at the market for three or four years. It added that a female vendor died in the incident. That was echoed by another journalist in Changsha, who said a row between vendors had spiralled. Local media reported that the attack took place near a primary school, which had kept its pupil inside as reports of the incident emerged.The @peopledaily_us Twitter feed of the official People’s Daily said: “4 dead, including one attacker gunned down by cops. Police captured 1 and 3 attackers at large.”Photographs circulated on social media, which appeared to match with photos of the location in official media, showed bodies lying on the ground.Another photograph circulating on social media showed a man with a moustache, wearing a sweater and shirt, being taken away by police.An official at the Hunan government propaganda office confirmed that fatalities and casualties had been reported but said he had no further details.A woman at the neighbourhood office said she could not comment as she was frightened of saying the wrong thing and spreading rumours.The incident comes after five assailants knifed passersby at Kunming train station without warning on 1 March, killing 29 and injuring many more. In that case the government has blamed separatists from the north-west region of Xinjiang.Additional research by Cecily Huang
