The surprise appointment of Bank of Canada governor, Mark Carney, to lead the Bank of England has been received as a compliment and a loss in Canada.In September 2008, as interbank capital liquidity hoarding precipitated a financial tsunami from which Europe is still reeling, Carney ensured liquidity for borrowers through the central bank, cut interest rates to a historically low 0.25%, kept inflation under control, and ensured Canada borrowed at the best possible rates.The 47-year-old Harvard and Oxford educated Canadian economist has a mission to reform the banking system so that taxpayers never again have to bail out "too big to fail" banks.Former Canadian prime minister and minister of finance, Paul Martin, said that he was "very disappointed" to see Carney leave Canada "He has been an outstanding governor of the bank of Canada as well as a very progressive head of the financial stability board." The "silver lining", said Martin, is that Carney's appointment "bodes well for the economies in Canada, the United States, China and elsewhere"."If what you're looking for is somebody who understands of the inner working of the banking system domestically, but at the same time its interconnections globally, and what has to be done globally, I think you've got a very, very strong person," said Martin.Duncan Cameron, from the Centre for Global Political Economy at Simon Fraser University, said Carney "has demonstrated in the Canadian context a quite uncanny ability to get things done under difficult circumstances", adding that "as governor he hasn't made any wrong steps".Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, many Canadian banks and financial institutions held worthless mortgaged-backed bonds while other major players held none. Carney managed to negotiate a bailout settlement to share the losses.Carney "turned his back on a very lucrative career in private banking to go into a public service job where his first job was to try and bang heads together and try and remedy an almost impossible situation", said Cameron."A lot of people wouldn't want to get up in the morning if they had to face that kind of situation and he seems to have thrived on it."The Canadian banking system, which is made up of five large banks, has been ranked the most sound in the world five years in a row by the World Economic Forum, which praised it for being "well-capitalised, well-managed and well-regulated".Canadian banks make loans on a case-by-case basis, depending on the creditor's ability to repay. Many of the high-risk and complex financial instruments that exacerbated the subprime mortgage fiasco in the US do not exist in Canada. This prudence has proven key to Canada's performance compared to its neighbour, which jumped on to the exotic, and ultimately toxic, trades bandwagon peddled by Wall Street and City of London.While it is often boasted that after the 2008 financial crisis, Canadian banks didn't need a bailout, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives has argued that Canadian banks profited from a secret bailout in the form if $114bn (7% of Canada's GDP) in emergency liquidity from the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, from October 2008 until well into 2010. The same thinktank has warned against excessive bragging about Canadian banks, calling it a "myth of Canadian exceptionalism" and insisting they are not "immune to the temptations and threats that compromised banks in Europe, the US and around the world".
