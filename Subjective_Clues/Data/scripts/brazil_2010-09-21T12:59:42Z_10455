President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has often spoken of going hungry as a child growing up in a remote village in the north-east of Brazil. One of the first measures Lula took when he came to power in January 2003 was to announce the Fome Zero (no hunger) programme. Almost eight years later, with three months of his second term left to serve, the president is proud of what has been achieved. In 2003, 12% of the population (22 million) did not get enough to eat. That figure has been more than halved, down to 10 million; 28 million of his compatriots have been lifted out of povertyThe key measure is a grant to families living in poverty (less than $1 a day), in the form of a credit card. Some 12 million households (50 million people) currently qualify for the bolsa familia. In 2008 the scheme cost $6bn, just under 2% of government spending. It is nevertheless the world's biggest redistribution programme.Though clearly vital, Candido Grzybowski, the head of the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Analysis (Ibase), thinks the bolsa does not go far enough. "It was a response to an emergency situation, but if it is suspended tomorrow people will go on dying of hunger," he said. "It must be followed up with structural reform, in particular in education.""The problem of hunger remains a concern for Dilma Rousseff," the leftwing candidate in the coming presidential election, according to her policy advisor Alessandro Teixeira. "If she is elected she will improve the bolsa."The opposition candidate, José Serra, who is standing for the Brazilian Social Democratic party, has also undertaken to maintain the grant, despite his party's frequent attacks on what it refers to as "assistencialism".A survey conducted by Ibase revealed that bolsa beneficiaries are afraid the grant will be withdrawn.This article originally appeared in Le Monde
