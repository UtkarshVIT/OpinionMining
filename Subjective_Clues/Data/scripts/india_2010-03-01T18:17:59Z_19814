At William Farr, a Church of England comprehensive in Welton, Lincolnshire, dance is part of an annual crosscurricular enrichment day on Indian culture. Year 9 students get a taste of bharatanatyam, kathak and other south Asian dance styles traditionally used for storytelling by watching and performing with dancers from Kala Sangam, a leading South Asian arts organisation.For a "largely white middle-class school in the Lincolnshire countryside", it is a way of extending children's understanding of other cultures, says Carole Lymn, head of religious studies, sociology and psychology."Working with the professionals, they achieve something they can be proud of in the space of an hour, which is pretty amazing to see."Bradford-based Kala Sangam deliver cross-cultural collaborative projects to schools nationwide, while also supporting subject teaching, according to its chief executive Gheeta Upadhyaya. "Insecondary, for example, we support PE but also explore subjects such as maths through dance, looking at rhythm cycles and time signatures and bringing in elements of geometry and number patterns."Dance can be a powerful tool in other ways, she adds."There is definitely a lot of self-esteem building, team-work and general positivity that flows from the dances. Students are creating something themselves, it's not just us teaching them what to do.
