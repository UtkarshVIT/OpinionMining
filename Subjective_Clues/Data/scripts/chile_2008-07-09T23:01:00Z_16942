A human rights group says it has strong evidence that a former SS member known as Dr Death is in Chile or Argentina. Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, flew from Israel to Chile yesterday to search for Aribert Heim, who would be 94. His daughter has lived in Chile for years. It is believed he is alive because $1.6m (Â£800,000) and other investments in Heim's name in Berlin have not been claimed by his children as they would have to produce proof that their father was dead. Heim was indicted on charges of murdering hundreds at Mauthausen, where he was camp doctor.

The raids followed months of investigation after police became suspicious of online orders for GBL, a chemical found in industrial cleaners that can be used to manufacture GHB, a potent depressant. Investigators said the GBL orders were placed to a number of chemical companies in Germany. Police in Austria and Switzerland said that they found some possible drug laboratories during their house searches. Associated Press in Berlin
