The British intervention in Iraq still casts a long shadow over Labour owing to the loss of life and trust, the shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander will say on Tuesday. But he will cite the intervention in Libya as a sign that Labour should overcome its genuine scepticism over what military intervention can achieve.In his main address, he will argue that the West, including the Labour party, has too often backed stability over democracy, a reference to British support to autocratic regimes in Egypt, Libya and North Africa. He will defend the Labour decision to back the military intervention in Libya saying, "I'm proud this year we chose to stand with those young people and against the old autocrats". He will also acknowledge the divisiveness of the Iraq war saying, "I have always understood the loss of life and loss of trust ... the Iraq war still casts a long shadow. Too often in the past the west has backed stability over democracy in the Middle East".He will also admit that the party has to recognise that across Europe the left is losing more elections than they are winning. "For a decade around 1997, the centre left was defeating the right. Now the centre right is beating the left." He will point out that the left is out of power in Germany, France, Sweden and Italy.Alexander, a strong advocate of the need for the party to recognise that it has lost key arguments over economic management, will contend that Labour now has to set out how it will pay its way in the world. He will argue Britain's long term prosperity is threatened less by the eurozone as the serious competitive threat posed by the new giant economies. "The real question for the new generation is not about the reach of Brussels but about the rise of Beijing."
