Lady Scotland employed Loloahi Tapui, a 26-year-old Tongan, as a maid at her family home in west London.The attorney general thought Tapui, who is married to a British citizen, was entitled to work in the UK, but was forced to sack her last Wednesday after it emerged she had overstayed on a student visa.According to the Mail, Tapui applied for an extension to her student visa in 2004. The application was rejected, meaning she has been living in Britain illegally for the past five years.The UK Border Agency last week announced it would conduct an inquiry after receiving a complaint from an anti-sleaze group.It is embarrassing for Scotland – as a Home Office minister in 2006, she helped the government to bring in controversial legislation on illegal immigrants.The Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act tightened the law on those knowingly employing illegal immigrants.The legislation means employers can be punished for unwittingly employing an illegal immigrant if they have not carried out proper checks, including taking a copy of the employee's passport.Employers, particularly small businesses, complained strongly about the regulations when they were introduced on the grounds that they imposed an unreasonable burden on firms.They can go to jail if they knowingly employ an illegal immigrant and, if they employ an illegal immigrant unknowingly, they can be fined up to £10,000.She has been fined £5,000 by the Border Agency, which found she did not knowingly illegally employ Tapui.Gordon Brown said no further action would be taken against her, although the Conservatives called for her to resign.
