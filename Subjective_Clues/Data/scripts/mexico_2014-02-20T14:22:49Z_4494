Even by the standards of a country wracked by armed struggle against drug cartels, the arrival of the leader of the world’s last superpower is cause for heightened security.As Barack Obama swept into the Mexican industrial city of Toluca on Wednesday in his 10-ton armoured limo, an estimated 5,000 police were stationed on every street corner for miles around.Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto waited nervously in the foyer of the state governor’s palace, hoping foreign praise for his economic reforms can help win over a sceptical domestic audience and put security fears aside.Back home in Washington, it is Barack Obama who is increasingly dismissed as a lame duck president: unable to persuade Congress to back even modest domestic reform. But, abroad, a US president still travels with the trappings of imperial power and an expectation that he has answers to difficult global problems.Yet the North American leaders summit that brought so much of Toluca’s historic centre to a halt this week has proven to be a object lesson in the limits of US presidential power, both at home and abroad.The two issues at the top of minds in Mexico and Canada – immigration reform and the Keystone oil pipeline – were both firmly off the agenda: victims for now of congressional intransigence and a White House terrified of making it worse by losing November’s midterm elections.The official purpose of the summit – deepening economic relations between the three North American neighbours and Asia – was similarly hamstrung by opposition to trade liberalisation among Democrats in Washington, who are refusing to give Obama authority to negotiate.Instead the summit looks likely to agree only a smattering of small bore reforms on trade and immigration: oiling the wheels of commerce with “trusted traveller status” and red tape reductions for businessmen, rather than tackling the bigger social and environmental questions on everyone’s lips.But even these agreements have been overshadowed in Toluca by the latest in a string of foreign crises to which the White House has no answers.Within minutes of Obama’s arrival at the North American summit, he was forced to address events thousands of miles away in Kiev, where a brutal government crackdown on pro-western protestors has exposed the relative impotence of their champions in Washington and Brussels.Among US officials travelling with Obama, Russian support for the Ukrainian government repression has provoked comparisons with a similar stalemate in Syria, where the White House openly admits its strategy for aiding rebel groups is fading fast in the face of fresh government aggression.And when he flies back to Washington on Thursday morning, Obama faces another dilemma over what to do about Afghanistan’s continued refusal to sign an agreement providing for a continued US security presence after its troop withdrawal later this year.The White House is expected to decide within days whether to give formal instructions to the Pentagon to prepare for an eventuality where no US forces are able to stay on.Although such scenario-planning has been going on for some time behind the scenes, a formal request before a Nato meeting in Brussels next week will expose Obama to fresh accusations that the US is being forced to cut and run from its 11-year mission to stabilise Afghanistan.White House strategists believe a war-weary US public will understand its reluctance to force the issue but it raises the prospect of no longer being able to counter terrorist groups in Afghanistan at a time when a similar withdrawal from Iraq has left insurgents back in control of the hard-fought-over city of Falluja.The crises in Syria, Ukraine, Afghanistan and Iraq are all much further from the US border than the smaller security worries of Mexico, but the combined sense of powerlessness is a stark reminder of the limits of US power.For now, the primary goal of US foreign policy seems instead to be one of expectation management. “We just can’t solve everyone else’s problems anymore,” said one senior White House official privately.
