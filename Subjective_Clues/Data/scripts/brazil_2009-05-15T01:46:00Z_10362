The Brazilian man accused of murdering and dismembering a London teenager last summer had a history of violence and drug use, a court heard today as his trial began in Goiania, in Brazil's mid-west.Mohammed D'Ali Carvalho dos Santos, 21, is accused of killing 17-year-old Cara Marie Burke after she threatened to tell his family about his involvement with drugs. After murdering her in his 13th floor apartment in the city, police say he dismembered the body in the bathroom before sending photos and boastful text messages to friends on his mobile phone.The torso of Burke, from Southfields, south-west London, was found dumped on a riverbank on the outskirts of Goiania inside a black suitcase on 29 July last year, four days after her murder. Police believe Dos Santos had hoped to marry her in order to obtain a British visa.Santos told the court he had been smoking crack cocaine for four days when Cara threatened to tell his mother he was spending all his money on drugs if he didn't give her an unspecified amount of cash. She also threatened to have a police officer confiscate his drugs.As she went into the living room to phone the officer, Santos said he started stabbing her with a knife that he had been using to cut up cocaine."I don't remember where I stabbed," Santos testified. "I kept on stabbing away, not knowing where, and when I saw what I had done, she was dead."Santos said he then took a bath and went to an all-night party. On the way home he said he stopped at a supermarket and bought a larger knife so he could cut up her body.After arriving home, he put her body in a bathtub and severed her limbs and head, putting them in one suitcase and her torso in another, according to his testimony.A porter at his apartment building told the jury how he had seen Dos Santos dragging a large black bag out of the building the day after Cara's death.Jane Lucia Souza Oliveira, Dos Santos's aunt, told the court that the defendant's father had been murdered and dismembered when his son was two years old. Oliveira said her nephew had spent time in a young offenders' institute, had once carried a revolver, and had stabbed his brother after a row about which television programme they should watch.His girlfriend, Hellen Vitoria, 19, told the court Dos Santos was a "caring" man.His lawyers are expected to plead diminished responsibility, claiming "he had been awake for four days" after using 50 grams of cocaine each day.Speaking to the Guardian in his cramped prison cell days after Cara's death, Dos Santos said he did not remember killing her, but admitted having "memories of cutting her up". If convicted he could spend up to 30 years in jail.
