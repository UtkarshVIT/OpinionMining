This is a fascinating, original fusion of Moby Dick, Greek myths, steampunk, literary theory, philosophy, dystopia, science fiction and adventure. The main character, Sham, is a moler on the railsea â€“ a tangled network of tracks that crisscross the bare earth between various islands. In the earth live the burrowing animals that Sham and the crew hunt, including giant earwigs, rabbits, moles and, in particular, the ivory-coloured talpa ferox rex called Mockerjack, which Sham's captain is obsessed with killing.Mieville's love of words permeates the whole novel, and while it's not a read for the faint-hearted, anyone who perseveres through the first few pages will quickly adjust to the vocabulary. The reader is hurled straight into a fully realised and totally convincing futuristic world, somewhat reminiscent of Philip Reeve's Mortal Engines. Although some critics have labelled Mieville's use of ampersands (&) pretentious, I love how they reflect the twisting tracks of the railsea itself. Anyone who likes crazy imagination, brilliant characterisation, uplifting philosophy and, above all, gorgeous writing, should read this book.Want to tell the world about a book you've read?
