An exhibition of some 130 paintings, drawings, prints and photographs charts a period in which Spanish culture flourished, despite - or perhaps partly as a result of - extreme political upheaval, from the peninsular war of 1807-14 to the Spanish civil war of 1936-39. It's a remarkable display of passion and tragedy, of deep spiritual aspiration and desperate social disillusionment that became a major influence on western culture. Goya's Disasters Of War etchings are quite possibly one of the most powerfully moving anti-war statements of all time. Each incisive victim and sky of acidic darkness speaks of the artist's deep disgust. Elsewhere, Picasso's Weeping Woman is a fragmented portrait of vulnerable beauty shattered.
