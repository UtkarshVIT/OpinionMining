While house prices across Europe have plunged in recent months, a stream of wealthy tax exiles is continuing to push up property prices in offshore tax enclaves across the continent.According to a new survey, tax havens from Gibraltar to the Isle of Man are bucking the slump, with many wealthy Britons helping to drive up prices.The survey, by the Sovereign Group, an international offshore tax specialist, points to Monaco – home to businessmen including the Topshop boss Sir Philip Green – where prices have risen by up to 30%, while in neighbouring Provence they have fallen back rapidly. In Gibraltar a local estate agent reported "a marked increase in interest for properties", in contrast to the nearby Costa del Sol, where home values have been in near-freefall.Nearer home, Jersey's chief government statistician said prices were up 7%. In neighbouring Guernsey, however, apartment prices are down, although house prices are stable. The Terra Firma private equity boss Guy Hands has recently relocated to Guernsey for tax reasons.On the Isle of Man, prices this year are up 4% and one local agent said: "Enquiries from UK applicants have risen strongly.""The facts speak for themselves here," said Howard Bilton, chairman of the Sovereign Group. "Property prices in the south of France and southern Spain are languishing in the worst slump they've seen in many years but on their outskirts are two little areas – Monaco and Gibraltar – where the market is extraordinarily resilient. We believe, and all our local sources are telling us, that much of this disparity is because of interest from a new breed of British tax refugee."Bilton said 20% of new business in his London office was coming from people looking to move offshore. Many are planning to take their businesses with them. "This is not the 1960s, when currency controls and limited communications made it difficult to relocate yourself and your business," he said. "This is the broadband age, when voting with your feet is a very viable option for many."
