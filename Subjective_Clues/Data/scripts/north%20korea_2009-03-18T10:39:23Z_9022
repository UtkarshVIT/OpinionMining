North Korea has rejected an offer of further food aid from the US despite its chronic food shortages, the US state department said today.Pyongyang said it would turn away about 330,000 metric tonnes due to arrive before May and ordered US non-governmental organisations to leave the country.The US offer was turned down days after a special investigator for the UN human rights council said almost 7 million North Koreans had not received the food aid they desperately need.Pyongyang's relations with Seoul, Washington and Tokyo have become increasingly strained, particularly since the announcement of its plans to launch a satellite next month.Other countries claim that will be cover for a ballistic missile launch.There is also tension over the stalled talks on aid for nuclear disarmament, and the situation has been exacerbated by the annual US and South Korean joint military drill.Robert Wood, a state department spokesman, said Pyongyang had informed the US of its decision a few days ago, but had not given any reasons.."This was a programme intended to try to help get food to needy North Koreans," Wood said. "And we're obviously disappointed."Last May, Pyongyang and the US agreed that Washington would provide 500,000 metric tonnes of food aid over 12 months.The last shipment, of almost 5,000 metric tonnes of vegetable oil and corn soy blend, is currently being distributed.Although most of the food was sent out through the World Food Programme, a team of five American NGOs also assisted. They will leave the country at the end of the month."We will work with US NGOs and their North Korean counterparts to ensure that food that is already in North Korea is distributed to the intended recipients," Wood said."This humanitarian assistance that we provide to the North has nothing to do with the six-party [disarmament] talks."This is about our true humanitarian concern for these people. The food situation in North Korea is not a good one, and so we're very concerned about it."In December, the World Food Programme warned that around 40% of the North Korean population – an estimated 8.7 million people – would need food aid this year.The organisation said many families were cutting down on meals and were dependent on a diet "treacherously poor in diversity".Hundreds of thousands died in a famine in the 1990s but, until 2005, the country's food security had been improving.Meanwhile, Seoul has warned that the future of a joint industrial venture is at risk after North Korea closed the nearby border for four days and left hundreds of South Korean workers stranded.The Kaesong industrial complex is a much-needed source of income for the North."We are at this point not considering shutting down the Kaesong industrial zone," Seoul's unification minister, Hyun In-taek, said today."But if the North repeats the border traffic suspension after the end of the [military] drills, the government will consider it a very grave situation and will take appropriate measures."He said he believed the Kaesong situation had "dashed the hopes that the North and the South would embrace each other despite the grave military and security conditions between the two".
