New Zealanders are to be given the chance to jettison the most visible remaining symbol of their colonial past in a referendum on changing the national flag. In a speech in Wellington on Tuesday, the prime minister, John Key, promised a vote in the next parliamentary term on whether to keep the existing design, which features the union jack and four stars representing the southern cross, or replace it with an alternative, such as the silver fern on a black background or a version of the Maori koru.Key, who personally favours the silver-fern-on-black option made famous by the All Black rugby side, said the time was ripe for “one more step in the evolution of modern New Zealand”. A change to the design of the flag, currently identical to the Australian banner apart from the number and style of stars, would show the country “acknowledging our independence”.“It’s my belief, and I think one increasingly shared by many New Zealanders, that the design of the New Zealand flag symbolises a colonial and post-colonial era whose time has passed,” he said.Key cited Canada’s shift in 1965, from a union jack adorned flag to a maple leaf symbol, as an example. “That old flag represented Canada as it was once, rather than as it is now. Similarly, I think our flag represents us as we were once, rather than as we are now.”He pledged to work with all political parties to establish a working group that would in turn map out a process, which would very likely involve two separate plebiscites – to determine if a change was wanted and the preferred replacement.Early indications from the main opposition leaders, who have criticised the prime minister’s past flirtations with a change in the flag as an attempt to distract attention from issues such as inequality, are that they will support the process outlined.While republican groups welcome the change as part of a trend towards severing ties with the “mother country”, Key emphasised that he did not see it this way.“We retain a strong and important constitutional link to the monarchy and I get no sense of any groundswell of support to let that go. Nor could we or would we dispose of the cultural legacy which gave us a proud democracy, a strong legal system and a rich artistic heritage,” he said.“Our status as a constitutional monarchy continues to serve us well. It’s an arrangement that provides stability, continuity and keeps our head of state above party politics.”Sean Palmer, chair of the lobby group Monarchy New Zealand, welcomed Key’s commitment to the Commonwealth, saying it was a mistake to “try to conflate the question of the flag and constitutional status”. The majority of Commonwealth countries did not sport the union jack on their flags, he said, and there was no reason for Prince William and Catherine, who visit New Zealand next month, to regard the announcement as a snub.A redesign is anything but inevitable, however. A Colmar Brunton poll for TVNZ last month found that just 28% of those who expressed an opinion wanted a fresh flag, with 72% preferring the status quo. In a similar poll in 2004, 42% wanted a change.Key had previously hinted a referendum might be held in conjunction with the general election later this year, but instead has used the promise of a vote in the next term as his first gambit since the announcement of the election date earlier this week.The election, in which Key’s National party hopes to win a third consecutive term, will be held on September 20, two months earlier than is usual, to provide sufficient time for any coalition talks ahead of the Brisbane G20 meetings and surrounding events in November, Key said.
