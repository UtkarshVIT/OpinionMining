After fruitless job-hunting in the UK, my husband has had two job offers from Canada. Neither is ideal. The first is in a prairie town where, to quote someone who knows, "The winters are long and frigid, the summers are boiling and with bugs the size of your head." It is quite a large place but in the middle of nowhere. Coming back to see family in the UK would be horrible with two small children, but it is, apparently, the most friendly place in the world.The second is in Quebec. It looks more cosmopolitan and cool. It is much closer – a six-hour drive to family – and it is nearer to the UK. The problem is my French is awful (I am willing to work on that) but also, I have been told the people can be very insular and frosty. The thought of speaking in another language all day makes me feel exhausted even thinking about it. Not accepting one or other is not an option.
