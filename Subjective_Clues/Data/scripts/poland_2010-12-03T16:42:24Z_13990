About 30 people have frozen to death in Poland over the past three days as the cold spell gripped Europe.Those who died were mainly homeless men aged from their mid-30s to their 60s, including some alcoholics who were sleeping rough. Between last night and this morning, 12 people in Poland froze to death.Temperatures in the north-east of the country reached a record low this week of -33Â°C.The Czech Republic and Lithuania also reported deaths, as did Germany where an elderly man was found dead in the snow outside a bank in Leipzig. France also saw its first homeless death of the winter when a woman in her 40s who had been sleeping rough in the entrance of a block of flats in Marseille was found dead at the weekend.Thousands were evacuated from their homes after severe flooding in Montenegro, Bosnia and Serbia.Power supplies were hit across Europe with severe frost leaving around 150,000 people in the southern Polish city of Czestochowa without heating today. In France, which has suffered electricity blackouts in the centre and north-west, around 3,000 homes were without electricity today.Transport was hit with airports including the European hub, Frankfurt, suffering delays and cancellations. Eurostar links from Britain to France and Belgium have recorded delays and cancellations and the service will be disrupted until Sunday, authorities said. Train travel in France and Belgium was disrupted due to snow.German authorities said the record-breaking cold temperatures would slow economic growth. "A lot of construction projects have been halted, a lot of business trips have been postponed and freight transport has become quite difficult," Volker Treier, the chief economist of the chamber of industry and commerce, told Reuters.
