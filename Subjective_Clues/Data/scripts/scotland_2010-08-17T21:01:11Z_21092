The Australian author Christos Tsiolkas, trailing controversy over his novel The Slap (hailed by some as "Neighbours as Philip Roth might have written it", by others damned as "unbelievably misogynistic") has been living in Scotland for the last few months, on a literary retreat at Cove Park on Loch Long. And for his next novel, he has taken inspiration from his surroundings. Asked on Saturday whether he had recently witnessed any incidents equivalent to the slap he saw administered at a party to a miscreant child (it was this slap that, fictionalised, becomes the starting point of his Man Booker-longlisted novel), he described visiting Luss on Loch Lomond. "It was an amazing summer day," he said. "All of Glasgow was there and had taken their clothes off and gone swimming in the loch. And man, was it freezing. It was just the kind of thing I was looking for: my next novel will begin at Luss with an Aussie dipping his toe into the water of the loch and thinking, 'Man, these people are crazy.'"
