Australia has defied the global downturn and saw its economy grow in the first three months of the year.Australia's economy grew by 0.4% in the first quarter of the year as the best trade performance in almost half a century helped offset a slump in business and housing investment, the Bureau of Statistics in Sydney said. Analysts had expected a rise of 0.1%. The economy contracted by a revised 0.6% in the final three months of 2008.The country has fared better than most during the financial crisis, thanks to quick and deep interest rate cuts, hefty stimulus spending and a solid contribution from commodity-based exports.Kevin Rudd, the prime minister, whose government doled out up to A$950 (Â£470) to millions of households as part of a A$42bn stimulus package in February, welcomed the news. But he cautioned that the economy "is not out of the woods yet"."This is the worst global recession in three-quarters of a century," he said. "We will face higher unemployment in the Australian economy and we're not guaranteed that we won't see negative growth in the future."Sukhy Ubhi, international economist at consultants Capital Economics, said: "Overall, the economy was saved from a technical recession thanks to the unexpectedly big improvement in net trade. Admittedly, the resilience of Australian consumer spending also came as a surprise, especially given the sharp increase in the household savings rate at the end of last year. But the deterioration in the labour and housing markets is still in its infancy, indicating that the worst for consumers is yet to come."
