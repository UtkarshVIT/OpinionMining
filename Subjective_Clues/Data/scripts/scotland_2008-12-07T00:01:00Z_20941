An Asian police chief who has been suspended for allegedly perverting the course of justice is to sue Scotland Yard for racial discrimination. Commander Ali Dizaei, head of Britain's black police association, claims senior Metropolitan Police officers orchestrated a 'smear campaign' against him.His decision comes weeks after his close friend, Tarique Ghaffur, formerly Britain's most senior Asian officer, accepted an out-of-court payout from the Yard of about Â£300,000 over race claims.As president of the National Black Police Association, which claims the Met is riddled with racism, Dizaei's decision will reignite the damaging race row within the Metropolitan Police that senior figures hoped had been settled with Ghaffur's payout. Dizaei's claim is based around the fact that white police officers accused of more serious disciplinary matters were not suspended pending an investigation. In September, Dizaei was suspended over three misconduct allegations, allegedly wasting police time, perverting the course of justice, assault and unlawful arrest. A file has been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service.Although Dizaei denies any wrongdoing and claims his suspension was racially motivated, sources at the Metropolitan Police Authority have said the allegations against the commander were so serious that officials were left with no alternative but suspension.
