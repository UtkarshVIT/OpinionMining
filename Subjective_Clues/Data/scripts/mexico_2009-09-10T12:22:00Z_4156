More than 100 airline passengers were today released unharmed after their plane was hijacked by a man who claimed to be on a divine mission to warn the Mexican president of an earthquake.The Aeromexico flight was seized as it came in to land at Mexico City after a flight from the resort city of Cancun.José Mar Flores, a 44-year-old Bolivian preacher, used a fake bomb to carry out his hijacking and said yesterday's date – 9/9/09 – was the number 666 turned upside down.He said had been told by God to warn the president, Felipe Calderòn, of an impending earthquake, and ordered the pilot to circle the city seven times, demanding to speak to Calderòn.The passengers were initially not told about what was happening as the pilot negotiated with Flores, who eventually allowed him to land the plane.The hijacker then kept the 103 passengers and crew on the tarmac for more than an hour as the plane was surrounded by heavily-armed police.He agreed to release women and children before, minutes later, police stormed the aircraft and escorted several handcuffed men away without firing a shot.Officers later said there was only one hijacker and the other men had been briefly detained because the suspect had told a flight attendant he had three accomplices.Flores later said his three companions were "the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost" and he had taken control of the aircraft with "a juice can with some little lights I attached". "Christ is coming soon," he added.The pilot told reporters Flores "said he had tried to speak to the president for three months and since there hadn't been an answer he decided to use this type of threat with an airline".
