Baroness Scotland should have said how deeply sorry she was for failing properly to vet her new housekeeper. But, instead, she insisted that she didn't have to be deeply sorry because she hadn't done much wrong. A £5,000 illegal worker fine is apparently like a £60 congestion-charge fine. Which can only mean one of three things. Congestion-charge fines should be £5,000. Illegal worker fines should be £60. Or neither is much money to the attorney general, who has forgotten that, for a lot of people, £60, let alone £5,000, is a big dent in the self- administered housekeeping. They all learned so very little from their expenses drubbing. What on earth can be done with them?
