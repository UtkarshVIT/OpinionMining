Gordon Brown today distanced himself from Britain's former close relationship with Augusto Pinochet as he paid a warm tribute to Chilean president Michelle Bachelet, who was tortured by the regime of the late Chilean dictator.In the first visit by a serving British prime minister to Chile, Brown praised the socialist president for her courage. Bachelet was kidnapped and tortured by forces loyal to Pinochet in 1975.Brown's approach was in stark contrast to that of Margaret Thatcher who invited Pinochet for tea in London after his arrest in 1998. Pinochet was arrested at the request of a Spanish judge investigating the disappearance of Spanish citizens during the Pinochet era."We have a duty to be responsible. We support democratic governments," Brown was to say today on the last stage of his five-day South America tour."President Bachelet was very courageous and brave," he said of the experience of the president whose father and boyfriend were tortured to death. "I will be telling her, building on what I said yesterday [when the prime minister rejected torture but voiced support for MI5], that Britain abhors torture."Brown was using his meeting with Bachelet to reiterate comments made in Brazil yesterday in relation to the Binyam Mohamed affair — that the government would not condone nor endorse torture.In a tour of the presidential palace in Santiago, Brown visited the room where the socialist president, Salvador Allende, shot himself as Pinochet's troops marched on the palace in 1973. On the day of the coup Pinochet ordered the air force to bomb the palace.Brown recalled the impact of the coup and the death of Allende, a hero of the left. "I remember the events in Chile in 1973. I was a student at the time and remember many Chilean students coming to Britain."Britain has historically enjoyed strong relations with Chile — Bernardo O'Higgins, who had Scottish roots, is known as the Liberator for his role in freeing the country from Spanish rule. But Anglo-Chilean links became controversial during the Falklands war when the Pinochet dictatorship offered intelligence support.
