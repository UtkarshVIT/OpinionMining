It was smoky, alcohol-free and there was not a bikini in sight, but organisers have hailed the first Miss Iraq beauty pageant in four decades as a victory against the tyranny of war. “What we’re hoping to accomplish is to make Iraq’s voice heard, show that it is still alive, that its heart is still beating,” said Senan Kamel, the 2015 pageant’s artistic director.

Speaking during a tree-planting ceremony near the ruins of the ancient city of Babylon on Thursday, Suzan Amer, a 22-year-old from the Kurdish town of Sulaimaniyah said the pageant was more than a mere distraction in Iraq.“It’s my first time doing anything like this but it’s an experience I wanted to be part of. I think Iraq needs events like these,” she said. Iraq is wracked by an ongoing war against the Islamic State, the world’s most brutal jihadist organisation, and plagued by deep sectarian tensions and corruption.The unrest forced the delay of the contest, which was originally supposed to take place in October. Several participants reportedly pulled out of the event following death threats. But the pageant, which culminated with the jury announcing the winner as Beethoven’s Ode to Joy filled the ballroom, left participants, organisers and guests feeling that beating the gloom was part of the war effort.“I think it is wonderful; it makes you feel things can come back to normal,” said veteran human rights activist Hana Edwar.The last time the Miss Iraq competition was held was in 1972, when the oil-rich country was stable and prosperous.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report
