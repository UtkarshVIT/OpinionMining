What is it?An investment fund being set up by the Indian government's National Innovation Council (which opened in September 2010) aimed at supporting small and medium sized business using technology to create social change.The National Innovation Council (NInC) says the money is to "invest in a new generation of Indian entrepreneurs who will build – and are in the process of building – world class enterprises that focus on the problems of the poor, without compromising on economic success."The Fund will provide risk capital funding to enterprises that create and deliver technologies and solutions that generate social and financial returns.A spokesperson for NInC said it is hoped the fund will reach about one billion dollars (5,000 crore) but will start with 500 crore, some of which might be provided by the UK Department for International Development.Who will fund it?The Indian government looks set to commit 20% of the pot. The rest is expected to come from Indian public sector enterprises, banks and contributions from private investors, corporates and investment firms - according to NInC.What are the timescales?Originally NIC talked about the fund being up-and-running from mid-2012, but it is now expected in November. Speaking to the Guardian, Ashwin Naik, chair of India's National Association of Social Enterprises (NASE), said: "With such a large fund anchored by government, it possibly will be delayed again, but there's no doubt it will happen - government has already earmarked funds. NInC is currently pulling together a management team."What ideas will be supported?The fund will support investment at different stages of the enterprise development cycle – from early stages, through later phases of scaling-up of potentially successful solutions and business models. There will be a focus on affordable healthcare, energy, education and job creation.In March, Sam Pitroda, adviser to the Indian Prime minister and chair of NInC, was quoted in the Indian Economic Times as saying that there was a pipeline of 85 ideas so far, and that the NIC expected to receive another 200.How will money be allocated?According to reports in India's Economic Times, each enterprise supported will get an investment of between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 5 crore each, according to Pitroda. Money will also go into existing investment funds to be passed on to enterprises, whereas the UK's government-supported Big Society Capital Fund all goes into existing social enterprise funds to be passed on, rather than directly to social enterprises.How long will the fund last and what are the exit options?Exit strategies are unclear, as yet, but NInC has said the fund will last nine-to-ten years and possibly extended by three years.What will returns look like?In January 2012, Livemint financial news service reported that returns would be around the 10-12% mark, but this has not been confirmed.What does the social enterprise sector say?"There is a big gap of funding for very early stage ideas, so this is very welcome," said Naik from NASE, who is also co-founder of Vaatsalya - a chain of affordable hospitals."We have had informal interactions and meetings with the NInC team and have passed on details of about 30 relevant social enterprises. There is going to be a lot of competition. I am happy with the way the fund is set up, the challenge is how it's executed," he added.This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
