Tributes have been pouring in for the world's oldest polar bear, who died peacefully at a Canadian zoo yesterday.Keepers at the Assiniboine Park zoo in Winnipeg, Manitoba, are mourning the death of the bear named Debby.She had lived at the zoo since 1967 after being captured as an orphaned cub in the Russian Arctic, in 1966.She was listed as the world's oldest polar bear by the Guinness Book of World Records when she turned 41.But veterinarians decided to euthanise her after it was discovered she had suffered several strokes and multiple organ failure due to her advanced age. She had stopped eating over the weekend. She was just one month shy of her 42nd birthday.Posts on a Winnipeg online chat site displayed fond memories of the bear, calling her death "a great loss to the city".Debby gave birth to six cubs at the zoo where she lived with a male bear, Skipper, who died several years ago, aged 34."Debby was a great bear," said Jos Gatien, the zoo's senior bear keeper who worked with Debby for 13 years. "She acted like a grumpy old bear a lot of times. It was great. She had a lot of life in her, a lot of feistiness."Debby's guardians will decide what to do with her remains. Skipper had his ashes scattered near Churchill, Manitoba, on Hudson Bay when he died in 1999.Robert Buchanan, president of Polar Bears International, praised Debby as "an Arctic ambassador of polar bears to the world"."We'll miss her," he said.
