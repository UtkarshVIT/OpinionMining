There's an old Westminster gag about Labour creating more tsars than Russia. It was never particularly funny, but at least it was recognisable as a joke. Until today â€“ when new figures have been published showing that it is actually true.The evidence comes from the Commons public administration committee, which has published a report called Goats and Tsars about the appointment of people from outside parliament to ministerial or other government posts.In the appendix at the end (on page 79) it includes a memo from Sir Gus O'Donnell, the cabinet secretary, who was asked to identify all the tsars appointed by the government. He named 25, not including the health tsars. A separate memo lists another 15 health tsars working as national clinical advisers in the NHS. That makes 40.My knowledge of Russian history is very limited. But the internet is a wonderful thing and this morning I've learned that the title tsar was used by Russian rulers from 1546 until 1917. According to this list, there were 26 of them.Tsars are a new development in British politics. According to the report, the term was first used in relation to the NHS appointments and the first tsar appointed in a wider political context was Keith Hellawell, who became drug tsar in 1998.The committee isn't impressed.At present there is little transparency concerning the informal and ad hoc appointments made by government to lead on, review or promote particular policies. Job titles are often uninformative, appointment processes informal and the work undertaken opaque and not clearly linked to results. The allegation that some of these posts might have been created for the sake of a press notice may be unfair, but it is difficult to refute without greater transparency.The committee says that the government should produce a regular list of tsars working in Whitehall and that, whenever a minister appoints a new one, the relevant department should spell out exactly what his or her responsibilities will be.
