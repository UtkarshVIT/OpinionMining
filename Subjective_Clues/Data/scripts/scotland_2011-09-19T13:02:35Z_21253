The Scottish Government has unveiled plans to train hundreds of dementia champions over the next two years to work across the NHS and councils. It is taking the step in a bid to drive up standards of care for people with dementia.As part of the plans, the government has awarded a contract to the University of West of Scotland and voluntary organisation Alzheimer Scotland to train an initial 100 dementia champions this year. Champions will be recruited from acute general hospitals and will be responsible for ensuring the needs of patients with dementia are met, as well as leading and supporting change in care.The government said that five Alzheimer Scotland dementia nurse consultants have already been appointed across the country as part of the programme. Discussions are currently taking place to secure the appointment of a nurse consultant on each NHS board.Joint funding has been provided by Alzheimer Scotland and the Scottish Government and it is expected that all boards in Scotland will have made appointments by the end of the year. The plans are a major strand of Scotland's first ever National Dementia Strategy, and will be backed by funding of more than Â£500,000 this year.Cabinet secretary for health and wellbeing, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "As I said in parliament just this week, providing the very best care for every older person on every occasion, in care homes and in hospitals continues to be a personal priority. This funding and the new posts it will create demonstrate that action to further improve older people's care - and the care of people with dementia at any age - is beginning to take place."She said it was important for the NHS and local authorities to be well equipped to understand the needs of people with dementia and their families "in order to ensure that their dignity, independence and wishes are met".Sturgeon added: "These key changes show just how much we prioritise older people's care within government and will mean that the dementia care provided by both NHS and social care staff will meet the highest possible standards."Henry Simmons, chief executive of Alzheimer Scotland, said he was happy with the way the government has started to approach dementia care."We are very pleased with the progress being made in implementing the National Dementia Strategy and welcome the personal commitment of the cabinet secretary, Nicola Sturgeon," he said. "We have long campaigned to highlight the difficulties faced by people with dementia in our acute general hospitals and care services generally."This article is published by Guardian Professional.
