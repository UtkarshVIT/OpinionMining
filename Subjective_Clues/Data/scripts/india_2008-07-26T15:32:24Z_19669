Two people were killed today and more than 50 injured in a series of explosions in the western Indian city of Ahmadabad, officials said, a day after a number of suspected bombs rocked the technology centre of Bangalore."At least 55 people have been hospitalised and two people have died so far," Shakeel Ahmad, a junior home minister for Gujarat state, of which Ahmadabad is the capital, told reporters, according to Reuters. "We are on high alert."The four small explosions in several areas of Ahmadabad came a day after seven suspected bombs killed two people in Bangalore, in the south of the country.Yesterday's bombs exploded in quick succession across Bangalore, one of the world's biggest centres for software development and the capital of India's outsourcing industry, also injuring 15 people.India has suffered a wave of bombings in recent years, with targets ranging from mosques and temples to trains. Indian authorities have blamed Islamist militant groups in Pakistan and Bangladesh but it is unusual for anyone to claim responsibility.In May, eight bombs, many strapped to bicycles, exploded in a crowded shopping area in the western city of Jaipur, killing at least 63 people and injuring hundreds more.Police said that attack bore some hallmarks of the Bangladeshi militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al Islami (HuJI).
