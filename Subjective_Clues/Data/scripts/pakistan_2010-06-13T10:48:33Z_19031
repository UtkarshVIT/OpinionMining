Pakistani intelligence is so deeply involved in the arming and funding of the Afghan Taliban that it holds a seat on the militant leadership council and has sent the president, Asif Ali Zardari, to make prison visits to captured leaders, a report by the London School of Economics has said.Researcher Matt Waldman said Pakistani support for the insurgency was "official" policy, implemented by the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency in the form of money, weapons and training."Pakistan appears to be playing a double game of astonishing magnitude," the report, which cited interviews with unnamed Taliban commanders and western officials, said.An ISI official in Islamabad described the report as "rubbish". "It's not even worth commenting on. It's speculative at best and downright degrading at worst," he said.ISI links to the Afghan Taliban have been frequently reported – but rarely to the extent claimed in the document, which said the spy agency had official representation on the Quetta shura, the 15-man leadership council, based in western Pakistan.Claims of civilian collusion were equally striking. Citing a Taliban source, the report said that, in late March or early April, Zardari met 50 top-ranking Taliban members at a secret prison in Pakistan.According to the report, he told them: "You are our people, we are friends, and after your release we will of course support you to do your operations." Three days later, a dozen Taliban prisoners were released.Farahnaz Ispahani, a media adviser to Zardari, said: "Not only are these allegations totally unfounded, they are quite outrageous. President Zardari's commitment to fighting terrorism and militancy in all forms is well documented."The allegations may heighten tensions between Pakistan, Afghanistan and western countries at a time when the cost of the Afghan war is mounting.Since 2001, thousands of Afghans and 1,800 foreign troops, 295 of them British, have died. The conflict has cost the US government $300bn (£206bn), with spending now running at $70bn a year.The report, whose findings are based largely on unnamed sources, said Pakistan gives "extensive support to the insurgency in terms of funding, munitions and supplies".One Taliban commander said his fighters received $120 per month from Pakistan, while others said the ISI was covering their families' living costs in Pakistan.One interviewee said an ISI official had trained him to make suicide vests and car bombs in South Waziristan in 2005."The man was definitely ISI, he told us," he was quoted as saying. "When some of our friends were arrested by the Pakistani authorities, he went and got them freed."Other interviewees appeared prone to conspiracy theories. One said the ISI support after 2001 originally came from the US government – a reflection, the report said, of the $12bn in military aid the US has given Pakistan since 2001.The report also revived allegations of links between Pakistani intelligence and Jalaluddin Haqqani, an al-Qaida linked warlord whose territory stretches into North Waziristan.The report said there was "apparently a number of small, covert Haqqani bases in North Waziristan and Korram agencies, and Quetta, staffed by serving or former Pakistani military officials. They are often combined with a madrasa, provide a broad-based military training, and include suicide bomber cells".The controversial document comes at a time of great sensitivity, as regional and western parties to the Afghan conflict jockey for position in anticipation of peace talks with the Taliban.Senior British officials favour negotiations, some Americans believe in fighting, and the government of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, is increasingly fractured.Last week, the long-time head of Afghan intelligence, Amrullah Saleh, resigned from his post, saying he had become an obstacle to Karzai's plans to negotiate with the militants via Pakistan.
