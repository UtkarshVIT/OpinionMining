A car full of explosives drove into a security checkpoint outside Peshawar in north-west Pakistan today, killing at least 12 people and injuring 50 others in the latest suicide bombing in the area.A police official confirmed the death toll and said many people were trapped under the debris of two damaged buildings in a nearby market.Television footage showed wrecked cars and pieces of the destroyed checkpoint scattered across a large area. Officials at Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar, said about 30 wounded people had come in for treatment."They have got multiple wounds," said one doctor, Mohammad Idrees. "Some of them have their arms and legs broken, and others have got head injuries. We have declared an emergency here."There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the blast. In recent weeks, the Pakistani Taliban say they have carried out a series of suicide bombings in revenge for military offensives in the north-west region that borders Afghanistan.The US has pushed Pakistan to crack down on militants who are using Pakistani territory to launch attacks on US and Nato forces in Afghanistan. A recent US-led foray into a Pakistani tribal region from Afghanistan, however, triggered an angry reaction from Islamabad.The latest atrocity came as Pakistani MPs were voting for a new president. Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of the assassinated former leader Benazir Bhutto,  is expected to win easily. Zardari, 53, is close to the US and has repeatedly stressed Pakistan's commitment to combating radicalism in Pakistan.
