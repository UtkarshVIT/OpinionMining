Name: Russia Local LtdCity: LondonWebsite: www.russialocal.co.uk/en/Since the company launched in 2010, we've been providing Russian language training for businesses and individuals. With the owner's background in linguistics and business development, in autumn 2011 it was the right time to offer a new service to the clients â€“ business consulting for organisations looking for expansion in Russia.At that point we could clearly demonstrate our clients' satisfaction in our Russian language tuition and our owner's success stories as a business development professional in Russia and the UK.We were given a lead to an Asian university struggling to find top-ranked Russian partner universities to establish student exchange programmes and top-ranked schools to recruit students from. We submitted a proposal and successfully defended our case in a series of online meetings and emails.From December 2011 we prepared several reports on the Russian education system and a list of universities consolidating the different ranking systems (there is no common league in Russia). We contacted the best four universities and scheduled meetings with the vice-chancellors' offices of three of them. We also identified and contacted top-ranked schools.Alongside this, we coordinated the logistics of the visit to Moscow and St Petersburg, and in April 2012, the visit to Russia took place.The work resulted in seven Russian institutions agreeing to partner and cooperate with our client. Currently the work is under way to sign the necessary contracts and prepare further visits to Russia in order to enhance these relations and find some more partnering institutions.Ignaty Dyakov is the director of Russia Local LtdFind out how you can enter on Best Practice Exchange here.
