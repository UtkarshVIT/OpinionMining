Very few people are able to travel across the secretive state of North Korea. Even the country's own citizens need a state-issued permit (or enough funds) to be able to travel internally.So when Eric Talmadge and David Guttenfelder of the Associated Press embarked on a 1,400 mile road trip through rural DPRK to report on the state of the country's farms (which are under pressure to keep the masses fed), it's not surprising that they wanted to document it. Taking in the symbolic sites at Mount Paektu and "potato country" in the north, their trip ended up producing some stunning, and rare, images.Tourists, and tour guides, who were once mostly confined to the capital Pyongyang, are also increasingly able to capture images of life outside the city. As North Korea opens up its fledgling tourism industry, more carefully selected travel destinations are being made available by state-sanctioned tour companies. Whether you agree or disagree with tourism to North Korea, these pictures also help to shed new light on everyday life in one of the most closed societies in the world.
