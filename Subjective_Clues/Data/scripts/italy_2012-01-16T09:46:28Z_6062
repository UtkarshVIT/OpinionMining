A sixth body has been found on the stricken Costa Concordia which crashed into rocks off Italy's Tuscan coast on Friday night.Unconfirmed reports suggest that a man wearing what appeared to be a lifejacket was found in a corridor still above water in the ship early on Monday. The discovery came as the ship's captain, Francesco Schettino, faced further questioning by prosecutors and its owners prepared to give their explanations for the disaster at the Mediterranean island of Giglio. Sixteen people remain unaccounted for.As survivors from the 4,200 passengers and crew gave their accounts of the disaster, divers continued to search submerged areas of the vessel and rescue leaders began to consider when they might have to wind down their efforts and concentrate on removing fuel from the liner.Costa Cruises, the company that operated the liner, has said "preliminary indications" suggested Schettino may have been guilty of "significant human error".In a statement it said: "The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures."Prosecutors have also said the crew mishandled the emergency, delaying the start of the evacuation until an hour after the accident and there have also been reports that the captain was already ashore just after midnight, well before the last passengers were evacuated.Schettino, who is reportedly held on suspicion of multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship, told Italian television he was not to blame, claiming nautical charts did not show the rocks which ripped a 160ft gash in the ship's hull. Claims have also been made that the captain was seen saluting a colleague or former colleague on shore.All 23 British passengers and 12 crew members on board the Costa Concordia survived.Cruise giant Carnival, which owns Costa Cruises, said on Monday the loss of the ship would wipe up to £62m from its profits this year. It would be out of service until at the least the end of its financial year on 30 November, costing it from $85m-95m this year. It was too early to calculate other costs but the company was insured for $40m (£26.1m) for the vessel.Micky Arison, chairman and chief executive of Carnival, said: "At this time, our priority is the safety of our passengers and crew."We are deeply saddened by this tragic event and our hearts go out to everyone affected by the grounding of the Costa Concordia and especially to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives. They will remain in our thoughts and prayers."Shares in Carnival were down 21% on Monday, wiping nearly £1bn from its market value. Its stock had already fallen about 30% over the previous year as the weak economic climate hit demand for cruises. It owns 11 brands, including P&O, Cunard and Princess Cruises.
