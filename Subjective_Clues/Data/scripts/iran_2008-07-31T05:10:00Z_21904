Kurdish freelance journalist Saman Rasoulpour has been arrested in Iran after covering a small demonstration in Mahabad, part of the country's predominantly Kurdish north west, demanding the overturning of death sentences imposed on journalists Adnan Hassanpour and Abdolvahed Botimar. They were sentenced to death a year ago on charges of "subversive activities against national security" and spying. Their convictions were overturned by the Tehran supreme court but a lower court has reimposed Botimar's death sentence and Hassanpour faces a new trial. (Via IFEX)
