Schools were shut, flights cancelled and ships stranded in ports as workers across Greece held a 24-hour general strike against proposed pension reforms today.The strike meant buses, trains and the Athens metro ran for only a few hours today, with heavy traffic clogging the streets of the capital.Greece's public bank and courts also closed their doors, news programmes went off the air and hospital doctors were only treating emergency cases as union members and their supporters prepared to march on parliament. Police vans and riot squads were stationed near the building from early this morning. Strikers clashed with riot police during demonstrations in the last general strike, which took place in mid-December.The Greek prime minister, Costas Karamanlis, is to unveil plans to reform the country's pension system in parliament on Friday. Last week, a senior government official said the government would propose condensing around 170 existing pension funds into six or less, raising the retirement age for some jobs and providing incentives for people to work longer.The country's two largest unions accuse the conservative government of reneging on promises made during last autumn's election.
