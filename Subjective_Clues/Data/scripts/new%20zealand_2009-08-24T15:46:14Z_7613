The father of a British law graduate killed riverboarding in New Zealand has said he hopes his daughter's death will change the way extreme sports are run.Emily Jordan, 21, of Trimpley, Worcestershire, drowned in the Kawarau river gorge on New Zealand's South Island in April 2008.Today the company that organised the trip pleaded guilty to two charges relating to her death. The sport involves riding a body board on rapids.Black Sheep Adventures Ltd, trading as Mad Dog River Boarding, and Brad McLeod, the company director, had previously both denied three charges of failing to ensure the safety of their customers. All charges against McLeod and one against Black Sheep Adventures were dropped, with the company pleading guilty to the remaining two.Queenstown district court heard that guides from Mad Dog River Boarding did not carry ropes and that the company's safety plan fell short of national standards.Emily was trapped underwater for 20 minutes until another boat carrying ropes arrived and freed her body on 29 April 2008.Emily's father, Chris, went to New Zealand for the court hearing. He told Radio New Zealand he wanted to cut the number of deaths from such activities."To just reduce the horrendous deaths that occur in some of these extreme sports would be my primary aim, my primary reason for coming over [from Britain] this week," he said. He added that he hoped to "see some changes taking place with regard to the way river boarding in particular was run â€“ and to some other extreme sports in general".Black Sheep Adventures will be sentenced under New Zealand's health and safety laws tomorrow.
