China defeats yet another British retailer. This time it is Kingfisher that is following Tesco's example and seeking a local joint venture partner for its B&Q chain. The explanation is similar too: tough local competitors; problems in finding management; a different consumer culture, in this case an expectation that the retailer doesn't just sell the paint but also supplies the decorator.Sir Ian Cheshire, Kingfisher chief executive, can at least claim the Chinese retreat is honourable. Five years ago, when he was fresh in the job, losses in China were running at £50m or so. A third of the stores have been closed since then and losses last year were reduced to £6m.That is deemed sufficiently encouraging to justify seeking a partner for the long term, rather than exiting China altogether. That judgment looks reasonable. Mind you, it would also have been reasonable in 1999, when Kingfisher first took B&Q to China. In those days, China was seen as a land of easy profits for slick western retailers; they all know better now.Semi-resolution of the Chinese headache was one of several items in Cheshire's spring-clean. The 21% stake in German group Hornbach has been sold for £195m. And, as expected, Kingfisher will start to hand back excess capital to shareholders. There may be even be an outbreak a Lord Wolfson-style common sense of how the spoils are distributed. Rather than one big splurge, Kingfisher has opted for a "multi-year programme," starting with £200m this financial year. A view on whether a buy-back or special dividend makes more economic sense will be made at the time – very sensible too.It was all enough to push the share price up 6% to 431p, at which level Kingfisher is valued at 18 times last year's earnings. For all the shareholder-friendly actions, that's not cheap. A stronger UK housing market will help, but profits in France are still treading water.
