France has dropped an arrest warrant for a British woman detained in 1989 on drug-related charges in a case that exposes the shortcomings of the EU's fast-track extradition system, human rights groups said today.Deborah Dark, 46, was arrested in France on drug-related offences and held for eight months pending trial.The French court found her not guilty of all her charges and she was released, but the French court of appeal overturned the original verdict without her knowledge in 1990, sentencing her to six years in prison.In 2005, the French authorities issued a European arrest warrant for Dark to be extradited to serve her sentence.She was arrested at gunpoint, strip-searched and handcuffed by customs police when she arrived in Turkey in 2007."I couldn't get any explanation from Turkish police, all they said was: 'Ask Interpol,'" said Dark, who told UK police about what had happened."They searched their databases and told me there was no outstanding warrant listed. I went to the Serious Organised Crime Agency and they said the same thing. So I assumed it must have been a dreadful error."In 2008, Dark was arrested at a Spanish airport as she was about to return to the UK to await extradition to France.Her retired father, whom she had come to visit, had to take her daughter and her two grandchildren back to England while she was held for a month to await a hearing.The Spanish court refused to extradite Dark to France on the grounds that too much time had passed since the date of the alleged offences and that there was no chance of a fair retrial as evidence had disappeared and witnesses had either died or would not have remembered the events.Dark was released and flew back to England in October 2008, but was arrested when she arrived at Gatwick airport by British police under the same European arrest warrant. She was held overnight at Holloway prison, in London, before being released on bail.In April this year, City of Westminster magistrates' court refused to extradite her for the same reasons as the Spanish court.The judge found that there was a "high risk of prejudice to Deborah Dark in the conduct of the retrial itself, and this must be unjust".Despite the ruling, Dark could not risk travelling abroad – she has not seen her father for two years – because of the European arrest warrant hanging over her.Her ordeal finally ended after the French authorities informed Fair Trials International, the legal charity that has been supporting her, that they no longer sought her extradition because of the statute of limitations.As of yesterday, she can travel without fear of arrest and plans to visit her father in Spain as soon as possible."It's been hell on earth – I broke down and sobbed when they told me," she told the Guardian. "I can start rebuilding my life."Fair Trials International says the case of Dark and others such as the football fan Garry Mann highlights the injustices of the European arrest warrant system with its fast-track extradition.Brought in after the September 11 2001 attacks in the US, the warrant was designed for serious crimes of national security.But according to Fair Trials International, people from all across Europe are being sent to other EU member states over minor offences or to serve prison sentences imposed after unfair trials."We are delighted that, 23 years after a French court first acquitted her, Deborah Dark is finally a free woman," said Jago Russell, the chief executive of Fair Trials International."She should not, though, have been put through this horrendous ordeal."Europe's fast-track extradition system must be reformed so countries are required to remove warrants when European courts have concluded that extradition would be unjust."
