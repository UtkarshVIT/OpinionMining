An examination of the background to and legality of Blair's decision to go to war in Iraq undoubtedly remains important. The late Robin Cook noted that it was much discussed and little opposed in cabinet (O'Donnell tries to keep cabinet Iraq talks secret, November 25). Also worthy of investigation is the government's behaviour since the initial phase of the conflict ended in May 2003, which raises important issues relating to our governance. The truth has been systematically covered up. Those in the Commons who continue to ask questions receive little support from the majority, despite the house having been seriously misinformed before the war and treated with a degree of contempt during the debates on the several inquiries after it. Briefly, it appeared that Gordon Brown was prepared to tackle this issue, but his initiative seems to have evaporated. The government's intention to reduce the analytical power of the Defence Intelligence Staff, the only element in Whitehall that got it right, is a clear indication that important lessons have been neglected.Dr Brian JonesSouthamptonOn Monday, in London, Shell, BP and Exxon will try to steal Iraq's oil. They want the Iraqi Petroleum Company to sign 20-year deals that give them 70% of the revenue. This deal has been rejected by the Iraqi parliament and people. This is a far worse deal than any other oil-producing country has accepted. How desperately do we need this oil that we're ready to starve the Iraqis of the funds to rebuild their country after our occupation? The new Obama world order looks the same as Bush's.Janet SalmonRichmond, Surrey
