Canada's immigration minister Jason Kenney has come under sustained criticism from lawyers representing migrants after his sudden change to visa rules in June made it obligatory for skilled workers from English- and French-speaking countries to prove that they are competent in one of those languages before they are allowed to settle.Applicants who could provide documentary proof of schooling in English or French medium countries were not required to sit either the Ielts test of English or the Test d'Evaluation de Français, but the rule change removes that exemption.David Matas, a spokesman for the Canadian Bar Association, called the change arbitrary and a violation of applicants' rights."What [the minister] is doing is taking a power over processing and using it, in effect, to amend the law," Matas told The Globe and Mail newspaper. "It gives me a good deal of concern and isn't just about language testing or immigration. It's the sort of power that, if accepted, would wreak havoc with all our laws."Other critics said it would delay applications and add extra costs for up to 30,000 migrants from English- or French-speaking countries.A ministerial spokeswoman said the change was necessary because non-native English or French speakers often used the documentation option and visa officers found it difficult to assess their abilities.Meanwhile, Canada's National Post newspaper reported that eight members of the Afghan military, wanted in the US after going awol from an English language training course at an air force base in Texas, are seeking refugee status in Canada.Japan schools look forward to business-English boostJapan's beleaguered English language training sector is hopeful that a trend among Japanese companies to make English their official in‑house language, in a bid to internationalise their businesses, will create new demand for classes.Rakuten, Japan's biggest online retailer, plans to make English the firm's official language, while Fast Retailing, operator of the Uniqlo clothing chain, wants to make English more common in its offices by 2012 and plans to test its employees. The company hopes overseas sales will eventually account for 70% of its online sales and staff will be expected to master English by 2012 or face the sack. "No English, no job," Rakuten CEO Hiroshi Mikitani said.Japanese carmakers Toyota and Nissan have also announced moves to increase the use of English.Fast Retailing will not provide English classes for staff. "How [employees] choose to meet these expectations is a personal choice," Daisuke Hase, a spokesman for Fast Retailing told Reuters.Beijing seeks to build on Olympic foundationsResidents of Beijing are under renewed pressure to learn English as part of an official drive to make the Chinese capital into a "world city".A recently relaunched government programme, which started in 2002 in preparation for the Beijing Olympics, calls for all preschools in the city to introduce English courses within five years.According to local press reports, a minimum of 60% of shop assistants, receptionists and hairdressers under 40 will also be required to pass English tests by 2015, as will 80% of police officers.Every civil servant under the age of 40 with a bachelor's degree will also be required to master a minimum of 1,000 English sentences.Max de Lotbinièremax.delotbiniere@theguardian.com
