Though the democracy-inspired New Wave Brazilian cinema of the 1960s could be described as a cohesive genre, contemporary Brazilian cinema, as diverse as its cultural heritage, defies easy labelling. This urban-centric festival has many tales to tell, facutal and fictional, that dispel the poverty-and-violence impression given by the likes of City Of God, such as The Sign Of The City, an engaging look at the vastness of SÃ£o Paulo revolving around four listeners of an astrology radio show. There's also an unusual twist in The Conception, which features over-privileged, hedonistic bureaucrats' children causing mayhem in Brasilia, and December, the directorial debut of popular actor Selton Mello in which disenfranchised flatmates plan a heist - with a transvestite cabbie. Back in familiar territory, Last Stop 174 is the fictionalised story of a young homeless man whose tragic life as a street child led to the hijacking of a bus in Rio de Janeiro.
