From the Norman Conquest to the Sun's ineffable "Hop Off You Frogs" relations between Britain - mainly England - and France have tended to be fraught, not least militarily.The two sides have historically been "most dear enemies" and the roll call of battles around the world - Crecy, Agincourt, Blenheim, Quebec, Waterloo - have echoed the wars fought: 100 Years' War, Spanish Succession, Austrian Succession, Seven Years, Napoleonic.Since 1815 however, it's mostly been cooperation: in the Crimea, the First World War, Second World War (overlooking the sinking of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kabir), Suez. The Entente Cordiale has lasted since 1904.But mutual incomprehension can break through: Lord Raglan, a veteran of Waterloo, leading the British army in the Crimea, kept on referring to his French allies as the enemy and British generals in the First World War had problems understanding their French counterparts - as they did the Brits.Sarkozy may be the first French president actively anxious to court les Anglo-Saxons. Addressing Parliament two years ago he called for a "new brotherhood".Most antagonism now is fortunately confined to the rugby field. Ominously however there are reports that the old affectionate French term for the English: "les rosbifs" has been replaced by a more demotic term they hear too often on English lips: "les fuck-offs."
