Tesco is facing criticism from farmers for promoting New Zealand lamb at the height of the British season for the meat, despite its promises to back local producers.National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Meurig Raymond said he was angry and disappointed that Tesco was promoting imported meat just 18 months after promising farmers at their annual union conference that it would source more red meat closer to home in the wake of the horsemeat scandal.In full-page adverts taken out in the wake of the scandal, in which horsemeat was found in burgers sold in Tesco and other retailers, the supermarket stated: "We know that the more we work with British farmers the better."Raymond said: "Consumers want to buy our great British product and know when it is in peak season, so it is vitally important at this time of year to give clearly-labelled, home-grown lamb pride of place, when there is a good, affordable and fresh supply on our doorstep." He said that the UK had more than enough lamb to be self-sufficient and that grass-fed spring-born British lamb was now in peak season, while meat from the southern hemsiphere was at the end of its season.Tesco said it sold more British lamb than any other retailer and expected to sell more than ever before this season ends."We are delivering on our commitment to strengthen our relationships with British sheep farmers through our Tesco Sustainable Lamb Group, which currently supports around 200 farmers," a Tesco spokesperson said.The latest clash comes after Tesco was criticised by farmers for cutting the amount of British beef it bought. A report by the National Farmers' Union published in February found that while the supermarket had achieved its promise of sourcing all fresh chicken in the UK, it had not set a timetable for its aim of putting British chicken in all its ready meals and had not even set an "aspiration" to source 100% British lamb in season. Tesco said at the time that it did not recognise the 8% fall in its purchase of British beef highlighted by the NFU and that all its beef was sourced in either the UK or Ireland, which customers did not differentiate between.Since then the price of British beef has dived as shoppers continue to shy away from buying processed foods with beef at a time of relatively high stocks.
