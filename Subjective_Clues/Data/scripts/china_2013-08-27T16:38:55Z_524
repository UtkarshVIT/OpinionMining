Tiffany, the New York-based jeweller, said its second-quarter profits were up 16% to $106m (Â£68.3m) driven by strong sales in China.The company, which sponsored Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby, said revenue from stores open at least a year were up 5%. Total sales for the quarter were $956m.Defying the continued fallout from the eurozone crisis, sales in mainland Europe and the UK were up 11%. Sales in the Americas were 2% higher overall and, in Japan, they fell 14%, dragged down by a weaker yen.But Asia-Pacific sales climbed 20%, led by strong results in China, which is considered a bellwether for the luxury market.The results came as figures showed Americans' confidence in the economy inched closer to its highest point in five-and-a-half years on growing optimism that hiring and wages could pick up in coming months.The Conference Board said today that its consumer confidence index rose to 81.5 in August, up from 81 in July and just below June's 82.1 reading, which was the highest since January 2008.Consumers' income expectations, which fell this year after a January tax increase, rebounded to the highest level in two-and-a-half years, said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's economic indicators.Although consumers were more confident about the future, their assessment of the economy dipped slightly in August.Consumers' confidence in the economy is watched closely because their spending accounts for about 70% of US economic activity.After hitting bottom at 25.3 in February 2009, the index has bounced back, but it has yet to attain a reading of 90, which signals a healthy economy.
