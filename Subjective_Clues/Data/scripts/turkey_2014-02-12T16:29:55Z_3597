A couple of weeks ago I was extolling the virtues of Medway council in Kent because it set aside a row of seats at meetings to accommodate citizen journalists.In the press release announcing this welcome initiative, the council's deputy leader, Alan Jarrett, was quoted as saying: "We are very keen to engage with people and to help them play a part in local democracy... It is important that councils are open and accountable."Could this be the same Alan Jarrett who is the subject of a feather-brained complaint about a report in last Friday's issue of the local newspaper, the Medway Messenger? I'm afraid it is.The Messenger carried an article about the council's budget proposals under the headline "Taxpaying 'turkeys' see bills rise". As you will immediately have grasped, the paper was referring to that clich√© about turkeys voting for Christmas. It did so because, at a briefing, Jarrett used that very phrase.However, as far as the council was concerned, the story did not make it obvious enough that he was not calling taxpayers turkeys. So, in a nonsensical statement on its website, the council argued that Jarrett "did not liken Medway residents to turkeys... he used a phrase called an idiom or simile to explain a situation."Doh! Clearly, the reporter knew that and the readers knew that. Naturally enough, the paper rejected the complaint as being, well, fatuous.The result is not so funny, however. As retribution, the paper has been told that the council's press office will communicate with the reporter in future only "by email rather than on the phone or face to face... so it can keep a paper trail of all communication with him in case further inaccuracies are ever reported."
