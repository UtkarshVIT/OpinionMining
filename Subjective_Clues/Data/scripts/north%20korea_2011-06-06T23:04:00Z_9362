Exactly a century ago, a tremendous thunderstorm broke over this part of the country. Tales of its duration and ferocity have been passed down through the generations; it flattened growing corn and hay, killed grazing livestock and did serious damage to buildings. One of the last-named was the medieval church in my village, Old Brampton. Its tower was put up in the 13th century and capped with an early type of broached spire 100 years later. That storm knocked the top off the spire and you can see the replacement masonry to this day. The topmost stone, which fell to the ground, was rescued by the church warden, taken to his garden (which is now mine) and fashioned into a bird bath, as which it still does service.It takes me only a couple of minutes to cross a sheep pasture and come to the crest of the broad, green valley, where it's possible to look back to the church steeple poking above the graveyard trees and out, the other way, to pick out the bright towers of Hardwick Hall all of nine miles away to the south-east. On a bright summer evening the massive, pioneering fenestration of Bess of Hardwick's pile really does live up to the old local rhyme "Hardwick Hall – more glass than wall". The funny thing about this green valley below my field-end lookout is that it lacks a name: no official name on any map, and no local, unofficial one either. But that doesn't in any way detract from its beauty. Just recently the green fields of waving corn, and grass waiting to be made into silage, have had a particularly fine fringe of purest white lace – cow parsley in rampant bloom.Looking back to the village, I espied the top of the church spire and thought of my bird bath, which must be one of the oldest in the country. Instead of supporting a gold cockerel it must now suffer the ignominy these past 100 years of serving blackbird, robin and house sparrow.
