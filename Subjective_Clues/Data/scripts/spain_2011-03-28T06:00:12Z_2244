This week, the Guardian's New Europe series travels to Spain, arguably the hardest hit of any big EU country by the economic crisis and the only one with a left-of-centre government.Our correspondents, columnists and critics will report on everything from food to fertility treatment, street style to sculpture, bullfighting to Britons abroad. We will interview leaders from the worlds of politics, business, gastronomy and education, and will investigate the strains on federalism that periodically undermine Spanish unity.We are teaming up with leading publications in each country to get a better sense of the national conversation. Stay with us on this journey. Get to know your neighbours a bit better.
