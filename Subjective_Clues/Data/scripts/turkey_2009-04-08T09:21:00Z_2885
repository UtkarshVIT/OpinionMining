Italy's Campari has bought the Wild Turkey bourbon brand from the French drinks group Pernod Ricard in a $575m (£391m) deal – the biggest acquisition in Campari's history.Campari is paying cash for the business, which includes the Wild Turkey brands, American Honey liqueur and distillery facilities in Kentucky. Campari makes several whiskies but no bourbon.Wild Turkey is a Kentucky bourbon that dates back to 1855 and has been owned by Pernod – the world's second-largest spirits maker after Britain's Diageo – for nearly three decades. It has yet to capitalise on its long and colourful history – its share of the US spirits market is much lower than that of Jack Daniels, the Tennessee whiskey, and Jim Beam bourbon.The acquisition will strengthen Campari's position in the US and international spirits markets. Nearly two-thirds of its sales will come from outside Italy after the deal closes at the end of June.Campari's chief executive Bob Kunze-Concewitz said: "With Wild Turkey Campari adds a brand of strategic relevance to its portfolio and further enhances its premium offering. It is a unique opportunity to enter the attractive bourbon whiskey category and exploit its growth potential through a global and leading brand. The transaction demonstrates our commitment, in line with our strategy, of continuing growth in the profitable US spirits market."As well as selling Wild Turkey, Pernod Ricard said it planned to raise €1bn (£900m) through a rights issue, which will be used to pay down borrowings. Pernod has been offloading products that fall outside its 15 main brands in an effort to repay debt taken on last year to buy the Absolut vodka maker Vin & Sprit.
