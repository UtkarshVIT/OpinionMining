Lower Rhine Music Festival, Dusseldorf, Tuesday."Ever since the far-off times of the great madrigal composers, England has played but a modest part in the concert of the great musical powers."For the products of the musical mind, she has depended almost entirely on importation, she has exported nothing but works of a lighter order."Such are the words with which the German author of the "Gerontius" programme, specially written for this Festival, introduces his subject.Rightly or wrongly, Germany and the Continent of Europe in general did not feel that serious English music was a thing to be taken seriously, and to that fact the writer (of the programme notes) refers with ingenious delicacy, going on to say that about the turn of the century a change began to be noticeable.Everyone concerned with musical affairs knows how that change was brought about, though not everyone on our side of the Channel cares to admit what he knows. It is in the main to Edward Elgar - a man who has done his best work living quietly in the Malvern Hills, remote from commercial distraction and the strife of commercialism - that the change is due.It is not accidental that on the present occasion the names of Handel, Mendelssohn, Schumann are absent, while Bach is very abundantly represented, Beethoven's name figures in connection with the most modern in feeling of all his works (the C minor Symphony) and Liszt's with his revolutionary Faust Symphony. Nor is it accidental that the preference is given to Strauss among German and Elgar among English composers. The performance of yesterday was remarkable for grandeur and dignity, and for the splendid manner in which the vast and complex web of tone was spread out by the mighty orchestra and choir.On looking back at the extraordinary eloquence and beauty of the musical symbolism in the prelude and death agony of Gerontius, one [now] perceives that the quietus which comes to the spirit in the scene following Gerontius's death is merely a climax in a process that really begins with the first note.
