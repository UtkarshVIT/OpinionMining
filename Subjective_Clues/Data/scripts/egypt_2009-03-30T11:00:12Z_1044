Egyptian authorities have released Diaa Eddin Gad, a 22-year-old Egyptian blogger, after nearly seven weeks in detention, during which he was beaten, kicked and threatened with torture, being forced to witness people being electrocuted. Gad's blog Sawt Ghadib (An Angry Voice) contained news and commentary on Gaza during the recent Israeli offensive as well as strident denunciations of Egypt's president Hosni Mubarak. (Via Reuters)
