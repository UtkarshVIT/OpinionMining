Anyone in Israel who is unhappy with Barack Obama's speech in Cairo will have a hard time to come up with a good reason. Indeed, the quick and completely undignified reaction of the settler movement only served to underline the fact that beyond racist ranting about "Hussein Obama", there wasn't really much to object to. Inadvertently, the settler movement's reaction also illustrated what Obama had accomplished with the speech: he had set up a litmus test that greatly improved on his predecessor's formula "you are either with us or against us in the fight against terror." In the Obama era, the choice is a different one – you are either for or against peaceful co-existence – and the consequences of the choice are clear: "America will align our policies with those who pursue peace".So who would want to be on the wrong side of Obama at a time when this looks suspiciously as if it was also the wrong side of history? Netanyahu's government was quick to address the challenge, releasing a short statement that expressed hope for "reconciliation between the Arab and Muslim world and Israel" and "an end to the conflict"; the statement further declared that "Israel is committed to peace and will make every effort to expand the circle of peace while protecting its interests, especially its national security".The question of how well Obama understands Israel's security concerns had loomed large in the run-up to the Cairo speech. Both the international and the Israeli media – and, presumably, their audiences – couldn't get enough of debating the odds of a major clash between Washington and Jerusalem on the issue of settlement construction. The Obama administration's ostensibly inflexible stance that opposed all construction, even if it did not encroach on additional land, was widely interpreted in Israel as a sign that America's new president had bought into the simplistic narrative that holds that if only Israel could be pushed into enough concessions, peace would suddenly break out in the Middle East.Anyone in Israel who still has such concerns after Obama's speech in Cairo should listen to the speech again (and repeat this treatment as often as needed). No Israeli could ask more from an American president who goes to an Arab capital to address the Muslim world in a quest for improved mutual understanding: Obama reaffirmed America's "unbreakable" bond with Israel; he demanded that "Palestinians must abandon violence" and that Hamas must "recognise Israel's right to exist"; and he was breathtakingly blunt when he turned to the Arab states and demanded their support for the peace process:If anything could have been improved in Obama's speech from an Israeli point of view, it was the part that addressed the Holocaust denial championed by Ahmadinejad. Before turning to this issue, Obama noted that "the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied". He then went on to say that the Jewish people had been persecuted for centuries around the world, but this first half of the sentence will likely be overshadowed by the second half: "antisemitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust".While it is clear enough from history that Zionism predated the Holocaust, Obama's speech leaves room for the popular Middle Eastern misperception that the Jews were "compensated" for the Holocaust with a state in Palestine. In a speech that amply quoted religious scripture and did not shy away from sensitive subjects, there could perhaps have been a mention of the yearning for the Land of Israel and Jerusalem that is an integral part of Jewish prayer and ritual. Moreover, given that Obama was trying to establish a certain symmetry by describing Jews and Palestinians as "two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive", it would have been arguably more persuasive and indeed more appropriate to refer to the hundreds of thousands of Jews who were driven out of Muslim countries in the wake of the UN partition plan of 1947. After all, watching Obama's speech in Cairo meant for some Israeli Jews to see the American president in their hometown.Whether Obama's speech will eventually be regarded as a truly historic event that marked the beginning of a new era remains to be seen. But the president surely deserves praise for the attempt to repeatedly emphasise shared interests in a region where political leaders can expect to be popular irrespective of what they deliver for the people they govern, because it's enough to be perceived as "standing up against US influence". This was cited as an explanation for poll results last year that showed that the three most popular political leaders in the Arab world were Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah, the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.While there is little reason to object to anything in Obama's speech from a mainstream Israeli perspective, just like people everywhere in the region, Israelis still wonder what concrete Middle East policies the Obama administration will pursue. What may be most worrisome for the Israeli government is not what Obama said, but rather what he didn't say. Reportedly, there is some disappointment that Obama did not put a stronger emphasis on the need to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.Yet there are precious few indications that would support the alarmists who believe that Obama is oblivious to Middle Eastern realities and will recklessly push Israel into concessions that will endanger its security. If even Israel's hawkish foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman can praise Obama's speech for offering a "vision of a better world", it surely is time to try to make this vision reality.
