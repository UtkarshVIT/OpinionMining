The Scottish Government has called on the UK government to support the creation of a .scot internet domain for Scotland.Alex Neil, cabinet secretary for infrastructure and capital investment has written to counterpart Ed Vaizey, minister for culture, communications and creative industries, asking him to back the not-for-profit company Dot Scot Registry (DSR) which has been set up specifically to ensure a domain is established.The move has been timed in advance of a three month period, beginning on 12 January 2012, when the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) will open the application window for new top level domains.Neil said: "The Scottish Government is behind this company (DSR) because we believe there is strong demand for a dotscot domain and that it should be run as a public resource on a not-for-profit basis that will quickly become self-financing."I am sure the UK government with its responsibility for internet governance will want to support us. Across the board support would undoubtedly strengthen our hand and build momentum behind the bid."Dotscot will be a wonderful asset for establishing a distinctive online identity for many organisations and people who have been described as the worldwide family of Scots and want to demonstrate that identity online."A spokesperson for the Scottish Government told GGC that it is not yet thinking seriously about whether to move public sector websites to a new domain, but that it could consider the idea in the future.At time of publication the Department for Culture, Media and Sport had not given an indication on whether it is likely to back the application.A similar campaign has been launched to provide a .cymru domain for Wales. The dotCYM campaign group said it would play a role in validating Welsh culture and language.This article is published by Guardian Professional.
