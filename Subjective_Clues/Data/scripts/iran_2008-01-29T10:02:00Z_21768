Iran's most important women's magazine, Zanan (Women), has been forced to close after 16 years of publication, after being accused of painting a "dark picture" of Iran. Its founder, Shahla Sherkat, is considered a prime example of Islamic Iranian feminism. She has been accused of "compromising the psyche and the mental health" of its readers by providing them with "morally questionable information." (Via AKI)
