Australians have long had to deal with jibes relating to the, well, career choices made by many of the first immigrants to their country's fair shores. Now, according to the Daily Telegraph, Robin Williams has joined the fray, calling the barbecue-loving populace "English rednecks". Then he broke the ultimate taboo, calling Australian rules football "rugby with a thong". "If Darwin had landed in Australia, he'd have gone, 'I'm wrong â€“ I don't know what I was thinking'." Let's hope Williams, who ranted to David Letterman, isn't planning a holiday or film down under any time soon.
