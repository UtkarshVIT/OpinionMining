Even with the presence of the late Heath Ledger in his final performance, Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus always looked like it might struggle to recoup its $45m budget. Gilliam's films, after all, have something of a habit of haemorrhaging cash, and the movie struggled to find a distribution deal in the US. But the former Python can rest assured that his film is, at the very least, wildly popular in Italy.Variety reports that Parnassus took a whopping $2.7m in its first weekend there, enough to put it at No 2 on the box-office chart. Distributors had clearly underestimated the appeal of a bit of fantastical Gilliam whimsy, for the film only screened in 227 cinemas. It will expand to more than 300 from this weekend to cope with demand, but the meagre number of screens available for viewers wanting to see the film meant that it scored the country's third-highest per-screen average of the year, an impressive $11,870 for each cinema.Gilliam's film, the tale of a travelling theatre company which offers audience members the chance to enter a fantastical world beyond its dusty curtain, is also faring decently in the UK, where it entered the chart at No 3 with a bow of Â£905,000 two weekends ago. The prospects therefore look a little better for the film's US debut on Christmas Day, though so far it is only being tested on limited release there.Roberto Proia, head of Italian distributor Moviemax, said Ledger's huge fanbase had undoubtedly helped Parnassus to achieve success in Italy. "We also found out that teenagers massively love Gilliam, and we did not expect this," he said. "He really has rock-star status."Gilliam's most successful box-office take is his $57m haul for 1995's science fiction thriller 12 Monkeys. His last film, 2006's fantasy drama Tideland, however, took just $566,000 across the world.
