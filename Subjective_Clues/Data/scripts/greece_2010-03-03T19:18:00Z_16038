Greeks were told today that they faced seeing their country go bankrupt unless they accepted more austerity measures, as the prime minister ignored public outrage and pushed ahead with a radical new package of budgetary reforms.The draconian measures, unveiled after an emergency cabinet meeting, were essential for the debt-plagued country's "survival and economy", said George Papandreou over protests against his policies.Financial markets, including the FTSE100 in London, rose on the news as analysts predicted Greece now had more chance of raising money on the bond markets to meet its budget shortfalls."We have done what we need to do. We are now justifiably expecting EU solidarity. Europe has a historic responsibility," said the socialist leader.The measures, the third set in as many months, are expected to raise an extra ¤4.8bn for the cash-strapped country – deemed crucial if Greece is to meet its target of reducing its massive public deficit by 4% this year.Papandreou, who will hold talks with the German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Friday, has come under unprecedented pressure from the EU to adopt the tougher policies. The new measures include further cuts in civil servants' annual pay through a 30% reduction of bonuses traditionally handed out at Easter and Christmas; a 2% hike in VAT, from the current 19%; higher taxes on alcohol, tobacco and luxury goods, including cars and yachts, and a freeze on state-funded pensions.But, with fears of social unrest also mounting, opposition was swift and strong. Reacting to the "barbaric" policies, the hardline KKE communist party called on Greeks to take to the streets."It is the responsibility and duty of workers and the poor to reject the lies of the government, the EU, the plutocracy and to rise up against these measures," it said.The civil servants' union, which appealed to Greeks to join a third one-day strike on 16 March, also vowed to fight the measures and warned of a "social explosion".Today, pensioners staged a mass demonstration outside the prime minister's office chanting "hands off state coffers" with many scuffling with officers as they broke a police cordon."The hungry don't fear prison, this is just the beginning," said Dimitris Dermantoudis, wearing a placard that proclaimed "70% of our pensions are under ¤600."But Papandreou, who has been emboldened by polls showing majority support for the measures, insisted that he would push ahead with the reforms despite the political cost.Addressing his parliamentary group on Tuesday, he warned of national catastrophe if the measures were not adopted. "We have to take difficult and hard decisions which in many cases are unfair," said the leader who was elected last October promising that lower- and middle-income workers would not pay the price of redressing the country's dire public finances. "We are in a race against time to keep our economy alive ... the country is in a state of war."Greece's debt crisis has dominated headlines since the socialists revealed the country's public deficit would reach 12.7% of GDP – nearly twice that predicted by the former conservative government – within weeks of taking office last October. In addition, Greece is saddled with debt worth ¤300bn euro, more than 120% of GDP.Papandreou has been criticized for not legislating and enforcing the ambitious deficit-reducing policies fast enough. On Monday, European Commissioner Olli Rehn said 'the key to success" would be the implementation of measures along with structural reforms aimed at developing the country's economy and competitiveness.Markets will be watching to see whether Merkel endorses the new measures and is prepared to offer guarantees of support when she meets Papandreou on Friday.The German chancellor has praised the Greek government's "courageous" steps but so far eschewed any concrete offer of help despite persistent media reports that both Germany and France are poised to assist Athens with up to 25 billion euro in aid.
