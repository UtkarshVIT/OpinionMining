It calls itself Asia’s food capital and has five restaurants in the World’s Top 100, but Singapore’s comfort food is hawker noodles. The dish westerners know as “Singapore noodles” doesn’t exist here – locals eschew its curry-powdered charms. Singapore’s virile noodle culture is all about mee. Bak chor mee is thin rice and egg noodles punctuated with stewed mushrooms, fried dried sole, minced pork and black vinegar (try Chia Keng at Chong Boon Food Centre). The flat mee in char kway teow are fried with crunchy lard croutons, prawns, cockles, bean sprouts and chives – calorifically wonderful at Hill St Char Kway Teow (Bedok South market). And I adore the fishball mee at Song Kee (Toa Payoh Lor 5). Mr Teo’s (Geylang Lorong 29, 396 E Coast Road). Hokkien mee are perfectly al dente – cooked in prawn stock and stuck with smoky lard croutons. Just don’t ask for curry powder.
