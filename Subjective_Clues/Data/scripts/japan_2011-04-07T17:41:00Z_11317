North-eastern Japan has been shaken by its biggest aftershock since the 11 March earthquake and its immediate aftermath. Authorities warned people to flee some coastal areas as a result of the offshore quake, which was centred in the same area as the original.Nearly 12,700 people died and another 14,700 are missing as a result of the 11 March disaster. The latest quake shook buildings hundreds of miles away and authorities issued a warning that waves of up to two metres might hit the coast of Miyagi prefecture. People were told to "evacuate immediately" to a safe place away from the shore.Neighbouring provinces were advised coastal areas might experience half-metre waves. The quake was measured at magnitude 7.1 with an epicentre 40 miles off the coast of Sendai and 30 miles under the sea.Announcers on Japan's public broadcaster NHK told coastal residents to run to higher ground and away from the shore. But the Japan Meteorological Agency cancelled its tsunami warnings and advisories within 90 minutes.Officials at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant said there was no immediate sign of new problems. Japan's nuclear safety agency said workers there retreated to a quake-resistant shelter in the complex and no one was injured. The plant has been in crisis mode trying to stop reactors melting down after the original quake and tsunami knocked out its cooling systems.The latest quake knocked out several power lines at the Onagawa nuclear power plant north of Sendai, which has been shut down since the tsunami. One remaining line was supplying power to the plant and radiation monitoring devices detected no abnormalities. The plant's spent fuel pools briefly lost cooling but an emergency diesel generator kicked in.The quake that preceded last month's tsunami was of magnitude 9.
