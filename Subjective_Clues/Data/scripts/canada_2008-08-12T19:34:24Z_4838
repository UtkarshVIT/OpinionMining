As the battle for control of the Arctic's energy resources heats up, the US is partnering with its territorial rival Canada for a cruise to map areas of the oil-rich continental shelf.In addition to the Canadian cruise next month, the US state department is slated to launch a preliminary voyage tomorrow that will use echo-sounder technology to produce a 3D map of the Chukchi Cap, located about 600 miles north of Alaska.The two cruises by the US coast guard cutter ship Healy mark the fourth year of America's efforts to claim a share of the expansive oil reserves in the Arctic. One-fifth of the world's available and untapped fuel is located in the far north, the US government estimates.Data collected from the Healy's cruises will be publicly released and "provide greater scientific insight into relatively unexplored regions of the ocean," the state department said this week.The voyages also could mark a new era of cooperation between the US and Canada, which are vying with Russia and Denmark to control parts of the Arctic seafloor. Russia's planting of a flag on the North Pole last year marked an escalation of the underwater land race.The Healy's findings could further enflame the politically charged debate over drilling in protected areas of the Arctic and the US coasts, depending on the data uncovered by the cruise.But the US-Canada cruise is primarily an alliance to aid both countries' scientific goals. Canada brings a seismic mapping system to the table hat uses sea sediments to measure the seafloor, while the Healy brings superior ice-breaking power to the venture.Even if the US can make a case for ownership of Arctic land beyond 200 miles off the Alaskan coast, ratification of the UN law of the sea treaty is likely necessary to formalise a claim. The US is the only nation hunting for Arctic resources that has yet to approve the treaty.
