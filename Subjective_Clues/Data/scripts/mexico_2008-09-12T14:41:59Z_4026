It was a familiar scene in a state along the drug-torn Mexico-Texas border -- a group of men lying face down with their hands tied behind their backs -- except these 35 men were wearing the dark blue pants and light blue shirts issued to the local police.Soldiers and federal agents captured the cops in Torreon, Coahuila, after a shootout this week in which 28 city patrol pickups were sent to free five Gulf cartel operatives just arrested by federal police, authorities said.On Thursday, the 35 police were charged with attempted murder and drug crimes and moved from jail to a state prison.And it was just one of several cases of high-profile police corruption or misconduct this week.On the opposite side of the country, where Mexico borders Guatemala, another big police bust this week netted 26 agents, including the Tabasco state police chief. They were allegedly on a payroll doled out to officers by the Zetas, a paramilitary group linked to the Gulf cartel.And in the beach resort of San Jose del Cabo, six officers are under house arrest for allegedly beating an American tourist to death at the local jail in August. Federal police and army soldiers are increasingly taking on local and state law enforcement groups that have sold out to drug traffickers and kidnappers, analysts say. And the criminal groups are rapidly spreading their influence far beyond the US-Mexico border, where police collusion with narcos has been legendary.The sudden airing of high-profile cases shows not just the familiar pattern of corrupt cops, but also the takeover of local and state law enforcement by the cartels and kidnappers, one security consultant said."What is new in terms of the narcos is that they have the money to buy off the local police force anytime they want to," said Jon French, head of the Mexico City firm Problem Solvers. "You had corrupt police in the past, but not to this extent because you didn't have such a narco problem."With the 350,000 state and local police outnumbering their drug-fighting federal counterparts by nearly 20-to-1, President Felipe Calderon faces an uphill task to neutralise corrupt local forces, analysts said.But the corruption is not limited to poorly paid local and state police. A federal police commander was among those arrested in Tabasco, and Mexico City authorities implicated a female officer from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a kidnapping ring that often killed its young victims.French said the record level of drug violence and busts of corrupt police has a counter-intuitive upside: Calderon's drug crackdown is fuelling the narco turf war and the internecine slayings among the cartels and their official protectors.Police involvement in the complex turf war among the Gulf, Sinaloa, Juarez and other cartels has also led to a record 450 police deaths this year, including 75 in August."I would be worried if there was no news at all on this front because that would mean the narcos were in control," said French, who gives security advice to US and Mexican business executives.But other security experts see it differently: the record 3,500 drug-related killings this year and the growing co-optation of local and state forces show that the government has lost control of wide swaths of Mexican territory.As drug traffickers' power grows through new businesses like kidnapping, protection rackets and even the distribution of pirated goods like music CDs and videos, so does their power to corrupt police, analysts said."The power of organised crime is growing and spreading to new territories," said Arturo Yanez, a former adviser to the federal government on security issues. "With it, we see the weakening and the disintegration of law enforcement institutions."
