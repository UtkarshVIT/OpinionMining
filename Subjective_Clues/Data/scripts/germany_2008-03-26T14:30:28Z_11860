Aufkl√§rung ... hundreds of lamps moulded after a bust of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Photograph: Jens Meyer/APThe previous leg of our long-running world literature tour took us to Romania, where we explored the vibrant literary health of a country few of us know in any detail, despite being a fellow member of the European Union. Many suggestions came from Bucharest resident vic31, with particular recommendations for Mircea Cartarescu's epic trilogy (Aripa Stinga, Corpul, Aripa Dreapta /The Left Wing, The Body, The Right Wing), reminiscent of Updike, and Filip Florian's magical realist Degete Mici (Little Fingers), which follows the mystery of whether some bones unearthed during an archaeological dig are from an ancient Roman military camp or a 1950s mass grave. Another poster, AIBlyth, drew our attention to his own translation of Little Fingers, to be published in the US by Harcourt, before recommending contemporary novels from Dan Lungu (Hens' Heaven), Stefan Agopian (Tache de Velvet) and Doina Rusti (Zogru).Nilpferd was also on hand with some fascinating suggestions, notably the surrealist writer Urmuz, an important precursor to one of Romania's most famous literary sons, the Romanian-French playwright Eugen Ionescu.Delve further into Romania's rich literary landscape hereMoving closer to home, we now pick up our wayfarer's thread in Germany, cradle of Sturm und Drang, Romantic irony and heartfelt post-war political realism. Germany's literary tradition is, of course, one of the greatest, stretching from Goethe - one of the first genuinely international literary superstars - and Schiller to WG Sebald and Gunter Grass, writers accorded a station in society that few English literary authors would expect. Today, with the country successfully reunified and the post-war heritage entering a new, more optimistic stage, the world of German books is flourishing.Before we open the gates to the flood of suggestions of great and lesser-known German authors and works (no Austrians, mind - we'll save that other great nation of German-language literature for another month), I'll leave you with the words of Novalis, aka Friedrich von Hardenberg, one of the greatest of the Jena romantics, writing of language as"a wonderful and fertile mystery: that when someone speaks merely in order to speak, one precisely then expresses the most splendid and most original truths."Substitute "speak" for "write", and one might have an honourable motto for the blogging spirit, no?And don't forget to vote on which country you think we should visit next.Read about former stop-offs on our world literature tour here.
