On May Day 2014, we student union officers and student activists are calling for the release of imprisoned Iranian trade unionist Shahrokh Zamani. On 23 April, Zamani ended a 47-day hunger strike after officials at Gohardasht prison agreed to transfer him to a wing reserved for political prisoners. A member of the Iranian painters' union jailed for attempting to build independent workers' organisations, he has also taken action in solidarity with groups including students and oppressed religious minorities. We call for the release of Shahrokh Zamani and all labour movement, student movement and political prisoners in Iran.Shreya Paudel National Union of Students international students officer-electDom Anderson NUS vice-president society & citizenshipDaniel Stevens NUS international students officerPiers Telemacque NUS VP society & citizenship-elect, Bradford College SU PresidentJoe Vinson NUS Vice-president, further educationHannah Paterson NUS disabled students officerSky Yarlett NUS LGBT officer (open place)Finn McGoldrick NUS LGBT officer (women's place)Gordon Maloney NUS Scotland presidentSteph Lloyd NUS Wales presidentMegan Dunn NUS vice-president higher education-electKelley Temple NUS women's officerShelly Asquith SUArts president and NUS London chairOmar Raii UCL union external affairs OfficerRachel O'Brien University of Birmingham Guild of StudentsDeborah Hermanns University of Birmingham Guild of StudentsChantel Le Carpentier University of Essex SU president-elect and NUS NECTom Flynn University of Bristol Union VP education and NUS NECJames Potter Essex University SU VP educationGrace Skelton Manchester SU general secretaryJamie Green Royal Holloway SU VP communication and campaignsKelly Rogers NUS trustee board-electEdd Bauer NUS trustee boardBeth Redmond National Campaign Against Fees and CutsTom Rutland Oxford University SU presidentRoshni Joshi Ruskin College SURobert Eagleton Cardinal Newman College SUHamish Yewdall Northumbria SU councillorElliot Folan Union of UEA StudentsMichael Chessum University of London Union presidentDaniel Cooper University of London Union vice-president and NUS NEC-electHattie Craig Birmingham University VP educationBecca Anderson Gateshead College SU presidentKirsty Haigh Edinburgh University Students' Association VP servicesEmma Barnes NUS part-time students representativeJosh Rowlands NUS mature students representativeJawanza Ipyana NUS NEC disabled students memberRosie Huzzard NUS NECJames McAsh NUS NECCharles Barry NUS NECPeter Smallwood NUS NECRhiannon Durrans NUS NECJessica Goldstone NUS NECChris Clements NUS NECAmy Smith NUS NEC-electRobert Foster NUS NEC Scotland representativeAfreen Saulat Bath University SUChris Pagett Bath University SUFreya Martin Sheffield Hallam SUEmma Booth Kent University Labour students chairMiguel Costa Matos Warwick SURoza Salih Vice-president diversity & advocacy, Strathclyde Students' Association and NUS trustee board-electAlannah Ainslie Aberdeen University Students AssociationJames Elliott NUS NEC disabled students member-electXavier Cohen Environment & ethics officer, Oxford University Student UnionChristopher Rawlinson Harris Manchester College JCR President, University of OxfordVonnie Sandlan NUS SEC and NUS NEC-electHannah Webb UCLU external affairs and campaigns officer, NCAFC NCHelena Mika JCR Secretary, Harris Manchester College, University of OxfordAbdi-aziz Suleiman NUS NEC-electDario Celaschi President, Stanmore College Students' Union and NEC-electClifford Fleming Manchester SU campaigns and citizenship officer, NUC NEC-elect and co-chair of Young GreensZarah Sultana NUS black students' committee and NUS NEC-electAndy Forse Milton Keynes College SUKelly Teeboon Liverpool Students' Union womens' campaign officer
