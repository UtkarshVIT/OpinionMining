How do newspaper publishers increase profits in these straitened times? By axeing staff, cutting wages and ditching pension schemes, of course.That's the clear message revealed in a set of figures published by the Glasgow-based Herald about its owner, the notoriously secretive Newsquest, the British arm of US media giant Gannett.Its Scottish division, responsible for The Herald, Sunday Herald and the Glasgow Evening Times, has posted a 19.6% rise in pre-tax profits for the year up to 25 December 2011 to £8.7m - despite a drop in revenue, which also saw turnover fall by 2.7% to £56.9m.Staff numbers fell from 597 in 2010 to 537 in 2011. Salaries dropped from £18.8m to £17.1m. And pension costs tumbled from £4.3m to £1.4m as the company closed its defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual from 31 March 2011.Managing director Tim Blott pointed to a 12.5% rise in advertising as a positive sign while noting that "print revenues continue to be under pressure during the current recession."And there could be problems ahead for the company's print plant at Cambuslang. Blott said it "faces a very competitive contract printing market as well as declining print runs and paginations."Source: The Herald Hat tip: AllMedia Scotland
