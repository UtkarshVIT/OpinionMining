Parts of Scotland are likely to see as much as 10cm of snow on Sunday night and into Monday, while forecasters are warning people in Northern Ireland to expect heavy rain.The Met Office said the snow was expected to settle on higher ground in the south of Scotland, while lower-lying areas were likely to see less. Overnight on Saturday, temperatures dipped well below freezing in Scotland.“Accumulations of 2–5cm are expected above 150m, with perhaps around 10cm on ground above 300–400m. On low ground, 1 or 2 cm could accumulate locally. The snow will become lighter and increasingly confined to higher hills during Monday,” it said.It also said that icy patches were likely, caused by rain falling on to sub-zero surfaces on Sunday evening.Forecasters warned people living in Grampian, the Highlands and the Outer Hebrides, Strathclyde and the Central, Tayside and Fife areas to be aware of possible localised travel disruption, with some snow likely to lie on roads.They issued yellow “be aware” warnings, the second least severe. They come after Storm Desmond caused widespread flooding in north-west England.The Met Office said that rain moving northwards into Scotland on Sunday evening was “likely to be preceded by a short spell of snow over higher ground in parts of southern Scotland before producing a longer, more prolonged spell of snow over regions north of the northern Central Belt”.The Met Office said it was caused by warm front moving northwards and meeting colder air over Scotland, which would turn rain to a “relatively prolonged spell of snow”.
