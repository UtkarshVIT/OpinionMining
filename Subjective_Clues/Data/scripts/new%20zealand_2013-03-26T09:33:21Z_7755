New Zealand may set up a regulator to deal with every aspect of media - broadcasting, print and online news.A report by the country's law commission has produced a report urging the creation of a sort of one-stop shop for both old and new media to be known as the News Media Standards Authority (NMSA).The law commission's president, Grant Hammond, distanced the decision from the Leveson inquiry by stating that said that New Zealand's review was not driven by a crisis of confidence in its media.Instead it was prompted by gaps and disparities in the legal and ethical standards and accountabilities that applied to news and current affairs.The NMSA would be a non-state body, with voluntary membership. It would be available to all news providers, including bloggers, but privileges accorded to media would only be available to those who signed up. It would have a separate legal existence independent of the industry and the commission recommends that it should be an incorporated society. There should not be any government or industry involvement in appointments to the body. The commission, recognising the move from print to digital, states:"Within the next decade it is conceivable that there will be few if any printed daily newspapers. Over the same time period there is likely to be an exponential increase in the amount of audio-visual content accessed on-demand via mobile and other devices. In this converged environment consumers must be confident that consistent standards apply to similar types of content irrespective of the format or platform by which it is accessed."In another key passage, it says:"We conclude that there is a strong public interest in adopting a broad-church definition of 'news media' reflecting the need to nurture a diverse and robust fourth estate during a time of unprecedented commercial and technological disruption."Hammond said: "In our view the current system of format-based complaints bodies adjudicating against different standards is inequitable for news producers, confusing for the public, and inconsistent with the realities of technological and content convergence. A new level playing field is required."Sources: New Zealand Listener/New Zealand Herald Full report: Available here
