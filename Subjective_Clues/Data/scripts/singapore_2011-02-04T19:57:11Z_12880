Black bittern, Ixobrychus flavicollis (formerly; Dupetor flavicollis), photographed in the island nation of Singapore. Image: Marie Louise Ng, 26 January 2011 [velociraptorize].Nikon D3s, 500/4 Question: What does this mystery bird's magnificent feet tell you about its life history? Response: This is a black bittern, Ixobrychus flavicollis. This individual is probably a juvenile because its eyes are not bright red and its plumage is dark brown instead of sooty-black. The black bittern's colouring is distinctive and makes them easily distinguishable from the other three bittern species found in Singapore. The short legs and long, narrow toes are consistent with a bird that does a lot of walking over wet or uneven surfaces in addition to perching. This species wades in shallow water, walks on large lily pads and marshy land, as well as perches on cattails and in trees.
