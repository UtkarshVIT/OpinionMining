Mexico has called on the US Justice Department to monitor investigations into three US police shootings of Mexican nationals within the past month, arguing that the incidents “cannot be seen in an isolated manner”.The call follows the fatal shooting of Ernesto Javier Canepa Díaz in Santa Ana, California, who was killed on Friday by local police during a robbery investigation, according to local news reports. Details of the incident remain sparse but a spokesman for Santa Ana police said three officers were dispatched to the scene after a suspect’s car was identified. The suspect was shot dead during an altercation but it was unclear how many officers had unloaded their firearms. The spokesman said the district attorney was now handling the investigation and that all three officers had initially been placed on administrative leave.“The incident is deeply troubling and causes us great concern as it comes just after the recent deaths of Mexican nationals Antonio Zambrano Montes and Ruben García Villalpando,” the Mexican foreign ministry said in a statement.

Video footage of the incident shows the 35-year-old running from police with his arms raised. He was unarmed.Villalpando, a 31-year-old father of four was shot dead by police in Euless, Texas, on 20 February. The Mexican national was also unarmed and family members claim he had his hands up at the time of the shooting.Mexican consulate officials have condemned all three incidents, but intervention in Díaz’s case marks the first time the foreign ministry has called for the Justice Department to monitor the shootings.The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.“Because these incidents cannot be seen as isolated cases, the government of Mexico has called the Justice Department of the United States to follow the investigations of these cases through its Civil Rights Division and provide assurances that they are conducted with transparency and if necessary, that civil and criminal responsibilities are established,” the foreign ministry said on Monday.“At the same time, Mexico joins several civil society organizations in their urgent call to move forward the review of use of force policies and practices.”The comments stood in stark contrast to the Mexican government’s tendency to play down widespread and well-documented abuses committed by its own security forces.

Last week, a 65-year-old man who walked with a cane died after receiving head injuries during a violent police operation to break up a demonstration of radical teachers in the resort city of Acapulco.A national poll published by the company GEA last November found that only 10% of Mexicans said they trusted the police. Calls for a federal intervention in the Zambrano-Montes case have steadily mounted since the shooting. Small protests in Pasco continued over the weekend as an independent autopsy argued Zambrano-Montes was shot twice from behind, in direct contradiction to police statements.The shooting is being investigated by a group of 15 officers from neighbouring police forces, sparking criticisms of a lack of impartiality. The matter will also be the subject of a coroner’s inquiry, where a jury of six Pasco residents, at least three of whom will be Hispanic, will determine if a case for criminal liability exists. The judgement will be non-binding.On Monday the National Fraternal Order of Police, the country’s largest law enforcement union, issued a statement describing Zambrano-Montes’s death as a “tragedy” but expressing confidence in the police investigation.“All of the officers involved in this incident have served Pasco honorably and effectively. Each of them is entitled to the same presumptions and due process rights which are extended to any citizen in these sad circumstances,” the statement said.
