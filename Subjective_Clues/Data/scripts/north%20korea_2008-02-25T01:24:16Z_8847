North Korea was removing anti-American propaganda before this week's visit by the New York Philharmonic, the ensemble's president said yesterday.Musicians preparing for the orchestra's trip to a country that remains technically at war with the US said they hoped to change North Koreans' views about their longtime foes. Some worried, however, that their performance tomorrow would fail to bring significant change.The Philharmonic's president and executive director, Zarin Mehta, said the North Koreans had met all the group's requests for the trip, agreeing to stage the performance in a larger hall and to broadcast it live by radio and TV. Beyond the concert, the Philharmonic musicians will hold master classes for North Korean students and play chamber music with members of the state symphony orchestra."There's going to be major interaction with their musical community and that's what we wanted to do," Mehta told the Associated Press in Beijing, where the orchestra - America's oldest - was playing before departing today for its 48-hour visit to North Korea.Mehta, who visited North Korea twice last year to organise the event, said some of the anti-American propaganda he had seen earlier on the streets of Pyongyang was being removed.Despite that claim, North Korea's state-controlled media kept up its usual vitriol yesterday, with the main newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, condemning "US warmongers" for staging joint military exercises with South Korea which, it said, brought the peninsula "to the brink of a war."Mehta said one of his first considerations in organising the event was making sure the orchestra's diverse members, which include eight Koreans, would all be allowed to participate.The North Koreans expressed surprise that the group included so many nationalities."Our objective is to prove that we're not fiends and ogres and that we're there to show what American culture and friendship and civility is all about," Mehta said.The orchestra will perform both countries' national anthems at the start of the concert.It was not known whether the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, would attend the concert, and Philharmonic spokesman Eric Latzky said the organisation had not directly extended an invitation to him.The Swedish embassy handles US interests in North Korea as the two countries have no formal diplomatic relations, and is working with its foreign ministry on the guest list for the event, he said.Latzky implied that reporters accompanying the Philharmonic should be ready for the unexpected, saying the orchestra staff would let them know about any "surprise guests" to appear at the concert.Musicians from the orchestra differed on whether their visit would bring about broader changes in the tense relations between the two countries."It's naive to think that playing a single concert for what is bound to be the elite, is really going to result in a substantive opening of North Korea," said violist Dawn Hannay, 52.Jon Deak, associate principal bass, performed with the orchestra when it celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall under the direction of Leonard Bernstein. The late Bernstein "would have wanted us to go", said Deak, 64. "He always wanted the arts to be in the centre of world events."
