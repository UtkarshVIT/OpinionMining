A London-based hedge fund has called on Britain to impose sanctions on Japan after Tokyo rejected its bid to increase its holding in a major Japanese power company.The Children's Investment Fund made the demand in a letter to UK government ministers, after the Japanese government cited national security and blocked its attempt to double its 10% stake in J-Power.It was the first time Japan had invoked a trade law allowing it to block foreign investors from acquiring more than a 10% stake in firms considered vital to national security such as weapons and aircraft manufacturers, and power utilities.A source close to the dispute told Guardian.co.uk that the fund had written to John Hutton, the business secretary, calling on the government to "formally intervene and impose reciprocal trade and investment sanctions" against Japan.The TCI letter, signed by the fund's managing partner Christopher Hohn, was also sent to Digby Jones, the minister of state for trade and investment, and Malcolm Wicks, the minister of state for energy. However, it appeared this morning that neither Hutton nor Jones have actually seen it yet."We have not yet studied this letter, but we think it is in the interests of the both Japan and the UK to encourage the free flow of trade and investment," said a spokesman for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.The $10bn activist fund, which has until tomorrow to formally respond to the decision, has vowed to fight the rejection through the European Union, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Trade Organisation.TCI is the biggest single shareholder in J-Power, which operates power plants across Japan and is building its first nuclear power station.The fund said Japan's explanation lacking transparency. Tokyo had said TCI's plans to boost dividends and shareholder returns could impede investment in power generation and affect electricity supplies.Critics cite the TCI case as proof that Japan lags far behind the rest of the developed world in its commitment to increasing inbound foreign direct investment (FDI).Japan ranked bottom as an FDI destination among the world's major economies between 1997 and 2006, according to the OECD. While Japan has taken advantage of more open economies in recent years, inbound FDI accounts for just 3% of its economy, compared with 20% in the EU.The decision prompted the EU trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, to describe Japan this week as "the most closed investment market in the developed world".Mandelson, who was in Tokyo to attend the EU-Japan summit, said: "For decades Japan has taken advantage of an open global investment climate. Yet at home it remains the most closed investment market in the developed world."Japan is the only country in the developed world with which the EU has a negative balance of investment flows."The TCI letter accuses Japan of failing to honour its international treaty obligations and calls on Britain and the EU to launch an investigation.Today, however, local media reported that Mandelson had assured Japanese officials that he would not turn the TCI case into a bilateral issue.
