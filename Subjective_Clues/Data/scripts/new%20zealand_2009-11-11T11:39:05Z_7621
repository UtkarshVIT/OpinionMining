We like a good cheese story on Word of Mouth – let's face it, who doesn't? So it was with some amusement that we came across a press release from the New Zealand police this morning (via Cold Mud and Stuff.co.nz) with news of a cheese heist that took place yesterday evening (our time, 7.30am 11 November New Zealand time), somewhere in the vicinity of Kakariki (presumably named after the species of native parrot) near Halcombe, Manawatu.A 23-year-old woman and 21-year-old man were charged in the morning "following the recovery of cheese believed stolen from a train en route to Auckland". Straight from the police briefing:Boxes of 20 kilo blocks of cheese were recovered and it was later confirmed that five containers of a train en route to Auckland, that passed through the area in the early hours of the morning, had been broken into.Radio New Zealand have spoken to the police officer involved, who said that, as the car was followed, boxes containing 20 1kg blocks of the cheese were thrown on to the road. A more ambitious attempt, it has to be said, than the Bristol man who attempted to smuggle six blocks of cheese from Aldi a couple of months ago.As the rest of the police report indicates, there is a more serious side to the story which shouldn't be trivialised, involving the possession of drugs, but that aside, a story like this makes it difficult to suppress a smile. You can't help but imagine the car chase along the state highway, past the wool scouring plants, the bemused cows chewing cud in roadside fields, the farmers stopped in their tracks, a clapped out car spluttering along the road intermittently disgorging blocks of cheese from the windows with rail workers and New Zealand's finest in hot pursuit. How quickly would Nick Park and Aardman Animations be able to turn this round for Christmas I wonder?The most crucial piece of information, the one that Word of Mouthers will of course be waiting on, what kind of cheese was it? Well, put it this way, Wallace wouldn't put down his copy of Ay Up! magazine for as much as a sniff - the cheese was a vacuum-packed cheddar, destined for export. Which leaves me with one final thought – if only the good people of Cheddar had thought to protect their cheese with a designation of origin, perhaps this ugly business could have been avoided.
