Israeli naval special forces today seized a civilian cargo ship near Cyprus which they said was carrying weapons, including rockets, destined for the Hezbollah militant group.The ship, flying an Antiguan flag, was boarded and brought to an Israeli port after ammunition and weapons "disguised as civilian cargo" were found on board, the Israeli military said.It was intercepted 100 miles west of the Israeli coastline and brought to Ashdod.Matan Vilnai, the deputy Israeli defence minister, said the weapons included Katyusha rockets.Vilnai claimed they were destined for Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006 and which Israel claims is Iranian-supported.Hezbollah fired thousands of Katyusha rockets into Israel during the conflict."There were Katyusha, whose purpose is to hit civilians," Vilnai told Israeli Army Radio. He said the crew of the container ship had probably been unaware of the cargo they were carrying.Israel's defence minister, Ehud Barak, suggested the weaponry was heading to either Lebanon or Syria, saying it was destined for "the terrorist arena in the north".He described the operation to seize the ship as "another success against the relentless attempts to smuggle weapons to bolster terrorist elements threatening Israel's security".The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, said the weapons could have "hit Israeli cities".Israel offered no evidence about the source or destination of the weapons. A report on the website of the Ha'aretz newspaper said the ship had left Iran, docked in Yemen and then Sudan before sailing through the Suez canal and into the Mediterranean.The report said the vessel's final destination was Syria or Lebanon. Another Israeli report said at least five containers holding weaponry were found on board.The boat was seen by an Israeli naval patrol, the military said, although one Israeli television channel said Israel had had advance warning about the ship.Israel frequently accuses Iran of arming and funding both Hezbollah, in Lebanon, and Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement in Gaza, but ship seizures such as this are rare.In 2002, Israel seized the Karine, a freighter, on the Red Sea, confiscating what it said were 50 tons of missiles, other weapons and ammunition heading for militants in Gaza.
