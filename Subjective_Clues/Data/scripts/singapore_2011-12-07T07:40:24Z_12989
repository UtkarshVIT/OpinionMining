BlackBerry-maker RIM is having no luck of late. After announcing a huge write-off on its PlayBook tablet, seeing an executive in its Indonesia operation charged following a stampede at a new device launch, and firing two executives who caused a plane to be diverted, it has seen the "BBX" name it planned to use for software on phones to be released in 2012 injuncted.Software company Basis International said a US federal court in Albuquerque has granted a temporary restraining order against RIM, barring it from using Basis' BBX trademark.The court decision bars RIM from using the trademark at its Asian DevCon conference on Wednesday and Thursday in Singapore.However, late on Tuesday, RIM appeared to backtrack on using the trademark."RIM doesn't typically comment on pending litigation, however RIM has already unveiled a new brand name for its next generation mobile platform. As announced at DevCon Asia, RIM plans to use the 'BlackBerry 10' brand name for its next generation mobile platform," RIM said.BBX, the operating system that Research in Motion is counting on to revive its BlackBerry franchise, has run into trouble even before the company could install the system in its smartphone line.Albuquerque-based Basis International claims the "BBX" name is protected by trademarks it holds and had earlier threatened to take legal action against RIM unless it stopped using the moniker.Basis said RIM had refused requests to stop using the moniker at the DevCon conference, which resulted in the company filing for the temporary restraining order.BBX had been the planned name for the software that would power the phones, which will mark a transition to a form of the QNX operating system presently used on the PlayBook.
