A tiny British airline that boasts a fleet of one plane - a 34-year-old Boeing 737 - was yesterday named one of the four best carriers in the world. Palmair, which flies from Bournemouth airport, was rated ahead of global brands such as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic thanks to its very personal service, which includes a member of staff who greets every passenger to make sure the seating plan she drew up on her kitchen table the night before suits everyone. The airline was shortlisted by the consumer champion Which? with four other much bigger names. Singapore Airlines (1.5 million passengers a month) won top prize but Palmair (70,000 passengers a year) was runner-up along with India's Jet Airways and Air New Zealand. David Skillicorn, managing director of Palmair, said: "We are just little Palmair with a little Boeing 737 yet we beat off the likes of Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. "Singapore Airlines has onboard massages and a choice of DVDs. All we can offer is the choice of tea or coffee."Palmair was founded by businessman Peter Bath in 1957 when the company leased an aircraft to take passengers to Mallorca. It bought its own plane and now flies to 14 European destinations, including Spain, Tenerife, Portugal and Croatia.Bath used to make sure he was in the departure lounge for each flight to greet the passengers. When Bath died longstanding employee Teresia Rossello took over the role. She draws out the seating plan on her kitchen table the night before flights. Stewardesses place fresh flowers on the plane every day.Palmair employs 25 cabin crew and 25 back-office staff. The plane flies twice a day in the summer and once a day in winter. The airline does not operate night flights as Bath believed they were antisocial.Which? asked 30,000 consumers about experiences on airlines. They were asked to rate factors such as the cleanliness of the planes, the amount of legroom, the quality of the in-flight meal and the helpfulness of the cabin staff.
