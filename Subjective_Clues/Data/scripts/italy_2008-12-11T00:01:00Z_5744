Italy will produce more wine this year than rival France for the first time in a decade, making it the world's biggest winemaker after an extremely good summer.The Italian farmers' association Coldiretti said the country was destined to produce 4.7bn litres of wine, up 8% on 2007 and beating France's 4.44bn litres, which is down 5% from last year. "Italy now is the world's biggest exporter by volume, although France remains No 1 in terms of value, thanks to sales of champagne," said Coldiretti official Domenico Bosco. Coldiretti claimed Italy's boom year would not mean a global deluge of cheap reds or vinegary whites, insisting that the rise in output had been matched by leaps in quality. Italy has cut the area of land under cultivation, and raised to 60% the wines given certificates of quality or geographic origin."It is not just production that is booming, but also demand, led by amarone, brunello di montalcino, barolo, chianti and also prosecco, which is priced lower than champagne and gets more attractive in times of crisis," said Bosco. Hailing from northern Italy, production of bubbly prosecco has doubled in the last 15 years. Strong southern reds such as primitivo, which were once used to bulk up weaker reds, are now acquiring a status of their own. Coldiretti said that Italy was now the top exporter of wines to the US in terms of value and volume, with 30% of the market, although sales had taken a dip thanks to the weak dollar and an investigation in Italy into the mixing of unauthorised grapes into bottles of brunello di montalcino.
