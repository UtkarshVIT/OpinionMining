Today, the Guardian is launching an Iran blog to add a new dimension to our coverage of the country.As Iran comes under closer and closer international attention we will combine the global context provided by our network of correspondents with an effort to bring the voices of ordinary Iranians to our audience, providing a platform for subjects less covered in the west than those that have grabbed the headlines in recent years.Subjects will range from how Iranians cope with life amid economic sanctions, the threat of war, journalists and activists behind bars, Persian culture, music, film, literature and underground life.I'll be blogging every week day alongside Guardian colleagues including Julian Borger, Ian Black and Peter Beaumont in London, Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem and Chris McGreal in Washington.Additionally, we're going to invite some contributors to write for our Iran blog, some will be blogging from inside Iran, its capital, Tehran and other cities.If you're inside Iran and you have a story to tell, or if you are a blogger, activist or journalist who wants to contribute, just let us know.If you have an idea, think we should cover an issue or want to pass on criticism, please drop us an email, send us a tweet or post a comment below.Be omide didar,Follow me on Twitter: @SaeedKDsaeed.kamali.dehghan@guardian.co.uk
