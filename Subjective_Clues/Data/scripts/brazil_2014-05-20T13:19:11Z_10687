 Guardian Travel is putting together an insiders’ guide to Brazil’s hidden gems – and we need your help. If you are from Brazil, or know it well, we’d love you to share your tips on where to go and what to see and do in the country – particularly in and around the World Cup cities. We’d like to hear about places and experiences you might not find in the guide books – trips and excursions, little-known cities, towns or villages, natural wonders, great neighbourhood restaurants and bars, and of course amazing beaches. Share your tips and photos – with your full name, where you’re from, and as much detail as possible, including, where relevant, addresses, telephone numbers (though only if these are public) and websites of the places you want us to see – and we will publish the best in our online guide. If you're sharing photos or videos, please make sure they are taken by you or you have permission to use them. You can submit your contributions by clicking on one of the blue 'Contribute' buttons on this article or by downloading the free GuardianWitness app, if you have a smartphone. Obrigado!
