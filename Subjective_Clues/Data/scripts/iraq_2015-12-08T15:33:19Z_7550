Isis fighters are using arms, mainly looted from Iraqi military stocks, which were manufactured, designed, and supplied, by more than two dozen countries, including the UK, Russia, China, the USA, Germany, and France, a report published on Tuesday by Amnesty International reveals.The weapons range from man-portable air defence surface-to air missile systems, guided anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicles, and modern assault rifles to Soviet Union-era Kalashnikovs.Decades of arms flows, largely unregulated and uncontrolled, into Iraq have provided Isis with a huge arsenal it uses to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria, Amnesty points out. It’s 44-page report, Taking Stock: The arming of Islamic State, is based on an analysis of thousands of videos and images.Oliver Sprague, Amnesty UK’s arms programme director, said:“Decades of free-flowing arms into Iraq meant that when [Isis] took control of these areas, they were like children in a sweetshop”He added: “The fact that countries including the UK have ended up inadvertently arming [Isis] , should give us pause over current weapons deals”. The extent of the armoury available to Isis reflects decades of irresponsible arms transfers to Iraq, a danger compounded by lax controls over military stockpiles and endemic corruption by successive Iraqi governments, says Amnesty.It says that between 2011 and 2013, the US signed billions of dollars’ worth of contracts for 140 M1A1 Abrams tanks, F16 fighter aircraft, 681 Stinger shoulder held units, Hawk anti-aircraft batteries, and other equipment.By 2014, the US had delivered more than US$500m worth of small arms and ammunition to the Iraqi government.It has been reported that Iraqi security forces lost 2,300 Humvee armoured vehicles when Isis overran the northern city of Mosul. Arms supplied by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey to rebel groups in Syria also end up in the hands of extremist Islamist elements.Research by anti arms trade campaigners shows that Britain over the last five years has approved sales of £5bn to a Middle East already awash with arms. Birtish weapos sales were sold to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Iraq, Egypt, Kuwait, and Lebanon.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: “For years now the UK government has been happy to flood the Middle East with arms. There is so such thing as arms control in a war zone and very little oversight. The lifespan of weapons is often longer than those of governments, so there is no way of knowing where they will end up or what they will be used for.”The Guardian on Tuesday reported from Isis documents how the violent extremist group funds its operations and has set up training camps to instruct fighters in the “latest arts of using wepons, military planning and military technologies”.Other recent reports describe how Isis runs a complex arms procurement system, benefitting from a black market with the enemies of Isis its best sources of ammunition.
