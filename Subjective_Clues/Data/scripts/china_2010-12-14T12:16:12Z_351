Dirty tricks by multinationals, political corruption and the erosion of an African success story have been among the stories that have emerged from the leaked US embassy cables over the past fortnight.The leaked cables, published by WikiLeaks, say that drug company Pfizer hired investigators to find evidence of corruption on the Nigerian attorney general to persuade him to drop legal action over a controversial meningitis drug trial.The cables also highlight rampant corruption in Kenya that threatens to push the country towards violence on a scale worse than that seen after the 2008 presidential election, and uncovers the scale of influence the oil giant Shell wields in Nigeria.Meanwhile, the Ugandan president's "autocratic tendencies" come under scrutiny, which, along with corruption, a population explosion and "sharpening ethnic divisions" is ruining Uganda's image as an African success story.Coinciding with the publication of his book Beyond the Crash, Madeleine Bunting examines Gordon Brown's passion for development, which seems at odds with his enthusiasm for globalisation, and asks if Britain's former prime minister is vying for a top job at the IMF.Jonathan Glennie argues that while African leaders may prefer to deal with China, rather than the US and Europe, any money from Beijing will still come with strings attached.And Kelly Nicholls writes about the publication of a report that reveals the hidden human tragedy of the 30,000 "disappeared" in Colombia.Later this week, we'll launch this month's Global development Focus podcast, which will explore the involvement of celebrities in aid and development. Visit our Talk point section and tell us which celebrities you think do the most good, or the most harm, and nominate those you think we should discuss in the podcast, which will be recorded on Thursday.To mark the Global development website's first Christmas, we'll be publishing a quiz over the festive period to test your knowledge of our coverage of the issues over the past four months.And with 2011 just around the corner, we'll look back at what 2010 did for global development, and look ahead to what the new year could bring.Gallery: South Sudan: the challenge ahead.
