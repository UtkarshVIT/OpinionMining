Scotland is to ban smoking in cars with children, bringing it into line with England and Wales, where legislation has been introduced to protect young people from secondhand smoke.The Scottish government announced it would back the smoking prohibition (children in motor vehicles) (Scotland) bill, which has been put forward by the Liberal Democrat MSP Jim Hume.The bill, which it is hoped will receive royal assent before the next Holyrood elections in May 2016, covers all cars, although Hume acknowledged that discussions may take place about exempting convertibles when they have the roof fully down, to bring it into line with English laws.“This legislation will ensure that we can put a stop to the 60,000 journeys being made in Scotland each week where children are being exposed to dangerous secondhand smoke,” he said. The bans in England and Wales come into effect in October.Secondhand smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, and exposure to it has been linked to chest infections, asthma and cot death in children.Welcoming the announcement, the chief executive of ASH Scotland, Sheila Duffy, said: “We are delighted that ministers have decided to support this important member’s bill, which has the potential to protect thousands of our children from the dangers of breathing secondhand tobacco smoke.”Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places in 2005, and Scottish NHS boards will be required to ensure that their grounds are smoke-free by April. The SNP government pledged in 2013 to achieve a tobacco-free generation within 20 years, with less than 5% of the population choosing to smoke by the target date of 2034.
