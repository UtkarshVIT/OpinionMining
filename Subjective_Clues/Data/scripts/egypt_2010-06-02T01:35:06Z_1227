Egypt bowed to international pressure over Gaza today and said it was opening its border into the territory for the delivery of humanitarian aid supplies.President Hosni Mubarak issued the order in response to Arab anger over Israel's interception of the Gaza peace flotilla and sudden intense focus on the situation in the strip.News of the opening brought Gaza residents rushing to the Rafah border post, their only route to the outside world other than crossings controlled by Israel. Egyptian security officials said it would be open from tomorrow until further notice.Egypt, which became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, annexed Gaza in 1948 and ruled it until the 1967 Middle East war. Mubarak, a close ally of the US and the recipient of $2bn (£1.3bn) annual aid – which is second only to Israel – is regularly attacked in the Arab world for effectively colluding with the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Critics openly accuse him of "collaboration" with the enemy.Normally, the Rafah crossing is open for a few days a month, though analysts suggested it was unlikely to remain open permanently because that would constitute a victory for Hamas that Egypt, like Israel and the US, wishes to avoid.Egyptian sources told Reuters only food and medical supplies would be allowed in. Construction materials including concrete and steel, urgently needed to repair the damage of last year's war, would still be banned.Khaled Meshal, the Damascus-based Hamas leader, had said earlier: "We call on our brothers in Egypt to use this historic moment to open the Rafah crossing."Hani Aziz, adviser to the Egyptian foreign relations committee, said Mubarak's decision "underlined the fact that Egypt always stands on the side of the Palestinians". Palestinians and many Egyptians may not agree.Mubarak's move seemed to have been promoted by pressure from domestic opposition groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood, which is close to Hamas, and criticism abroad. He is often attacked at demonstrations against Israel. The Cairo-based Arab League, meeting in emergency session, was expected to issue a strong response to the Israeli action.
