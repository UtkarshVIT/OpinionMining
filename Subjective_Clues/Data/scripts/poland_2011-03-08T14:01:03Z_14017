The UK's Higher Education Policy Institute, an independent thinktank, has joined a chorus of protest at government proposals to tackle illegal immigration by restricting student visas.Last month Hepi said plans to limit student visas and raise the English language skills requirements of applicants would have "dire consequences" for universities.The report's author, Professor Edward Acton, vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia, told the BBC that government proposals to reduce the number of students studying below degree level would not only cut fee income by about $1.6bn, but would also reduce subsequent undergraduate numbers.He said more than 40% of international students at UK universities arrive via a pre-university pathway course, and he warned that 70% of recruits to these courses would be barred by the language requirement change.The report says: "For recruitment from countries where English is not one of the official languages, combining academic preparation with intensive English language tuition from native speakers is essential."Sever the link and the damage inflicted on our universities will be severe."Children in rural Poland falling behind in EnglishSchool-age students in rural areas of Poland are falling behind their urban counterparts in English language skills, a study comparing education outcomes across populations has revealed.The survey, entitled English – Whose Opportunity?, was carried out by the Polish Forum for Development Initiatives and the European Fund for Rural Development.It found that the English language exam scores of junior secondary school students in rural areas were 6.5 points lower than similar cohorts in larger towns and cities.There was no significant difference in the performance of both groups in humanities and science tests. The report linked the poor performance to a lack of co-ordinated support for English language teaching in rural areas. It recommended introducing new teaching methods and for additional time to be allocated to English lessons.Japan opens up to Indian teachersA major trade agreement signed between Japan and India last month is likely to make it easier for English language teachers from India to work in Japan.The pact covers trade in goods, services and investment and is expected to reduce tariffs in about 90% of trade between the two countries over the next 10 years.In return for easing export of goods and services to India, Japan has agreed to liberalise the temporary movement of English language teachers, yoga practitioners, classical music performers and chefs.Innovators take a bow at ELTons awards in LondonExcellence in English language teaching was celebrated at the annual British Council awards for innovation, better known as the ELTons, held in London in February.London-based language school United International College (UIC) was one of three recipients of the UK Award for Innovation, for its Communication Station resource incorporating radio and broadcast skills into lessons. The BBC picked up the other UK awards for two web-based learning resources, BBCe!, a bilingual radio show broadcast in Egypt, and Rinku's World, a multi-platform teaching resource for Bangladesh.Abax ELT, based in Japan, won the Cambridge ESOL International Award for Innovation for its Fiction in Action: Whodunit. The Macmillan Education Award for Innovative Writing went to Simona Petrescu, from Romania, for her proposal for a course based on human resources.Brian Abbs and Ingrid Freebairn were awarded the council's Lifetime Achievement award for their ground-breaking textbook series.Glaswegian tops 'most attractive' English pollGlaswegians have the most attractive accent for Japanese speakers of English, a study has revealed.The Glasgow accent came out on top for social attractiveness to Japanese people learning to speak English, found a survey by Northumbria University, England.Robert McKenzie, senior lecturer in sociolinguistics at the university, questioned more than 500 people to study how worldwide perceptions of the English language are changing.The six accents used were from Alabama and Ohio in America, the Glasgow dialect, Scottish standard English, moderately accented Japanese English and heavily accented Japanese English.Dr McKenzie said: "It seems to be that globalisation, and especially the resultant worldwide spread of English-language media, are influencing non-native perceptions of the qualities associated with various forms of spoken English."Max de Lotbinieremax.delotbiniere@theguardian.com
