This blog has been second to none in its tireless cheerleading for Spain for McCain, the support group whose energies have not been dimmed by their candidate apparently not knowing where Spain is, nor by only having a cardboard cutout of the man to haul from event to event, but guys, you have to meet us half way. Now it turns out that an artist is planning to create a 2.5-acre image of Barack Obama's face out of sand and gravel right in your own backyard -- Barcelona beach! My friends, if you cannot stop at least this one single example of Obama worship, right there on the Iberian peninsula, we will begin to harbour suspicions that the groundswell of McCainiac support you purport to represent isn't all it's cracked up to be. So get to it. Remember: Si se puede! Si se puede! [CNN]
