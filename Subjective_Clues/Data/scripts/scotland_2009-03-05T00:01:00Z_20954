Scotland's plans to place a minimum price on a unit of alcohol should be welcomed (Report, 2 March). While some may complain about the "nanny state", alcohol misuse costs the NHS Â£2.7bn a year, not to mention social disorder, crime and policing costs, and where the market fails to self-regulate there is a strong ethical justification for the state to intervene. Research commissioned by the World Health Organisation shows that increasing the price of alcohol is one of the most effective ways to cut consumption. The rest of the UK should follow Scotland's lead. Even a small reduction in our drinking, at the cost of an extra few pence for a beer or a whisky, will pay dividends in welfare and economic terms.Hugh WhittallDirector, Nuffield Council on Bioethics
