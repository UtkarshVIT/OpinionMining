After 12 years of leftist government, Argentina moved towards the centre-right on Sunday, as Buenos Aires mayor Mauricio Macri of the Cambiemos (Let’s Change) party sealed victory in the country’s presidential election. He will replace Christina Fernández de Kirchner in the Casa Rosada presidential palace, with the outgoing president stepping down from office on 10 December. Factors behind Macri’s surprise victory include rising concerns among voters about increasing inflation, slowing growth and current crime rates. But opponents fear a return to the neoliberal policies of the 1990s that ended with the country’s economic collapse in 2002, and also worry a vote for Macri could mark a weaker stance on human rights. The election result confirms a sharp change of direction for South America’s second biggest economy, following 12 years of leftwing “Kirchnerism,” and we’d like to hear your reaction to the election result. What is the current mood like in Argentina? Are you happy with the result? In the wake of the result what are your hopes or concerns for the future of the country?
