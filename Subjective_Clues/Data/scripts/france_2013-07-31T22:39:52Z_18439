A fugitive Kazakh oligarch and dissident who was granted political asylum in the UK before fleeing to avoid a prison sentence has been arrested in southern France, according to his family.Mukhtar Ablyazov, who is also being pursued by his former bank in London's high court over allegations that he embezzled $5bn (£3.3bn), was detained near Cannes by French special forces on Wednesday as Russia requested the oligarch's extradition, his son Madiyar told the Guardian.Ablyazov, who is a political opponent of Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, and is wanted in Kazakhstan on charges relating to the collapse of his former bank BTA, was granted asylum in the UK in 2011 as he fought one of the largest and most complex fraud cases ever heard in London.The proceedings took an unusual turn in February 2012 when the billionaire fled Britain on a coach departing from London's Victoria station for France, after being sentenced to 22 months in prison for contempt of court for lying about his assets. A judge in the case had also previously told Ablyazov that he could not be trusted not to dissipate his assets, which the court had frozen.BTA bank was declared insolvent in 2009 and was nationalised after defaulting on $12bn of debt owed to creditors including Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays. In May, receivers in London began the process of selling two of Ablyazov's luxury properties, a £17m mansion in Hampstead, north London and a 100-acre, £18m estate near Windsor called Oakland Park.Before fleeing, Ablyazov had lived in Britain since BTA's nationalisation – a move which he insisted was forced upon him because he was a leading figure in the Kazakhstan opposition. He also said he was previously imprisoned for political reasons and claims the embezzlement charges are politically motivated.Ablyazov's arrest comes after the former banker's wife Alma and daughter Alua were detained by Italian authorities last month and then deported back to Kazakhstan, where they are now thought to be staying with relatives.The Russian Embassy did not immediately return the Guardian's phone calls.
