Our dream for New Zealand's South Island was very simple: one campervan, two friends, three weeks, four feet on the dashboard and a cold beer when we pulled up at night.We set off with a monumental greed to experience New Zealand's wild places, to spend as much time as possible in the non-human world, swimming in freezing rivers, getting lost in the acoustics of the rainforest, drinking from streams and camping out under stars. We wanted to swim with dolphins and fur seals, wake to the piping of bellbirds, hear trees sigh and flightless birds shuffle.In elemental form, the route was dolphins – backcountry – mountains – stars – rainforest. In map terms, the route was Christchurch, Kaikoura and Picton marine reserves, Marlborough Sounds and Abel Tasman, then back down the wild wet west coast to Mount Cook. Ending at Queenstown with a luxury trip walking the Routeburn, and swimming every part of the way.Setting out before Christmas, we stopped first at the dusty seaside town of Kaikoura, a low series of faded pastel buildings, assaulted by a fierce combination of hot sun and icy southerlies.A deep offshore trench there brings whales, seals and birds from the Antarctic, and the town offers truly wild, wild swimming with seals and dolphins – craft are tightly restricted, and the animals are not fed or induced towards boats. An offshore storm meant boats couldn't take swimmers out during our stay so we watched waves breaking over a hulking grey sperm whale from a plane instead, then took a screaming dip in the sea, the temperature proving that we were not far from the south pole, that we were in the albatross latitudes.Higher up on the southern tip of South Island, locals pointed us to swimming holes whenever asked. Between Marlborough Sounds and Abel Tasman we pulled in at the Trout Hotel before Canvastown, and bumped our way down the Wakamarina track to the Butchers Flat car park, past a sign saying: "Keep going, it's worth it", to a series of emerald pools.We spent an afternoon swimming in the deserted gorge, clambering over grey river stones in the cold trout stream, before returning to Pelorus Bridge. Here children hurled themselves into the swimming hole repeatedly, but if you're feeling adventurous you can float down beyond the bridge into the gorge, and around to Totara Flat – a good 20-minute swim but a five-minute walk back due to the loop in the river.At Abel Tasman we parked at the Old Macdonald Farm holiday park (oldmacs.co.nz) in Marahau, where roses trailed around the van and the day's hikes could be topped and tailed in the on-site swimming holes.After the heat of Abel Tasman, the glory of the west coast was not the glaciers but the weather, and the area was best experienced through fast-moving wipers. We pulled up for the night at Cape Foulwind, which is not whimsically named, and spent a sleepless night in the dark drum of a storm, rain thrumming the roof and the van rocking and swaying. The next morning tidelines were littered with huge, waterlogged trees, washed up by the stormy seas.Then we were in another, golden world – blinding sun reflected off the Franz Josef glacier, rivers the colour of opals in Haast, the Mackenzie basin, with its scorched cornfields.At Mount John Observatory near Mount Cook, protected from light pollution, we spent an evening gazing through telescopes at belts around Jupiter, the craters of the moon, the galaxy within the Southern Cross (newzealandsky.com/earthandsky).The final stop was the Routeburn (doc.govt.nz), a three-day trek through the soak of a rainforest, and a swim in snowmelt. At night thunder trembled the window of our shelter, with spear grass lit up intermittently by sheet lightning.By now we were drunk on landscapes. River, rock and sky, never wanting to return to the world of the humans.• For more information on New Zealand and to see more of Kate Rew's videos of her journey, visit the Tourism New Zealand website, newzealand.com/katerewExpedia (0330 123 1235, expedia.co.uk) offers a wide choice of flights and hotels for visitors to New Zealand, including return flights from Gatwick to Auckland from £924 with Emirates.
