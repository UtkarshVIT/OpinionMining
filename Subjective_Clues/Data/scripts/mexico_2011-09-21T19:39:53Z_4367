When two trucks full of bodies were dumped during rush hour on a main road on the edge of the port city of Veracruz it underlined the way Mexico's drug wars are both qualitatively escalating and expanding to parts of the country that were previously peaceful.Gunmen left the 23 men and 12 women piled up in the vehicles and strewn across the tarmac at around 5.30pm on Tuesday while commuters watched. Some tweeted warnings to stay away from the area.State officials said many of the people whose semi-naked bodies were left lying face down with their hands tied behind their backs had been tortured and that most died from suffocation.The incident is one of the most shocking single events in the drug wars that have claimed the lives of 40,000 people since President Felipe Calderón launched a military-led offensive against the country's drug cartels in December 2006 triggering an intensification of already rumbling violence.The violence was initially concentrated along the border region with the US as well in a couple of other more central hotspots, but it has spread to much of country as the number of massacres has increased."What we are seeing in Mexico is typical of a process of paramilitarisation in which different groups seek to wipe territories clean of their rivals," Edgardo Buscaglia, an expert in organised crime, told MVS Radio. "The groups are fighting over 22 different illegal markets, not just drugs, and that produces … an orgy of violence."Until a few months ago the state and city of Veracruz, on the Gulf coast, were considered an unassailable stronghold of the Zetas cartel. A sharp rise in the number of killings, gun battles and disappearances has coincided with a change of state governor as well as an intensification of federal operations against the Zetas. This may have disrupted its operational capacity, making Veracruz more vulnerable to incursions by rivals.A message left beside the bodies found on Tuesday threatened to kill all Zetas and announced: "There is a new owner of the turf." The message was signed GN, initially assumed to refer to Gente Nueva (New People), a name used elsewhere in Mexico by gunmen associated with the Sinaloa cartel.Some media reported that the massacre was ordered by the Sinaloa cartel, which has been fighting the Zetas since early 2010 in neighbouring states.Veracruz's attorney general, Reynaldo Escobar, insisted the message did not necessarily explain the massacre and might be "a distraction"." He discounted the additional claim within it that the victims included some of the 32 prisoners who escaped from three jails in the state on Monday.Escobar said that all the victims identified so far had criminal records suggesting links to organised crime. "There is nothing in this event that affects the civilian population."The Veracruz authorities are developing a reputation for clumsy efforts to minimise the impact of the violence. Earlier this month local prosecutors charged a male teacher and a grandmother with terrorism after they allegedly caused panic across the city by spreading unfounded rumours of attacks on schools through social media.Following an international outcry, and hours before the horrifically real discovery of the 35 bodies, local legislators changed the law so the two twitterros, as Twitter users in Mexico are called, could be charged with disrupting public order instead.
