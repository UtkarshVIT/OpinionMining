I was deeply disappointed by your article (Greece puts its islands up for sale to save economy, 25 June). First and foremost, the assertion that the Greek government is involved in the sale of any islands is wholly inaccurate. The sale of privately owned islands is neither new nor newsworthy, in Greece or elsewhere. Indeed, the Ionian island of Nafsika has been on the market for a long time.It is doubly misleading to imply that the Greek government is also in negotiations with Russian and Chinese investors to sell off land in Rhodes, when this refers to commercial real estate transactions unrelated to the Greek state and is based on unsubstantiated hearsay.The far-fetched suggestion that Greece would consider selling off islands "driven by the inability of the state to develop basic infrastructure, or police most of its islands" is both incorrect and offensive. Last but not least, Greece did not receive a "bailout" from the EU and IMF, but a loan, which will be repaid in full.George PetalotisGreek government spokesman, Athens
