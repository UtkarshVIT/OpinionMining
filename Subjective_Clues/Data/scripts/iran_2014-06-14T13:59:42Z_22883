Iran is seeking a deal with major world powers within weeks that would end years of dispute over the country's nuclear programme and economic sanctions imposed on it by western powers, President Hassan Rouhani has said.He said he wanted to reach an agreement by 20 July, adding that the the international sanctions regime had crumbled and would not be rebuilt – even if no final nuclear deal could be reached.Rouhani also said he would be willing to work with the White House to meet the danger posed by Islamist extremists who have taken towns in northern Iraq, in a sign of shifting attitudes towards the US in Tehran."The disputes can be resolved with goodwill and flexibility … I believe that the 20 July deadline can be met despite remaining disputes. If not, we can continue the talks for a month or more," he said, addressing the nation in a live broadcast on state television."During the nuclear negotiations we have displayed our strong commitment to diplomacy (but even) if a deal can't be reached by July 20, conditions will never be like the past. The sanctions regime has been broken."We believe the issue can be settled by 20 July. We are very serious at the talks."Iran and the five permanent members of the UN security council – the US, Britain, France, Russia and China – and Germany will hold another four days of talks in mid-June in a bid to break a deadlock, which has raised the threat of the deadline pasisng without a deal.An outright failure of the talks would strengthen the position of conservative hardliners in Iran's clerical establishment against Rouhani, who has tried to improve relations with the country once termed the "great Satan". The countries severed ties during a hostage crisis after the 1979 Islamic Revolution."The west should use this opportunity to reach a final deal in the remaining weeks. American hawks and Israel will be blamed for (any) failure of the talks," Rouhani said, according to Reuters.Iran insists it needs to maintain a domestic uranium enrichment capability to produce fuel for a planned network of nuclear power plants without having to rely on foreign suppliers.But some western officials believe it will need many years to build any nuclear power station and that its underlying goal in enriching uranium is to be able to yield material for nuclear bombs at short notice, an allegation the Islamic state denies.The latest round of negotiations in Vienna last month ran into difficulties when it became clear that the number of centrifuge enrichment machines that Iran wanted to maintain was well beyond what would be acceptable to the west.
