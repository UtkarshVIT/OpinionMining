I can understand that Wajid Shamsul Hasan has concerns about the forthcoming elections in Pakistan (Letters, February 5). But I am not sure it is wise for him to make sweeping generalisations such as "the elections are already stolen" and "rigging and malpractice are everywhere" without providing substantial evidence.Even before Benazir Bhutto's assassination, these elections were always going to be a serious challenge. For this reason, the EU's election observation team has had over 50 long-term observers in place for many weeks, watching the whole process, including electoral registration and media monitoring. Short-term observers will join them to oversee voting at thousands of polling stations as well as the counts and results announcements.Only then will we be able to state whether the elections have fulfilled President Musharraf's hopes that they will be "free, fair, transparent and safe".Robert Evans MEPChair, European parliament election observation mission to Pakistan
