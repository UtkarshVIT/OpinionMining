Nine people, including a British man, have died in a aircraft crash in New Zealand.The aircraft, carrying a party of skydivers and tourists, crashed and burst into flames shortly after takeoff from Fox Glacier airport on the west coast of the South Island, police said today.A police spokesman said five New Zealanders were killed, including the pilot, and individuals from Australia, Ireland, Germany and the UK."The embassies of each overseas victim have been informed and relatives are in the process of being advised," he said.The Foreign Office said: "We can confirm that one British national has died. He has been identified and next of kin have been informed."New Zealand police said the bodies would remain at the crash site until tomorrow.The dead Irishman was later named locally as Patrick Byrne, 26, from Gorey, County Wexford. He had been in New Zealand on a working visa.Witnesses said the plane was almost totally destroyed in the accident, which happened at 1.15pm local time.A man told the New Zealand Herald: "It was like a fireball and then there were big puffs of smoke going up. [The plane] was engulfed in flames immediately."Fox Glacier is a popular tourist spot in New Zealand's Southern Alps, about 90 miles from Christchurch, which was yesterday hit by an earthquake that damaged buildings and injured at least two people.
