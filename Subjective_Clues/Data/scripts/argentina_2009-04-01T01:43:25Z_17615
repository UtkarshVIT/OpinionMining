Raúl Alfonsín, whose presidency has come to symbolise the return of democracy across Latin America from an era of military dictatorships, has died.Alfonsín's personal doctor, Alberto Sadler, said the former president died of lung cancer yesterday. He was 82.The presidential inauguration of the leader on 10 December 1983, ended more than seven years of a repressive military regime that left at least 12,000 disappeared.He won an open election that the military was forced to call, in disgrace after the country's defeat in the 1982 war with Britain over the Falkland Islands.His presidency was marked by two milestones: his daring decision to bring to try the leaders of the dictatorship for the human rights violations, and an economic collapse that made him hand power to his successor six month before his term was to end. Inflation had jumped to over 3,000% annually.Few discussed his crucial role in the restoration of democracy at a time military regimen ruled most of South America.In Argentina, he was instrumental in getting several political groups to set aside differences and unite in a loose coalition that paved the way for the 1983 election. He garnered 51.7% of the vote, handing the powerful Peronist party its first election defeat ever.Shortly after entering the Pink House presidential palace, he stunned many by ordering the trial of nine members of the former ruling military junta, on charges ranging from kidnap to torture and disappearance of thousands of people.It was a bold step in a country where the military had dominated for decades, having taken power in six coups in the 20th century."I think that some times I take too many risks, because what we did no one had done before," he said later of his decision.But he said the trials were needed to restore a strong judicial system and break the destructive cycle of political chaos and military coups that wracked Argentina for a half-century.The trials, unprecedented in Latin America, were conducted by a civilian court and ended in December 1985 with the conviction and imprisonment of five former military rulers, including two ex-presidents. Four others were acquitted.
