Name: Russia Local LtdCity: LondonWebsite: http://www.russialocal.co.uk/en/Russia Local Ltd helps British businesses expand into Russia. However, we have recently exported our services to Russia itself - attracting clients who wish to export back here in the UK. I increased my business' exposure in Russia by writing blog posts for the company website of a leading Russian logistics firm. I made this contact completely by chance: my mother met the company's vice-director on a trip to Finland! Within the course of a week, the blog brought me several enquiries from potential customers. They are all Russian businesses looking into going global, and London might well be their gateway to the world. After writing these blog posts, I was approached to write another article for a business magazine in Moscow which generated further publicity for Russia Local Ltd. I am always happy to write and talk about my business experience to encourage more people to become entrepreneurs and try new markets. Since gaining new clients in Russia, I will be able to grow my business in two directions rather than just one - and double in size. So what would be my main tip for fellow entrepreneurs? Well, always tell your mum what you're doing. And on a serious note, be open to everything.Ignaty Dyakov is the director of Russia Local LtdFind out how you can enter our Best Practice Exchange here.
