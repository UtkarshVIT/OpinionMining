One of the world's most wanted drug lords has been arrested in a five-star Madrid hotel, Spanish police said yesterday. Edgar Vallejo-Guarín, 47, also known as Jairo Gómez and Beto Gitano, has 'an extensive history of violence, money laundering, and the corruption of high-level government officials,' said a US state department spokesman. Vallejo-Guarín, from Colombia, was indicted in 2001 by a federal court in Florida for heading and operating a criminal enterprise. The indictment said that he was a major source of Colombian cocaine in America between 1990 and 1999, and was responsible for numerous multi-ton shipments of cocaine to the US and Europe. The US government, which had offered $5m reward for information leading to his arrest, said that it would request his extradition.
