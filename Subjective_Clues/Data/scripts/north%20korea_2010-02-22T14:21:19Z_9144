Life expectancy in North Korea has fallen, with increases in infant and maternal mortality, according to a census offering a rare glimpse into conditions in the country.The survey, which is the first in 15 years, also suggests that the country's military has far fewer than its reputed 1  million-plus soldiers.While it is impossible to know how reliable the data is, it is unusual for North Korea to issue official statistics. The ­figures have been published by the United Nations' statistical division, but were compiled by the North Korean government, said the UN's PopulationFund, which helped with the survey and sent five teams to monitor the work.In the 15 years since the previous census, life expectancy dropped by 3.4 years, with men living to only 65.6 and women to only 72.7 years on average.Infant mortality rose, from 14 deaths in 1,000 live births to 19, while maternal mortality rose by about 30%, to 77 maternal deaths in 100,000 live births.The period between the two studies included the devastating mid-90s famine estimated to have killed at least 600,000 North Koreans. Some believe the death toll was more than 1 million, and even now the country remains heavily dependent on food aid.The North Korean media reported that the census showed a population increase of almost 3 million over 15 years, taking the total to just over 24 million.According to the US state department, the country's army has been estimated to comprise 1.2 million. But the study puts the number of people working for the government or military at about 700,000.Agriculture, forestry and fishing employ 36% of the workforce – with slightly more than half of those in the sector being women – while manufacturing employs another 24% despite struggles to maintain the country's once-thriving industrial base.One in every seven men over 16 had finished a university education, according to the census, while only one in 12 women enjoyed the same advantage.The document was first highlighted in the North Korean Economy Watch blog.
