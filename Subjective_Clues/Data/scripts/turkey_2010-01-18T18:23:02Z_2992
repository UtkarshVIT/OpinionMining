A couple in the remote north-west coast of Scotland who were separated for nearly a month over Christmas by heavy snow have finally been reunited.Kay Ure, who left the former lighthouse keeper's cottage at Cape Wrath on 19 December to buy the couple's Christmas turkey, some coffee and some presents, was cut off by deep snow, gale-force winds and sheets of ice until today.Her husband, John, who has been on his own since then, made the 11-mile journey by 4x4 car and boat from Cape Wrath, to find his wife waiting with the turkey, cranberry sauce, fresh coal and dog food for their six springer spaniels.A neighbour in the nearby village of Durness, where Kay Ure has lived during their months' separation in a small caravan, said: "They've gotten together again and Kay and John are on their way back to the lighthouse. I know they've got copious amounts of dog food and coal, but I dare say the turkey is with them too."The month of isolation left John Ure with rapidly dwindling supplies of food and fuel, after his diesel generator broke down and his coal ran out, forcing him to use a supply of timber stored for a building project for heat and cooking.Their dogs – his only companions apart from two walkers who arrived unexpectedly at their small café on Christmas Day – were left eating army rations left behind from an earlier military training exercise.
