Switzerland may offer to negotiate a "model" tax treaty with the US that could be a template for its dealings with other countries and end a row over its tax-haven status, the Swiss government's closest financial advisers have said.Berne is also being advised to warn the country's banks and citizens that its financial sector, which generates around 13% of GDP, will have to shrink substantially and many of its private banks will go out of business or be forced to merge.The Swiss government has followed the advice of a taskforce of independent experts and senior officials, agreeing this month to comply with Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development standards on banking secrecy to avoid being placed on the body's blacklist and avert pariah status at next week's G20 summit in London.Specialists helping to draw up Swiss defences are discussing a revised model treaty with the US authorities on exchanges of tax information.This could then serve as the basis for bilateral treaties with around 70 other fiscal jurisdictions around the globe.It is likely that the federal government, which appointed the taskforce of specialists and senior officials only two weeks ago, will heed their advice. The Swiss would then be asked to swallow their pride and approve it in a national vote.The alternative would be to conclude separate treaties with each country and put each to a national referendum in a process that could last 150 years, Swiss sources say.Alfred Mettler, an associate professor of finance at Georgia state university in the US, and one of five independent experts, told the Guardian: "The key thing for Berne is to secure a level playing field with other jurisdictions – Austria, Luxembourg, Singapore, Hong Kong, Andorra and the rest."If Switzerland really sticks to the OECD rules and the others don't, it will be shooting itself in the foot. The playing field must be as level as possible and you don't reach that goal alone. This has got to be a concerted effort through legal and diplomatic channels, winning allies among the key countries that want to change the secrecy rules: the US, UK, France and Germany."Switzerland is estimated to be home to a third of the $11tn (£7.5tn) of wealth and assets hidden from global tax authorities. Its biggest bank, UBS, was fined a record $780m by the US authorities for abetting offshore tax evasion. It is under new legal pressure to disclose the names of 52,000 US citizens with Swiss accounts as its wealthy clients continue to pull out billions of assets previously protected by the country's 75-year-old secrecy laws.Berne is being advised that it is in the country's interest to settle the case, even though the price could be a significant contraction of the wealth-generating financial sector. "It is very clear you have to prepare for times when you won't have the flows of untaxed monies coming in any more," said one specialist, who did not want to be named.Pointing out Switzerland had already stopped inflows of criminal or terrorist money and assets from, among others, dictators, sources say the government should negotiate a timeframe to handle all untaxed income, say within a couple of years. There are no definitive estimates of the amount of untaxed wealth secreted in Swiss accounts. A senior private banker has suggested as much as 50% of assets under management in Geneva is untaxed, but others have suggested 10%."To lose 10 or 20% in the short run does not make you obsolete as a banking centre," Mettler said. "It's very different from writing off 20% of a bank's assets on its balance sheet: that kills you."The outcome is likely to be that "universal" banks such as UBS and Credit Suisse will survive in shrunken form. Hans-Rudolf Merz, the Swiss finance minister, and regulators have made plain they will not allow a merger of the two banks. But many of the smaller private banks dedicated solely to wealth and asset management could be forced to consolidate.
