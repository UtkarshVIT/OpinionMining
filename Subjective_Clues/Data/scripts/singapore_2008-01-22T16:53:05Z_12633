Smart and cosmopolitan Singapore has been marching into non-conformity with a new batch of boutique hotels, transforming old Chinatown shophouses into 21st-century modernism, and hip hostels wired for the digital generation. · 10a Upper Wilkie Road; + 65 6438 5588; dorm room £12.50, double £35.70· Block 166, Woodlands Street 13 #01-545; + 65 97516451; dorm room £1.15An eclectic abode fashioned out of an old red-light district shophouse punctuated by shuttered windows and come-hither balconies. The interiors are furnished with the owner's excess pieces of mid-century design: an Eames chair here, a Hoffman sofa there. Peek-a-boo showers and bold geometric or floral print bedspreads complete the mod costume. Although the location puts you in the heart of the action, the small rooms might encourage you to stay out for the night. · 50 Keong Saik Road; + 65 6347 1929; double £57.12Design becomes performance art at this newly minted boutique hotel. Only the exterior of the converted shophouse retains an antiquated appearance, while the lobby is an atmospheric white-on-black space channelling the angular shapes of a Miro painting. The 30 rooms were decorated by emerging and established Singaporean artists and each features a unique theme, a few design gimmicks and lots of urban chic. But the exhibitionism is best captured at the hotel pool, which has portholes in the bottom allowing restaurant diners to peek at the fishy movements of the swimmers above. · 31-37 Bukit Pasoh Road; + 65 6511 4700; doubles £107· 33 Erskine Road; + 65 6511 3333; double £82· 12 Perak Road; + 65 6299 7733; www.peraklodge.net; double £53One might expect that this heritage building, an old-fashioned survivor amid the makeover mania of Orchard Road, would have been converted into a plantation-era boutique hotel replete with limousine airport transfer and complimentary cocktails. But alas, the facelift fanatics will be disappointed: Sha Villa shows its age with decrepit air-conditioners and other undeniably run-down characteristics. On the other hand, the rooms have gleaming hardwood floors and hints of bygone grandeur. The hotel is the training centre for students of Singapore's hospitality college, meaning that service can be inept but enthusiastic. For those who prefer less than perfect, Sha Villa is lovable because of its wrinkles and foibles. · 64 Lloyd Road; + 65 6734 7117; double £64· 1 Nanson Road at Robertson Quay; + 65 6849 8686; double £89Nearly as famous as the city itself, Raffles Hotel started out as a riverside boarding house that receded from the water as the city reclaimed land. It later hosted exclusive balls for the waltzing colonialists and invented a cocktail (Singapore Sling). Today it has colonial ambiance, historic status and luxurious accommodation, plus a guest list of notables. · 1 Beach Road; + 65 6337 1886; double £340· 22 Scotts Road; + 65 6737 7411; double £137
