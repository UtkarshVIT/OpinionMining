Two British tourists were killed and several more injured when a train derailed in the north of India on Saturday.A group of 37 British tourists – mainly in their 60s – were travelling on a narrow gauge “toy train” that runs 60 miles through more than 100 tunnels and over dozens of viaducts to the historic hill resort of Shimla, in the foothills of the Himalayas.Anil Saxena, spokesman for Indian Railways, said the accident took place at 12.55pm, about two miles beyond the station of Kalka and 15 minutes into the journey.“Two coaches were derailed resulting in the deaths of two female passengers,” said Saxena. Three others suffered serious injuries, while five more were discharged after treatment for cuts, bruises or simple fractures.A second official said the cause of the accident was still unclear.“It might have been a technical problem. There is a possibility that a stone or a rock suddenly fell on the track, or animals came, leading to the derailment. There is an inquiry,” said Neeraj Sharma, a spokesman for the northern zone of India’s sprawling railway network.Images broadcast on Indian TV networks showed carriages on a bend among thick vegetation on apparently flat land about 150 miles north of Delhi.The injured, who included three Indian nationals, were taken to hospital near the city of Chandigarh.Accidents occur frequently on Indian railways, which suffer from decades of under-investment and a shortage of trained staff.Earlier on Saturday, nine coaches of a train derailed in southern India, killing at least two people and leaving several injured.Despite ageing rolling stock, buckling tracks, wandering elephants and Maoist guerillas, Indian Railway’s 1.25 million employees still run 17,000 trains carrying up to 25 million people every day.Raaja Bhasin, a Shimla-based historian who was guiding the tourists and travelling in the train, told the local Indian Express newspaper that the tragedy had taken “just a fraction of a second”.“Two lost their lives and others narrowly survived. I had just taken a seat minutes before the accident. It was God’s grace I was seated at that moment otherwise I wouldn’t have been alive and talking to you,” he said.The train, which had been chartered by a UK-based travel company, was composed of four luxury coaches and a single locomotive.Suresh Prabhu, India’s railway minister, has ordered an investigation into the accident.The Foreign Office said it was urgently looking into the reports of the accident.A spokesman said: “Following a train crash in [the northern Indian state of] Haryana, we are urgently looking into reports of British nationals affected and stand ready to provide consular support.”Shimla was the summer capital of the British Raj administrators in India, and remains a popular destination for tourists, both foreign and local.The Kalka to Shimla line is more than 100 years old.
