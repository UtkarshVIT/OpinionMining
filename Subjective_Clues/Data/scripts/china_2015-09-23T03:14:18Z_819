China has ticked off Malcolm Turnbull over his comments on the South China Sea, saying Australia should maintain a neutral position over the contested area.“We hope that Australia will stay committed to not taking sides on issues concerning disputes over sovereignty,” foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters in Beijing.On Monday the new prime minister said island-building in the disputed area was “pushing the envelope” of acceptable behaviour.
