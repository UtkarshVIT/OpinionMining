Prince Albert of Monaco and his two sisters have labelled a new biopic starring Nicole Kidman as their mother Grace Kelly "pure fiction".Albert, the current ruling monarch of the Mediterranean principality, issued a joint statement with Princess Caroline and Princess Stephanie denouncing the project, which is titled Grace of Monaco."We have had absolutely no association with this project, which claims to be about the lives of our parents," the royal trio said in a statement. "For us, this film does not constitute a biographical work but portrays only a part of her life and has been pointlessly glamorised and contains important historical inaccuracies as well as scenes of pure fiction."Kelly became known as Princess Grace after she departed Hollywood, where she was one of the most famous actors in the world and a favourite of Alfred Hitchcock in classic movies such as Dial M for Murder and Rear Window, for a new life as the wife of Monaco's Prince Rainier III in 1956.Due for release in 2014, Grace of Monaco examines Kelly's first few years in Monaco, and has drawn attention due to the fact that 45-year-old Kidman is set to play 32-year-old Kelly. The film reportedly centres on the period in 1962 when Monaco and France were in dispute, with Grace playing a vital role in helping to avoid a coup. The film is currently in production, with La Vie en Rose director Olivier Dahan on board, and Tim Roth in the role of Prince Rainier.Kidman has said the film interested her for the way it covers the young actor's transition from film star to princess in 1962. "It reveals her great humanity but also her fears and frailties as she leaves her career behind," she said.Kelly, who was born in Philadelphia, died in 1982 when she suffered a stroke at the wheel of her car. Rainier ruled until 2005, when he died at the age of 81 as a result of multiple conditions.
