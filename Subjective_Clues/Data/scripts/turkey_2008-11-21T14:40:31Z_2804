Turkey could be off the Christmas dinner menu for many people across the UK after meat hygiene inspectors voted to go on strike, Unison said today.The union said members had backed industrial action by two to one, demonstrating the scale of opposition to planned cuts to overtime payments and the introduction of new work patterns.Unison warned a strike would "seriously disrupt" supplies of meat to supermarkets in the crucial pre-Christmas period."This is a decisive vote for strike action and shows the strength of feeling of meat inspectors," said the national officer Simon Watson."Unless the employers abandon their plans and get back around the table to negotiate a settlement, the industry could lose millions of pounds in lost meat production in the run-up to Christmas."A union spokeswoman told theguardian.com the three-day strike would take place in the first couple of weeks of December. She said inspectors were not targeting Christmas deliberately, but had reached a point where there "was no alternative" to full industrial action. She claimed the inspectors' employer, the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS), was attempting to impose changes in terms and conditions on workers in contravention of previous agreements.Bird flu and rising feed costs have posed a threat to turkey supplies in recent years. In November last year a planned strike by production giant Bernard Matthews, which union leaders claimed could threatened Christmas turkey supplies, was called off after the company threatened to obtain an injunction preventing industrial actions.The MHS chief executive, Steve McGrath, said he was still hoping for a negotiated settlement. The service said it had plans in place to ensure that meat production would not be seriously disrupted in the event of industrial action.There are around 1,000 meat hygiene inspectors in the UK, responsible for making sure that meat is produced following strict health and safety standards. The MHS, an agency of the Food Standards Agency, checks up on approved slaughterhouses, cutting plants, farmed and wild game facilities and other meat products premises.Salaries for inspectors are typically between £15,000 and £22,000.
