The Japanese government is heading for a messy confrontation in parliament next week after naming Toshiro Muto as its choice to replace Toshihiko Fukui as the Bank of Japan governor.The Democrats, the biggest opposition party, have threatened to oppose Muto's appointment, citing concerns over his close ties to the finance ministry. Muto, a former high-ranking ministry official, is currently Fukui's deputy at the central bank.Government officials warned that further delays to the selection process could damage international confidence in Japan's economy, and urged MPs to ensure a new governor is in place by the time Fukui steps down on March 19."Having the governor's seat go vacant simply won't be allowed," Fukushiro Nukaga, the finance minister, said.But opposition MPs hinted that they would oppose Muto's appointment because he risked compromising the bank's independence."We have been saying at informal meetings that it would be hard to accept Muto if he is nominated," Kenji Yamaoka, the Democrats' parliamentary affairs chief, told reporters.Speculation is mounting that the party may instead propose Yutaka Yamaguchi, a former BoJ deputy governor, before the candidates are questioned in parliament early next week.The appointment requires the approval of both houses of the Japanese parliament; Democrat and other opposition MPs will be able to block Muto's selection because they won control of the upper house in elections last August.Whatever his identity, the new governor is not expected to take monetary policy in a new direction, however."No matter who takes over the head position at the Bank of Japan, the bank's stance on rates will probably remain unchanged," Tohru Sasaki of JP Morgan Chase Bank told the Associated Press.The Nikkei business newspaper urged MPs to reach agreement quickly. "This abnormal situation will undoubtedly erode Japan's credibility on the international stage," it said. "As the end of the governor's term approaches, we are being forced to confront a nightmare."Today the bank's board kept rates on hold at 0.5% at Fukui's final meeting as governor.
