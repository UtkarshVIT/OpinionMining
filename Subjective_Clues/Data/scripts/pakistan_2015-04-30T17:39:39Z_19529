Ten men involved in the attempt to kill Malala Yousafzai have been sentenced to life in prison by a Pakistani court, lawyers involved in the case have said.None of the men was in the team who shot the education activist in the head as she sat in a school minivan in 2012, but a security official said they had been part of a wider group of plotters involved in the planning and execution of the attack.The point-blank shooting of the then 15-year-old at the behest of the Pakistani Taliban caused global outrage and Malala later became the youngest ever winner of the Nobel prize.

She has lived in the UK since being taken there for life-saving treatment at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham.
