Another day, another opportunity to whack the bonds of the weaklings of the eurozone. Even the Dutch finance minister concedes that it "could take months" before stability returns to the eurozone. Behind the broad sweep of pessimism, it is worth thinking about how the "eurozone in crisis" story could eventually improve. Spain is the key. If that domino does not fall, the picture could look different in the new year.According to the optimists, Spain should not have to take a trip to the emergency ward. Yes, everybody knows about the recession, the 40% fall in property prices and the 20% rate of unemployment. But, as one old market hand puts it, 20% unemployment in Spain used to be regarded as a normal – the "unofficial" economy makes the true number better. As for the property slump, it is severe, but loan-to-value ratios are not off the scale – Spanish regulators retained some sense of credit control. Moreover, government debt, at 60% of GDP, is at the lower end. That's the cheery view.The pessimists counter that too much of that debt has to be rolled over in a hurry next year. Further, the bottom end of the banking system is rotten and the true scale of property-related losses has yet to be revealed since the pan-European stress tests are discredited.The point is that there is a genuine debate about the state of Spain. Hints from Jean-Claude Trichet suggested the European Central Bank may make a stand against markets by buying up more sovereign debt. There is no guarantee of success, but Spain would be the place to concentrate the firepower.
