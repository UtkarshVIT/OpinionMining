Australian special forces members are finally moving into Iraq, Tony Abbott has said, as the US presses its friends and allies to make a greater contribution to the military training effort.The prime minister indicated in Beijing on Monday that the 200 special forces members were on their way from a defence base in the United Arab Emirates to Iraq, where they would advise and assist local security forces in the fight against Islamic State (Isis).The special forces were sent to the region in September, but their movement into Iraq was delayed by negotiations over the legal arrangements. The 400-strong Royal Australian Air Force group began participating in US-led air strikes in early October.“Our priority at the moment is getting our special forces into Baghdad and then into the field on the advise and assist mission that we have set them,” Abbott said.“That is happening, and I am confident that our people will do good work.”Abbott revealed the progress after a meeting with Barack Obama on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit on Monday.At the same media conference, the US president signalled international coalition partners might be asked to do more in Iraq. “I am having conversations with Australia and other coalition partners that are already committed to putting trainers in, to see how they can supplement and work with us in this overall effort,” Obama said.Sydney’s Daily Telegraph reported the US had discussed the possibility of Australia providing up to 200 more training troops.A spokesman for Abbott said the government had yet to receive a specific request from the US.Obama said the coalition mission was initially focused on stopping the momentum of Isis, but was moving to a new phase of training and assisting Iraqi security forces “so they can begin to build up and form an offence”.“We can provide close air support, we can provide logistics and intelligence, but ultimately they are the ones who are going to have to fight to push [Isis] out of some of these areas that have been taken over,” Obama said.“In order for us to be able to do that, we are going to have to have more trainers on the ground and that is the reason why I authorised this additional number of US troops.”Abbott said Australia’s efforts were focused on helping the Iraqis “to reclaim their country from something which is evil, from something which is a menace to them, and if it is allowed to remain, will be a menace to all of us”.The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said Labor had supported “the efforts to fight terror in northern Iraq” but was yet to receive any formal briefings about increasing Australia’s contribution.“The government has been very good at keeping Labor informed about what is going on and consulting Labor about its decisions for further engagement,” he said on Tuesday.“We await briefings from the government in the spirt to which they have been providing them so far in this most difficult issue.”
