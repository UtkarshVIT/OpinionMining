An attempt to launch the memoir of the Pakistani schoolgirl who became a global icon after being shot in the head by the Taliban in her home province has been scuppered by opposition from local politicians.Malala Yousafzai's book was due to be launched at an event on Monday at Peshawar University but organisers were forced to scrap it after the intervention of two senior members of the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (KP).The episode underlines the antipathy among many Pakistanis towards the 16-year-old who campaigned for education in the face of Taliban opposition.While she has been hailed in the west for her campaign against extremism, in Pakistan she is widely regarded with suspicion, with many people believing conspiracy theories that the story of the Taliban attempt to assassinate her as she travelled to school in October 2012 was untrue or exaggerated.The event that was to have been held at the university's Central Asia Area Study Centre had been intended to raise awareness of a book which is not widely available in Pakistan.Few booksellers dare stock it after the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which is particularly strong in KP, threatened to attack shops selling copies of I Am Malala.Organisers said they came under enormous pressure to abandon the event, with ministers, the police and university officials all intervening."They all made so many excuses," said Khadim Hussain, director of the Baacha Khan Education Foundation and one of the organisers. "First they said it was a security risk, then they said the book was not relevant to the study centre."He said opponents of the book launch simply wanted to please the Taliban.The provincial government is controlled by a coalition comprising a hardline Islamist party called Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led by Imran Khan, a former cricket player whom critics often accuse of pandering to the country's religious right.Provincial ministers from both parties approached the Area Study Centre to demand the event be cancelled.They later said they viewed the event as party political because of the Baacha Khan Education Foundation's affiliation with the Awami National party, a left-leaning secular party that competes with the PTI and JI in the province.Writing on Twitter, Imran Khan said he was taken aback by the decision to stop the book launch. "I am at a complete loss to understand why Malala's book launch in Peshawar was stopped. PTI stands 4 freedom of expression & debate," he tweeted.The party's spokesperson later said there had been "no ban or stoppage of launch" of the book, but there was "an issue of venue".Yousafzai was shot in October 2012 but survived long enough to be moved to the UK for further surgery and to continue her education. She later became the youngest ever nominee for the Nobel peace prize.
