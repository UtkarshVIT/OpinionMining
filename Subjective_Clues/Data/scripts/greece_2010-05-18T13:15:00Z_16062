Greece will receive the first slice of its €110bn (£94bn) rescue package later today, just in time to prevent the eurozone's weakest member defaulting on its debts.The EU will formally lend Greece €14.5bn, with the International Monetary Fund contributing €5.5bn. The €20bn loan will allow Greece to repay €8.5bn of government bonds which mature on Wednesday."The first tranche of financial assistance for Greece is being transferred … and the IMF will do its part in parallel," EU economy commissioner Olli Rehn announced last night following a meeting of European finance ministers in Brussels.The €110bn loan was agreed last month, and is meant to give Greece protection while it brings in unpopular austerity measures in an attempt to cut its deficit. Ten-year Greek government debt is currently trading at a yield, or interest rate, of 8.4% – making it prohibitively expensive for Greece to borrow from the financial markets. The country has a total national debt of around €300bn, and its deficit in the last year is estimated at 13.6% of GDP.The arrival of the aid was overshadowed by the embarrassing resignation of a government minister after it emerged that her husband, a popular singer in Greece, owed more than €5m in unpaid taxes and fines.Angela Gerekou, deputy minister of culture and tourism, stepped down after a national newspaper broke the news. Gerekou had filed joint tax returns with Tolis Voskopoulos for many years. Voskopoulos had a string of hits in the 1960s and 1970s, but his real estate assets have now been frozen and he faces criminal prosecution.Although one of Greece's greatest old-timers, and most frequent performers, the star had claimed earnings of only €3,000 a month, the pro-government Ta Nea proclaimed on its front page.Other newspapers reported that with around €5.5m owed to the Greek state in outstanding taxes, the singer's file had been "well known to economy ministry officials" for months.The Greek government said in a statement: "Angela Gerekou has submitted her resignation for reasons of sensitivity and sensibility, so that there cannot be the slightest pretext to hurt the government."Gerekou was seen as a protege of prime minister George Papandreou, who has pledged to overhaul Greece's tax system to prevent richer citizens hiding their income or assets. Her resignation came just days after the Greek government launched a high-profile campaign to name-and-shame tax evaders. In the first step, the finance ministry named 60 doctors and dentists facing legal action for under-reporting their incomes."This idea that you're a successful tough guy if you evade taxes and deceive the state has got to change," Papandreou declared last week.Three former government ministers are reportedly being investigated for misuse of government funds and within hours of Gerekou's resignation being accepted the justice minister tabled draft legislation in parliament that that will lift the immunity of politicians suspected of wrongdoing. Dimitris Droutsas, the deputy foreign minister, said: "[Gerekou's resignation] is a message from the government and especially the prime minister that there is equal justice for all."The extent of the tax avoidance by the richest in Greek society has fuelled the anger among ordinary citizens against the tax rises and salary cuts being implemented by Papandreou in return for the €110bn aid package.
