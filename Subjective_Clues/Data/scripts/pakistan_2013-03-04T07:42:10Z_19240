Senior reporter Malik Mumtaz was shot to death while driving home in the city of Miranshah, capital of the tribal region of north Waziristan, last Wednesday (27 February).The journalist reported for Geo TV, as well as other Urdu and English speaking newspapers. His murder prompted a widespread outcry and a protest rally by groups of journalists.Both the Pakistan army and the outlawed group Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan condemned the killing. The Vienna-based International Press Institute (IPI) urged a swift and comprehensive investigation"The continued, pervasive impunity in all cases of violence against journalists is the single greatest reason for the numerous targeted killings against journalists in Pakistan that we have been reporting about in recent years," said IPI's press freedom manager Barbara Trionfi.Source: IPI
