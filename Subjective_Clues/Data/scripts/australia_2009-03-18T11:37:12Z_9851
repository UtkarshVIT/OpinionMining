The Australian government is to outlaw excessive "golden handshake" payments amid outrage over huge bonuses collected by company executives.Under new legislation, termination payouts will require shareholders' approval, and curbs on severance pay could be linked to job losses, Australia's treasurer, Wayne Swan, saidtoday."Golden handshakes, particularly when companies have not performed or where workers are being retrenched, are simply a means of rewarding failure and are absolutely unacceptable," Swan told the Australian parliament. "So we are sending a very clear message to corporate Australia – your actions are under scrutiny."Current laws allow company directors to receive termination payments of up to seven times their total annual remuneration, which is often much more than base pay, before shareholder approval is required. In some recent cases, executives have received A$15m (£7.1m) despite company losses, falling share prices and staff cuts.The government's crackdown comes amid outrage in the United States after insurer AIG granted huge bonuses to employees who brought the giant firm to the brink of collapse.There have been similar protests in Australia following revelations that underwear maker Pacific Brands, which last month cut 1,850 jobs, paid its former chief executive Paul Moore A$5.8m when he stood down in 2008.Swan called the payouts "frankly sickening"."What we have seen for the past decade, under laws we have inherited from the former government, is the retirement gold watch replaced by a truckload of gold bullion," said Nick Sherry, Australia's corporate governance minister."That's why we have decided to take some strong and decisive action and carry out major reform in this area of golden handshakes," he told reporters at a press conference in Canberra.The Sydney Morning Herald reported in February that Sol Trujillo, chief executive of telecommunications firm Telstra, would receive a A$40m payout in cash and shares when he left the post on 30 June. But Telstra said todayhe would only receive a one-off payout of A$3m upon departure.The Australian Shareholders' Association (ASA) predicted that "before the ink is dry on the legislation, there will be an army of lawyers and remuneration consultants looking for ways to avoid it"."Shareholders are being given the final say on golden handshakes because of boards' chronic failure to act," said Stuart Wilson, ASA chief executive.The move will extend the rules to cover a wider range of executives and will place criminal penalties on those who flout the law. The government's productivity commission will also hold a nine-month inquiry into executive remuneration and bonuses.
