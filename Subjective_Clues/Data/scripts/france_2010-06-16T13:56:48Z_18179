The French government today sparked anger from unions and the Socialist opposition when it announced its intention to raise the legal age of retirement.The move comes as part of sweeping reforms to a pensions system deemed inadequate for the modern age.In a blow to a much-cherished exception française of the social landscape, the French will no longer be able to retire from the age of 60. They will instead be expected to work until they are 62 by 2018, the employment minister, Eric Woerth, said.Defending the move as an "inevitable" consequence of demographic changes, Woerth cited a list of other countries, including Britain, whose governments were faced with a similar dilemma."The ageing of the French population cannot be got round. We have to face up to it," he said. "All our partners in Europe have done this by working for longer. It is not possible for us to not join this movement."As well as a progressive raising of the retirement age, beginning next July, the reform also envisages increasing the number of work years needed in order to claim a full pension, from 40.5 years now to at least 41.5 in 2020.An array of tax hikes, including a 1% surcharge on the top income tax bracket, also aims to raise revenue for a pensions system forecast to register a €32bn (£26.6bn) deficit this year."It is fair to believe that those with more resources than others should contribute more than others to the financing of our pensions," Woerth said.The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who has singled out pensions as the most important area of reform required before his term in office ends in 2012, insisted the changes responded to the needs of "justice and equality".The rightwing president needs to show Brussels he is serious about taking steps to cut France's oversized budget deficit, which currently stands at 7.5% of GDP.Hoewever, his reforms have been denounced as anything but fair by the leftwing opposition, which has vowed to fight tooth and nail to maintain 60 as the legal age of retirement.Brought in by François Mitterrand in the 1980s, the age is viewed by Socialist party stalwarts as a symbol of left-led social progress."I am very angry and very sad because the end of retirement at 60 ... is the end of an era," Jean-Luc Mélenchon , the head of the Parti de Gauche, told French radio. "It's the end of a way of living, and it's the end of happy days."François Hollande, the former leader of the Socialist party, said the reform was "the most unfair" of any to have been pushed through by Sarkozy."[He] wanted, above all, to send a sign to the markets and to our European partners and he chose to make the poor and those who started work early pay," he said.
