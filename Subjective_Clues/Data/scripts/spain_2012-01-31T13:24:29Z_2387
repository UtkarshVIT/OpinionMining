Crusading Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón has told a court trying him for abuse of his powers that an investigation he opened into the deaths of 114,000 opponents of the Franco regime was based on the same principles used to order the arrest of Chile's Augusto Pinochet.The judge was giving evidence as he faced charges of deliberately abusing his powers in order to open a formal court investigation into human rights crimes committed by dictator General Francisco Franco's regime between 1936 and 1975.Garzón, who had a brief and controversial parliamentary career as a Socialist MP, denied he was motivated by political ideology.He told a panel of supreme court judges he had simply been seeking the truth and looking after the rights of the victims and their families."There was no ideology in this, but there were thousands and thousands of victims whose rights had not been dealt with," he said.Garzón faces being fined and struck off as an investigating magistrate for 20 years if he is found guilty in this trial, which is just one of three different cases against him going through the supreme court. He said his investigation into Francoist crimes was similar to those he carried out - backed by the Spanish courts - into human rights offences committed by Pinochet's dictatorship and Argentina's military juntas.Garzón had Pinochet arrested in London in 1998 and the British courts accepted he could be extradited to Spain to face trial.Among other arguments used by Garzón in the Pinochet case was that the crime of "disappearance" — when someone is taken away and never seen again — cannot be covered by amnesty laws as it is an ongoing crime of kidnapping that is still being committed today.He used this principle in the Franco case as the bodies of many of the victims, which are believed to lie in secret mass graves, have never been found.Garzón also brought a successful prosecution against an Argentinian navy captain, Adolfo Scilingo, who was jailed by a Madrid court for throwing drugged prisoners out of aircraft into the sea."I based myself on the Scilingo case from Argentina when accepting this investigation [into Francoist crimes]," he said on Tuesday.Garzón said he had declined to open a separate investigation in the mass killing of thousands of prisoners of the leftwing republican government during the Spanish civil war because he did not think it was a matter for the national court to deal with."Garzón showed today that his decision to take up the investigation of the crimes of the Franco era was fully supported by international law," said Reed Brody, an observer from Human Rights Watch. " But the spectacle of a judge as a criminal defendant, having to justify his investigation into torture, killings and disappearances was itself an affront to principles of human rights and judicial independence."A dozen relatives of Franco's victims are to give evidence during the trial, which is expected to last for weeks and has drawn observers from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.Protests continued outside the courthouse on Tuesday, as victims, relatives and pro-Garzón campaigners complained he had become the victim of a concerted campaign of persecution.
