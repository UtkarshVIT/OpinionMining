The Russian government blocked access last week to a blog-hosting site that publishes the work of two prominent independent journalists who are often critical of the Kremlin, reports Mike Rispoli.The site, LJRossia.org (LJR), was added to the country's official "internet blacklist."It is described as "a non-profit project created to support freedom of speech, civil society and encourage the free exchange of ideas." Two journalists who run blogs on LJR are Andrei Malgin, who has been very critical of the government, and Vladimir Pribylovsky, who has been targeted for publishing a database of government misdeeds and for disclosing official documents that expose corruption.Source: Mike Rispoli/Access
