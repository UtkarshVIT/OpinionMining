Jenson Button has won the Monaco grand prix for his fifth race victory of the season, putting him 16 points clear of Brawn team-mate Rubens Barrichello in the world championship standings. Barrichello finished seconds in Monte Carlo with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen in third.Button, who won from pole after leading throughout, said: "This victory is massive for us. I got off the line clean, and it was all good from there other than the usual Monaco things such as traffic and the barriers getting nearer and nearer as the race dragged on."It's a strange feeling because you start backing off a little bit, and it started going through my mind that if I kept it together I'd win at Monaco. But that's dangerous, so I had to concentrate, keep a steady pace and end up enjoying a great day at Monaco."It's been an outstanding weekend. The team have been fabulous, and we're looking very strong over the next few races. Before the weekend I said winning here would not mean as much, but that was just to take the pressure off my shoulders. In fact, to win here is fantastic. It does mean so much."Button's only mistake of the day came after his victory when he parked his car back in the pits rather than in the top three parc ferme. That forced him into a run out of the pits, around La Rascasse and up the start/finish straight – around 600 metres in total – to take his place on the podium.Lewis Hamilton could only finish in 12th place after starting from the back of the grid.1 Jenson Button (Gbr) Brawn GP 1hr 40mins 44.282secs2 Rubens Barrichello (Bra) Brawn GP 1:40:51.9483 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 1:40:57.7244 Felipe Massa (Bra) Ferrari 1:40:59.3925 Mark Webber (Aus) Red Bull 1:41:00.0126 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Williams 1:41:17.8687 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Renault 1:41:22.1218 Sebastien Bourdais (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:41:47.4249 Giancarlo Fisichella (Ita) Force India 1:41:49.32210 Timo Glock (Ger) Toyota at 1 Lap11 Nick Heidfeld (Ger) BMW Sauber at 1 Lap12 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) McLaren at 1 Lap13 Jarno Trulli (Ita) Toyota at 1 La14 Adrian Sutil (Ger) Force India at 1 Lap15 Kazuki Nakajima (Jpn) Williams at 2 LapsNot Classified: 16 Heikki Kovalainen (Fin) McLaren 51 Laps completed, 17 Robert Kubica (Pol) BMW Sauber 28 Laps completed, 18 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 15 Laps completed, 19 Nelson Piquet Jr (Bra) Renault 10 Laps completed, 20 Sebastien Buemi (Swi) Scuderia Toro Rosso 10 Laps completed1 Jenson Button (Gbr) Brawn GP 51pts,2 Rubens Barrichello (Bra) Brawn GP 353 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 23,4 Mark Webber (Aus) Red Bull 19.55 Jarno Trulli (Ita) Toyota 14.56 Timo Glock (Ger) Toyota 127 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Renault 118 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 99 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) McLaren 910 Felipe Massa (Bra) Ferrari 811 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Williams 7.512 Nick Heidfeld (Ger) BMW Sauber 613 Heikki Kovalainen (Fin) McLaren 414 Sebastien Buemi (Swi) Scuderia Toro Rosso 315 Sebastien Bourdais (Fra) Scuderia Toro Rosso 216 Giancarlo Fisichella (Ita) Force India 017 Adrian Sutil (Ger) Force India 018 Nelson Piquet Jr (Bra) Renault 019 Robert Kubica (Pol) BMW Sauber 020 Kazuki Nakajima (Jpn) Williams 0Manufacturers: 1 Brawn GP 86pts, 2 Red Bull 42.5, 3 Toyota 26.5, 4 Ferrari 17, 5 McLaren 13, 6 Renault 11, 7 Williams 7.5, 8 BMW Sauber 6, 9 Scuderia Toro Rosso 5, 10 Force India 0
