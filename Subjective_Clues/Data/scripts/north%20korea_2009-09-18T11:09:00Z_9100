North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has said he is willing to engage in multilateral talks, Chinese state media reported today, in what appeared to be a conciliatory shift that could pave the way for the reopening of disarmament negotiations.But sceptics have warned that the North may be seeking the relaxation of UN sanctions – which were toughened after its nuclear and missile tests earlier this year – without being willing to make significant concessions."North Korea would like to solve relevant issues through bilateral and multilateral talks," Kim told Chinese president Hu Jintao's special envoy, according to China's official Xinhua news agency. It added that Dai Bingguo handed the leader a letter from Hu.Pyongyang had previously demanded a one-on-one discussion with Washington. It pulled out of the six-nation denuclearisation talks following the tightening of sanctions, saying that the process infringed its sovereignty.The North's official Korean Central News Agency reported an "amicable" meeting to discuss the countries' relations and issues of mutual concern. Chinese premier Wen Jiabao is expected to visit the North in October to mark the anniversary of the two countries' alliance.Pyongyang is heavily dependent on Beijing's support but the two have an uneasy relationship – one reason the North is so keen to hold direct talks with Washington.The US has said that bilateral discussions with the North could be worthwhile to bring the state back into the six-party negotiations, which also involve China, Russia, South Korea and Japan.The South's president, Lee Myung-bak, said earlier this week that the North showed no signs of giving up nuclear weapons and was adopting a "conciliatory strategy" because it was feeling the pain of sanctions.Despite proffering olive branches to Washington and Seoul recently – via the release of two imprisoned US journalists and the lifting of border restrictions with the South – Pyongyang has continued to develop its nuclear programme. Earlier this month it claimed to be in the final stages of enriching uranium, which would give it a second way to make nuclear devices."North Korea will be keeping up the pressure on its part in order to raise the stakes," Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korea Studies told Reuters. "But, especially now that Kim Jong-il has pledged to talk, the prospects are not too bad."However, Kenneth Boutin of Deakin University in Australia said: "There is a growing body of thought that the North Korean leadership has no intention of abandoning its nuclear weapons programme, and it may well turn out to be the case that their understanding of 'denuclearisation' is far different from ours."
