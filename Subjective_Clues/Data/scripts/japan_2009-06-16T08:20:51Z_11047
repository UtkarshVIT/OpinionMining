Japan may be over the worst of the recession, the country's central bank said today, after rising exports and production fuelled optimism that the world's second biggest economy could return to growth during the current quarter.The Bank of Japan raised its assessment of the economy for the second month in a row, but warned that it was too early to wind down extraordinary measures to support lenders and ease corporate debt.The BoJ, which kept interest rates at just 0.1% after a two-day meeting, said the economy had "begun to stop worsening" and expected to see more signs that it is levelling out in the coming months."Japan's economic conditions, after deteriorating significantly, have begun to stop worsening," the bank said. "Domestic private demand has continued to weaken against the background of declining corporate profits and the worsening employment and income situation. On the other hand, exports and production have begun to turn upward and public investment has also increased."The bank added that the economy was "likely to show clearer evidence of levelling out over time," but said financial conditions "remained tight".Despite the encouraging news out of Tokyo, markets across Asia fell after poor manufacturing figures from the US dented hopes of a quick exit from the global recession. Investor confidence was also shaken by an IMF report warning that the worst of the US economic crisis may still lie ahead.The Nikkei benchmark index fell 286.79, or 2.9%, to close at 9752.88 in Tokyo - its biggest fall in almost three months - while indices in Hong Kong and South Korea were down 3% and 0.9%.The BoJ's guarded optimism was echoed by the finance minister, Kaoru Yosano, at a meeting of G8 finance ministers at the weekend. "The economy is in recession but the pace of decline is slowing," he said. "That's a very cautious statement. Signs of stabilisation, that's also an expression with a question mark."The central bank's report comes amid a mixed picture for Japan's export-dependent economy. Last week the government said the economy had shrunk less than initially thought during the first quarter of this year, but the contraction was still the biggest on record, at an annualised 14.2%.Factory output, on the other hand, rose 5.9% in April, the biggest gain since 1953, signalling a modest rise in demand for exports.The bank said it remained wary of poor demand and other downside risks. Wholesale prices fell 5.4% in May from a year earlier, fuelling fears of a return to deflation, while households continue to bear the brunt of job cuts, which took unemployment to a seven-year high of 5% in April.Analysts warned against making too much of the BoJ's slightly upbeat assessment."Although there has been some optimism on the economy after strong industrial output data, the BoJ is maintaining a very pessimistic view on the economy," Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities in Tokyo, told Reuters."It said the economy has begun to stop worsening, but it didn't say it has stopped worsening."
