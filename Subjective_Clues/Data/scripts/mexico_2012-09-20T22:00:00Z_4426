New Mexico governor Susana Martinez has asked her administration to remove a reference to "forcible rape" from a new state policy, after its use was criticised by women's groups.The outdated and inaccurate language, which effectively narrows the definition of rape, became the subject of heated debate in August after Republican Missouri senate nominee Todd Akin used the term "legitimate rape" in describing his anti-abortion views.The Huffington Post reported on Wednesday that the term appeared in the New Mexico's proposed changes to its official applications to childcare assistance. The state's children, youth and families department was proposing changes to its means-testing policy for childcare assistance that would exempt only victims of "forcible rape" and incest from having to file child support claims against the father.Women's and family groups reacted angrily, saying that using such language made a distinction between "forcible" and other rapes, even though all rapes involve force. It would also, critics said, push victims of rapes not considered "forcible" – such as statutory rape of a minor – to contact their rapists to pursue them for child support before being eligible for childcare assistance.No-one at the state's CYFD was available for comment.Enrique Knell, a spokesperson for the CYFD, told the Huffington Post that Martinez, a Republican, asked the department to remove the word "forcible" from the language on Wednesday night."It's redundant, unnecessary, and she [Martinez] doesn't support its usage," Knell said.He said the CYFD had used such language because the FBI still uses the definition, as do some federal regulations relating to paternity disputes.Martinez, a former district attorney, also used the words "forcible rape" in a proclamation about New Mexico's Sexual awareness month in April.Carol Tracy, the executive director of Woman's Law Project, which has long campaigned for the definition of "forcible rape" to be changed, welcomed Martinez's removal of the term.She said: "It is a good move, a progressive move. Because rape is force enough."The definition of rape used by the FBI in its Uniform Crime Report was revised from "forcible rape" to rape in January this year. Rape is now defined federally as: "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim."However, states vary in their definition of rape.Attorney general Eric Holder, announcing the changes earlier this year, said: "The longstanding, narrow definition of forcible rape, first established in 1927, is 'the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will.' It thus included only forcible male penile penetration of a female vagina and excluded oral and anal penetration; rape of males; penetration of the vagina and anus with an object or body part other than the penis; rape of females by females; and non-forcible rape."• We originally referred to Susana Martinez as a former attorney general. We should have said district attorney. This has now been changed.
