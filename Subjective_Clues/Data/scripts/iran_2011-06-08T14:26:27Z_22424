Hollywood stars including Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon are launching a campaign with Amnesty International calling for the release of the acclaimed Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi, who has been sentenced to six years in prison.Panahi, who angered the government by supporting Iran's opposition green movement, is also banned from directing and producing films for 20 years after being found guilty in December of making propaganda against the regime.Amnesty International said a group of campaigners would deliver to the UN in New York tens of thousands of signatures including from Penn, Sarandon, Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott demanding Panahi's conviction be overturned.About 20,000 people have signed the petition, along with Iranians including film director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, pop singer Googoosh, academics Hamid Dabashi and Azar Nafisi, and previously imprisoned journalists Roxana Saberi and Maziar Bahari.Campaigners intend to hold a rally in New York outside the UN offices attended by Oscar-winning film-maker Paul Haggis. They will symbolically rename a nearby New York street plaza "Azadi Square" (freedom square) after the rallying point in Tehran where thousands gathered in protest after the disputed 2009 election.Panahi won the Camera d'Or at Cannes in 1995 for The White Balloon. Attempts by the Iranian authorities to silence him were initially highlighted by the French actor Juliette Binoche who held up his name at the 2010 Cannes festival in protest at his arrest. Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola also condemned it.Another Iranian film-maker, Mohammad Rasoulof, was arrested with Panahi in February 2010 and given six years' jail. Both have since been repeatedly honoured at prestigious film festivals including Berlin and Cannes.Parviz Jahed, an Iranian director and critic, said that despite the regime's severe crackdown on their industry, film-makers continued to work. "Independent film-makers in Iran have always been subjected to censorship and intense pressure from the authorities. In spite of, or perhaps as a result of this, they have always managed to persevere to an extent and achieve recognition for independent Iranian cinema on an international scale," he said.Larry Cox, Amnesty's US executive director, said: "Imagine your government telling you that you cannot work, speak your mind or express your beliefs â€“ or you will be thrown in prison. This is the ordeal that Jafar Panahi and Mohammad Rasoulof suffer every day. These two men are being persecuted; it is simply wrong and we must speak up against Iran's actions."
