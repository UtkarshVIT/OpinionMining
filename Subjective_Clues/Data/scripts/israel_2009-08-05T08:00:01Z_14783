Israel's approach to refugees is based first and foremost on political expediency; humanitarian concerns coming a distant second in the decision-making process. The authorities deal with the matter as though they were a state-sized version of my alma mater, granting unfettered entry to those deemed genetically pure, while turning away anyone with the wrong type of blood coursing through their veins. While Israel is a fully paid-up signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, its track record on assisting non-Jewish asylum seekers leaves a lot to be desired.The recent cancellation of the notorious Gedera-Hadera law has been hailed by some as a sign that Israel's leaders' attitude towards refugees is softening, although again it appears politics is the main driver behind the volte-face. The original statute, enacted in 2008, prevented African asylum seekers from settling in the centre of the country (anywhere south of Hadera and north of Gadera), where they were deemed to be taking jobs from indigenous Israelis and creating an unworkable burden on the local authorities.However, driving the refugees to the periphery of the country has created a backlash from the residents of those towns where the migrants ended up. Given that the inhabitants of such areas tend to vote for rightist parties such as Shas and Likud, the interior minister, Eli Yishai, realised that shunting the "refugee problem" on to the doorstep of his party's voter base was likely to backfire at the polling booth – hence his scrapping of the law last week.When it comes to Jewish refugees, the state bends over backwards to welcome those arriving on its shores, providing instant citizenship to the incoming masses, along with all the trappings afforded to legal residents. Millions of shekels are spent on absorbing and integrating new arrivals into the system, teaching them Hebrew, arming them with health and education benefits and generally living up to Israel's founding fathers' promise to provide sanctuary to every Jew on earth.A few years ago, some of that same benevolence seeped into the state's treatment of the influx of refugees from war-torn African countries. The mass arrival of African refugees began less than five years ago, and dates back to the killing in Egypt of dozens of asylum seekers by Cairo police during a protest outside the UNHCR headquarters in 2005. The slaying was a wake-up call to those fleeing genocide in Darfur, Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere, who realised that they would need to look further afield for true shelter and respite, hence their taking the decision to cross from Egypt to Israel.Israel has dealt with the refugees in a somewhat uncertain fashion ever since: the authorities have granted asylum to a few hundred of the earlier wave of refugees and provided school places for those under 18 and temporary work visas to the adults from the burgeoning community. But politicians have been loth to present Israel as a "soft touch" and have sporadically cracked down on those seeking asylum in the country: rounding up those without papers, banning immigrants from certain cities in the centre of the country and imprisoning thousands for up to two years – culminating in the "fascist" bill currently making its way through the Israeli political system.The proposed "infiltrator law", which sailed resoundingly through its first vote in the Knesset, has ratcheted up the tension between the authorities and the tens of thousands of African refugees to an unprecedented level. In effect, not only do those crossing illegally into Israel face up to 20 years in jail for their actions, but anyone deemed to be assisting the refugees – from doctors, to NGO workers, to casual volunteers – can be imprisoned as well for the "crime" of abetting the immigrants.By virtue of 17,000 African refugees having voted with their feet and arrived in Israel, it is clear that Israel is by no means the worst offender on the world stage when it comes to its attitude to asylum seekers. The harrowing tale of the Eritreans stuck in Calais who would rather risk life and limb trying to get into the UK than return to Italy or stay in France signifies how desperate conditions are in apparently enlightened countries in Europe. Likewise, the mistreatment of non-native migrants across the Arab world is scandalous, whether in the sweatshop shanty towns in Dubai or Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and Syria.But for supporters of Israel to fall back on a defence that the Jewish state is the best of a bad bunch is hardly the most resounding endorsement of human rights and basic decency. Israel's previous record when it comes to creating a refugee problem and discriminating against those not of Jewish extraction is a major stain on the state – and the ongoing apathy-cum-antagonism towards the African asylum seekers only adds fuel to the fire.Whilst the spurious claims made in The Voice comparing Israeli jails to concentration camps are both absurd and offensive, a brief tour of Tel Aviv's refugee community shows how much work needs to be done if Israel is to honour its duty to all those seeking shelter on its soil. The squalor of refugee shelters, the malnutrition suffered by adults and children alike and the hostility of the authorities to the asylum seekers is an unpalatable way to act towards people in the same boat as the Jewish people have been throughout our history.Thinly disguised political horse-trading is no substitute for a fair and proper solution to the plight of the refugees; Israel has a responsibility to play fair with refugees from any background, regardless of creed or colour.
