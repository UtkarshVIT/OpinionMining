FranceLast week, being February half-term, was one of the busiest of the season, and unfortunately conditions across France and most of the Alps were pretty poor. Most French resorts haven't had new snow since the start of the month, and warm temperatures have meant artificial snow machines have been able to operate only at night. Slopes have been icy in the morning, slushy by lunchtime. The good news is that all that could change tomorrow, when all the French resorts are forecasting snow. La Grave, Les Deux Alpes and Alpe d'Huez are expecting the most - 16cm AustriaMassive early snowfalls are now but a memory. Warm weather has seen snow on lower slopes melt away - Mayrhofen has no snow on some lower slopes, Solden just 10cm. Some snow is now forecast, but only a couple of centimetres. Best conditions are in Obergurgl and the St Anton area. ItalyColder temperatures have preserved snow better than elsewhere. Between 4cm and 14cm is expected tomorrow. SwitzerlandA similar picture to France, with some snow due tomorrow. Zermatt predicts 14cm.Norway and SwedenNorway has great conditions - Oppdal had 30cm of new snow on Monday, Voss saw at least 10cm on Thursday. Are in Sweden is forecasting 32cm this weekend.
