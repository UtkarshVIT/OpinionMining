The Rio de Janeiro-based Jornal do Brasil is to stop circulating its 119-year-old print edition and appear only online. Its owner, Nelson Tanure, took the decision after failing to sell the once-influential daily newspaper, which is mired in debt and suffering from a circulation collapse. It sells just 17,000 during the week and 22,000 on Sundays. It has 180 employees, including 60 journalists.Sources: Knight Centre. In Portuguese: O Globo
