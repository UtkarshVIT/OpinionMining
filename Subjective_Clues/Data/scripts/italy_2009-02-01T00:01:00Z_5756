A more different place from its Nevada namesake it would be hard to conceive. The area, high in the Italian Dolomites, feels a world away from the braying masses that clog skiing's mega-resorts like Val d'Isère. In San Cassiano, the closest village, English voices remain rare. It's a pretty, modest place, with a handsome church, a cable car, a couple of hotels and a car park beside the ski piste where you wait for the gloriously named Ulli Crattolave, who picks you up on his skidoo and powers back up the pistes, through the forests, then out in the open above the tree line. Ulli took over six years ago and in 2005 built the Las Vegas Lodge, a new mountain restaurant-with-rooms that redefines the concept of the high-altitude "refuge". There's lots of wood, as you'd expect, but instead of rough beams and panelling, it's smooth, polished and light. There's a roaring fire, but it's long, funky and rectangular, set flush into the wall. Then there's the gourmet food served in a restaurant with a glass wall giving views straight out over the slopes. But the real treat awaits upstairs. Instead of bunkbeds in the eaves, there are 10 huge, beautiful double bedrooms with soft white sheets and sparkling bathrooms - all super-stylish. • Doubles from €172 half-board including skidoo transfers from San Cassiano (00 39 0471 840 138; www.lasvegasonline.it).
