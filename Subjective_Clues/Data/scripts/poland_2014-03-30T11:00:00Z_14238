Before I read this book I thought that it could have a bit of humour because of the word weird in the title. However, I found out that there are speech bubbles and questions to answer!I also learnt that Germany invaded Poland while most people were still tucked up in their beds asleep.I like the book because of the funny quotes in the pages like "guess which one of these blokes will soon become a megalomaniac dictator?" And the answer is "Hitler the cry baby."I would rate it 5 out of 5 stars because of the facts and humour and I found out a lot about World War Two.Want to tell the world about a book you've read?
