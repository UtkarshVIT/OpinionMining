Japan promotes its energy-frugal ways >>Source: The New York TimesWith its towering furnaces and clanging conveyer belts carrying crushed rock, Taiheiyo Cement's factory looks like an industrial revolution relic. But it is actually a model of modern energy efficiency, harnessing its waste heat to generate much of its own electricity.

In a rare "good news" announcement, climatologists now say the ice may not be in such a hurry to throw itself into the water after all. Mother Nature, it seems, has given it brakes. Since 1991, the western edge of Greenland's ice sheet has actually slowed its ocean-bound progress by 10%, say the team, who have studied the longest available record of ice and water flow in the region.Volkswagen to Make Limited Edition of 282 miles-per-gallon car  >>Source: TreehuggerThe one litre car has been around in prototype form since 2002 and greens everywhere have been drooling at its 282 miles per gallon fuel economy (or 1 litre of petrol per 100km, hence the name).

The "G8 climate scorecards," compiled by environmental group WWF and insurance company Allianz, said Britain, France and Germany - at the top of the rankings - had failed abysmally to implement measures to back the goal of cutting CO2 emissions.South Asia adopts action plan on climate change >>Source: ReutersEnvironment ministers from South Asian countries has adopted a three-year action plan for regional cooperation to combat climate change effects.
