A strong earthquake swayed skyscrapers in Mexico City and rattled colonial buildings in neighbouring Puebla state today, sending frightened people into the streets. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.The US Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 5.7 and was centred 90 miles (140km) south-east of the capital in Puebla. The Mexican seismological service measured it at 5.9.Mexico City office worker Mariana Rodriguez, 20, was in a 19th-floor bathroom when she felt her building sway."I saw in the mirror that everything was moving," she said. "The soap even fell down. We were really nervous, but they didn't let us leave the building."But many did run outside across the metropolis of 20 million, and waited several minutes before returning indoors. The capital has lived through powerful earthquakes, including one in 1985 that killed as many as 10,000 people.Others immediately got on Facebook and Twitter to tell friends and family they were OK. Some said mobile phone service was knocked out.Today's earthquake was stronger and closer to the capital than one that hit last month. But Bruce Tresgrave of the US Geological Survey said it was 35 miles below ground deeper than normal and thus unlikely to cause major damage.Mexican TV network Televisa said there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage in Mexico City or at its epicentre in Puebla.
