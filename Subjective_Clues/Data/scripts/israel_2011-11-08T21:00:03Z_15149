Archbishop Tutu and Michael Mansfield can hardly "progress understanding and peace in Israel/Palestine" while suggesting similarities with the South Africa apartheid regime (Comment, 4 November). I, too, frequently visit Israel/Palestine but do not see signs of apartheid. Ethiopians, Iranians, Indians, Palestinian-Israeli Arabs and Israeli Jews are among the many groups on the buses, in the hospitals, coffee bars and shopping malls of the towns. There are Arab/Jewish projects in theatre, music, painting and sport. Many schools are mixed and, since 1972, there's been a Jewish/Arab village, Neve Shalom/Wahat-al-Salam. No apartheid but yes, discrimination – some of it the same ignorant, inherent prejudice that we get here in the UK – but most of it coming from the reality of the situation for the average Israeli. Every home with a hermetically sealed security room. On the streets, young people armed and in uniform. A deep-rooted fear of what will happen next. "Will my young soldier daughter be able to handle the situation at the checkpoints?" "When will the next bomb strike?" A small country where everyone knows someone who is bereaved or maimed. For Jewish people, discrimination historically has always been the other way round. "Get out of here – go back to where you belong" were the cries of Europe before the state of Israel. And still the cries continue.Jenny NemkoPinner, Middlesex• The embassy of Israel totally rejects this cynical attempt to defame the state of Israel. People of conscience understand that this elaborate publicity stunt serves no constructive purpose. It does nothing to promote the direct negotiations and reconciliation which are the right and only way to bring peace to the Middle East, as South Africa's own experience has shown, and it dishonours the memory of the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.Amir OfekSpokesman, Embassy of Israel
