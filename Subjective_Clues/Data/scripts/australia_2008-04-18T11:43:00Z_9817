The recently elected Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, is holding a brainstorming session this weekend to come up with future policy ideas.He has invited 1,000 of the country's "best and brightest" minds (which naturally includes Cate Blanchett) to the two-day summit. Rudd has expressed the hope that it will "shake some new ideas loose from the tree".The suggestions so far are a mixture of the serious and the bizzare. They include: - Send more people up to Darwin to take advantage of the higher rainfall there- A euthanasia kit for the frail- Dump the Queen as head of state- A ban on the sale of alcohol to the country's indigenous population- Raise the smoking age to 40- Free crayfish meals for everyone - Jukeboxes for nursing homesWe'd like to know how you would make Australia better? Throw out all the poms is not an acceptable answer.
