Social Media Week kicks off in cities across the globe from Monday, with a range of events in the US, Europe, Africa and Asia aimed at exploring the social, cultural and economic impact of social media and networking.The event marks its fifth year with a global theme which it says will "explore openness in a connected and collaborative world", with speakers and workshops designed to appeal to media, advertising and business. Since launching in 2008, Social Media Week has grown to include events in cities during two weeks, in February and September.This month, events and activities will be taking place in New York – where the event is supported by the Guardian – Copenhagen, Hamburg, Lagos, Miami, Milan, Paris, Singapore, Tokyo and Washington DC. Many of the events will be streamed live online."Few cities inspire us more than New York and Social Media Week is proud to be hosting it here for a fifth time this February," said Toby Daniels, founder and executive director of Social Media Week. "The community here is unique, an incredible example of how to collaborate in times of crisis. It's both an inspiration and the perfect accompaniment to this year's global theme 'Open and Connected'."We couldn't be more excited to bring this community together once again, and to connect them with an incredible lineup of diverse speakers, host organizations, global brands, public sectors organizations and nonprofits."Ford will be among the companies hosting events in New York, with its global head of social media, Scott Monty, due to make an announcement at an event at the Bloomberg building on Tuesday evening. Ford will discuss its social media efforts, which include the first automotive social movement, the Fiesta Movement, and Monty will discuss how brands can avoid pitfalls in the unpredictable social world.Google will also have a large presence, with a team from Google+ offering a masterclass in using Google Hangouts – its live chat tool. A number of media organisations have invested time and effort in using Hangouts to engage readers and their community; HuffPost Live uses the platform as a social two-way in its video service, while the Washington Post is among a number of media groups to have used the feature to engage with its users.In another highly anticipated event, Eli Pariser from Upworthy and Reddit's Alexis Ohanian will discuss the battle to protect free information on the internet, and the "need to encourage" governments and social networks to leave content people are creating unfiltered in a bid to preserve free speech. Last year's February Social Media Week attracted more than 36,000 attendees, across 1,000 events, according to organisers. Some 2,500 speakers engaged in conversation across 12 cities, with hundreds of thousands of people engaging in events online.
