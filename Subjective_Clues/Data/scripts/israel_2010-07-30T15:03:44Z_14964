A free Israeli daily, Israel HaYom, has just become the country's leading newspaper.Its estimated readership is reported to have edged ahead of the long-time market leader, Yediot Aharonot. According to a biannual TGI survey, Israel HaYom has a readership of 35.2% compared with Yediot's 34.9%.Two important dailies have lost readers. Haaretz dropped from 6.6% to 6.4% while Ma'ariv went from 13.6% to 12.5%.The fall of the latter title will doubtless delight Israel HaYom's owner, the US-based billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who once accused Ma'ariv's owner of lacking sufficient patriotism.Adelson is a big supporter of Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and an opponent of the two-state solution for the Palestinian people.Critics argue that Israel HaYom follows the same political line. They also claim that its readership success is due mainly to Adelson's huge investment. Sources: Globes/Jerusalem Post/The Independent
