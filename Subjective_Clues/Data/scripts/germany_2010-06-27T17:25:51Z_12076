England are out of the world cup, beaten 4-1 by Germany in a match where the team was consistently outclassed, according to the pundits.It was not the new territory into which Fabio Capello was supposed to lead his squad. This is the heaviest defeat England have known at a World Cup finals, outdoing a 4-2 loss to Uruguay in 1954. That is meaningful mostly as a measure of England's terrible fallibility in defence.But how did they do according to the statistics?
