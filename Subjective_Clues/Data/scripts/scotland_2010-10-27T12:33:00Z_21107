Initially the application will be available on Apple iPhones and iPads, but Scottish Government said it has plans to it roll out to other types of mobile phone.Known as the PCS procurement app, it was produced in Dundee by iPhone application developer, Waracle.The application, launched on 26 October, will work alongside Public Contract Scotland (PCS), the official purchasing portal. The Scottish government said it will provide companies with access to £9m worth of public sector business each year.It said the move is an important part of Scotland's Public Procurement Reform Programme, which is aimed at driving up standards in public service procurement.Speaking at the National Procurement Conference in Glasgow, Nicola Sturgeon, deputy first minister, said: "The portal, and now the PCS app, make contract opportunities even more accessible to suppliers; are helping to make public sector procurement more transparent and competitive; and play key roles in achieving efficiency improvements."In a challenging economic climate, it is more important than ever that we make best use of available resources, and deliver greater value for money in public procurement."Since its launch two years ago, the PCS has attracted more than 8,000 registered suppliers and between August 2009 and July 2010 published 11,000 business opportunities. The Scottish Government has estimated that each registered supplier saves more than £400 a year in the costs of searching for public sector tenders advertised through other channels.
