The Mexican government is holding a competition to find the most outrageous examples of bureaucracy and the best suggestions on how to improve rid government agencies of inefficiency and corruption. Mexicans face such delays and complications in their dealings with officialdom that bribery to speed things up is commonplace. The president, Felipe Calderon, who announced the competition, wants to slim down the number of forms used by the federal government from 4,200 to a slightly more manageable 3,000 by the time he leaves office in 2012. "Governments serve to facilitate the development of people and communities, not to complicate them," the government's public administration secretary, Salvador Vega, said at a news conference.Questions asked in competition entry forms include "Were you asked for difficult-to-acquire or nonexistent documents?" and "Were you asked for a bribe to complete the service?" People are asked for suggestions on how to improve government agencies.The head of the Mexican branch of the anti-corruption group Transparency International will chair the competition judging panel, which will include citizens. The winners will be announced in December. The worst example of federal red tape and the best suggestion for improvement will win US$27,900 (Â£15,180). Winners at the state and local level will get US$9,300 each.The entry forms feature a photograph of an official at his desk, surrounded by stacks of documents and pointing a long line of weary residents in another direction, while an assistant paints her nails. A clock on the wall gives the time as 11.30am and a digital counter announces that the second person of the day is being served.
