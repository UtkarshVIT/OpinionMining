Six world powers began two days of talks with Iran today aimed at curbing its nuclear programme, but there is little hope of a breakthrough at the Istanbul meeting.The two sides sat down with no sign they were ready to budge from widely differing positions revealed after a first round of talks in Geneva last month.The talks opened a day after the Guardian revealed that US officials believe Iran now has the "technical ability" to make highly enriched uranium, an essential step towards building a nuclear bomb.According to a leaked US diplomatic cable, a US representative told a meeting of international nuclear experts: "Iran had now demonstrated centrifuge operations such that it had the technical ability to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU) if it so chose".Not all western governments share the US conclusion but, if Washington's fears are true, it suggests international sanctions have failed to deny Iran the knowhow required to make a nuclear bomb.The six countries involved in the talks in Turkey – the five permanent UN security council members, the US, Russia, China, Britain and France, plus Germany – would like to kickstart discussions focused on freezing Iran's uranium enrichment programme, but Tehran has repeatedly said that is not up for discussion.Instead, Iranian officials are pushing an agenda that ignores its nuclear programme but covers global disarmament, Israel's suspected nuclear arsenal and Tehran's concerns about US military bases in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East."We want to discuss the fundamental problems of global politics at the Istanbul talks," said the Iranian chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili.President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad suggested any push to restrict the meeting to Iran's nuclear programme would fail."They employed all their might and tried hard to prevent Iran from going nuclear," Iranian state TV quoted Ahmadinejad as saying, "but Iran went nuclear and there will be no way back."A diplomat familiar with the talks says the six powers will seek to nudge Iran toward acknowledging the need to reduce worries that the Islamic republic might turn its enrichment programme to making weapons. He asked for anonymity because the talks are closed.Tehran denies such aspirations, insisting it only wants to make nuclear fuel. Concerns have grown, however, because its uranium enrichment programme could also make fissile warhead material. There are also worries about Iran's nuclear secrecy and its refusal to co-operate with attempts to investigate suspicions that it ran experiments related to making nuclear weapons.Iran came to the table warning that it was in no mood to compromise. "Resolutions, sanctions, threats, computer virus nor even a military attack will stop uranium enrichment in Iran," Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told Iranian state TV.The enrichment programme led to Iran being on the receiving end of UN security council sanctions and the Stuxnet malware computer virus, which is thought to have been created by Israel or the US. It has also provoked the threat of military strikes from both America and Israel.Before today's session, the diplomat said the EU high representative for foreign policy, Catherine Ashton, would urge the Iranian side in her opening address to recognise the need to discuss international concerns about Iran's nuclear programme.Ashton, he said, would renew a 2008 offer providing Iran with technical and logistical support for peaceful nuclear activities as well as trade and other incentives in exchange for its willingness to address the calls for curbs on its atomic programme.Diplomats hope that Jalili will agree to meet his US counterpart, William Burns, in a bilateral meeting. While the Iranians met several delegations at the Geneva talks, they refused a US overture for a one-on-one meeting in the Swiss city.
