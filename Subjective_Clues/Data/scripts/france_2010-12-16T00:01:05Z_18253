Ever since their last king was overthrown in 1848, a small number of unreconciled citizens of the French republic – along with several of its bestselling magazines – have yearned for the monarchy's return. There is sensibly little support among the majority of French people for such a reactionary fantasy. Yet France now has a rare opportunity to have the best of both worlds – upholding its republicanism while also doing full honours to one of its greatest monarchs. The scientific confirmation that an embalmed head in the possession of a private collector belongs to King Henri IV means that the relic can now be restored to a proper place in the royal chapel of Saint-Denis, from which it was disinterred during the revolution. If the skull had been that of his descendant Louis XVI, who was separated from his head on what is today a traffic island in the Place de la Concorde, the idea of a solemn reinterment attended by the president would even now be a politically controversial step. But Henri IV rightly retains a place of honour in French hearts, right and left, as the man who brought the country's religious wars to a close, introduced one of the most remarkable measures of religious freedom of the 16th century, rebuilt the French economy and dreamed of creating a network of long-term alliances that some admirers have seen as a forerunner of the European Union. By all means let his remains be returned to Saint-Denis. But if ever there was a king who deserved to rest in the national Panthéon, it is Henri IV.
