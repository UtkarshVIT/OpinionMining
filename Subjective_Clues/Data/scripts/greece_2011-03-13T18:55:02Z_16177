 Barely 24 hours after declaring victory in his battle to win better terms for bailout loans to debt-stricken Greece, prime minister George Papandreou called an urgent cabinet meeting on Sundayamid mounting anger over concessions agreed for the improved conditions.Despite securing a reduction in interest rates and extension in the repayment period of the €110bn (£95bn) EU and IMF rescue package, Papandreou came under fire at the weekend for accepting to pay too heavy a price at Friday's summit of eurozone leaders.Under the new pact, Greece will be able to pay back the emergency aid over seven and a half years, up from three and a half, and at 1% less. "These decisions are a clear indication of the appreciation of the effort being made by Greece … and the Greek people," said the socialist leader. "We are €6bn better off."But the backlash has been swift and sharp. On both the left and right politicians accused Papandreou of caving into German pressure to push ahead with a controversial €50bn privatisation programme including a fire-sale of prime state-owned properties in return."Greece and the Greek people should know that prolongation of the repayment of €110bn has been given in exchange for the selling off of public property and with new pressures on the Greek people," said Alexis Tsipras, who heads the left-wing Syriza party.Greek unions representing civil servants, who have seen their wages slashed, pensions frozen and taxes increased since crisis erupted last year, said they would stage a general strike in April to protest against further cuts.With its public debt projected to reach 158% of GDP next year, Greece has faced growing pressure to denationalise loss-making public companies and sell off land holdings estimated by the IMF to be worth between €200bn and €300bn.The real estate includes islands, Olympic games venues and other prime sites around the country. But with state-owned assets considered sacred cows by powerful unions traditionally aligned with the ruling Pasok party, such a move would also bring the socialists head to head with grassroots support.Under the original terms of the bailout, international creditors had demanded sell-offs worth no more than €5bn. But with Greece's debt load believed by some economists to exceed €400bn, – up from €330bn at the end of last year – calls for taking radical steps have mounted if the country is to avoid a sovereign default.
