What is the biggest change you have seen in China? And in your own life?Our country has solved the problem of starvation. Everyone has enough to eat. Our economy is strong and big. The financial crisis has not affected us much. I haven't noticed any difference in village life, though some migrants have come back home. As individuals, we don't feel that we have got much richer. We don't have much money.  The biggest change since I was young is the loss of water. I used to swim in the ponds around our village, but they have all dried up.What's your greatest hope for China and for yourself?I would like the government to provide more support to improve the environment in rural areas. They always say that they treat the city and the countryside equally, but that is not the case when it comes to sanitation. We need more help from above. But I believe our country is generally following the right direction set by our party. We could see the power of China last year during the Olympics and in the way we helped each other after the earthquake. Our country can be the greatest in the world.What is your greatest fear?My biggest concern is my wife's health. She has Alzheimer's. She always supported me by looking after the farmland while I was out. But now, I must stay home and look after her.  She has been sick for two years now. We have to pay all our medical bills ourselves. That is tough. Our income is very low. We earn 1,000 to 2,000 yuan (£100-£200) per year from our farmland. They say there will be a new medical insurance system later this year that will help us, but I haven't seen anything about it yet.
