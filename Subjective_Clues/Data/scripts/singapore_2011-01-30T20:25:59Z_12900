Hooded pitta, Pitta sordida, photographed in the island nation of Singapore. Image: Marie Louise Ng, 26 January 2011 [velociraptorize].Nikon D3S, 500/F4 Question: If I told you that the males and females of this Singapore mystery bird species look almost identical to each other, what could tell me about their breeding behaviours?Response: This is a hooded pitta, Pitta sordida. This small passerine is found in a variety of different forest types as well as on plantations and in other cultivated areas throughout southeastern Asia. Male and female hooded pittas look almost identical. As is typical for birds where there is little to no visible differences between the sexes, both parents contribute to caring for the eggs and raising the hatchlings.
