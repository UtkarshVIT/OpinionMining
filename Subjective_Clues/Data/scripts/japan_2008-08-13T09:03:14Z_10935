Stock markets across most of Asia fell today following the news that the Japanese economy contracted in the second quarter of the year.Official figures showed that Japan's gross domestic product fell by 0.6% in the three months to the end of June, compared with the first quarter of the year when it had grown by 0.8%.The Japanese contraction was caused by a range of factors, including lower consumption by individuals and a drop in both public and private investment. Industrial production has also fallen, thanks to higher energy and commodity prices and the slowdown in export markets such as the UK and America.Economy minister Kaoru Yosano admitted that Japan faces "downward risks", but predicted that the contraction would not last long.The news sent Japan's Nikkei index falling by over 2%, with the Hong Kong Hang Seng index dropping by 1% and China's Shanghai index closing at a fresh 20-month low.Some analysts believe that Japan's economy is already in recession. Unlike in the west, where recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, the official Japanese definition is the period between the peak and the trough of the economic cycle. "The data gave an impression that the economy has entered a recession and I think it is in a recession," Takahide Kiuchi, chief economist at Nomura Securities, told Reuters.
