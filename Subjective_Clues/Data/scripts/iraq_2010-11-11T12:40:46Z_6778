Iraqi politicians have announced a deal which could finally see the formation of a government after eight months of political deadlock.But while the US called the development "a big step forward for Iraq", Ayad Allawi, the leader of the bloc that won the most votes in March's election, is seriously considering walking away from the deal.The agreement was announced today by Kurdish regional president Masoud Barzani, who brokered the protracted negotiations between Allawi and his rival, the incumbent prime minister, Nuri Maliki.Barzani said that under the deal, Maliki will remain as prime minister, while the Kurdish faction will keep the presidency.Allawi's mainly Sunni Iraqiya group will get the speaker's post in the national assembly (parliament), while Allawi himself will head a new council of strategic policy, he said.But Allawi, who won 91 seats in the 7 March poll, compared with Maliki's 89 seats, remains unconvinced that the role created to lure him into a power-sharing administration actually offers any power.Sources close to the secular leader have confirmed that most members of Iraqiya will join a coalition government. Leading members will take senior roles, including the national security position, which was touted as a solution both for Allawi and for Iraq's interminable political woes. It was meant to act as a counterbalance to the prime minister's powers, which were increasingly seen as without limits.It was also meant to maintain a semblance of balance in Iraq, the destiny of which is now up for grabs in a byzantine struggle for regional influence that pits the declining power of the US, and Saudi Arabia, against a sustained push by Iran.Allawi was backed strongly by the Sunni Arab world. Maliki had sought and won the patronage of Iran.Antony Blinken, national security adviser to US vice-president Joe Biden, said: "Iraq's leaders negotiated and apparently agreed to a major redistribution of powers that creates real checks and balances against the abuse of power by any one group."But the role assigned to Allawi has proven to be far from a panacea. It was offered as early as July by former US ambassador Christopher Hill, who had realised the danger facing Iraq if the disenfranchised Sunnis were further sidelined.But today's deal appears to have done little to meet those concerns.Last week, Allawi told the Guardian: "There are still no discussions about agreements on power sharing, devolution of power. Our rights and the will of the Iraqi people are being ignored. The rights of Iraqiya having the most seats are also being ignored."There has been no breakthrough on this issue since, and as talks dragged on, the streets of Baghdad have been ravaged by a string of violent attacks. Meanwhile, the faith of voters who were told to believe in the process has been strained beyond breaking point.Allawi has for many months faced the most difficult of choices: to sign up for a job that he suspects offers power in name alone, or to opt out all together.His decision is now imminent. In the meantime, what is emerging from an eight-month imbroglio is much the same as before. Maliki will remain as prime minister, the Kurds will keep the president's palace and re-nominate Jalal Talabani. The next month will see the spoils carved up as ministries are handed out.In the meantime, the already restive Sunni streets of Anbar and Diyyala will keep a very close eye on Allawi's move.
