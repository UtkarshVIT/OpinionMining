As tensions between China, Japan and others in the region rise, observers could be forgiven for wondering which year this is, given the copious references to events dating back seven decades or more.Historical grievances have always played a role in regional tensions. But longstanding issues – particularly over Japanese wartime brutality in China – are being invoked increasingly frequently and explicitly.The news that Japan is considering revising its apology for enslaving Chinese and South Korean women in military brothels follows inflammatory remarks from public figures, including the head of the state broadcaster.Meanwhile, China has approved the establishment of national memorial days to commemorate the Nanjing massacre and Japan's defeat in the second world war.Chinese officials reportedly want President Xi Jinping's visit to Berlin next month to focus on the war - underlining Beijing's attempts to contrast German contrition with what it sees as Japan's lack of remorse.And on Wednesday, China's premier told the National People's Congress: "We will safeguard the victory of World War II and the postwar international order, and will not allow anyone to reverse the course of history."Leaders have also drawn pointed parallels between past and present, with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzõ Abe, suggesting bilateral relations were akin to those between the UK and Germany before the first world war. The Filipino president, Benigno Aquino, took it a step further by comparing China's rise to that of Nazi Germany.For Beijing, the more potent parallel in the light of hawkish Abe's ascendance is not 1914 but 1894 – the beginning of Japan's first war against it.The historian Wang Zheng, of Seton Hall University in the US, said problems such as the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu or Senkaku islands in the East China Sea were deeply rooted in history.But he argued that China and Japan also see past and future as closely tied, to a degree that western counterparts do not."Unfortunately, they have quite different understandings of history … Both sides consider themselves peace-loving and the other side as aggressive," he said.While a new museum in northern China commemorates the man who assassinated Korea's Japanese governor in 1909 as a patriotic martyr, Tokyo calls him a terrorist."Eastern nations have a habit of referring to history in diplomatic disputes … They like to make historical stories serve the present reality," said Zhang Lifan, an independent Beijing-based historian.He argued that highlighting some aspects of the second world war allowed China to remind the US of previous enmity with its now ally Japan.Wang's book, Never Forget National Humiliation, explores the broader issue of the Communist party's extensive and sophisticated use of nationalism to legitimate its rule.The concept of a "century of humiliation" at the hands of foreign powers – from the opium wars, which began in the 1840s, to Japan's defeat – has been central to nation-building, he said."To have the country get back to its former glories is the basic motivation of China's history," he said.While Mao Zedong proclaimed that "the Chinese people have stood up", it was after the student protests of 1989 that Beijing systematically built up its patriotic education programme.Wang noted that this message cannot be dismissed solely as propaganda: atrocities took place, within living memory. Victims and their families are understandably angry to see Abe visit the Yasukuni shrine, which honours Japanese war dead, including several convicted war criminals.Nor are Communist leaders simply using this view of history cynically: it affects their own attitudes, emotions, judgment and understanding.The frictions with Japan in part reflect a similar message on Abe's part of a return to historical greatness. He has suggested his country needs to end "masochistic" feelings of guilt and his vision of national rejuvenation includes revising the constitution, under which it renounces war.He has promoted rightwingers to prominent roles – such as at the state broadcaster – and Shogo Suzuki, an expert on Sino-Japanese reconciliation, at Manchester University, noted that the right's rise may also have emboldened revisionists to speak out.Such comments do not reflect the mainstream, Suzuki argued. "The number of Japanese people who think Japan did a lot of harm to Asian people has actually increased over the years," he said.But many view Japan's aggression within the context of its race against western imperial powers. There is also a sense of exasperation that other countries are not held to account in the same way, Suzuki said: Tokyo has apologised for its record, while western countries have barely acknowledged their brutal colonial histories. And Japan, too, suffered wartime trauma – the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Others point out that while Chinese leaders urge others to face the past, they suppress discussion of politically instigated domestic disasters such as the great famine that began in the late 50s and the Cultural Revolution."China criticises Japan for distorting history, but the party distorts history too," said Zhang.While wrangling over the past appears to be driving the two countries further apart, Wang believes honest discussion could bring them closer together.He cited a joint history textbook produced by academics from South Korea, China and Japan – a project that the South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, has suggested could be built on officially. Where the scholars could not agree, they presented their differences in the text."Even if they can't agree on everything, they should be able to have a dialogue about the past," said Wang. "It's not just the responsibility of the government, but of scholars and educators. Otherwise, this cycle of hatred will continue."
