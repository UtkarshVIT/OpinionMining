Naked alpine ramblers have been warned to keep their clothes on this spring or face fines under new legislation introduced by Swiss authorities intended to clamp down on a growing pastime.The Swiss canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden has said it will slap fines of 200 francs (£122) on holidaymakers going naked in the Alps."We were forced to introduce the legislation against this indecent practice before the warm weather starts," said Melchior Looser, the justice and police minister of the canton.He said that until now the naturist walkers – sometimes referred to as "boot-only hikers" – had been free to wander naked because there was no law to prevent them from doing so. The new law is expected to come into force on 9 February in time for the start of the hiking season.According to one naked hiker website, nacktwandern.de, the trend goes back to the start of the 20th century and has much to do with the new access it gives people to nature."Abandoning unpractical clothes enables a direct contact with the wind, sun and temperature", the site said. Some hikers even abandon footwear.A 58-year-old German lawyer and naked hiker called Dietmar, who declined to give his last name, said he was sad to hear of the Swiss changes. "We simply try to tune into nature," he said. "It's the most harmless pursuit possible."Looser said: "The point is many children visit our mountains in the summer."Naked ramblers are drawn to Appenzell Innerrhoden – which is also famous for delaying giving women the vote until 1990 – by its beautiful landscape. Last year an internet campaign by a lobby group of hikers declared it to be a "naked rambler paradise", prompting a rush of visitors.The naturist movement in the German-speaking world – known as free body culture (FKK) – has traditionally flourished on beaches rather than in the mountains. According to a strict set of rules, beaches are divided into designated sections for nudists and non-nudists, with beach police patrolling the two to keep the peace.
