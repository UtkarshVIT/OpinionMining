In 2006, following publication of the National Health and Nutrition Survey, newspaper headlines were damning: "Mexico: nation of obese" or "Mexico: world's fattest country."The bad press zeroed in on children and adolescents. In 2012, close to 35% of those between 5 and 19 were classified overweight or obese, which not only presented a public health problem, but a public funding crisis as well. Estimates indicate that obesity costs the Mexican government more than 5bn dollars each year, and forecasts indicate that by 2017, this amount will exceed 11bn.Newspaper headlines on child obesity might be more positive in the near future thanks to recent public policy decisions made by the Mexican government and legislators, such as the approval of a 10% tax on flavored drinks with added sugar and another 8% tax on high calorie foods. Another reason for optimism is the 2013 education reform, which established the obligation to provide nutritional meals to students, prohibit the sale and consumption of unhealthy foods in schools, and encourage nutrition education and physical activity.Additionally, the government recently launched the National Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Overweight, Obesity and Diabetes, which is underpinned by public health, medical attention, fiscal policy and health regulations, particularly in relation to information on the nutritional content of foods on labels and advertising.This last aspect is vitally important. The existing self-regulating codes for food and drink advertising, which currently have 34 member companies, including large multinationals, is supervised by an advertising ethics council run by the private sector, opening the door to conflicts of interest. The code is already considered rather lenient.The strategy's goal is to limit unrestricted advertising that invites consumption of non-nutritional foods and drinks during children's television programming times, but so far, the necessary legal reforms have not been undertaken, nor are the respective oversight mechanisms and sanctions in place. These are urgently needed if children are to be protected during a stage in their lives where they are particularly vulnerable to such influences.UNICEF Mexico works with government, business, academics, lawmakers and social actors to put children at the heart of a comprehensive strategy that addresses obesity as a multi-factor phenomenon. We recognizethat preventing obesity in children is an effective way of avoiding harmful effects to their immediate healthwhich could lead to disability and premature death in adulthood.Relatedly, UNICEF actively promotes breastfeeding â€“for its benefits to both mother and child, but also as a means of tackling child and adult obesity. We also focus on social and nutrition programmes for children who show signs of chronic malnutrition which can lead to obesity later on, as well as timely, efficient and effective public investment to make the right to adequate nutrition a reality for all Measures such as these will go a long way in creating favourable headlines and a more positive outlook for Mexican children and will help address the impacts of marketing and advertising to children.Isabel Crowley is representative for UNICEF Mexico Copy on this page is provided by UNICEF, supporter of the children: the next business agenda hub
