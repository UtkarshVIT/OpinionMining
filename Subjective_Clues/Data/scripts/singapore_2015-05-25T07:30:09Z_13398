Welcome to the first of my new puzzle series. Every second Monday I’ll be posting some kind of brainteaser, usually mathematical, here on the science blog network.I’ll be posting the solution on Tuesdays. Which gives you the Guardian puzzlers – guzzlers, obviously! – a full day to chew, digest, absorb and solve.To kick the series off, we have the puzzle that the entire world has been waiting for.Remember the Albert, Bernard and Cheryl problem – also known as the Cheryl’s birthday problem? It exploded across the internet last month, becoming the most discussed logic puzzle of recent years.The puzzle was written by Joseph Yeo Boon Wooi of Singapore’s National Institute of Education, originally for a test paper in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad.Well, Dr Yeo has written a sequel and I’m thrilled that he has given it to me for the launch of this series. A new character joins logic’s most famous threesome. Enjoy!Albert, Bernard and Cheryl became friends with Denise, and they wanted to know when her birthday is. Denise gave them a list of 20 possible dates. 17 Feb 2001, 16 Mar 2002, 13 Jan 2003, 19 Jan 200413 Mar 2001, 15 Apr 2002, 16 Feb 2003, 18 Feb 200413 Apr 2001, 14 May 2002, 14 Mar 2003, 19 May 200415 May 2001, 12 Jun 2002, 11 Apr 2003, 14 Jul 200417 Jun 2001, 16 Aug 2002, 16 Jul 2003, 18 Aug 2004Denise then told Albert, Bernard and Cheryl separately the month, the day and the year of her birthday respectively.The following conversation ensues:So, when is Denise’s birthday?To clarify: neither Albert, Bernard or Cheryl know anything else at the start apart from the fact that Albert has been told the month, Bernard the day (meaning the number of the day), and Cheryl the year.Extra points: a playful aspect of the Cheryl birthday problem was that the answer - i.e. Cheryl’s birthday - is also Dr Yeo’s birthday. He has also hidden a fun little nugget - what he calls an “Easter egg” - in this one. It is something purely mathematical. What is it?Go, guzzlers, go!My latest book is Alex Through the Looking Glass (UK) and The Grapes of Math (US). To keep in touch with this blog I’m on Twitter, Facebook and Google+. Also, my personal website.
