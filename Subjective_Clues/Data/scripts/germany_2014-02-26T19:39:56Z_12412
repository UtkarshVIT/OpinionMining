The European parliament could become a squabbling ground for "loonies and lobbyists", observers warned after a German court on Wednesday ruled against a voting threshold at European elections.The president of the federal court, Andreas Vosskuhle, ruled on Wednesday that the 3% entry hurdle violated the constitution and had stopped parties from getting a fair hearing. The ruling will come into effect immediately and apply to the European elections in May, where Germany will elect 96 MEPs for the next parliamentary term – the highest number of seats of all member states.Sixteen out of 29 EU countries, including Britain, have no threshold quotas for European elections, but the issue is an unusually politically loaded one in Germany: a 5% hurdle was introduced for the national parliament in 1949 with a view to making the raucous parliamentary squabbles of the Weimar Republic a thing of the past.Germany's proportional system has encouraged the creation of an unusually high number of smaller parties. While the Pirate party, the anti-euro Alternative für Deutschland and the far-right NPD are the three most prominent parties likely to gain from the changes, a number of smaller splinter groups and single-issue parties will be hoping for seats in Strasbourg and Brussels too.The head of the Pirate party, which is currently represented in the European Parliament via its Swedish branch, said the decision would guarantee that citizens' votes "wouldn't again fall under the table".The NPD, over whom the upper body of the Germany parliament is currently seeking a ban, called the court's decision a "phenomenal victory" and confidently announced on its website that its entry into the European parliament was now "not just likely, but a certainty".At previous European elections, German parties had to overcome a 5% hurdle, which the federal court had ruled unlawful in 2011. Last year, the German parliament had proposed replacing the 5% hurdle with 3%, but after complaints by 19 smaller parties this compromise too has been dismissed by the courts.Had there been no threshold at the last elections in 2009, seven additional parties would have gained seats, including the Free Voters, the far-right Republicans, the animal rights party Human Environment Animal, the Pensioners party, the Family party and the anti-growth and pro-family Ecological Democratic party, whose chairman Sebastian Frankenberger told the Guardian that the court decision was "a victory for democracy and for the citizens whose votes will no longer be wasted." The satirical party known as The Party has also announced its intentions to win a seat in May.But some commentators warned that the court's decision could condemn the European parliament to irrelevance. "The danger is that it could encourage lots of individuals with an axe to grind to set up their own party," said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Berlin's Otto-Suhr-Institute for Political Science. "You won't just get loonies, but loonies who can pretend to have a political career without wielding any real political power."Others were less pessimistic. "I don't think there will be a big chaos," said Nils Diederich of Berlin's Free University. "The big parliamentary groups will work more closely together, and there will be new alliances between smaller parties. Making decisions may take longer, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."The party that will be affected most directly by the decision to scrap the 3% hurdle is Angela Merkel's CDU. Until now, the Christian Democrats have tried to counter the threat posed by the anti-euro party Alternative für Deutschland by allowing their Bavarian sister party, the CSU, to opt for a more eurosceptic tone. But with the AfD feeling emboldened by the court's decision, the chancellor's party may have to readjust its European strategy."We have to live with the judgment and the fact that splinter parties and radical elements from Germany will be represented in the EU parliament," said CDU MEP Markus Ferber. "That's not a very pleasant situation."
