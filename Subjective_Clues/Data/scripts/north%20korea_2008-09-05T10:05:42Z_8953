Negotiators from South Korea, Japan, the US and China today convened a hastily arranged meeting in Beijing to discuss the deadlock over the dismantling of North Korea's nuclear programme.In February last year, Pyongyang agreed to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for aid and diplomatic concessions. It handed over details of its nuclear facilities in June, but has so far failed to agree a verification process. Last week, it announced it had halted disabling work at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor because of anger at Washington's failure to drop it from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.Officials from countries negotiating with Pyongyang said some equipment was being moved out of storage and back to the plant. "This is a critical moment, and we should try to break this deadlock as soon as possible so that North Korea can promptly restart nuclear disarmament and come back to the six-party talks," Kim Sook, South Korea's chief nuclear envoy, said."There is no information on whether North Korean officials will come to Beijing." The US has been in "near daily" contact with North Korea on how to verify the contents of a declaration on its nuclear inventory, a senior Washington official said yesterday. The official said the contacts - including the most recent, which took place on Wednesday - were one reason why the US was not unduly disturbed by Pyongyang's decision to take equipment at the nuclear complex out of storage.Analysts said the North might be attempting to pressure the outgoing Bush administration as it looks for diplomatic successes to bolster its legacy, and might also believe it could get a better deal by waiting for a new US president.US officials said they viewed North Korea's moves more as a negotiating tactic than a genuine effort to rebuild Yongbyon, which proliferation experts claim has produced enough plutonium for six to eight bombs.
