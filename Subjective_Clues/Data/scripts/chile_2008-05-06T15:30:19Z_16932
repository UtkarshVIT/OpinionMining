Hundreds of people were urgently evacuated today from a town close to the Chaitén volcano in southern Chile after lava and ash began spewing 12 miles into the air.The snow-capped volcano erupted on Friday forcing nearly 4,500 people to flee. Further eruptions have prompted the government to remove the remaining people from the remote Patagonian region.Carmen Fernandez, head of the government's emergency bureau, said the final evacuation of residents in Chaiten, six miles from the volcano, involved 300 people, including police, soldiers, emergency personnel, a few reporters and some residents. The amount of lava emerging from the volcano was "very small and very thick", he reported, and as such was moving slowly so it is moving very slowly''.Some residents resisted leaving their homes but officials ordered all be evacuated immediately. "The situation has changed suddenly," Rodrigo Rojas of the national emergency office said."Today the volcano is erupting with pyroclastic material on a different scale," he added. "We presume lava is flowing and so have ordered the immediate precautionary evacuation of all civilians, military and press in Chaitén." The volcano, which is around 760 miles south of Santiago, has long been considered inactive. Authorities were shocked when it began spewing ash on Friday — it's first eruption in thousands of years. President Michelle Bachelet has toured emergency shelters in Futaleufu, the second town to be evacuated, where around 1,000 residents crossed into Argentina. Residents have been urged to protect their eyes and wear masks to avoid inhaling ash which, in some places, has settled more than six inches deep. Around 25,000 cattle are also at risk.According to Sernageomin, a government mining and geology agency, there is no record of the volcano erupting in the last 2,000 years.
