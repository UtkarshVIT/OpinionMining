Iran has begun installing 6,000 new centrifuges at its uranium enrichment plant in Natanz, the country's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, announced on state television today.Centrifuges are machines used to enrich uranium, either to a low level to produce nuclear fuel or to a high level for use in a weapon.Iran already has about 3,000 centrifuges at Natanz and news of the expansion will be seen as a further snub to the US and its allies, who allege the country's uranium enrichment programme is a cover for building nuclear weapons.It is not clear what kind of centrifuges are being installed in Natanz. More advanced centrifuges can enrich uranium at a much faster rate.  Iran says it needs to boost its domestic energy supply and is simply exercising its right to enrich fuel for nuclear power under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty. The UN security council imposed a third round of sanctions, targeting the nuclear and military sectors, on Iran last month.
