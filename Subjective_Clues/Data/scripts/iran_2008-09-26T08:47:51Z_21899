More and more minority journalists are being jailed in Iran. Four Azeri journalists have been held without charge for more than 10 days, while an Azeri journalist and blogger, Shahnaz Gholami, was sentenced last weekend to six months in prison for her online articles. Well known for her involvement in the struggle for women's rights, she remains free pending an appeal. (Via Reporters Without Borders)
