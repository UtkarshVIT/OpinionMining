Daily Mail Australia and News Corp have reached a confidential legal settlement three months after Rupert Murdoch’s Australian arm accused it of plagiarism.A spokesman for Mail Online’s publisher, Martin Clarke, confirmed that an agreement had been reached but declined to give details.However, Guardian Australia understands no money changed hands.A News Corp Australia spokesman said: “We have settled our dispute with the Mail Online. It was agreed to keep the terms of the settlement confidential. We do note there has been a change in the practices of the Mail Online since we made our complaint. We are keeping a vigilant eye for any future breaches of copyright.”Shortly after Britain’s Mail Online officially rebranded as Daily Mail Australia, in a joint venture with Nine’s digital arm Mi9, News Corp launched a campaign against its commercial competitor.News Corp sent a legal letter asking the company to stop using its content or face a lawsuit.“We have taken this action because we believe the Daily Mail Australia is breaching our copyright by lifting substantial slabs of original content from a large number of articles from our mastheads,” a News Corp spokesman said in June.Daily Mail returned fire, alleging News Corp had “lifted” content from its publications without proper attribution or links.In the latest Nielsen Online news rankings, Daily Mail Australia moved up to fifth spot, ahead of all the News Corp mastheads except news.com.au.Guardian Australia is seventh.In an interview with the Financial Times, Clarke said the matter had been resolved “very much to my satisfaction”.
