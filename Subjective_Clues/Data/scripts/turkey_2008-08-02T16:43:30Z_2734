The Turkish interior minister today said a number of people had been arrested over last weekend's Istanbul bombings.Besir Atalay said most of those who carried out the bombings, in which 17 people were killed and 154 injured, had been taken into custody.It was not immediately clear how many people had been detained."Those who helped, those who gave shelter and those who took part in the attack have been caught," Atalay said.The two blasts, which happened minutes apart, hit a residential area in Turkey's largest city last Sunday.The country's political leadership blamed the attacks on the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) guerrilla group. "Our judgement is that this merciless attack was the work of the bloody separatist group," Atalay said.Zubeyir Aydar, the PKK leader, said the party was not linked to the attacks and suggested they could have been carried out by ultra-nationalists. No claim of responsibility has been made.The minister did not say which organisation, if any, the people arrested belonged to.
