With the recent elections, there's a lot in the news about Iran and we'd like to see as many different perspectives on the country as possible. It doesn't have to be about the election, just something from your viewpoint. Whether you're living in Iran or you're Iranian and living elsewhere – if you have something to share, we'd like to hear from you. Please show us your pictures, video or text – though if you can, please write in English. Some of your experiences will be used in articles on the Guardian site.Though we'd like to hear from you, your security is most important. We recognise it may not always be safe to record or share your experiences – so please think about this when sending your content to GuardianWitness.قبل از آنکه چیزی را برای ما ارسال کنید پیش از هر چیز امنیت خودتان رادر نظر داشته باشید
