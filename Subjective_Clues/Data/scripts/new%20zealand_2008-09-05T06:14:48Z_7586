The New Zealand tourist board is aiming to go one better than Australia, which famously ruffled British sensibilities with its "Where the bloody hell are you?" ads, and entice Brits with a new TV campaign.Tourism New Zealand's £3m ad campaign taps casual Antipodean vernacular using the line "What do you say UK?" and features testimonial-style ads from British people of all ages who have had a fantastic time holidaying in "the youngest country on earth".A total of 22 British holiday-makers feature in a series of eight TV commercials, created by NZ ad agency Assignment and rolled out in the UK by WPP-owned JWT, that will dovetail with Tourism New Zealand's existing "100% Pure" campaign.Tourism New Zealand is hoping that the classic tactic of peer recommendation might entice more Brits to take the plunge and travel to Lord of the Rings country.Filming of the "What do you say UK?" ads will continue throughout the New Zealand summer.The ad campaign, which breaks on Sunday, is the largest that Tourism New Zealand has ever launched in the UK, with an annual budget 75% above what it spent last year.Tourism New Zealand's 100% Pure campaign will run in cinemas and on digital underground escalator panels.The UK is New Zealand's second largest tourist market - behind Australia - with more than 290,000 visitors in the year to the end of June.However, according to reports in New Zealand visitor numbers are down around 3.5% year on year, prompting an unusually UK-specific advertising push."[New Zealand's] dream destination status is a double-edged sword for the country," admitted Gregg Anderson, the Tourism New Zealand regional manager for the UK and Europe. "The issue is that we are seen as an aspirational holiday, which means people will hold off travelling to NZ because they want to make it as great a trip as possible," Anderson said.Rocketing oil prices have also put significant pressure on the cost of long-distance flights, while the credit crunch has seen many belt-tightening UK consumers look to take holidays closer to home.· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.
