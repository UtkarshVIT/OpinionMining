The Italian government has approved a series of business-friendly tax cuts and measures to boost consumer spending that could put Rome in breach of austerity budget rules set by Brussels.Prime minister Matteo Renzi said a reduction in the main corporation tax rate and reduced levies on agricultural and industrial equipment were aimed at supporting Italy’s fragile recovery.Putting forward a budget for next year on the last day of a deadline set by the EU commission, Renzi said €5bn (£3.7bn) of tax cuts would include the abolition of a wealth tax on the main residence of all Italians, worth around €200 a year to most homeowners.The 40-year old said the package would make Italy “a simpler and fairer country”, adding: “This year not only are the taxes not going up but they are coming down.”The proposals will now go before parliament, where they must be approved by the end of the year. However, the budget must also be approved by Brussels, which only last week warned the rightwing government of Mariano Rajoy in Spain that proposals to relax austerity measures in its 2016 budget could be rejected.New fiscal rules, adopted after the eurozone debt crisis, give the European commission power to seek amendments to national budgets.Renzi, who has made tax cuts a rallying cry ever since he came to office in February last year, appears to be prepared for a fight against the Brussels elite that wants Italy to take the opportunity of its recent recovery to step up fiscal tightening.Alessandro Zattoni, an economics professor at the LUISS business school in Rome, said the EU commission is concerned that the deterioration in world trade following the slowdown in China could hurt the Italian economy, hitting tax revenues and further widening the budget deficit.Last month, the government increased its target for 2016’s deficit to 2.2% of output, up from 1.8%, and said it expected the national debt to hit 131.4% of national income (GDP), up from a previous forecast of 130.9%. Renzi said that nonetheless, the debt-to-GDP ratio would begin to fall next year for the first time in nine years, and said other countries that were critical of Italy did not themselves respect the EU’s fiscal rules. Zattoni said Brussels was likely to give Renzi a fair hearing after he imposed stringent austerity measures last year and was forced to increase spending this year to cope with the refugee crisis.“It is about the feeling in Brussels. And I think that has improved after a series of reforms and Renzi’s handling of the refugee situation,” he said.“But Brussels will want to keep an eye on Rome because it is concerned that the economy and the budget could be vulnerable to a deterioration in global trade.”He said business-friendly tax cuts and reforms were good news for the business community and especially entrepreneurs, which have struggled against a tax system that can sometimes charge more than 100% of profits.Reforms to the pension system, allowing older workers to work part-time while drawing their pension, could also free up jobs for younger workers, he said.A tax break for employers who hire staff on unlimited contracts will be continued, although the benefit to employers could be cut after it proved hugely successful.The government ams to limit the growth in short-term contracts that have played a dominant role since the financial crash but have also left millions of younger workers on low pay with little job security.
