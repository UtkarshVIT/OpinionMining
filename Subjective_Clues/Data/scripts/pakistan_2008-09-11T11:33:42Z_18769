When George Bush announced the withdrawal of 8,000 combat troops from Iraq this week, he devoted a considerable amount of his speech to Afghanistan and Pakistan, where Asif Ali Zardari has just succeeded a disgraced Pervez Musharraf as president.Specifically, Bush said the US had to help Pakistan defeat Taliban and al-Qaida fighters hiding in its remote border regions with Afghanistan, where, the US president reminded us, the global war on terror started with the attacks on the World Trade Centre."Defeating these terrorist and extremists is also Pakistan's responsibility - because every nation has an obligation to govern its own territory and make certain that it does not become a safe haven for terror. America and our Nato allies will continue helping Pakistan in its efforts to defeat the extremists."Bush's remarks take on added significance in light of an article in today's New York Times, which reports that he secretly approved orders in July allowing US special forces to make ground assaults inside Pakistan without the prior approval of the Pakistani government.For some time now, the US has carried out missile and artillery strikes inside Pakistan targeting al-Qaida members. They have also killed civilians, arousing understandable resentment in Pakistan.But last week, US ground troops carried out their first foray into Pakistan in pursuit of al-Qaida fighters, so today's piece in the New York Times should not come as too much of a surprise.Increased US military activity in Pakistan has been on the cards for some time. American policy makers have made no secret of their impatience at what they see as the lack of Pakistani resolve in pursuing a reinvigorated al-Qaida and Taliban implanting themselves in the tribal areas where central authority has been weak to non-existent for ages.But increased US intervention brings its own dangers, not least if it turns the Pakistani public – which is increasingly anti-American – against Zardari, who has vowed to fight terrorism. Should Pakistanis see Zardari as a US stooge, it will make his attempt to restore economic stability and fight the growing extremist threat that much more difficult.The big danger is that if the US does not proceed with tact and care, the US and Pakistan will be working at loggerheads instead of together against a common threat.It does not bode well for the US-Pakistan alliance when General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the head of Pakistan's army, who usually keeps a low profile, went public with a warning against unilateral attacks."Falling for short-term gains while ignoring our long-term interest is not the right way forward," Kayani said, in what can only be seen as a very direct message to Bush and whoever succeeds him in November.A more overt US military role poses dangers for the next occupant of the White House as well, with a war-weary public. As the Times of India, which has been watching America's growing willingness to involve itself militarily in Pakistan, notes:"Most interventions in Third World countries begin with such ventures involving advisers and trainers, as it happened with the Soviet involvement in Afghanistan and Cuba. Although widely regarded as a vassal state, Pakistan had avoided direct involvement of US troops inside its territory to avoid a public backlash from an increasingly anti-American mood in the country."
