Singapore's vast army of maids doesn't have it easy. Expected to cook and clean for their employers at a moment's notice, they also have to pass a test to show they can speak English.But this is now set to change, as the city-state's mandatory examination for maids, which included English language testing, will be scrapped from June 2012 and replaced by a "settling-in programme", with modules on stress management, safety awareness and adapting to life and work abroad. It will not offer English language training, nor any classes on cooking or cleaning.One in six Singaporean families hires domestic help, but until now it's often been English that has unified employer with employee. The majority of Singapore's maids hail from its poorer neighbours, notably Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Burma.The exam was introduced in 2005 to improve the calibre of domestic workers coming to Singapore, and has often been cited as a source of stress for new arrivals, many of whom have already paid high recruitment fees to agencies back home in anticipation of a new life.Around 80 maids take the test every day, but failure is common. One Indonesian maid committed suicide last year after failing the test three times, the maximum number of tries allowed.Tan Chuang-Jin of Singapore's manpower ministry said that the new law should offer a more stress-free environment for domestic workers, four out of five of whom are said to face problems adapting to life in Singapore."While the entry test was introduced with good intentions â€¦ it is not a meaningful measure of quality and does not guarantee that the worker understands the English language," he said."It discourages some good foreign domestic workers from wanting to work here, while others spend valuable training time mugging for the test."Local employers and agencies have welcomed the news, with the Singaporean Association of Employment Agencies expecting the new law to increase the number of foreign maids applying to work in Singapore up to 25%. Around 3,000 new domestic workers arrive every month.Others, however, are worried that scrapping the law will pose more, rather than fewer, problems.According to Rieke Dyah Pitaloka, of Indonesia's House of Representatives commission, which oversees labour affairs, poor language skills caused 92% of disputes between Singaporean employers and their Indonesian domestic workers between January and July."Lax requirements will only cause problems, because [poor skills in] language can lead to poor communication between employers and employees," she told the Jakarta Globe.
