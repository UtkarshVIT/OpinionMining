Aldi is planning to expand into China, taking the German discounter into its fourth continent.The family owners of the firm are reported to have agreed to the move but no timeframe has been set. Analysts at the Planet Retail consultancy say Aldi is not likely to start operations in east Asia before 2018.The expansion plan was revealed in minutes of meetings between the two arms of the business – Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd, which operates in the UK. According to the German business journal, Manager Magazin, Aldi Süd will take on the China venture. The supermarket group, which is piling pressure on traditional grocers in the UK including Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s, is scheduled to make its debut in California next year, where it is building a warehouse near Los Angeles.The Chinese market has proved tough for many major western retailers including Tesco and Carrefour. Yujun Qiu, Planet Retail’s China analyst, said: “The big challenge will be how Chinese consumers will react to Aldi’s private-label ranges. Many are sceptical when it comes to retailers’ own brands and prefer the well-known manufacturer brands instead.”
