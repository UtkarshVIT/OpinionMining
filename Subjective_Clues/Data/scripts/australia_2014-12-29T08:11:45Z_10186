The day in briefWell that was another absorbing day of cricket in this 3rd Test at the MCG. The scene is now set for an equally-compelling finish with Australia in a commanding position - 326 runs ahead - but not entirely certain that this talent-laden Indian batting line-up will fold on day five.Australia started the day by mopping up the Indian tail in clinical style before Chris Rogers (69) nudged, nurdled and occasionally even blasted (yes, you read that right) his way to his fourth consecutive Test half-century and provided the ballast as Australia went about setting a challenging total for the tourists. The Indians pegged them back with a steady flow of wickets though. Shane Watson (17) and Joe Burns (9) fell to loose strokes and Steve Smith (12) to a leg-side trap that had given the Indians no joy previously.Of the Indian bolwers, Yadav (2-73 from 14) was expensive and took wickets from shockers but stuck at his task, Ishant (2-49 from 19) was both probing an occasionally menacing and Ashwin (2-56 off 22) never less than a threat. If India’s batting form of this summer and the feisty spirit in which this series has been played holds true, we’re in for a far more absorbing final day tomorrow than the raw numbers might suggest. Make sure you join us at 10am local time for all the live action.

75th over - Australia 261-7 (Marsh 62, Harris 8)With all that faffing of the last over, the world’s oldest-looking 24-year-old, Mohammad Shami, will bowl the last over of the day. He starts with some rubbish down the leg side, which suits Ryan Harris just fine in his efforts to chaperone Marsh through to stumps. Harris even sneaks two through mid wicket when Shami fluffs his attempt at an in-swinging yorker. And that is that. Stumps is called on day four and the Australians lead by 326 with a 10am (local time) start tomorrow due to the time lost to weather today.

74th over - Australia 259-7 (Marsh 62, Harris 6)There’s just six minutes left now until the end of the day’s play but if India are in a hurry to let their bowlers get the maximum opportunity for a dismissal, they’ve got a funny way of showing it. They loll about in the field and at one point the ball - in the process of being passed back towards Yadav - is tossed over Kohli’s head and half-way out to the boundary. Good to see CA offering a $20 adult charge to see the denouement of this Test match tomorrow. #goodvalue

73rd over - Australia 257-7 (Marsh 62, Harris 5)Ryan Harris isn’t afraid of a bit of hard work and digs in admirably as Ashwin zeroes in around his middle and leg stumps with a series of curling, drifting offies. His defence looks impregnable but it’s effective for now. The maiden also probably comes as a relief to the bowler too. Australia leads by 322. Updated

72nd over - Australia 257-7 (Marsh 62, Harris 5)Yadav produces a maiden to Marsh. Six balls, no runs. Fancy that. KFC Trivia: What will Brayshaw call cricket balls in this commentary stint? A) Cherries B) Nuts C) Tomatoes D) Mogwais #ChannelNineNonsense

71st over - Australia 257-7 (Marsh 62, Harris 5)The other thing that this recent onslaught has achieved for Australia, aside from the obvious, is that it’s blunted Ashwin’s influence as he’s reactively tended towards a flatter and faster trajectory. That’s a big win for the home side. Updated

70th over - Australia 255-7 (Marsh 61, Harris 4)Marsh is in charge now. He gets the strike back from Harris, digs out a yorker and then pummels Shami for a pair of wonderful boundaries through cover. He struggled to the 40s and made batting look like learning Sanskrit, but now I’m convincing myself he’s on for a ton. Can Harris hang around? Is there enough time? Australia leads by 320.

69th over - Australia 246-7 (Marsh 53, Harris 3)Whoooof!! Out of nowhere, Shaun Marsh explodes into action by advancing down the track to Ashwin and thumping the spinner over long-on for six to bring up a determined half-century. India need to be careful here because Harris is no slouch, as his first-innings 74 would attest. I remember watching him play as a genuine all-rounder for the Redbacks in the late 90s. What a time that was. I wasn’t even receding yet. @rustyjacko When one leaves a game then returns, one's perspective is different from those who have watched it. Aus look MILES ahead to me!But I’ve seen things, Gary. I’ve seen things.

68th over - Australia 236-7 (Marsh 44, Harris 2)Rahane thinks he has another catch at leg gully from Harris but Kumar Dharmasena makes another judicious call, rightly identifying that it had come off the batsman’s hip. The Australian lead edges past 300 with 2 to Harris. Robert Wilson is on the mark, as usual. “There’s been so much sub-Beckett gloom about the evils of IPL and the death-throes of tests in the last couple of years. With this game setting up beautifully for the last day, that lovely NZ win and the W.Indies currently showing some wherewithal, may I just say that the death throes seem quite vigorous and entertaining?”Yes, you certainly can.

Shami strikes with a a slower-ball bouncer, tying Johnson up and drawing a false stroke that bobbles up in the air to Rahane at mid-wicket. The Australian lead now sits at 299 and there is a lot of feeling out in the middle. Johnson appears to have words to Kohli and perhaps Ishant on the way off. No surprises there, though probably not a great idea on the part of the tourists if the Gabba is anything to go by.

67th over - Australia 234-6 (Marsh 44, Johnson 15)Ashwin and Dhoni have conspired to place two men in the deep, straight, to Johnson. That almost brings about a wicket when the Aussie moves down the track and biffs another flat, fearsome drive but it skids through to Murali Vijay from a single bounce, never rising greatly above head height.

66th over - Australia 233-6 (Marsh 44, Johnson 14)Johnson might have been unshackled by that boundary off Ashwin because he unleashes a thunderous blow off Shami here too, a cross-bat mow that almost kills both the bowler and Umpire Kumar Dharmasena. That breeds some trepidation among the fielding side as well and there’s a fumble in the field next up to gift him a single. I haven’t mentioned it yet, but how magnificent has it been to have Bill Lawry back for what is now a kind of bittersweet Christmas present to cricket lovers?I'll never get tired of Bill Lawry saying 'he hit it as clean as a whistle' #AUSvIND

65th over - Australia 228-6 (Marsh 44, Johnson 9)Mitchell Johnson had waited a shade under half an hour to to move beyond his score of four, but he doubles that in fine and muscular style by slog-sweeping Ashwin over mid-wicket for a boundary. The Ausralian lead creeps up to 293 with 15 overs still to play today.

64th over - Australia 223-6 (Marsh 44, Johnson 4)Did I mention that today’s play has been stretched by an hour due to the delays earlier? It will conclude at 7pm local time, in just under 50 minutes. Out in the middle, Ishant thinks he’s got Marsh trapped in front not playing a shot, but replays confirm what was not immediately obvious to the naked eye - that the ball had pitched outside leg.
