BHP Billiton is prepared to defer by several years about C$2bn (£1.23bn) of tax credits in its hostile bid for Canada's Potash Corporation, the world's biggest fertiliser producer, as it fights to get the deal done in the face of mounting opposition.The Anglo-Australian miner is locked in discussions with the Canadian federal government after Potash's home province of Saskatchewan rejected the $39bn (£24bn) offer, saying the deal would cut local tax revenues by about C$3bn over the next 10 years.The federal government ultimately makes the decision to clear or block the deal, but will be heavily influenced by Saskatchewan, where the deal is opposed by 55% of residents as well as the provincial government.About C$2bn of the losses Saskatchewan is claiming relate to tax credits BHP is due as a incentive for the Jansen plant, a separate potash mine planned to start production in 2015. If it acquires Potash, BHP will be able to transfer the tax credits and claim them early.The other C$1bn of lost tax receipts relates to write-offs that BHP would be able to make from the money it borrows to finance the deal. A spokesman said: "BHP is confident it can address this [Saskatchewan's] concern and ... is prepared to make commitments which go beyond the requirements of prevailing Canadian legislation that should effectively address the tax loss concerns of the province."But Brad Wall, Saskatchewan premier, said: "I still do not see how this BHP takeover of Potash Corp is a net benefit to Saskatchewan. In order for this takeover to be neutral in our view the province would need to see C$3bn come from somewhere."A BHP source said the C$3bn would be made up by deferring the bulk of the Jansen tax credits until after the plant opened.It is understood that BHP has no intention of satisfying additional requests from Saskatchewan, which is asking for a one-off special upfront tax payment of more than C$1bn.
