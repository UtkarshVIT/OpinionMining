The New Zealand prime minister, Helen Clark, conceded defeat in the general election today, paving the way for the country's first conservative government in almost a decade.Clark, who told a crowd of supporters "tonight is not our night", also said she would stand down as leader of the Labour party.The National party's John Key will become New Zealand's 38th prime minister, ending nine years of rule by Clark.The multimillionaire former foreign currency trader told supporters that New Zealanders had "voted in their hundreds of thousands for change", but warned of tough times ahead because of the global economic downturn. Clark, who had been seeking a historic fourth term, appeared to have suffered a crushing loss with more than 90% of the vote counted.As expected, National will have to rely on small allied parties to form a majority in the 122-seat parliament.But Key, 47, will not need the support of the indigenous Maori party, which won five seats but will not hold the balance of power.Key campaigned on a platform of change, invoking the mantra of US president-elect Barack Obama, but also blamed Clark's Labour government for letting the economy fall into recession even before the global financial crisis hit.Clark was also damaged by a series of scandals this year, including fallout from fraud investigations into the party of the former foreign minister Winston Peters. His New Zealand First party appeared to have lost all seven of its seats in parliament, ending Peters' 30-year career as an MP.Key may yet invite the Maori party to join his government to strengthen its majority, something the party leader, Tariana Turia, said would be considered.Clark, 58, became leader of the Labour party in 1993 and was elected as prime minister in 1999.Â· This article was amended on Monday November 10 2008. Helen Clark became prime minister of New Zealand in 1999, not 1998 as we originally said and there are 122, not 123, seats in the New Zealand parliament. These errors have been corrected.
