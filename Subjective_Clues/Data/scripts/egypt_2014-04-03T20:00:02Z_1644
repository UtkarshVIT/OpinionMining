The death sentence handed down to 529 protesters by an Egyptian court (Report, 24 March) should have produced much more than mumbled regret from the British government. This was a political show trial in which less than half the defendants were present in court. Their defence lawyers were not in the court either. The trial has been condemned by Amnesty International. The protesters were not, as reports have routinely claimed, all supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and revulsion at the verdict stretches across the political spectrum to include all but the most determined supporters of Field Marshall El Sisi. All this takes place against the background of the outright banning of Egypt's largest opposition group, which followed the shooting by the Egyptian army of thousands of Muslim Brotherhood supporters last year. The British government should call in the Egyptian ambassador and demand that this judgment is withdrawn with immediate effect.Mark Serwotka General secretary, Public and Commercial Services UnionSteve Turner Assistant general secretary, Unite the UnionKen Loach Film directorHelena Kennedy QCAlaa Mohamed Chair, British Egyptians 4 DemocracyBasma Muhammad Co-ordinator, International Anti-Coup Pro-Democracy AllianceAndrew Murray Chief of staff, Unite the UnionJohn Rees Co-founder, Stop the War CoalitionMohammad Soudan UK representative, Freedom and Justice PartyLouise Christian Human rights lawyerBernard Regan Chair, Sertuc international committeeCaryl Churchill PlaywrightPeter Oborne Chief political commentator, Daily TelegraphLindsey German Convenor, Stop the War CoalitionCarl Arrindell Head of current affairs, Islam ChannelPaul Mackney Former general secretary Natfhe/UCUChris Nineham National secretary, CounterfireSteve Bell Treasurer, Stop the War CoalitionKate HudsonCherry Sewell Officer, Greek Solidarity Campaign• Maryam al-Khawaja's claim that having Formula One in Bahrain causes human-rights violations (Report, 28 March) is little more than attention-seeking from an unrepresentative voice. Not only is there no evidence whatsoever to back this claim up, why on earth would the overwhelming majority of people – including the main opposition parties, such as Al Wefaq – support the hosting of the race if that were to be the case?The independent inquiry in 2011 – led by one of the world's leading human rights experts, Cherif Bassiouni – resulted in a comprehensive report and a series of recommendations for extensive reform, which was fully accepted by the government. At no stage did this report find any links whatsoever between human rights violations and Formula One, with over 9,000 testimonies taken into account. Bahrain welcomes and celebrates in the joy of Formula One, with attendance at the race representing almost 10% of the total population of the kingdom. It benefits the whole country, irrespective of religion and political affiliation and our upcoming race will be a true testament to that.Alice SamaanAmbassador of Bahrain
