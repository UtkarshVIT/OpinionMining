The Bridge Project is a fascinating transatlantic collaboration that also brings Sam Mendes - the Hollywood film director (American Beauty, Revolutionary Road) who founded and ran the Donmar Warehouse - back to the West End. Two productions, of Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, in a new adaptation by Tom Stoppard, and Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, are the result of work by the Old Vic, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Neal Street Productions. Among the cast are Simon Russell Beale, Sinead Cusack and Ethan Hawke. Touring to Singapore, Auckland, Madrid and Epidaurus in Greece, the productions give audiences on both sides of the Atlantic the chance to see each other's work.â€¢ Old Vic, SE1, Sat to 15 Aug
