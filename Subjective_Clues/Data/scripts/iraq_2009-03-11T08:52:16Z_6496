UNFRIENDLY WELCOMEIt's one of those mornings where the Daily Mail and the Sun see fit to black out their front page to symbolise the dreadfulness of it all.The issue at hand is the protest at the return of the Royal Anglican regiment from Iraq yesterday."Hate for heroes, Muslim in vile demo" the Sun says in its splash. "Hate-filled Muslim fanatics spat abuse at British soldiers", which is rivalled only by the Mail's description in a front-page picture caption: "Venom: Faces contorted with fury, some of the Muslim demonstrators who marred the homecoming."The Sun goes on to describe the scene something like this: "Fifteen fanatics staged a sickening protest – sanctioned by police … they wielded banners branding the soldiers butchers, war criminals, murderers, terrorists – and baby killers"On its leader page, it is, of course, nothing but direct: "The Royal Anglians had to face a chanting mob waving grotesque placards accusing THEM of terrorism and child murder. Astonishingly, this despicable demo went ahead with police approval."When it turned predictably ugly, who did our brave bobbies arrest? Not the extremists who started the trouble, but a couple of locals who rallied to Our Boys' defence."Daily Mail:  Home from war and our troops are greeted by abuse from hate-filled mob of Muslim protestorsSun: Hate for heroes'OUTRIGHT QUACKERY'The peculiar passions of Prince Charles have again raised the ire of the scientific community. This time, he stands accused of "exploiting a gullible public" by adding his name to a herbal detox treatment.Professor Edzard Ernst, said the Duchy Herbals detox tincture, which is available for £10, relied on "superstition and quackery" rather than science.Not holding back, the professor put it like this: "Prince Charles contributes to the ill health of the nation by pretending we can all over-indulge and then take his tincture and be fine again … Prince Charles thus financially exploits a gullible public in a time of financial hardship. This comes from somebody who should know better and from somebody who arguably should not be deluding the nation and contributing to its ill health."The Guardian takes up the story on its page three: "The heir to the throne has always prided himself on his alternative views, establishing himself as something of a royal iconoclast who gives voice to public fears over GM foods and nanotechnology, while pioneering a simpler vision of society based on championing organic agriculture, local produce and traditional architecture."But this time, Prince Charles' embrace of the alternative has led to him being accused of peddling 'outright quackery'."Daily Mail: Prince Charles accused of 'outright quackery' over detox food supplementGuardian: 'Make-believe and outright quackery' – experts verdict on prince's detox potionFUNERAL FOR TSVANGIRAI'S WIFEAs Zimbabwe's prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai laid his wife to rest yesterday following her sudden death in a car accident last week, Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, described her death as an act of God."This is a difficult moment for our colleague," Mugabe said at the memorial service for Susan Tsvangirai. "He has lost a partner and we must rally to support him and lessen his burden … this is the hand of God."To our supporters, we want to say the violence should stop. That's what [Susan Tsvangirai] would have wanted."Guardian: Mugabe says death of PM's wife an act of GodRATVILLE UKFlamborough, a coastal village in Yorkshire, has been identified by the Daily Mail as the "epicentre of Ratville UK" where unlucky residents are apparently becoming too afraid to go out of the house as they are in the midst of a rat plague.Paul Harris, in a special dispatch, reports: "The first thing that spooks you is the noise. It's the rustling, scratching sound of countless tiny feet and at times it's all so intense that the hedgerows are alive with it And then you see them."Rats! Big rats with long, wormy tails … baby rats screaming for their mothers …"But enough of that. The reason for all this? Well there are various theories doing the rounds – including that the town is cursed, and the rat plague will be followed by a swarm of locusts, but the most likely appears to be that the rats thrived on strips of corn left out by a local farmer.Daily Mail:  Ratville UK: fear and loathing rule in a corner of Yorkshire overrun with rodentsSATNAV LAWNMOWERSThe Express and the Telegraph report today that Leicestershire county council is spending £6,000 installing satellite navigation systems to ride-on lawnmowers so their drivers know which patch of grass to catch.Sites that need cutting will be marked on an interactive computerised map, which will then be picked up by contractors using the fleet of 14 mowers.Daily Telegraph: Council spends £6,000 fitting sat navs to lawnmowers
