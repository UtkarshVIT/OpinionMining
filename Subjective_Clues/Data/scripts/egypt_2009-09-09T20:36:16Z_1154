A letter by an Israeli soldier captured near Gaza was published in an Israeli newspaper today, describing his "intolerable nightmare" and appealing to the government to secure his release. The 14-line letter, to family and friends, was written by Gilad Shalit, now 23, in 2006, months after capture by Palestinian militants. He is held by Hamas, which has not let the Red Cross see him. Negotiations to secure his release in return for that of hundreds of Palestinians drag on; prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu is due in Egypt next week to see president Hosni Mubarak over the case.
