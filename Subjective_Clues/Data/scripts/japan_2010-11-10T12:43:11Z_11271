Thousands of Japanese teachers could be sent to the US to develop their English language teaching skills as part of an agreement expected to be signed when US President Barack Obama meets the Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, during a visit to Japan this week.Under plans discussed by the two governments, primary, middle and secondary school teachers at the beginning of their careers would have the opportunity to train in the US for up to two years.But the proposal has highlighted concerns about funding for existing language assistant programmes in Japan. The future of the long-standing Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) programme, which has sponsored more than 50,000 mainly native English speakers to work as language assistants in schools in Japan since 1987, has been put into doubt while a government review is carried out.According to reports in the Daily Yomiuri newspaper, the foreign ministry, which is one of the government departments involved in the programme, has cut its request for JET funding in 2011 by 14% to $1.6m.Boston schools told to retest 15,000 studentsBoston's public schools authority last month agreed to reassess the English language skills of its students and provide additional language support. The settlement with the departments of justice and education follows claims that the authority had breached equal opportunities legislation by failing to properly identify and adequately serve thousands of English language learners (ELLs) since 2003.The city's current superintendent of education conceded that over 15,000 students who had been wrongly assessed as having adequate English skills, who were not submitted for language skills assessment or who were inadequately tested, would be retested and offered additional language classes where necessary.The settlement means that Boston city officials will avoid facing charges in court, but eight other school districts from across the US are facing similar investigations by federal authorities.According to Education Week, federal officials are scrutinising six of the eight, including Los Angeles Unified School District, to establish whether the authorities are "ensuring access to equal educational opportunities" for ELLs.Women golfers get lessons on fairwaysWomen golfers in the US have been offered specialist language training in their breaks between play at major tournaments, to help them communicate with the media and fans. The LPGA, the professional women golfers' organisation in the US, which attracts players from around the world, is providing access to tutoring for its members.In 2008 LPGA officials caused a public outcry after proposing that foreign players should be penalised if they did not learn English. Players from South Korea, who dominate the golf tour, were accused of not making enough effort to engage with the media.The one-to-one tuition, which has been running since the beginning of this year, is aimed at building players' confidence in press conferences and when meeting fans.Indian workers offered speaking skills in SaudiA not-for-profit organisation based in southern India has teamed up with language training provider ELS to offer English classes for expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia.The Centre for Information and Guidance India is promoting the courses, which start in Jeddah later this month, to develop the spoken communication skills of Indian workers in Saudi Arabia.A spokesman for ELS told the Arab News newspaper: "India is emerging as a superpower mainly because of the abundant availability of skilled manpower. Expatriates can achieve greater heights if they master English."Max de Lotbini√®re max.delotbiniere@theguardian.com
