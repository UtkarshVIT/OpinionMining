Snow fell throughout last week, with the southern Alps and Pyrenees benefiting the most. Flaine got 30cm of snow on Wednesday, Val d'Isère and Samoens got 20cm on Thursday. There is excellent powder skiing in Chamonix, La Plagne, Les Arcs and Val Thorens. However this year's heavy snow has come at a cost - 26 people have died in avalanches in the Alps since the new year. Take care. Between 10cm and 20cm of fresh snow fell late last week, with the Innsbruck area and western resorts doing best. St Anton now has an impressive 235cm snow depth at the top, while Ischgl is reporting powder conditions even on-piste.Less snow in Switzerland, although Zermatt did well with around 20cm of new snow on Wednesday. The sun was due to return today after small falls of under 10cm late last week.Some huge falls in the middle of last week - the little resort of Chiesa got 60cm, while the Milky Way resorts got 40cm. Sun is forecast today and early this week.Steady daily falls of 20cm have added up to some huge overall snow depths - Timberline has 368cm at the top. Between 20cm and 30cm more is forecast for the western resorts this weekend. The east coast resorts have good conditions, even if with far less snow than out west. Fabulous conditions in British Columbia - Whistler has 242cm at the top, while Revelstoke has had 48cm in the past week. East coast resorts such as Tremblant and Mont-Sainte-Anne are forecasting up to 30cm this weekend.· Data courtesy of the Ski Club of Great Britain (www.skiclub.co.uk)
