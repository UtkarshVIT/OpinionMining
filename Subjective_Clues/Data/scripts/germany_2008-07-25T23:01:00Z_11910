Bad news from a couple of German insurers sent tremors through their British counterparts yesterday.Reinsurer Munich Re issued a profit warning it blamed on the turmoil in global markets, while smaller rival Hannover Re said if things did not improve it would be hard pushed to meet its financial targets.This soured sentiment in the whole insurance sector. Legal & General finished 7.1p lower at 98.6p, RSA Insurance Group fell 6.5p to 128.8p, Aviva was down 21.5p at 490p, Prudential dropped 20p to 515.5p and Standard Life ended 6.75p lower at 221.25p.A downbeat note from Merrill Lynch before the results season starting next week did not help, nor did news from Lloyd's of London insurer Beazley that first-half profits had fallen by 25% because of the market conditions hitting its investment income.Over at the banks, HBOS ended up 8.75p to 310.25p after reports that JP Morgan was plotting to form a consortium for a break-up bid. But one of the supposed members, National Australia Bank, yesterday unsettled the sector with news of a £400m write-off associated with its exposure to the US mortgage market. So Royal Bank of Scotland lost 4.25p to 215p and HSBC fell 10p to 828p. But Barclays went the other way, adding 8.5p to 356.5p.Oil shares suffered a volatile day as the crude price first edged higher, then fell back by $2 a barrel to below $124 on continuing concerns about falling demand. Tullow Oil, having been as high as 755p, ended up 2p at 727p. Royal Dutch Shell B shares were also off their best, closing 12p better at £18.02. But gas and oil group BG bounced 40p to £11.08 as Credit Suisse raised its price target from £15.60 to £16.00. The bank said: "The damp response of BG shares to [Thursday's] results illustrates the desire of markets for earnings upgrades. Indeed our own forecasts do not increase materially (only +3% in 2010). However, earnings are not the only way to add value in the oil sector. BG hit 15 out of 22 exploration targets in the first half of 2008 and we believe BG may have successfully drilled prospects worth up to 11% of its market cap in this period."Overall, the market was partly rescued by Wall Street, which was up about 50 points by the time London closed. So after falling as low as 5291.4, the FTSE 100 index slipped 9.7 points to 5352.6. There were contrasting fortunes for the British and US economies. Whereas second-quarter UK economic growth slowed to a three-year low, US new home sales and durable goods numbers came in better than expected. Among the mid-caps David Montgomery's publishing group Mecom - which has been on the slide on worries about its debt levels - jumped 3.75p to 23p after reports it had received an unsolicited bid for its Norwegian business. The division, Edda Media, could fetch around £375m, analysts believe. But Rentokil slumped 30.75p to 70.75p as it issued its fourth profit warning in eight months. And Britvic lost 18.25p to 237.25p after saying trading conditions were tough and costs were rising. Its Irish business, which incorporates the business bought last year for £170m from C&C Group, also saw a decline in revenues. Analysts at Citigroup, Britvic's joint broker, said: "Given uncertainties around the outlook for 2009 from input cost pressures, Great Britain and Irish [pub] trading, we believe short-term upside will be capped."But pubs group Mitchells & Butlers added 2.25p to 264.75p as it indicated it had seen a small pick-up in trade over the early months of the summer. Rival Punch Taverns rose 14.5p to 269.5p, also helped by news that hedge fund manager David Einhorn had bought 2m more shares to take his stake to 9.73%.Among the housebuilders, Bellway fell 33.5p to 506p as Panmure Gordon moved from buy to hold. Taylor Wimpey slipped 2.5p to 46p as a report in Building magazine suggested the company may need to raise new cash before it is able to strike a deal with its lenders about waiving banking covenants.Satellite communication group Inmarsat ended 7p higher at 467.5p as 28% shareholder Harbinger, the US hedge fund, unveiled plans to bid for the company, and merge it with its own SkyTerra business. But the deal depends on regulatory approval, and for that reason Harbinger said it could not lay out the exact terms of the proposal. The two sides said this week they had suspended talks because of competition issues, but they were both open to doing a deal.Acambis, best known for its smallpox vaccine, added 1p to 116p. After the market closed the company revealed an agreed £276m takeover from Sanofi-Aventis, the world's third-largest pharmaceutical company.Finally came late news that Mike Lynch, chief executive of Autonomy, had cashed in more than £8m worth of shares. The technology group, which closed up 12p to £10.61 before the announcement was released, said the sale was to meet capital gains tax liabilities.Watch Consort Medical, which dipped 4p to 531p yesterday. Despite the fall, house broker Investec believes the company, formerly known as Bespak, should benefit from this week's $860m takeover of US rival Vital Signs by GE Healthcare. Investec said: "Vital Signs is a direct peer to Consort's King division and the multiple paid would value King at £85m. Applying that multiple to the overall group gives a price of 960p. This deal reaffirms our view that corporates are seeing value in the listed medical technology space, and we reiterate our buy recommendation."nick.fletcher@theguardian.com
