Spain's first female defence minister is back at work – 42 days after having her first baby. Pictures of the pregnant Carme Chacón inspecting the Spanish troops made newspapers all over the world, as she became a symbol for the possibility of equality in politics and evidence of the changing of the guard in once-macho Spain.Chacón didn't take the full four months' maternity leave to which Spanish law entitles her. I was pleased to learn that little Miquel is being looked after by his father, who is taking the rest of Chacón's statutory leave under a recent law from the current socialist government.Back in the parliament, though, Chacón seemed perhaps a shade too keen to demonstrate that she hadn't taken her eye off the troops even during just less than six weeks of sleep-interrupted nights. Spain's victory in Euro 2008 was "mission accomplished", she joked to MPs at the start of her five-hour appearance. She would increase the number of troops from 126,000 to 130,000, introduce new laws on defence – and "in a few weeks" would replace the chief of the armed forces and the heads of the army, the navy and the air force.Although, as Spanish daily El Pais points out, it is not unusual practice for the military chiefs to be replaced after every parliament, in the past the new minister of defence waits until he or she "has had time to get to know the generals and to see who are worthy of belonging to his inner circle".Miguel González, in the generally pro-government El Pais, says Chacón ignored the advice of the prime minister and of her predecessor José Antonio Alonso to keep the chief of the armed forces, Felix Sanz, in post at least for a short while.Clearly, Chacón has her own ideas about the kind of people she wants in charge and her critics are probably (privately) fearing the worst. The trouble with Chacón's speech to parliament, though, was that it wasn't that clear about Chacón's plans for defence. She insisted on the need to give Spanish troops taking part in missions abroad "more flexibility" but left it to her listeners to assume that might mean scrapping current rules which limit the number of Spanish troops abroad to 3,000. Nor did she address thorny questions such as the difficulty of recruiting professional soldiers and marines now that Spain no longer has military service."Nor do we know how our remaining in Kosovo is justified [Spain has not recognised Kosovo as an independent state] nor the point in the medium term of the mission in Afghanistan, consumed to a large extent in tasks of self-protection," added El Pais' Miguel Angel Aguilar.Commentators concluded the aim of Chacón's speech was all about building "consensus" – the current buzzword in Spanish politics with the opposition even prepared to show it can be less antagonistic (and plain nasty) than in the last parliament.The trouble, of course, is that you can't always have consensus in politics – and you certainly can't always have it in decisions involving war and conflict. Chacón is likely to face some tough questions in the weeks ahead.
