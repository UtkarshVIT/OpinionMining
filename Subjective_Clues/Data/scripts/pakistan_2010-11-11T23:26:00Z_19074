Heavily armed militants stormed a police headquarters in central Karachi today firing guns and exploding a bomb that killed at least 16 people.It was the biggest assault on a security target in Pakistan's largest city for several years, rocking a busy area packed with shops, five-star hotels and government buildings. A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility.At least five gunmen attacked the police headquarters, triggering a firefight that lasted several minutes and ended with a car bomb explosion that was felt across the city of 18 million people.The blast destroyed the building, damaged houses and left a crater in the road that was 12 metres (40 feet) wide and three metres deep. The city centre ground to a halt as rescuers pulled bloodied corpses from the rubble and dazed, dust-covered survivors stumbled away."I heard shooting and then I came to the site and there were injured people screaming," bystander Sajid Khan told Reuters.The target was the Criminal Investigation Department, a police unit that investigates sectarian and militant crimes in Karachi.Hours before the blast, CID officers brought to court six members of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Sunni sectarian outfit with links to al-Qaida and the Taliban.The agency is also investigating a Taliban suicide attack on a Sufi shrine last month in which eight people were killed. Its headquarters contains a detention facility for militant and criminal suspects.Claiming responsibility, Azam Tariq, a spokesman for Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, said the attack was in retaliation for US missile strikes in the north-western tribal belt. "Such attacks will continue until drone strikes are stopped," he told Reuters.Karachi has been no stranger to violence this year, the bloodiest period in over a decade due to a spate of political killings, sectarian violence and militant attacks.More than 80 people died in a one-week spate of tit-for-tat killings last month that was triggered by a by-election.By one count, more people have died violently on Karachi streets this year than in Taliban suicide attacks across the country.At the CID headquarters rescuers worked late into the night, sifting through the rubble in search of survivors. Hospitals reported up to 100 injuries and the death toll was expected to rise. There was a widespread sense of trepidation that militant violence, in recent months largely confined to the north-western border regions, was again spilling into the rest of Pakistan."A Muslim cannot do such things. Killing humanity is not the teaching of Islam," said Abdul Sattar Edhi, one of Pakistan's most respected charity workers, at the site of the blast.On Twitter, the reaction ranged from despondency to anger at the US. Calls from Washington to "do more" have irked Pakistanis, who say their country is already paying a high price for fighting militancy.
