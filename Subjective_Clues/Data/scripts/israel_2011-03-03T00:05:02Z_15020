I am afraid that Arthur Goodman's letter on behalf of Jews for Justice for Palestinians (1 March) simply will not do.As someone who has been highly critical of Israeli policies for some time, and sees no evidence at all of a genuine desire to negotiate for a viable Palestinian state on the occupied territories, I nevertheless accept, unlike Mr Goodman, that antisemitism is being used by some speakers at universities and other places. Indeed, going by his comments, one would conclude that antisemitism has almost disappeared, or if it does exist it is all because of Israel.Nearly 2,000 years of poisonous antisemitism culminated, as we know, with the Nazi atrocities, and hardly arose because of a Jewish state. Moreover, postwar tyrannies in Africa and Asia are hardly an excuse for racist, antiâ€‘black attitudes.It is also noticeable that those who write like Mr Goodman never make any mention of blatant anti-Jewish propaganda, particularly in Arab media outlets, where once again a notorious forgery such as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is promoted as being genuine, and the Holocaust is either simply denied or minimised.Extreme defenders of Israel do indeed try to portray criticism of that state as antisemitic, and that is certainly a point worth making. However, organisations such as Jews for Justice for Palestinians need to be careful that they are not viewed by Jews as those farcical groups that over the years have tried, on religious grounds, to convert them to Christianity or some other religion.David Winnick MPLabour, Walsall North
