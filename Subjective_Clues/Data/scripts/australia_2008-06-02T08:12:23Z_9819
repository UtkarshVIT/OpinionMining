Australian troops returning home from combat operations in southern Iraq will be welcomed with an official parade, it was announced today.The country's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, will personally greet the returning soldiers at a ceremony on June 28, when the streets of Brisbane are expected to be lined with well-wishers. The pullout, announced yesterday, fulfils an election promise made by the Labor government to end the Australian military's combat role in Iraq.Soldiers marked the end of their deployment by lowering the Australian flag that had flown over Camp Terendak in the southern Iraqi city of Talil.The defence minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, said the withdrawal "closed anotherchapter in a strong and proud Australian military history". The 550 members of the Overwatch Battle Group, who have been operating in al-Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces, should be proud of what they had achieved, he added.Australian troops had protected engineers carrying out reconstruction work, contributed to the training of 33,000 Iraqi soldiers and police and mentored Iraqis involved in counterinsurgency operations, he said."Our soldiers have worked tirelessly to ensure that local people in southern Iraq have the best possible chance to move on from their suffering under Saddam's regime."He also described the decision to pull the troops out of Iraq as overdue, saying the country's military had become overstretched by its commitments in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq.The Australians are being replaced by Iraqi and US soldiers.Major General Bill Crews, the national head of the Returned Services League, said he expected a huge turnout to welcome the troops home."I believe we're able, or most of us are able, to separate the politics of the deployment from the need to wholeheartedly support the service men and women who undertook this role on our behalf," he said.Australia, a staunch US ally, was one of the first countries to commit troops to the Iraq war five years ago.Rudd has said that the deployment made Australia more of a target for terrorism, but his predecessor, John Howard, has defended his decision. "I firmly believe it was the right thing to have done," he told the Sydney Morning Herald. "If I had been returned at the last election we would not have been bringing them home, we would have been looking at transitioning them from their soon-to-be terminated role to a training role."Some 300 troops will stay in Baghdad to help guard Australian diplomats. A further 500 will remain in the region, including 200 sailors aboard the frigate HMAS Stuart in the Persian Gulf.No Australian soldiers were killed in combat in Iraq, although six were wounded by roadside bombs.
