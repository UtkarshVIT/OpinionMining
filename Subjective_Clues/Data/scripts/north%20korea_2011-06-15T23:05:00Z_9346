There are various iconic images in the Highlands such as the golden eagle, salmon and red deer stags. While these may be elusive there is another that is more readily seen â€“ the bottlenose dolphins of the Moray Firth. These dolphins are the only resident population in the north of Britain and can be seen in various ways. One is to find a vantage point such as Chanonry Point on the Black Isle, a popular place since the publicity on the BBC's Springwatch and Autumnwatch TV programmes. Another way is take one of the many boat trips out from such places as Inverness, Avoch and Cromarty.Last week I chose perhaps an even easier way and visited the dolphin and seal centre at North Kessock, based on the north shore of the Beauly Firth. There is one advantage in this centre in that if you do not actually see any dolphins you can watch a video of them taken at Chanonry Point, or listen to their strange noises via hydrophones. The centre is dominated by its panorama window that overlooks the firth: it provides binoculars to watch the seals and dolphins in the sea below. The noticeboard outside, regularly updated by the attendant, informed me that earlier that day two dolphins had been seen from the centre.Fascinatingly, many of the dolphins have been given names as they can be individually identified by characteristics, especially the shape and colour of their fins. This recognition, backed by photographs, is an invaluable aid to the close studies of this population. The video of the Chanonry Point dolphins was mesmerising as they frolicked and leapt out of the water. On the other side of the firth from the centre the underwater hydrophone is situated in the area they feed and pass through the most, and the sound of their clicking and whistling seems to sum up their enigmatic life in the firths.
