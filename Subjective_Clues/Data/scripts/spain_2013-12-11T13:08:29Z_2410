A Spanish judge has taken Ryanair to task for sexism, ordering the low-cost airline to drop an advertising campaign for its annual Girls of Ryanair calendar.The racy calendar, which shows female cabin crew stripped down to bikinis, landed the airline in court in Malaga after a Spanish consumer group lodged a formal complaint.The judge Amanda Cohen ruled on Tuesday that both the calendar and a web campaign to promote it broke advertising laws in Spain as they used the "female body as a mere object" to capture attention.Cohen said there was an "absolute disconnection between the image used and the product being promoted", and the campaign was "illegal, discriminatory and unfair". Members of the cabin crew were shown in a "sexually suggestive manner", she said. She ordered the company to publish the judgment in two national newspapers at its own cost.The Girls of Ryanair calendar has been running since 2008. Sold at a cost of £10 in the UK or €10 in the eurozone, it has raised more than €600,000 for various charities over the years. Proceeds from the 2014 edition, shot in Crete, will go to the UK-based Teenage Cancer Trust.Cohen praised Ryanair for its "laudable charity work" but said it was clear the calendar was being used as a marketing tool to sell airline tickets.The ruling comes after five years of complaints by various consumer and women's groups in Spain. The latest complaint, lodged by the consumer group Adecua, claimed the calendar used "sexual connotations" to advertise and called for it to be banned.A Ryanair spokesperson, Robin Kiely, said the airline planned to appeal against the ruling. He said the 2013 calendar that provoked the complaint had raised more than €100,000 for the TVN Foundation, a Polish charity that works with sick children.He added that the case related to specific adverts run in November and December 2012, and had "no effect on Ryanair's continuing charity work or our current 2014 cabin crew charity calendar".This month the company announced record sales for its 2014 calendar, with more than 9,000 copies sold in six weeks.
