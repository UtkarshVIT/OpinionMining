A British woman who has been imprisoned for the last year on charges of killing her newborn son in a holiday apartment on Crete has been released from prison.Leah Andrew, 21, was told she was free to return to the UK after a court acquitted her of murder in a case that has gripped Greece.Andrew's lawyer, Zoe Lama, said her client would be able to leave the country in the next few days once paperwork was completed in Athens. The fact that she was well behaved in prison and learned to speak Greek played a role in the court's decision.The mother-of-two from south London had been charged with stifling the baby boy after giving birth, unassisted, while on holiday in Malia on Crete.Three out of four judges, convening on the island, voted to clear her of murder. Two previous appeals for her release had been unanimously rejected by magistrates citing a coroner's assessment that the baby had been deliberately suffocated.As the verdict was announced, the student burst into tears, hugged her parents, Isaac and Pamela, and sobbed: "I never killed my baby, I never killed my baby."During a package tour holiday last July, Andrew, who had hidden her pregnancy from friends and family, went into labour after returning to her apartment alone.She was discovered by her sister, Lydia, lying in a pool of blood on the floor with the baby swaddled in a large knotted sheet beside her. She claimed she had wrapped him in the sheet, assuming he was stillborn after he failed to move or cry.
