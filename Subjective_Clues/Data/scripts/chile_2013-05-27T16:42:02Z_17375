Waitrose is to start supplying some of its most popular food and drink products to Chile.The supermarket hopes the Chilean public will take to English breakfast tea, biscuits and truffles, as it offers more than 40 lines to over 100 shops in Unimarc supermarkets.Waitrose said it will start shifting European favourites such as penne pasta, mayonnaise made with extra virgin olive oil and stuffed olives, as international sales increased 20% last year.David Morton, Waitrose's business-to-business director, said: "South America, in particular Chile, has a growing economy and we were approached by Unimarc to help meet the demand for more cosmopolitan flavours among their customers."He added: "Wherever we sell our products overseas, we find the bestsellers are food and drink associated with Britain, such as tea and biscuits."Waitrose may well be on the lookout for new partners, after it was revealed earlier this month that relations with Ocado had broken down after the online groceries delivery firm announced a new partnership with rival Morrisons.The company first started exporting its products in 1996 and now has a presence in 46 countries worldwide including Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand and India.
