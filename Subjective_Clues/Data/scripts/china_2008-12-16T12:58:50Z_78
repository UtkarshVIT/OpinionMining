Chinese government officials have defended their decision to block several foreign news websites, including the BBC, as the country moves away from its pledge for uncensored internet access during the Beijing Olympics.The BBC, Voice of America, Hong Kong's Ming Pao News and Asiaweek have all had their websites blocked in China since early December. Restrictions had previously been lifted in August, when foreign journalists demanded full access during the Olympics.China's foreign ministry said today that it was within its rights to block sites that showed content illegal under the country's law. A foreign ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao, said the Chinese government "could not deny" that it had issues with some sites."For instance, if a website refers to 'two Chinas' or refers to mainland China and Taiwan as two independent regions, we believe that violates China's anti-secession law, as well as other laws," Liu added."We hope that the relevant websites can comply with China's concerns and not do things contrary to Chinese law. This will help establish good co-operation between China and the relevant countries, as well as China and the relevant websites."China has previously blocked several high-profile websites but has not acknowledged an official ban, preferring to show users an error message for those sites instead.Access to the BBC's English-language site was briefly lifted in March, although the Chinese-language site remained blocked.A BBC spokeswoman said: "We are disappointed that Chinese-speaking audiences in China are not able to get access to the BBC's impartial and editorially independent news and information through BBCChinese.com. In the runup to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Chinese residents were able to have some access to BBCChinese.com but now there seem to be more difficulties in viewing the site. We will endeavour to continue working with the Chinese authorities to improve access for our Chinese-speaking audiences in China."Chinese authorities are understood to be far stricter with the Mandarin-language version of the BBC website at BBCChinese.com, which saw only slightly loosened restrictions during the Olympics. Both the BBC's Mandarin radio broadcasts and Mandarin-language site have been subject to restrictions, the latter for most of its 10-year existence.Online content is understood to be filtered by subject to web users in China, so news about Tibet or Chinese politics is censored."We're not surprised at this behaviour from the Chinese government," said a spokesman for the press freedom group Reporters Sans Frontières. "The figures for Chinese control of the web are appalling. We were trying to raise awareness of this during the Olympics and even then it was very difficult to gain access to some sites, let alone for journalists travelling in China."The Foreign Correspondents Club of China said it had recorded 177 cases of journalists being obstructed in their work since the start of 2008, including Christian Science Monitor reporter Peter Ford being arrested after covering a Protestant prayer meeting in Henan province.RSF ranks China 167th out of the world's 173 countries for its record on press freedom. Only Vietnam, Cuba, Burma, Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea rank lower.China recently overtook the US as the world's biggest internet market with an estimated 253 million web users, according to Internet World Stats.• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
