The Kinoteka Polish Film Festiwal (sic) has chosen its eighth annual incarnation in the UK for a retrospective dedicated to the country's most famous, and controversial, film-maker, Roman Polanski.Timed to coincide with the release of his latest film, The Ghost Writer, Kinoteka will show a season of Polanski's short films, as well as early works in which he collaborated with the composer and jazz pianist Krzysztof Komeda. As Polanski is still under house arrest in Switzerland, the festival is facing the controversy head-on: it will lead the Polanski segment with a screening of Marina Zenovich's 2008 documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, which "challenges many of the myths which have built up" around the director's case. The films run in conjunction with an exhibition of rare Polanski film posters from across the globe.Other highlights of the festival include Borys Lankosz's Reverse, Poland's submission for the best foreign language film Oscar; and Snow White, Russian Red, adapted from the eponymous novel by Dorota Masłowska. A portrait of the drug-fuelled excesses of Poland's post-communist youth, this "Trainspotting of Poland" made Masłowska a literary star before the age of 21, so it will be interesting to see whether the film enjoys anything like the success of Danny Boyle's 1996 sensation.Multiple Oscar nominee Andrzej Wajda has thrown in his hat with Sweet Rush, about a middle-aged woman dating a much younger man. There are also archival documentaries by Krzysztof Kieslowski; a new film from animation pioneers the Quay Brothers based on Stanisław Lem's short story The Mask; and a gala concert performance of Komeda's music led by jazz trumpeter Tomasz Stanko. And there is the 2010 Oscar-nominated Rabbit à la Berlin, a short documentary on the wild bunnies that once thrived in the "death zone" between the inner and outer sections of the Berlin Wall. One imagines 1989 was to the rabbits as Homer Simpson was to the ant colony he smashed: "Freedom! Horrible, horrible freedom!"The festival runs from 4 March to 13 April in various locations around London. Details: www.kinoteka.org.uk
