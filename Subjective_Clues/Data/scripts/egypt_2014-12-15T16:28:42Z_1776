A prominent American political analyst has been denied entry to Egypt and deported, in an escalation of the government’s crackdown on political opposition that has been interpreted as a warning to foreign critics of its policies.In a separate development, the authorities sent 439 civilians to military trial in a single stroke, making use of new legislation that gives the country’s powerful army jurisdiction over large parts of the civil infrastructure.Michele Dunne, a former American diplomat and a senior analyst at the US-based Carnegie thinktank, was stopped on arrival in Cairo on Friday night, detained for several hours, and deported the following day. A frequent visitor to Egypt, Dunne has been a vocal critic of the current Egyptian regime’s authoritarian turn – which has seen at least 16,000 political prisoners detained according to the police’s own figures – and it is suspected that her own detention was prompted by her uncompromising stance.Several Egyptian scholars have been targeted under the crackdown, including the politics professors Amr Hamzawy and Emad Shahin, while the head of Human Rights Watch, Ken Roth, was refused entry to Egypt in August. But Dunne’s deportation is thought to be Egypt’s first move against a western-based academic in recent memory.Incongruously, Dunne had travelled to Egypt to take part in a debate with pro-regime figures, including current and former government officials. Other analysts said that her treatment would deter similar engagement from Middle East specialists in the future, and risked bolstering rather than discrediting Dunne’s arguments.“The barring of Ms Dunne will empower her argument that the authorities in Egypt cannot tolerate opposing views,” wrote Nervana Mahmoud, another commentator on Egyptian politics.The analyst HA Hellyer suggested academics might now think twice about studying and commenting upon Egyptian politics. “The ban on her entry,” he wrote, “will be interpreted in very stark terms – that even if you are impartial or independent in your critique, the price of your disagreement may be phenomenally disproportionate to any perceived damage you might be accused of causing.”Egypt’s foreign ministry denied that Dunne had been refused entry for political reasons, and said she should not have tried to enter on a tourist visa, the standard means of entering Egypt.Separately, prosecutors on Monday referred 439 civilians to military courts for their alleged involvement in riots that took place in August 2013. The decision is permitted under new legislation that gives the army the right to try civilians accused of crimes that take place in most public spaces, including roads. But concerns have been raised since the alleged crimes took place 14 months before the legislation was enacted. Critics of military trials say that their procedures lack transparency and oversight.
