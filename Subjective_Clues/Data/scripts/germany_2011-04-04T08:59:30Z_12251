The King's Speech has become a surprise smash in Germany, where it has been the No 1 film at the box office for weeks.Tom Hooper's Oscar-winning film centres on the battle of Colin Firth's King George VI to overcome a debilitating stammer as Britain faces the imminent prospect of war with the Third Reich. The film also examines the abdication of Edward VIII, a well-known Nazi sympathiser who was seen as such a security risk that he was sent to the Bahamas with new wife Wallis Simpson for the duration of the conflict.However, Peter Heinzemann, managing director of the film's German distributor Senator Film Verleih, said Germans were more interested in the story of personal triumph at the heart of The King's Speech than its historical content. He also cited the film's Oscars success – it took four Academy Awards last month – as a defining factor in the drama's lure for cinemagoers."The great success of the film lies, in my opinion, in the terrific and emotional story more than anything else," Heinzemann told Variety. "Audiences can identify with this heir to the throne because this admired and respected person suffers like anyone else from an impediment."Hooper's film has so far taken $17.3m (£10.7m), to add to a spectacular total of $374m worldwide, a remarkable figure for an independent British film with a budget of just $15m. Had it been released in January, rather than the tail end of December in the US, it would currently be the highest grossing film of 2011 worldwide, easily outperforming The Green Hornet's $227m. In terms of British films, only 2008's Abba-themed Mamma Mia! has made more money in recent years. The King's Speech is about to surpass the $374m taken by Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, the last UK film to win big at the Oscars.
