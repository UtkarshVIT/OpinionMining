Google's now infamous Street View camera cars only set to work on the streets of Bangalore last month, but already Indian authorities have ordered Google to suspend taking images because it has not secured the necessary security clearance.Google has said that after Bangalore, it plans to map all major cities in India â€“ the 27th country in which the firm plans to launch Street View. As well as cars, Google had been using some tricycles with Street View's chunky camera equipment attached.Local police were concerned that Bangalore has several military institutions, and a statement given by Google to the AFP confirmed that Google had suspended the operation following a letter from Bangalore's police commissioner.Street View concerns in developing countries are significantly different to obstacles Google has hit recently in Germany and Switzerland, which were about privacy and data retention. Street View Brazil reportedly snapped dead bodies, while in India there are also sensitivities in the wake of the Mumbai attacks and from several bombings in Bangalore itself.
