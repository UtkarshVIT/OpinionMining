Artist Georgia O’Keeffe spent part of her year in New Mexico. Green chile, or chile verde, is either a sauce or stew made with local Hatch peppers. O’Keeffe liked hers with eggs and garlic oil.Serves twoChar 800g green peppers over a flame until black all over, then seal in a sandwich bag until cool. Remove skins, seeds and pith; finely chop the flesh. Finely chop one onion and two cloves of garlic; soften in a tablespoon of olive oil with a pinch of salt. When translucent, stir in a tomato and half a green chilli (or to taste), both deseeded and finely chopped; add half a teaspoon each of ground coriander, cumin seeds and oregano, and a tablespoon of flour. Cook for two minutes, then add 300ml stock. To use as a sauce, season; to make a stew, add 400g diced, browned pork shoulder and a little water, cover and simmer for two hours, until tender. Serve with coriander and/ or fried eggs.
