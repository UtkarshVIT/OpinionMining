The UK jobs market is an unwelcoming prospect for students preparing to graduate this summer, which is one reason why many are planning to spend the coming year travelling and working in Canada. The Canadian High Commission has just released 5,350 places for this year's International Experience Canada (IEC) working holiday initiative and it has already received an unprecedented number of applications.The chief attraction is that, unlike in Britain, there are plenty of jobs available in Canada for those prepared to be flexible. "There is a big call for skilled labour in hospitality and construction in the western provinces, Alberta and British Colombia and in Toronto and the ski resorts," says Gordon Campbell, Canada's High commissioner to the UK. "We are one of the economies in the western world that is currently very strong."Fiona Brown spent a year in Toronto after graduating with an English and History degree from Edinburgh and says that the experience determined her career path.She says: "I was unsure what career I wanted so decided to take a year out and hopefully get a sense of direction."After a few weeks of temping with an agency she found a permanent £7-an-hour job in a bookshop and volunteered with a charity that supports isolated older people."I was matched with a woman who has cerebral palsy and enjoyed the regular visits so much that I applied to do an MA in social work at Warwick University," Brown adds.She organised her trip through the overseas work specialist BUNAC which, for a £254 fee, helps applicants obtain visas and assists with flights, accommodation, job hunting and general support throughout their year there. "We have two resource centres in Toronto and Vancouver which help people search for jobs and we issue a handbook beforehand and an orientation course on arrival which give advice on living and working in Canada," says marketing manager Holly Brooks."People can choose to fly out with a group of other people on the Work Canada programme so they can get to know each other, they can be accommodated together in the hostels we use and we organise social events to help them make friends once they're there."Those hoping to launch themselves as high fliers in the Canadian financial sector may be disappointed. The IEC visas are for a year only and geared towards more casual work combined with travel. "Jobs in retail are the easiest to get, although there is demand for more high skilled people," says Brooks. "So long as you're flexible about what kind of work you'll accept, it's unlikely that you won't find a job within the first three weeks."This year's increased demand means that visa applications to the Canadian High Commission may take longer than the usual eight weeks to process.When Fiona Brown completes her MA this summer she intends to apply for a work visa and return to Canada for good.She says: "I love the whole lifestyle there. Everyone is so friendly and they're fascinated by the British accent which made me stand out in the group interview for the bookshop job."I went out there because I thought it would be an adventure, but that year gave me a sense of my future."
