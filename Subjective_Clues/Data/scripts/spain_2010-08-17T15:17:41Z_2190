Spain has become the latest country to launch an investigation into data collected by Google's Street View mapping cars.A Google representative will appear before a judge in Madrid, Raquel Fernandino, on 4 October.Google has admitted to collecting fragments of personal data through Wi-Fi networks when its Street View cars mapped various towns and cities in 34 countries around the world.In May this year, Alan Eustace, a senior vice president in engineering and research at the Mountain View company, said Street View cars had been "mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open Wi-Fi networks, even though we never used that data in any Google products".A string of code in the production systems of Street View cars allowed Google to retrieve and store information about the networks' location, names and Media Access Control (MAC) addresses on wireless networks that were not password-protected.The Madrid lawsuit, filed by an association promoting the rights of internet users, Apedanica, is made under an article of the Spanish penal code relating to the interception of communications without permission.A Google spokeswoman told Spanish daily newpaper El Mundo that the company is cooperating "in all countries with institutions and judicial authorities to answer any questions they have". "Our ultimate goal is to remove the data in accordance with our legal obligations and in consultation with the relevant authorities."Last week police officers in South Korea raided Google's Seoul headquarters, seizing computers and hard drives, as the country's authorities investigate the data collected by Street View cars.The UK's information commissioner set something of a precedent last month, saying that an investigation by the commissioner's office had found that Google is unlikely to have collected "significant amounts of personal data", and that there is "no evidence as yet that the data captured by Google has caused or could cause any individual detriment".The UK is one of many countries where the Wi-Fi data – amounting to 600MB – is being investigated.
