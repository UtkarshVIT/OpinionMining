On some nights, one news bulletin will include footage of another, like Magritte's receding images. Generally it's archive material, so the contemporary coverage of an official inquiry into a massacre, train crash or shooting will be introduced along with a snippet of the news as it was broken long ago. And there's often a poignancy in this, because we're seeing the same presenter looking impossibly young, or a semi-forgotten colleague.On other occasions, the footage is only hours or minutes old, showing how the death of Michael Jackson or the plight of Chilean miners is being reported in the story's home location or around the world. But, in one instance, which happened again this week, the sampling of another broadcast has a different, almost subliminal function: to make viewers feel grateful and relieved for the bulletin we're watching.John Simpson's report on the political reshuffle in North Korea in Tuesday night's BBC1 News featured – as did several US reports – a screen grab of the nation's state TV announcing the changes. Ri Chun Hee, North Korea's Fiona Bruce, sat in a pink kimono before an orange and brown backdrop and beamed the news with the pride of a parent announcing a birth.In western democracies, the news services are obsessed with projecting authority – quasi-presidential anchors – but North Korean TV has authority to spare and so seeks to lessen it. The vivid colour schemes make us think of children's telly – appropriately, because this is current affairs with the bad news left out – while the absence of a video screen behind the anchor, reminds us that North Korea's television service is unusual in proceeding largely without pictures, for security reasons.We are being invited to laugh and to contrast. And yet, seeing these clips embedded within Fox News, with its hysterical host screeching that "the fate of the whole planet" could hinge on the family gavotte, reminds us that free news has its own idiocies. While UK viewers might reflect that Korean TV is ahead of us in having a woman as main nightly news anchor.
