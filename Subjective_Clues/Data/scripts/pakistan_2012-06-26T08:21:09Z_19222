Gunmen opened fire yesterday on the offices of a Pakistani television station, Aaj TV, in Karachi. Two guards were injured.A spokesman for the Tehrik-e-Taliban, a militant Islamist group, claimed responsibility, saying it was angry that it did not receive the same amount of coverage on the station as that given to the government and army. The group also said that the attacks would continue if Aaj TV, a private Urdu-language outlet, did not offer it more coverage. One of the station's anchors, Wajahat Khan, told the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) that Aaj doesn't intend to alter its coverage.Pakistan was ranked as the most dangerous country in the world for journalists in 2010 and 2011, according to CPJ research. Last month, two journalists were killed, two others shot and wounded, and another attacked in police custody.Source: CPJ
