Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet approved a €50bn (£46.7bn) stimulus package today, the biggest programme in Europe, to tackle overcome the country's deepest economic crisis since the second world war.The package will require a new borrowing level of €36.8bn, more than twice the amount planned for 2009 before the impact of the global crisis on Europe's largest economy was realised. It is also more than three times the amount forecast in the middle of last year. A controversial draft supplementary budget is planned to cover the leap in borrowing.The programme is equivalent to 1.6% of gross domestic product, and is the biggest of its kind in German history. In the UK, the government unveiled fiscal stimulus measures totalling some £20bn in last year's pre-budget report.The German package includes €17.3bn of investment in the country's infrastructure, as well as tax cuts, a one-off €100 child bonus, and an increase in some social benefits. A boost to the car industry in the form of an "old banger bounty" will offer people the chance to trade in cars more than nine years old and to receive a €2,500 bonus towards a new or slightly used car.The car industry has been one of the worst hit as exports, particularly to the US, have tumbled, causing a record slump in German manufacturing orders.Peer Steinbrück, the finance minister, came under attack for the package, which some experts estimated would cause national debt to rise in real terms to as much as €74.3bn."Steinbrück is the minister of record debt," said Otto Fricke of the pro-business, liberal Free Democrats.Some small comfort was taken today at news from the federal statistics office which showed that, despite the crisis, Germany remained slightly ahead of China as the world's largest exporter. And business confidence unexpectedly rose this month based on the news of the package, according to German business mood barometer the Ifo Index, which polled 7,000 firms.The International Monetary Fund expects the German economy to contract by 2.5% this year.
