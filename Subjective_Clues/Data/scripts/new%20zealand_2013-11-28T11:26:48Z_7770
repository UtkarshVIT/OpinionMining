Sainsbury's has admitted misleading shoppers by selling jellied eels on its fish counters as "British" when they actually came from New Zealand.The supermarket owned up after the Angling Trust, which represents the UK's anglers, complained that shoppers were being misled.Justin King, chief executive of Sainsbury's wrote to the trust to admit the mistake and promised to rectify in-store labelling, which saw the jellied eels sold under a large sign saying "from sustainable sources from around the British Isles". He said: "As a result of your communication we will ensure communications at our store fish counters are as clear as possible."Eel numbers in British waters have plummeted in recent years and the trust said food should be properly labelled so shoppers can make "informed decisions".Jellied eels were once staple fare for working-class Londoners and a popular snack from shellfish stalls. After a sales slump in the 1990s, they are now being revived by supermarkets across the UK as consumers seek cheap and nutritious food.Over the last two years sales at Tesco have grown by 35% and last year the supermarket chain took a gamble by putting jellied eels on sale outside of London for the first time, including Scotland and Northern Ireland. It now sells jellied eels in nearly 300 of its stores across the UK. Its supplier Bradley's, which only sources British eels also provides eels for 150 Morrisons stores, and Sainsbury's.The European eel has been a recognised endangered species since 2010 and anglers are required by law to return any that they catch using rod and line. Only last week, the International Council for Exploration of the Seas (ICES) issued its latest report on eel stocks: "The status of eel remains critical and urgent action is needed. ICES advises that all anthropogenic mortality (eg recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to as close to zero as possible, until there is clear evidence of sustained increase in both recruitment and the adult stock."Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, said: "We welcome Sainsbury's admission and hope it will take a careful look at the source of all its fish and how it's marketed. Provenance is very important to customers and we should be able to trust supermarkets to be absolutely precise about how food is labelled so that we can take informed decisions."A spokesman for Sainsbury's said more than 60% of its fish was sourced from the UK.
