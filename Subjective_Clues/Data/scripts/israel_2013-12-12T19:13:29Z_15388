The Israeli government has shelved a plan to forcibly relocate tens of thousands of Bedouin Arabs from their ancestral lands to government designated towns.The proposal had prompted widespread protests in Israel and Palestine, and attracted international criticism.The decision to halt the progress of the legislation before the Israeli parliament, followed the disclosure this week by one of the plan's architects that the Bedouin had never been properly consulted nor agreed to the move."I didn't tell anyone that the Bedouin agreed to my plan. I couldn't say that because I didn't present the plan to them," said the former minister Benny Begin.Under the bill, which had been expected to clear parliament by the end of this year, about 40,000 Bedouin Arabs – who are Israeli citizens – were to be forcibly moved from their "unrecognised" villages in the Negev desert into overcrowded, impoverished, towns.It was unclear whether the proposal had been dropped, or whether it would be presented again in a new form."The government now has an opportunity to conduct real and honest dialogue with the Negev Bedouin community and its representatives," said the Association of Civil Rights in Israel in a statement. "The Negev Bedouin seek a solution to the problem of the unrecognised villages, and a future in Israel as citizens with equal rights."
