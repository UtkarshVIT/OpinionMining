Two Ukranian boxing brothers have teamed up with Sylvester Stallone to stage a musical version of Rocky in Hamburg, Germany.Stallone said he had long thought that a musical transfer for the 1976 Oscar-winning drama was a good idea, in particular if its romantic side was amped up. "At the end of the day, Rocky is a love story and he could never have reached the final bell without Adrian. To see this story coming to life on a musical stage makes me proud. And it would make Rocky proud."Numbers which will move from the film to the stage version include Eye of the Tiger and Gonna Fly Now, although it's not clear whether they will be translated into German, the language in which the musical has been written. Gonna Fly Now, the main theme tune, was written by Bill Conti, who composed the bulk of the soundtrack, and made the No 1 spot on the US Billboard list for one week in 1977.Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko will co-produce the musical along with Stallone and train the lead actor, who has not yet been cast. Stallone, whose career was launched by Rocky, and who has previously sung in films such as Rhinestone, is unlikely to be cast himself.The brothers, whose own story has been committed to film, told how they had been fans of the film as children."Seeing Sylvester Stallone in Rocky when we were kids actually was the reason for us to start boxing in the first place, he said. "We are very excited to support this theatrical project."The musical will open in November 2012.
