Pressure is building on Indian officials to delay the hanging of a convicted Sikh militant scheduled for Saturday.The execution of Balwant Singh Rajoana, who was found guilty of playing a key role in the assassination of the chief minister of the north-western Punjab state in 1995, would be the first time a capital sentence has been carried out in India for eight years.This week a court in the Punjab state capital, Chandigarh, rejected an appeal by the director of the jail where Rajoana is being held.Rajoana was convicted in 2007 after an 11-year trial and has refused to plead for clemency, although co-conspirators have successfully appealed against their sentences.The current chief minister of the Punjab is due to see India's president, Pratibha Patil, on Wednesday night to ask for clemency on Rajoana's behalf.In many towns in the Punjab, one of the wealthiest parts of India, traders and businesses observed a one-day strike on Wednesday called by Sikh organisations in protest at the planned execution.Some groups have called Rajaona a "living Sikh martyr", and there are fears the execution could reopen old wounds."The death penalty is always wrong and the Indian government should immediately stop this execution," said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch."Executing Rajoana would merely continue the cycle of killing and retribution between the Sikh community and the Indian state that has long divided communities."The Punjab was the scene of years of bloody violence in the 1980s by militants who wanted to establish a separate Sikh state. Many Sikhs were incensed by the prime minister Indira Gandhi's handling of the 1984 occupation of the Golden Temple in Amritsar by Sikh militants.When Gandhi was killed by her Sikh bodyguards within six months of the bloody operation to recapture the holy site, thousands of Sikhs died in riots. A fierce insurgency lasted into the 1990s.Tens of thousands of security personnel have been deployed around the Punjab in recent days to maintain order.Although Indian courts still occasionally pass death sentences, few are implemented. Ajmal Kasab, the only survivor of the team of Islamist militant gunmen who killed more than 150 people in an attack in Mumbai in 2008, is currently on death row, as is the alleged mastermind of an attack on the Indian parliament in 2001.Rajoana's role in the 1995 killing of Beant Singh, the chief minister of the Punjab, was as a backup suicide bomber. Singh died with 16 others when a member of the Babbar Khalsa militant group blew himself up outside a government office.Legal experts say there is still a strong possibility that Saturday's execution will be postponed due to the ongoing appeals of others implicated in the attack and the apparent opposition of the state government.
