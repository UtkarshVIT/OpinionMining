Germany, Europe's economic powerhouse, is rapidly losing steam, with the country's central bank slashing its growth forecasts for this year and next.The Bundesbank lowered its growth forecast for this year to 0.7% from the 1% it predicted in June. It cut its 2013 prediction even more sharply, to 0.4% from 1.6%, but is expecting growth to bounce back to 1.9% in 2014.The news shocked markets on Friday morning. "Investors have become accustomed to continuing woes in the eurozone periphery but Germany, Europe's largest economy, is considered the backbone of the shared currency zone and was previously viewed as the beacon of stability," said Lee McDarby of Investec.The eurozone remains mired in recession and the Bundesbank's revisions came a day after the European Central Bank said it expected that to continue next year, cutting its 2013 forecast for the 17-nation bloc from 0.5% growth to a 0.3% decline.Germany's export-driven economy has been slowing amid falling orders from the eurozone. New figures showed on Friday that industrial production in Germany crashed by 2.6% in October. This meant that a contraction of its economy in the fourth quarter had become almost inevitable, economists said."Even a technical recession of two consecutive quarters cannot be excluded entirely, particularly if the fiscal cliff negotiations in the US disappoint and hamper the US recovery," said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. "Looking beyond the next one or two quarters, however, the German economy should be able to pick up speed relatively quickly."
