As economists, we note that the historical evidence demonstrates the futility and dangers of imposing unsustainable debt and repayment conditions on debtor countries; the negative impact of austerity policies on weakening economies; and the particularly severe effects that flow on to the poorest households.We therefore urge the troika (EU, European Centra Bank and IMF) to negotiate in good faith with the Greek government so that there is a cancellation of a large part of the debt and new terms of payment which support the rebuilding of a sustainable economy. This settlement should mark the beginning of a new EU-wide policy framework favouring pro-growth rather than deflationary policies (Report, 14 January).We urge the Greek government to abandon the austerity programme that is crushing economic activity and adopt a more expansive fiscal policy setting, targeting immediate relief from poverty and stimulating further domestic demand; to launch a fully independent investigation into the historic and systemic failure of the Greek public financial management processes (including any evidence of corruption) that led to the accumulation of debt, the disguising of the size and nature of the debt and the inefficient/ineffective use of public funds; and to consider the establishment of a judicial body or alternative mechanism that is independent of government and charged with a future responsibility of investigating corruption from the highest to lowest levels of government.We urge other national governments to exercise their votes within official sector finance agencies and to pursue other diplomatic activities that will support a cancellation of a large part of the Greek sovereign debt and new terms of payment for the rebuilding of a sustainable Greek national economy.Malcolm Sawyer Emeritus prof, University of LeedsDanny Lang Associate prof, University of ParisProf Yu Bin Professor and deputy director, Chinese Academy of Social SciencesProf Ozlem Onaran University of GreenwichProf Mario Seccareccia University of OttawaHugo Radice Life fellow, University of LeedsJohn Weeks Professor emeritus, Soas, University of LondonProf Howard Stein University of Michigan, Ann ArborAnitra Nelson Associate professor, RMIT University, MelbourneProf George Irvin University of London, SoasDr John Simister Manchester Metropolitan UniversityMogens Ove Madsen Associate professor, Aalborg UniversityWang Zhongbao Associate professor, editorial director, World Review of Political Economy Dr Susan Pashkoff EconomistAndrea Fumagalli University of PaviaPat Devine University of ManchesterProfessor Ray Kinsella University College DublinAlan Freeman Co-director, Geopolitical Economy Research and Education TrustEugénia Pires Economist, member, Portuguese Citizens Debt AuditDr Jo Michell University of the West of England, BristolMichael Burke Economist, Socialist Economic BulletinPaul Hudson Formerly Universität Wissemburg-HalleDr Alan B Cibils Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento, Buenos Aires, ArgentinaGuglielmo Forges Davanzati Associate prof, University of SalentoProf Sergio Rossi University of FribourgFaruk Ulgen Associate prof, University of GrenobleTim Delap Positive MoneyEleni Paliginis Middlesex UniversityGrazia Ietto-Gillies Emeritus professor, London South Bank UniversityProfessor Radhika Desai University of ManitobaMichael Roberts Economist, ‘The next recession’Michael Taft Unite the Union, Ireland region Dr Andy Denis City University LondonPeter Kenyon ChartistProfessor Emeritus Geoffrey Colin Harcourt UNSW Business School
