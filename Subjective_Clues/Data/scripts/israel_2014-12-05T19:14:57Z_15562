It’s not at all self-evident that linking Jews with sharpness about money constitutes antisemitism, let alone racism (Antisemitism is racism and merits equal contempt, 3 December). A character in the film Kes was accused of “throwing his money about like a Scotsman with no arms”. This kind of stereotyping – Italians with cowardice, Irish with stupidity, French with licentiousness, Americans with cultural shallowness, English with snobbery or emotional constipation – is mostly associated with rather coarse or lazy habits of mind, but it isn’t generally called antiScotsism, antiItalianism, or antiIrishism etc.It isn’t always very nice, perhaps, but shouldn’t we at least equally challenge any assumption that generalisations about cultural differences between peoples and nations are always wrong? Remember, if it were so, positive qualities – of which so many and so significant are also attributed to the Jewish people and culture – would in logic have to go out with negative ones. True, history makes more slighting, perhaps uglier, references to Jews than those other examples. But for Jewish people to be so quick to be thin-skinned is not good either, and is in danger of seeming coercive.Baddiel’s throwaway parenthesis on Israel’s being “deemed the nutcase pariah-state du jour”, is frankly disreputable, and gives the impression that he is “playing the antisemitism card” with more in mind than the banal misspeakings of a few footballers.Phillip GoodallNorwich• David Baddiel suggests that “the left” has become even “more ambiguous” about Jews, because it has deemed Israel the “nutcase pariah state du jour”, thereby implying that it is antisemitic. The ambiguity lies more with David than “the left”, because those who criticise Israel do so from consistent anti-racism. They criticise Israel for its racist treatment of Palestinians through a policy of ethnic cleansing that began in 1947-8, and continues to this day. Just as “the left” opposed apartheid in South Africa on the grounds of racism, so today Israel has made itself the “pariah state” for many, who are not even on the left.Jules TownshendLondon
