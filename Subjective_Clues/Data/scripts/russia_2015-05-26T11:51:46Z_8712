The prime minister emphasised the need for the trilateral contact group to continue to meet and to work through the outstanding issues.”The spokesperson added that Cameron concluded the call by noting that “the UK and Russia had worked successfully together on the Iranian nuclear issue” and that “he hoped that in the years ahead [they] could find other issues where the UK and Russia could work together on matters of mutual interest”.
