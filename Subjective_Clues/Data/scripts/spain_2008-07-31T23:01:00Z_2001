As August begins, thousands of Britons are scrambling to Spain to get their annual fix of sun, just as they do every year. Over the decades it has opened up foreign travel for millions, and it remains the top destination for UK tourists. But this happy achievement has come at a cost, with stretches of coastline laid waste by the bulldozer and massive emissions from flights. Yes, Spain is admired for many things, but environmental protection is not traditionally one of them. This week, however, that started to change, thanks to a new energy plan - its sweep and ambition shames tamer efforts in places where greenery has deeper roots. The most eye-catching idea - and the biggest political risk - is slashing speed limits to 50mph to save fuel. A cap on winter heating is also planned, as are tight restrictions on how far air conditioning can be used to chill public buildings in those sizzling summer months. There will be less street lighting, more public transport and a drive to build a million greener cars. Success is not guaranteed, and the decentralised political system could make it harder to come by. And it is true that Madrid is motivated by enlightened self-interest as much as by concern for the world: saving billions on oil imports will flatter a swelling trade deficit. But in telling business that business as usual is no longer an option, a progressive government is setting set an example for others to follow. Long sought out for its heat, Spain is suddenly playing a noble role in keeping the world as a whole cool.
