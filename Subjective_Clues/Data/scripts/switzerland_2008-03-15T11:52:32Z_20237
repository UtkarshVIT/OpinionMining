Yahoo, one of the world's leading technology companies, has intensified the debate about Britain's ability to hang on to big business by announcing it is moving its European headquarters from London to Switzerland.In a move that the business lobby group CBI last night interpreted as underlining an increasingly "uncompetitive" UK tax system, Yahoo said that it had started work on the relocation to save money.The US company, fighting off a takeover attempt by software group Microsoft, is under pressure to cut costs and appease investors as it struggles to regain its previous web clout in the face of competition from Google.Yahoo said yesterday: "This decision is part of our ongoing international business strategy to increase competitiveness, deliver financial results, performance and efficiencies. Yahoo! Europe remains committed to maintaining a strong presence in all of its key markets in Europe."The move is expected to take around 18 months and to affect around 5% of Yahoo's workforce in Europe.The embattled company's emphasis on "efficiencies" and "competitiveness" echoes big companies' reluctance in recent years to locate key offices in Britain. Google has just opened its European engineering headquarters in Switzerland.Yahoo's news follows an in-depth report by the CBI into the UK's tax system, in which it warned a radical shake-up was needed to win back Britain's status as a competitive place to put businesses.CBI director-general Richard Lambert said: "We are deeply concerned that the UK corporate tax system is becoming uncompetitive and, without knowing the detail, this sounds like another sign of that."The CBI wants a simplified corporate tax system, including a headline corporation tax rate of 18% within eight years and simpler book-keeping requirements.A recent survey by accountancy firm KPMG blamed complex rules and a mass of legislation for putting the UK in the bottom half of a league table of the most attractive places to do business in Europe.The study put Cyprus, Ireland and Switzerland top for their combination of easy-to-understand rules, low tax rates and stable fiscal laws. The UK came 12th out of 22 countries for the attractiveness of their domestic tax regimes.Other reports have suggested the UK's lack of competitiveness is intensifying. The latest annual global report from the World Economic Forum put Britain in ninth place in the world league for overall competitiveness, down from second place the year before.But the Treasury argues that reforms to the tax and regulatory regimes make the UK attractive. It stresses the UK has set the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7 group of industrialised countries.A spokesman said last night: "As a result of measures introduced by the government, the UK is one of the most competitive economies in the world and one of the best places in the world to do business, with continued rising investment in education, skills, R&D and business infrastructure."
