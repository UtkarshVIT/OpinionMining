The founder of one of the world's most celebrated festivals is in a coma after a skiing accident.Claude Nobs, creator of the Montreux jazz festival, was injured on Christmas Eve after he "fell while practising cross-country skiing" near his home in the village of Caux in Switzerland, festival organisers said on Monday. He has undergone surgery but remains unconscious. "His condition requires further additional tests," they added.Nobs, who is Swiss, co-launched the now world-renowned festival in 1967 with the then president of Atlantic Records, Nesuhi Ertegun. Charles Lloyd and Keith Jarrett were the first headliners.The 76-year-old, nicknamed Funky Claude after he was mentioned in the Deep Purple song Smoke on the Water, underwent heart surgery six years ago, but remained festival director, a position he shared during the 1990s with Quincy Jones. The US music producer returns each year to introduce new talent.Previous headliners have included Miles Davis, Ray Charles, Prince and guitarist Santana. Joan Baez arrived on horseback for her 1973 performance. Nobs often joined musicians on stage, playing harmonica, and sometimes accompanied by his pet dogs.The festival's secretary-general, Mathieu Jaton, will take over Nobs's responsibilities for this year's event on 5-20 June.Last year's lineup included Bob Dylan, Lana Del Rey and Hugh Laurie.
