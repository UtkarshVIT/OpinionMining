The Israeli navy is preparing to "take any necessary action" to prevent two boats carrying pro-Palestinian activists from reaching Gaza after they set sail from Turkey on Wednesday with the aim of breaking Israel's sea blockade of the coastal territory."The navy has completed the necessary preparations in order to prevent them from reaching the Gaza Strip," it said in a statement."The IDF is fully prepared to guard the safety of Israel and its maritime border and to take any necessary action and prevent vessels from breaking the maritime security blockade."The organisers of the Canadian and Irish vessels gave no advance publicity to the mission for fear of Israeli diplomatic pressure to prevent the boats leaving port, or sabotage.The Tahrir and the Saoirse, which are also carrying a "symbolic" cargo of $30,000 (Â£19,000) worth of medicines, left Fethiye on the Turkish Mediterranean coast on Wednesday. If they are not intercepted by the Israeli navy, they expect to reach Gaza on Friday.Among those on board the two boats are activists and journalists from nine countries as well as crew members. None are Turkish nationals. The passengers had been trained in non-violent resistance but were unarmed, according to organisers."The message they carry is one of unity, defiance, and hope, in spite of Israel's policies that have physically separated Palestinians from each other," Freedom Waves to Gaza, the umbrella organisation behind the mission, said in a statement.Majd Kayyal, a Palestinian philosophy student from Haifa on board the Tahrir, said: "We want to break the siege Israel has imposed on our people. The fact that we're in international waters is already a victory for the movement. Israel's siege of Gaza is untenable and it's a moral responsibility to put an end to this injustice."The IDF said the purpose of the mission was "to create a provocation against the state of Israel, to break the maritime security blockade on Gaza, and to undermine Israel's security"."The blockade is legal and in accordance with international law. Furthermore, the Palmer committee appointed by the UN to examine the matter has concluded that the blockade is in fact legal," it said.Israeli naval commandos intercepted a flotilla of activists heading for Gaza in May 2010, resulting in the deaths of nine Turkish nationals and triggering a diplomatic crisis with its ally.An attempt to launch a second flotilla from Greece four months ago was blocked by the Greek government under pressure from Israel and the US. Activists also claimed some boats had been sabotaged.However, individual activist boats carrying aid were permitted to land in Gaza on five separate occasions in 2008.Israel imposed a naval blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized control of the territory in June 2007. It says it is necessary to prevent weapons being supplied to militants in Gaza.Critics of the sea and land blockade say it is collective punishment of Gaza's 1.5 million inhabitants.
