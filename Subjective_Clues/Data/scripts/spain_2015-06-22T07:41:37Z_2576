Journalists in Spain believe press freedom is in danger of being undermined ahead of national elections due in November this year.Some of them argue that freedom of expression, which has been enshrined in the constitution since the end of Franco’s dictatorship, is under threat both openly and behind the scenes. According to a report by one of the members of this month’s International Press Institute (IPI) delegation to Spain, Stephen Whittle, the journalists point to five factors: The overt politicisation of RTVE, Spain’s public service broadcaster; the fact that six new broadcasting licences will be granted by the government rather than an independent broadcasting regulator; the provisions of a new public security law, which comes into force next week and provides for fines for the taking of “unauthorised images” of the police and security forces; the way in which institutional advertising is allocated; and the private pressure on media owners and editors to toe the line.Four political parties, each attracting about 20% support in the polls, are fighting to win power and, “as in most wars, the first casualty is truth”, writes Whittle.He cites concerns raised by the Platform for the Defence of Free Expression (PDLI), a group of journalists, lawyers and academics founded last December.Its president, Virginia Pérez Alonso, argues that Spain’s economic crisis and claims about terrorist threat are being used as a smokescreen to introduce reforms likely to restrict press freedom.She says: “Many of these reforms have a common denominator: curtailing those methods of sharing information, placing barriers on the internet as a space of free expression and penalising, in some cases disproportionately, new forms of protest”.Her group argues that new public security law, which should be known as the “gag law”, has been criticised by the UN’s human rights rapporteurs.The IPI delegation, accompanied by representatives from the European Federation of Journalists and the Committee to Protect Journalists, spent three days in Madrid in order to persuade parties of the virtues of accurate and impartial political media coverage.One of the main areas of contention is the widely watched RTVE. Its newly appointed chairman has boasted of his political affiliation to the ruling conservative party, PP.The party’s spokesman in parliament told the IPI mission that it was necessary to make such an appointment because RTVE’s reporting “had been anti-government”.See more here and especially here - the report on the state of press freedom in Spain published in March after the IPI’s December mission.
