Sir John Chilcot has received responses from all of the people criticised in his report into the Iraq war, clearing the final external obstacle to its publication six years after the inquiry began.In a letter to the Commons foreign affairs committee, Chilcot confirmed the end of the so-called Maxwellisation process, in which those who are mentioned negatively in the report are given a right of reply.However, he still refused to name a date for the publication of the final document, saying only that he would reveal a timetable as soon as he is able.

I am pleased to confirm that it has now done so,” Chilcot said. “There is, inevitably, further work for my colleagues and I to do to evaluate those submissions, which are detailed and substantial, in order to establish with confidence the time needed to complete the inquiry’s remaining work.“As soon as I am able to I shall write to the prime minister with a timetable for publication of the inquiry’s report.”Yvette Cooper, one of the Labour leadership candidates, has offered to work with the government on a motion in parliament calling on Chilcot to publish before the end of the year.The prime minister’s spokeswoman said Cameron welcomed the news that the inquiry seemed to be “a step further on in the sense of all of the Maxwellisation responses have been received.”“As the prime minister has said before, he’s keen to see a timetable as soon as possible, so that’s what we would hope the inquiry could focus on doing now.”
