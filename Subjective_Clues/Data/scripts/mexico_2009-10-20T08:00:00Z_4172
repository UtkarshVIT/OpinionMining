For decades, Enrique Fuentes, the owner of Librería Madero, an antiquarian bookshop in the historic centre of Mexico City, rummaged through piles of near-garbage in a junkyard market. A 16th-century book he dug up there in 1985 paid for the shop he now owns.In Mexico City, books exchange hands continually, between private owners, bookshops and public libraries, sold, stolen, lost or often just thrown away. Garbage is big business in the city, and salvaged books are sold to junk dealers, who either sell them on the street, in markets or to secondhand booksellers.Although many of its books come from such humble sources, Librería Madero has one of the finest collections of Mexican history and antiquarian books in the city. The volumes that line the walls are clean and well-ordered. Not so in the dozen or so secondhand bookshops housed in crumbling colonial buildings along the length of Calle Donceles, one of the oldest streets in Mexico City.Given the stacks of dusty books heaped on tables, stuffed into shelves, blocking passageways of sunken floors or spilling on to the sidewalk, one could easily imagine that these shops have been here since Mexico was a Spanish colony. But although this neighbourhood was home to the first printing press on the continent (100 years before the first book was published in the US) and was for centuries the centre of ­Mexican publishing, the area became associated with bookselling again only in the last few decades.You don't have to read Spanish to love these bookstores, as there's an incredible range of old, odd books in English (as well as French, German and Italian) scattered throughout the shelves. In one Donceles shop, Bibliofilia, a 1960s Manual for Refrigeration Mechanics, a first edition of TS Eliot's The Cocktail Party and the 1866 History of the United States in four volumes with steel engravings are all for sale, at about a third the price they could fetch north of the border.Although good deals are to be found on blankets spread out around the city, in bookstalls set up on traffic islands, or in the happy hunting ground of flea markets, when you buy a book in a Donceles bookstore you feel you have acquired a piece of Mexico City's history.
