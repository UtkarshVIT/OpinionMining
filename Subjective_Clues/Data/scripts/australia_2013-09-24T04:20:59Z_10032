Australia is spending $1bn a year more than it should on generic medication, costing the government money that could fund tens of thousands of extra nurses every year or pay for new government-subsidised medicines on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS), according to a consumer health campaign.Consumers Health Forum of Australia (CHF) is calling for the government to tighten up a policy that was originally introduced by the prime minister, Tony Abbott, when he was federal health minister, to see the savings of cheaper medicine passed on to taxpayers as soon as possible. It has launched an interactive which shows the “overpayments” adding up by the second.Currently, when pharmaceutical drugs become available and are listed for government subsidy on the PBS, the government negotiates a price with the manufacturer, which pharmacists then pay when they buy the medication and dispense it. However, when patents on these drugs end and cheaper generic versions become available for pharmacies to buy, the government can still be left reimbursing them for the higher pre-negotiated amount, unaware that the price has dropped. Pharmacists get to keep the difference.When medications become cheaper, manufacturers are obliged to inform the government within 12 months, and it is then another six months before the price drops. CHF wants this time period shortened so PBS drugs can get cheaper, faster.The delay in disclosure results in overpayments of about $3m a day beyond the price that the UK currently pays for the same drugs, according to CHF – money which it says would be better used to fund other parts of our health system.“We know that up to 15% of consumers put off filling scripts because they can’t afford the costs,” the chief executive of CHF, Carol Bennett, told Guardian Australia.“We cannot afford to be spending a billion [dollars] more than comparable countries on medications, or we are simply going to end up missing out on new treatments and on other treatments,” she said, adding that Australia pays about twice the amount that the UK and New Zealand pay for medications.“This is $2,000 a minute, that’s 55 GP visits. It’s five hip replacements or four coronary bypasses every hour. It’s 54 nurses a day and that’s 90,000 nurses working full-time for a whole year. This is a significant, enormous amount of money out of the health budget,” Bennett said.By cutting down the reporting time of price drops and passing them on to consumers, more money would also be available to add new medications to the PBS, said Alan Kirkland, the CEO of consumer advocacy group CHOICE.“There are new drugs being invented and trialled and released for clinical use all the time,” Kirkland told Guardian Australia.“If we can make sure that the cost of medications that are already on the PBS is as low as possible, it’s more likely that we’ll see new medications listed as they become available.”A spokeswoman for the minister of health, Peter Dutton, told Guardian Australia that the 2007 price disclosure reforms had saved billions of dollars since they were introduced, but did not commit to any plans to shorten the time period.“While the cost of medicines to taxpayers is very important, the government’s priority is also to ensure Australian patients get timely and reliable access to innovative new treatments,” said the spokeswoman.“While some countries may pay less for some drugs, their systems can mean fewer innovative new treatments are available to their citizens. Some countries rely on just one supplier, risking shortages or disruption to supply.“The government will continue to look at ways to improve the system and get better prices, but I will also be conscious of the need to balance price with ensuring that patients get timely access to the drugs they need – this is ultimately why we have the PBS.”
