Sixteen Maori heads – mummified, tattooed and held for decades as precious artefacts in France – are to be sent home after MPs in Paris's national assembly voted tonight to return them to New Zealand.Three years after authorities in Rouen offered to repatriate a warrior head as "atonement" for colonial-era crimes – and 135 years after that head arrived in the city's National History Museum – the French parliament voted almost unanimously to relinquish ownership of the remains. "You do not build a culture on trafficking. You build a culture on respect and on exchange," said the culture minister, Frédéric Mitterrand, approving the legislation.His words were a far cry from those of the ministry in 2007, when it stepped in to postpone Rouen's repatriation bid, citing concern that the official procedure for the "declassification" of a national possession had not been followed.Observers suggested the government was afraid that any move to return a work of art from a French museum to its native land would set a dangerous precedent for a country bursting with antique treasures and colonial-era loot.However, perhaps as a result of a string of countries – including the US – meeting New Zealand's demands for a return of Maori heads in recent years, Paris has shown itself to be more willing to wipe its slate clean with countries and communities who want their artefacts back.The legislation – drawn up by a member of the Nouveau Centre party, Catherine Morin-Desailly, and voted into law by all but eight MPs – means the Maori heads will be returned to New Zealand without further delay.As well as the one in Rouen, there are known to be seven of the objects in storage at the Musée du Quai Branly, and several others scattered across the country. Campaigners estimate that, of about 500 of the heads that travelled all over the world during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, more than 322 have been returned.What started as an ancient Maori practise of preserving the heads of fallen warriors spiralled out of control during the colonial era, when demand for the tattooed body parts soared and suppliers took to barbarous methods to keep their wealthy western customers satisfied.Historians say that while some heads belonged to fighters who were killed deliberately for trade, others were those of Maori slaves who had been forcibly tattooed and murdered.The crux of the debate was whether the heads could be considered to be museum items when they were human remains.Speaking before the vote last week, French MPs from all parties welcomed the move to return the "sensitive cultural material". "These remains have awaited a dignified burial, in accordance with Maori rights, for too long," said Michèle Tabarot, head of the commission for cultural affairs at the national assembly.Henri de Raincourt, minister for parliamentary relations, said France had not shown itself to be "overly eager" to return the heads, but that it was a duty that needed to be done. "From a ritual showing the respect of a tribe and family toward their dead, the mummified heads became the object of a particularly barbaric trade due to the curiosity of travellers and European collectors," he said.The Maori case is not the first thorny debate surrounding exotic cultural treasures in France's esteemed collections. In December the Louvre handed back five fragments of frescoes to Egypt, while in 2002 the parliament gave the go-ahead for the return of a South African woman known derogatively to western audiences as "the Hottentot Venus".
