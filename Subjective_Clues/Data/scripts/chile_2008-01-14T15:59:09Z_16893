Chile is the latest country to get its own version of the award-wining British TV comedy The Office after the BBC signed a licensing deal with local producers in the south American country.BBC Worldwide Americas has licensed the format to production company Chilecorto and Canal 13-Chile, part of Chilean network UCTV, with the show due to begin production early this year.The Office is now shown in 90 countries, with remakes in the US, France and Germany, but this is the first Spanish-language version and the first format deal for the show in Latin America.Gervais said: "We stopped making The Office in 2003 but the rest of the world didn't. I won't be happy until I see an Inuit doing the dance."The deal covers series one and two plus the Christmas specials, with the premiere set for May this year.BBC Worldwide will advise on the production and Duncan Cooper, the BBC Worldwide executive producer of formats and local production, will assist the producers in the show's development.  Well-known Chilean actor Luis Gnecco has signed to play the role of David Brent and Chilecorto is currently casting for the remaining characters. · To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
