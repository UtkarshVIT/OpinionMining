It is the holy grail of clean energy: harnessing nuclear fusion to create unlimited power without also generating greenhouse gases and radioactive waste.For decades the dream has eluded the world's scientists, but today, North Korea claimed it had succeeded where many have failed, creating a successful nuclear fusion reaction.The official Korean Central News Agency said: "The successful nuclear fusion by our scientists has made a definite breakthrough towards the development of new energy and opened up a new phase in the nation's development of the latest science and technology."But the extraordinary assertion, which would put the regime well ahead of its nuclear rivals in the west, was dismissed by scientists in South Korea."Nuclear fusion reaction is not something that can be done so simply," said Hyeon Park, a physics professor at Postech science and technology university.He said he believed North Korea had merely produced plasma, a preliminary step on the way to nuclear fusion.The KCNA said scientists had "solved a great many scientific and technological problems entirely by their own efforts … thus succeeding in nuclear fusion reaction at last." Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the "ingeniously" developed technology "represents a field of the latest science and technology for the development of new energy desired by humankind". The announcement came on the Day of the Sun, a holiday to mark the birthday of North Korea's founder, Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994. If true, the claim would represent a scientific breakthrough – one all the more remarkable for taking place in one of the world's poorest countries, which struggles to generate enough electricity for lighting and other basic needs.Kune Y Suh, a nuclear expert at Seoul National University, poured scorn on the claim, saying: "Maybe if two suns show up in the sky tomorrow, then people could believe the claim."A South Korean official said the North could not afford the facilities necessary to create nuclear fusion. "It is not easy to make such facilities secretly."Unlike fission, nuclear fusion produces little waste, but scientists in other countries have so far been unable to turn it into a viable energy alternative.North Korea's nuclear ambitions continue to generate concern: Pyongyang has tested two nuclear bombs, the most recent a year ago, and has vowed to build a light water nuclear fission plant.The communist country has come under pressure to return to nuclear talks following UN sanctions that have added to its economic problems.In its report the KCNA said: "In this course, Korean-style thermonuclear reaction devices were designed and manufactured, basic researches into nuclear fusion reaction completed and strong scientific and technological forces built to perfect thermonuclear technology by their own efforts." It pointed to "a definite breakthrough toward the development of new energy", adding that it had demonstrated the country's "rapidly developing cutting-edge science and technology".
