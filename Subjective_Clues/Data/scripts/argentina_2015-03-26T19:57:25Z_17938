A federal court of appeals dismissed charges against the Argentinian president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, on Thursday, regarding an alleged conspiracy to shield Iranian officials’ from prosecution over their alleged role in the deadly 1994 bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish community centre.The charges had originally been made by prosecutor Alberto Nisman in January, four days before he was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head in his Buenos Aires apartment.On 14 January, Nisman had presented a 289-page writ in court that he said unveiled a conspiracy headed by Fernández to clear five high-ranking Iranian suspects of charges that they had masterminded the 1994 bombing of the Amia centre, in which 85 people were killed.

Opinion polls have shown roughly 70% of Argentinians believe Nisman was murdered – a hypothesis propelled by the prosecutor’s family and seemingly confirmed by their independent forensic tests. One month after his death, 400,000 people participated in a “march of silence” demanding justice for Nisman. The court investigating his death has stuck to the hypothesis of suicide.As the special prosecutor in charge of the investigation into the Amia bombing, Nisman had obtained Interpol arrest warrants against five Iranian officials that he charged with masterminding the 1994 bombing.Nisman claimed as evidence to support the charges of conspiracy, an agreement signed by Iran and Argentina in 2013 to set up a binational “truth commission” to investigate the Amia attack. Nisman claimed that the agreement effectively neutralised his investigation and the Interpol arrest warrants against the Iranian suspects.Although the Iran agreement was blocked last year by a court ruling that declared it “unconstitutional”, Nisman decided to accuse Fernández in January of attempting to block the court case against the Iranian suspects with that agreement.

Fernández needed to close the court case against the Iranians “as part of a new geopolitical alignment on the current world stage”, Nisman said in his extensive writ. Néstor Kirchner, Fernández’s husband, who preceded her as president from 2003-2007, had resolutely rebuffed approaches from Iran proposing generous trade concessions in return for Argentina dropping the charges against its five citizens. Following his unexpected death from heart failure in 2010, Fernández began seeking closer relations with Russia, China, Venezuela and Iran.“Fernández made Argentina drop off the map of the world with these new alliances,” said legislator Elisa Carrió, a presidential hopeful for Argentina’s upcoming October elections. Nisman’s accusation seemed to offer an explanation for Fernández’s surprising about turn regarding Iran after her husband’s death.“We had standing orders from Kirchner not to negotiate under any terms with Iran regarding Amia,” said Roberto García Moritán, who served as deputy foreign minister under both Kirchner and Fernández. “And Iran was very insistent.”“They made offers of up to $4bn in wheat and maize purchases,” Kirchner’s former foreign minister, Rafael Bielsa, said in an interview with the newspaper Perfil after the “truth commission” with Nisman was signed.Fernández was also hoping to increase trade with Iran, a traditional market for Argentinian grains before the 1994 bombing, which soured relations between the two countries, Nisman argued in his writ.• The headline on this article was amended on 27 March 2015 to better reflect the story.
