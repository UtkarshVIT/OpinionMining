Forget about Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? For an honest portrayal of a disintegrating relationship, Journey to Italy is the grownup choice. Rossellini paired his wife, Ingrid Bergman, with George Sanders as a childless couple, Katherine and Alex, stuffy Brits abroad on the Amalfi coast where they're selling a recently inherited house.Confined to their car, alone for the first time in years, they're strangers, and the awful realisation dawns on them that their marriage is empty. "What noisy people," Alex says at the start, and the couple's pasty Englishness is continually overwhelmed. Visiting excavations at Pompeii, they watch as a man and a woman are uncovered from volcanic dust, frozen in death in an embrace. The sight terrifies Katherine: "Life is so short."Extraordinary, potent moments like these, ravishingly shot, punctuate awkwardness and uncomfortable silences. This is not the most conventional of romances, for sure, but one that understands like no other the complex nature of human relationships. Journey to Italy flopped at the box office, but the young writer-film-makers at the Cahiers du Cinéma instantly declared it a modern masterpiece. "If there is a modern cinema this is it," enthused Jacques Rivette.
