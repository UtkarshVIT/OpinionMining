Projecting a workaholic image is par for the course for many world leaders. Margaret Thatcher famously got by on a daily 20-minute catnap during the Falklands war. Benito Mussolini cheated by leaving a lamp burning in his office when he was already tucked up in bed. But has Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin gone a step too far by promising to stay up all night after work – watching a bunch of builders on CCTV?Putin made the commitment on Tuesday as he toured Mokhovoye near Moscow – or what remains of it after a fire engulfed the village. It was meant as a sop to public anger over the handling of the hundreds of wildfires that have torn through Russia in the last week.Residents of Mokhovoye blamed poor firefighting for the destruction. What's more, they doubted assurances that their cottages would be replaced before the winter. That's when Putin stepped in.Video cameras would, he said, be installed at every building site to beam live images of the restoration effort to the government, its website and "me at home". "One of the most efficient measures of control is 24-hour monitoring," he added.Orwellian as it sounds, Putin clearly hopes the terror of his name will head off any attempts to cash in on the crisis; it's customary for bureaucrats to skim millions of roubles off any construction budget for a new Mercedes or a dacha refit. Whether Putin is staying up red-eyed in front of a screen tonight is really neither here nor there. Few of those builders will risk slacking off now.
