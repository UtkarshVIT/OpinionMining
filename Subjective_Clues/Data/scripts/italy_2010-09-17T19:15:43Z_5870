Venice film festival, the oldest and one of the most glamorous cinema awards ceremonies in the world, has been overshadowed this year by allegations of nepotism and elitism among the jury, with Silvio Berlusconi's government threatening to intervene and hand pick next year's judges.In a magazine interview published yesterday, the Italian culture minister launched a stinging attack on American film director Quentin Tarantino, who led this year's jury, calling him "the expression of an elitist, relativist and snobbish culture."Sandro Bondi also slammed the judges' choice of winners, which did not include any Italian films, and said he would take part in the selection of next year's jury, "since [the festival] is financed by the state". The Italian government contributes €7m (£5.8m) to the festival's €12m budget.Bondi told the Italian magazine Panorama that Tarantino "pays no attention to the sentiment and the tastes of the people and of traditions, which are now considered unsophisticated and outdated. And that vision influences his critical judgment of films, including foreign films".Tarantino, who specialises in blood-soaked pastiches of trashy B-movies, is not often on the receiving end of accusations of elitism. But it is not the first time his role in the festival has come in for criticism: this week the director was accused of nepotism after presenting several awards to friends.Sofia Coppola, Tarantino's former girlfriend, won the festival's top prize for her film Somewhere, while the Spanish director Alex de la Iglesia, a longtime friend of Tarantino, was awarded best director and best screenplay for his movie, A Sad Trumpet Ballad.The jury also gave a lifetime achievement prize to Tarantino's mentor Monte Hellman, prompting Italian daily Corriere della Sera to accuse the Pulp Fiction director of "the most obvious conflict of interest possible".In his interview Bondi did not spare the festival's director Marco Muller, claiming he was excluding "talent and innovation" from the awards.Bondi said he had avoided the festival because of the "insupportable" snobbery of the cinema establishment.Bondi's plan to hand pick jurors attracted derision from Italian film- makers. Luca Guadagnino, a member of this year's jury, called it "authoritarian and ridiculous", while Paolo Ferrari, the head of Warner Brothers in Italy, said it would go beyond the censorship exercised by Mussolini.Allowing the government to select a festival jury "does not happen in any country in the world," said Riccardo Tozzi, the head of the Italian film producers' association ANICA."Why doesn't Bondi join the jury himself or even become a director, taking the opportunity to resign and leave the ministry in better hands," asked Matteo Orfini, a culture spokesman for the opposition Democratic party.Bondi, 51, who was appointed culture minister by Berlusconi in 2008, is a former communist who in 1994 made a dramatic switch to support the prime minister, going as far as dedicating poems to Berlusconi and claiming he would go to jail for him.He also wrote a 2001 booklet entitled An Italian Story, packed with photos documenting the rise of Berlusconi and his meetings with world leaders, which was mailed to Italian voters. He refused to attend this year's Cannes film festival when he found out it was showing Draquila, an Italian documentary criticising Berlusconi's handling of the relief effort after last year's devastating earthquake in Abruzzo. The film, he said, "offends the truth and the entire population of Italy".Shortly after his appointment as minister, Bondi admitted he did not understand modern art and merely pretended to appreciate it when visiting galleries. Yesterday Corriere della Sera wondered if he was able to name any of the films selected for this year's Venice festival.One reason for Bondi's outburst was suggested by Italian producer Domenico Procacci. "Bondi was motivated by the fact that he wanted an Italian film to win, the goal of a lot of people," said Procacci, whose film Barney's Vision was in competition.But the minister denied homegrown talent had been overlooked, stating Italian directors are equally as out of touch with their audiences as Tarantino and Muller. "There is no authenticity in the scripts, in the language and in the acting," he complained.Bondi said he was trying to bring culture closer to the people, "even if, for certain left-wing intellectuals, 'the people' is something annoying and unsophisticated."Anyone wondering what Italian culture minister Sandro Bondi means by cinema for "the people" should look out for September 11, 1683, a historical epic now in preproduction which has just received ¤5.7m in funding from Italian state TV network RAI.The film re-enacts the bloody struggle by Christian soldiers to repel Muslim troops from the gates of Vienna on the date that gives the film its title.According to legend, the Christians were led by the Capuchin friar Marco d'Aviano."The title is a deliberate reference to 9/11 and I want audiences to see that both sides were convinced they represented the truth," said director Renzo Martinelli, who says he has signed Harvey Keitel to appear as the King of Poland and hopes to cast Joseph Fiennes as d'Aviano.But the Corriere della Sera newspaper warned that the film and its title were "anti-Islamic" and could promote violence, adding that its state funding had been backed by Italy's anti-immigrant Northern League party.The league also lobbied for state funding for Martinelli's previous film, Barbarossa, about Italians repelling the army of the Holy Roman Empire in the 12th century, and featuring league leader Umberto Bossi in a cameo.Despite a premiere attended by government ministers, Barbarossa fared badly at the Italian box office.
