A forest fire in northern Israel killed about 40 people today, the country's national rescue service said.Fire crews, assisted by planes dropping water, are still struggling to contain the blaze, which is raging across the Carmel mountains near Haifa. Many of the deaths occurred when a bus on the way to rescue people from the area went up in flames, the rescue service said.Authorities cleared the Carmel Forest area of hundreds of people, including some 500 Palestinian inmates from the Damon prison, after the fire broke out early today. The bus was carrying some 50 prison guards when it flipped over and got caught in the flames, according to Haaretz.The fire broke out near the Druze village of Osafia, the Jerusalem Post reported. Haifa university, a hotel, farm and residential properties were evacuated, according to Israeli media. Authorities are still trying to determine the cause of the blaze. Israel experienced an especially hot summer and has had little rain this winter."This large fire has spread due to strong winds," the Haifa district police deputy superintendent, Ahuva Mishne, told Israel Radio. "The winds are blowing in the direction of the sea, so there is no real concern for the [nearby] villages."â€¢ This article was amended on 3 December 2010.
