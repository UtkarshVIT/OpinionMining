Eleven tourists and eight guides kidnapped 10 days ago in Egypt have been freed, local media reported today.The country's state news agency and television station did not give details of where or how the group had been freed, saying only that the five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian were in good health. They reported that the tourists and local guides and drivers were on their way to Cairo.The group disappeared on September 19 while on a desert safari trip in a remote corner of south-western Egypt. Their abductors took them to Sudan and Libya, but their final whereabouts were unclear.On Thursday, Sudanese officials said the kidnappers had moved into Libya, but Libyan officials said they could not find them. Sudan, Chad, Egypt and Libya share borders in the remote region.Eight kidnappers led Sudanese soldiers on a high-speed chase through the desert yesterday, ending in a gunfight that left all but two of the gunmen dead, said a Sudanese military spokesman, Sawarmy Khaled.The two surviving men were arrested and told soldiers that the tourists were being held by 35 more gunmen in Chad, Khaled said. He told the Associated Press yesterday that Sudanese soldiers had been combing the Jebel Oweinat region near the Libyan border when they came upon a white sports utility vehicle carrying eight gunmen. "The armed forces called for it to stop, but they did not respond and there was pursuit in which six of the armed men were killed," he said. The dead included the leader of the group, whom Khaled identified as a Chadian named Bakhit.German officials had been negotiating with the kidnappers, who were demanding millions of dollars in ransom.The vast majority of Egypt's 9 million tourists each year visit pharaonic sites along the Nile or Red Sea beach resorts, far from the Western Desert and the Gilf al-Kebir. The Gilf, a desert plateau 500 miles south-west of Cairo, draws adventure tourists with its sand dunes and desert cliffs, as well as a trove of prehistoric cave art. Around 2,000 tourists visited the area in the past year, up from only a handful less than a decade ago.
