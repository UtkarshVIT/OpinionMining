The US and Australia have removed sanctions against Fiji following democratic elections.Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, on Friday began a two-day visit to Fiji, describing it as the start of a new era in the relationship between the two countries. She announced that Australia had lifted all remaining sanctions, including on weapons sales.The US ambassador to Fiji, Frankie Reed, said the US was lifting restrictions on its financial assistance to the Fijian government and exploring opportunities to resume co-operation with Fiji’s military.Fiji’s election in September was the first since military ruler Voreqe (Frank) Bainimarama seized control in a 2006 coup. His Fiji First party won a decisive victory at the polls, completing his transformation from military strongman to civilian leader.Bishop’s visit is the first by any foreign minister since the election. “Today marks the start of a new era in the relationship between Australia and Fiji,” she said.Under the resumption of ties a high commissioner will once again be posted by Australia in Fiji and vice versa.
