Mark Cavendish yesterday won his second stage of the Tour of Switzerland, beating the former world champion Oscar Freire in Bad Zurzach with his customary quick acceleration. It was the 24-year-old's 13th win of the season, and he is well on track to beat last year's 17 victories, his best as a professional.The Briton paid tribute to his Columbia-Highroad team-mates, who gave him the perfect lead-out to launch his sprint. "It was easy to win here today," he said. "[My team-mate] George Hincapie brought me into a good position, and I moved around [Thor] Hushovd. I was quite tired [at the start of the stage], it was a difficult, technical course, and the finale was very physical."With the start of the Tour de France just over a fortnight away, Cavendish's form in Switzerland augurs well for his chances of adding to his four stage wins last year. And his chances of also targeting the green jersey, for most consistent sprinter, were boosted last night with the Tour de France organisers, ASO, confirming that Tom Boonen, a former green jersey winner, would be banned from this year's race after his positive test for cocaine in April.Lance Armstrong's Tour de France challenge also remains on track, with his team, Astana, announcing yesterday that its financial problems have been resolved until the end of the season. Having missed a payment deadline to the International Cycling Union on Tuesday evening the Kazakh-backed team faced suspension, but it seems that the squad has been bailed out by the Kazakh government."Thanks to the guarantees made by the Kazakh government we can continue," said the team's manager, Johan Bruyneel. "The government showed that – despite the economic crisis – they really want to invest in cycling [and] they succeeded in finding funds." It had been reported that the team faced a shortfall of $9m (£5.5m).
