A major new road safety campaign is to be launched tomorrow to warn drivers of the deadly dangers of deer on Scotland's roads.An average of three people a year are killed and numerous others seriously injured in around 10,000 accidents involving deer as they roam across rural and suburban roads in search of fresh pastures.Collisions involving deer usually peak between now and the middle of next month, prompting Transport Scotland and the Deer Commission for Scotland (DCS) to run a high-visibility awareness campaign for drivers across the country, but particularly throughout the central belt, north-east of Glasgow, Aberdeenshire, Morayshire and around the Dundee area."Juvenile roe deer are a higher risk on the roads at this time of year, as their mothers are about to give birth, leaving one-year-olds to find their own way for the first time. This leaves the younger roe in search of territories of their own and can often lead to them wandering across roads," said Jamie Hammond, of the DCS."We often find that people who live in and around towns think that these warnings aren't really that relevant to them, but in fact accident rates are often higher in areas with more people and more cars on the road. Accidents certainly don't only occur on the most rural roads in the Highlands."Millions of pounds of damage and personal injury claims are caused by collisions with deer every year.According to the Deer Collision Database, it's not just Scotland where there is a danger to motorists, as accidents have been recorded across Britain.Accidents involving deer are not reportable and the police don't get involved unless there are injuries to people, which means the actual number of collisions each year could be as high as 50,000 across the UK.Many of the deer hit by cars are not killed outright, and instead have to be put down at the roadside, while others escape to die later of their injuries.
