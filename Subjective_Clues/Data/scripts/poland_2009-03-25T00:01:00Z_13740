Poland's environment minister, Maciej Nowicki, says plans for a new highway connecting the country to Finland have been changed to save one of Europe's last pristine wetlands. Authorities have decided to reroute the highway around the Rospuda valley, in north-eastern Poland, instead of building a 10-mile section across the valley on concrete pillars. The original plans drew protests from environmentalists and an injunction from the EU. The highway is part of the Via Baltica and will bypass the congested town of Augustow. Poland will ask the EU to lift its injunction, Nowicki said.
