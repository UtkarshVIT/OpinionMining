Name: TriptoesBased: BathWebsite: www.triptoes.comTriptoes, which launched January 2014, was started from a personal passion and a vision to provide family-friendly holidays to Canada for UK families. Our mission is to become the leading provider of unforgettable family holidays to Canada, removing stress from the planning process and ensuring that each family that travels with us experiences the best that this vast and beautiful country has to offer. In October, we won the TravelMole award for Best Accommodation Website 2014 as voted by our peers in the travel industry. During the past year, we have focussed on developing our brand and reputation as a niche family specialist and have been quoted as a family travel specialist in the Globe & Mail, Canada’s leading newspaper. We have grown from being a provider of accommodation-only holidays to developing our adventure product and tailor-made fly-drive itineraries. Over the last 18 months, we have received grant assistance from our local enterprise partnership growth fund and we have just registered for our second year in a row to attend Rendez-vous Canada, the country’s leading tourism marketplace at Niagara Falls in May.
