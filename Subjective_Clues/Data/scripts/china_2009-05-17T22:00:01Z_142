In the past most people were very poor. We lived in houses built up from dry grass. There was no electricity nor gas and we carried heavy wood from the mountains to cook with. You depended on what you grew, and if you met natural disasters it was very possible you were left with nothing to eat. But things have changed totally – farmers build houses up to five storeys high and I hear some use washing machines. Men work out as migrants and women stay but have a lighter burden because they have fewer children. They won't suffer from hunger anymore; they've started to worry about high blood pressure and cholesterol. In the countryside, women used to only depend on their father, brothers or husband. So when I got a job in the city I felt I had stood up and become the master of my life. And we had more information – in the countryside we could not eat properly, so how could there be newspapers?My biggest hope for myself is good health and safety and health for all my relatives. I hope that the country prospers and the people are at peace.I don't have many worries. My two sons worked out well and no longer need our support; they support me and my husband instead. My granddaughter has started work and my grandson is at university. Everything is good. Under the new healthcare plan, we only need to pay 8% if buying medicine, and after I turned 70 I got a senior citizen's pass allowing me to go to any park and take any bus for free. In fact, our pensions are more than what we spend every month so I feel no burden.
