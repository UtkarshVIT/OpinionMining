Intergovernmental rivalry is fine on the football pitch but Argentina and Britain are now replaying the Falklands war in the battlefield of the Bonn climate talks.The scene was the subsidiary body for implementation, at issue were the islands' greenhouse gas emissions - which probably amount to just a few tonnes a year - mainly from the back end of sheep.Argentina objected to the UK's inclusion of the "Islas Malvinas" in its national communication, citing sovereignty disputes. Britain's diplomats responded tartly that emissions from the Falkland Islands were included "since the issue of sovereignty was not in doubt".Eco soundings believes this is the first time that two countries have deliberately tried to increase their emissions.
