The FBI has questioned North Korea’s involvement in the cyberattack that crippled Sony Pictures computers and leaked confidential data and films.A senior FBI official said that they had been unable to confirm links between the hack and Pyongyang or affiliated groups.“There is no attribution to North Korea at this point,” Joe Demarest, assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division told a panel at a cybersecurity conference.Despite indications in the software used in the attack, Pyongyang’s promise of “merciless counter-measures” against the Sony Pictures film The Interview and continued demands from hackers to “stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism”, North Korea has officially denied involvement in the “righteous deed”.While security analysts have said that preventing sophisticated and well-funded cyber criminals from breaking into a company is very hard indeed, researchers have criticised Sony Pictures for its poor data security.“There is a lot of post-breach thinking,” Ken Levine, chief executive of security firm Digital Guardian told Ars Technica. “What we are saying is, not that all breaches are preventable, but what the bad guys get from the breach is absolutely preventable.”“That minimum compliance [by law] is the goal speaks volumes about Sony Pictures’ attitude towards the security of their data,” said security analysts Thinkst in a report on the attacks. “Sony subsidiaries have fallen victim to tens of successful attacks in recent years, leading us to question the importance of security in the broader conglomerate.”The security firm hired by Sony to investigate the attack, FireEye, described the attack as an “unparalleled and well-planned crime, carried out by an organised group, for which neither SPE nor other companies could have been fully prepared” in a leaked report.Part of the data stolen from Sony during the attack included security certificates that are used to digitally sign or vouch for software.Security firm Kaspersky Lab discovered new malware like that used in the attack on Sony Pictures being deployed in further attacks against other companies. The malware had been signed and authorised by Sony Pictures, allowing it to bypass certain security checks.The FBI issued a warning that hackers are using malicious software to launch destructive attacks in the US against businesses, similar to the attack on Sony Pictures.• Hackers claim responsibility for Sony PlayStation Network outage
