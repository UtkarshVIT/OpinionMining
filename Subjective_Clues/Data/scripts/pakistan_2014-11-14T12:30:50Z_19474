The photojournalist Alixandra Fazzina has been collecting stories and photographs of women surviving conflict on the borders and in the cities of Pakistan for five years. The film of Alixandra’s experiences is her view of Pakistan – and we would now like to find out perspectives of other people living and working there. Show us the Pakistan that we don’t often see. Perhaps it’s the extraordinary landscape or parts of cities that tourists don’t often visit. We’d also like you to tell us about your experiences of Pakistan, are they very different from what’s shown in the media?It’s important to take care when recording and sharing your content, as these images will be public on the GuardianWitness site. We understand that there may be cultural considerations in sharing photographs and videos , so please ensure that the content you upload isn’t considered offensive to anyone in your community. You can share your photos, videos and perspectives by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ button on this article. You can also use the GuardianWitness smartphone app or the new Guardian app and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments’ – and if you add it to the homepage – you can keep up with all our assignments.
