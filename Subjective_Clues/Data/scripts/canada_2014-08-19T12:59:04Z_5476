I’m up here in the land of the midnight sun at 68.4 degrees latitude, with summer temperatures approaching 30C. However, all good things must come to an end, and the sun will dip down to the horizon at about 2am. Attentive folks will say it should be midnight, no? Reason is that we need to follow Alberta’s mountain time for convenience, rather than the true time given by our longitude. If you follow the longitude down from Inuvik, you end up in the Pacific Ocean far west of Vancouver.This is my second time living in Inuvik in the Mackenzie Delta region of the Northwest Territories. This time I moved from Ragged Ass Road in Yellowknife. The first trip to Inuvik was exactly 18 years ago, and that was quite an adventure. The most eventful part of the 3,200km journey from Edmonton was travelling the Dempster Highway from Dawson City, Yukon up to Inuvik, a distance of 740km on tyre-punishing crushed black shale. The trip involved a large semi-trailer truck trying to force us off the road (the old Saab ran well, even with two wheels over the shoulder), and a lightning strike right beside the car in a foggy drive over a mountain crest right up in the clouds in the Richardson mountain range. That was a window-rattling explosion like a mine blast under a tank in a second world war movie.So moving back to Inuvik is like coming home. They say when you venture to a remote community in the Arctic you will either love it or hate it. When my family of four moved here in 1996 we were ambivalent. However, go where the work is. Soon every trip south to the so-called civilised world seemed crowded and impersonal. So it is a treat to sit here again in the Cafe Gallery, sip my mocha, gnaw on a cranberry muffin and reminisce.Guardian Weekly regularly publishes a Letter from one of its readers around the world.
