An inquiry into Australia's media has recommended the establishment of a government-funded council to set and enforce journalistic standards.The investigation was launched after News Corporation closed the News of the World last year over the phone hacking scandal. News Corp owns 70% of Australia's newspapers through its subsidiary, News Ltd.Many Australian politicians argue that News Ltd's newspaper holdings are too large and are biased against the ruling Labour party (Rupert Murdoch tweeted criticism of its leader, Julia Gillard, and former leader, Kevin Rudd, this week).The Gillard government launched the inquiry in September and it heard more than 60 submissions in public hearings. The inquiry's report recommended that a government-funded "News Media Council" should be established to set journalistic standards and handle complaints when those standards are breached.The council would also be expected to regulate online news, covering any news website receiving 15,000 or more hits a year.Sources: AP/The Australian
