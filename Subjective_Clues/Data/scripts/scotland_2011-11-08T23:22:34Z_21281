The turbulence surrounding the leadership of Scotland Yard continued on Tuesday as Tim Godwin announced his departure as deputy commissioner.He becomes the sixth senior figure this year to depart or take extended leave from Britain's biggest police force.Godwin applied to be commissioner of the Met this summer, but was beaten to the post by Bernard Hogan-Howe, who the government had installed as his deputy.Godwin, who has 30 years' service as an officer and is thus entitled to a full police pension, will leave to take up a role in the private sector.He twice served as acting commissioner, and his departure had been expected.But Godwin's retirement will underline the seismic change in the Met's top leadership within a year. Most of those who started the year in the Met's cabinet, its senior management team, are no longer in post. Sir Paul Stephenson's commissionership was ended by the phone-hacking scandal, as was the career of former assistant commissioner John Yates.Ian McPherson is leaving as assistant commissioner for a private sector job, and in April Martin Tiplady left his role as head of human resources. Dick Fedorcio, the Met's public relations chief, is on extended leave pending an IPCC investigation into his involvement in the work carried out for Scotland Yard by the former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis. Assistant commissioner Cressida Dick, current head of counter-terrorism, would appear to be the favourite among likely internal candidates to replace Godwin. From outside the Met, possible candidates include Steve Otter, chief of Devon and Cornwall and John Stoddart who heads the Durham force and was asked by Hogan-Howe to review the Met's handling of phone hacking.Other candidates could include Andy Trotter, head of British Transport Police, and John Murphy, who succeeded Hogan-Howe as head of Merseyside and served as his deputy there.Godwin was first acting commissioner when Stephenson was ill, and took the decision to launch a new criminal investigation into phone hacking. During his second stint in charge after Sir Paul's resignation, 22 of London's 32 boroughs were hit by disturbances, with Godwin defending the force's response against criticism of policing of this summer's riots.Godwin started his working life in the merchant navy, and then joined the police service. Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said: "I am personally sorry to lose the Deputy Commissioner – a man of integrity, intellect and humility. I know the officers and staff of the Metropolitan Police will lose a man they love a great deal."London mayor Boris Johnson praised Godwin's insistence on sticking to traditional British policing values in the face of the summer riots, as some called for them to be junked and a more 'militaristic' approach to be taken.Johnson said: "I will always be grateful to him for his advice and action, not least last summer when his faith in common sense traditional British policing was vindicated, the streets reclaimed and public confidence restored."• This article was amended on 9 November 2011 to clarify the circumstances of Dick Fedorcio's extended leave.
