A British banker has died after falling from the rooftop bar of a hotel in Singapore.William Hart, who is believed to have been the head of sales at Bank of China International in Singapore, fell from the seventh floor of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, in the city state's Marina Bay area, on Thursday evening.The 37-year-old was at the Lantern bar when he got past a metal railing and a glass barrier before plunging into the waters below at about 11.25pm.His body was found several hours later after emergency services searched the Singapore river, and he was declared dead at the scene.Giovanni Viterale, the general manager of the hotel, told the Sunday Times that Hart had been in a group of four, one of whom was a friend visiting from Canada.Around 180 people were at the bar when the incident happened, Viterale said, adding that Hart was not a regular customer.The Straits Times reported that Hart's father flew in from Hong Kong on Friday to collect his body.A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: "We can confirm the death of a British national in Singapore on 7 April. "We are in touch with his family, and are providing consular assistance."
