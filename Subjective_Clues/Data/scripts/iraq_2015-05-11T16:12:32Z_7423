The private security firm G4S did not make sure that a former British soldier was adequately vetted before he killed two fellow security contractors in Iraq, a Stockport coroner has said.The killing of Paul McGuigan and Australian Darren Hoare by their colleague Danny Fitzsimons was a “defining moment globally in the security industry”, said the coroner, Joanne Kearsley. She recorded a verdict of unlawful killing in the case of McGuigan and said she would be sending recommendations to the Security Industry Authority.Fitzsimons killed McGuigan and Hoare after a whisky-fuelled argument in Baghdad in August 2009. The former paratrooper from Middleton, Manchester, became the first westerner convicted in the country since the 2003 invasion when he was sentenced to 20 years in an Iraqi prison in 2011.The inquest hearing in Stockport, which started in September last year, heard that Fitzsimons had a history of criminal offences and there were ongoing proceedings against him at the time he travelled to Iraq.Kearsley described Fitzsimons as a “highly manipulative individual” who had provided inaccurate information to his employers, the BBC reported. The coroner dismissed Fitzsimons’ claims during his trial that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or acting in self-defence when he murdered McGuigan.Fitzsimons joined the army at 16 and was discharged eight years later. He was employed by ArmorGroup, part of G4S, and injured an Iraqi security guard 36 hours after arriving in Iraq in 2009.Last week the inquest heard that Fitzsimons had declared in private writings that he believed himself to be “the antichrist” and had promised to “satisfy my blood lust”.McGuigan, a former Royal Marine, was shot twice in the chest and through the mouth. His fiancee, Nicci Prestage, gave birth prematurely to his daughter, Elsie-Mai, a few weeks after his death. She has called on the new justice secretary, Michael Gove, to bar Fitzsimons’ transfer from an Iraqi jail to the UK.Hoare, also 37, from Brisbane, was shot through the temple at close range.
