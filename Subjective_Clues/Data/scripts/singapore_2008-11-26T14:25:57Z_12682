The Wall Street Journal Asia, based in Hong Kong, has been fined Â£10,700 by the Singapore high court for contempt of court for publishing two editorials and a letter by an opposition leader questioning the country's judicial system. The attorney general said the editorials and letter, published in June and July this year, "impugned the integrity, impartiality and independence of the Singapore judiciary." (Via Wall Street Journal)
