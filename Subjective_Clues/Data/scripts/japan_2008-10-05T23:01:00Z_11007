For a country that counts a cartoon cat among its ambassadors, Japan's new prime minister Taro Aso seems like an obvious choice. The 68-year-old, LSE-educated Aso boasts a voluminous manga and anime collection, is said to read around 10-20 comics a week, and has become an instant hero among Japan's subculture of manga-obsessives (or otaku, as they are known). He even sparked a market surge in manga-related shares when it looked likely that he would capture the top job in the world's second largest economy.And there couldn't be a better spokesman for the otaku. Aso is a self-assured, rich, wisecracking aristocrat who believes his fellow otaku and their manga and anime related obsessions can lift Japan out of its current economic hole. It's what's being called "soft power" - the diplomatic and economic clout of a nation's pop culture. In this case it is Japan's formidable comic-based culture that has conquered the youth of the west in spectacular fashion, starting with Pokemon."Thanks to the otaku, we can send messages about Japanese subculture to the entire world," Aso told an audience in Tokyo's electronics and PC game playground Akihabara. "We should be proud." Aside from cultural bridge-building, though, what Aso has to offer voters is less clear. With the Japanese economy as badly bruised as our own, the electorate will be hungry for real change, not just escapism. Despite his cuddly, comic book-reading persona, Aso is a nationalist prone to verbal gaffes. Meanwhile, his Liberal Democratic party is not riding high in the popularity stakes. Perhaps it hopes for enough bounce from this unusually colourful Japanese politician to retain power in the coming election.
