All Britain's main political parties are keen supporters of the union. All will be campaigning for a no vote in next year's Scottish independence referendum. Only the Liberal Democrats, however, have thought to hold their annual party conference in Scotland in the runup. Their welcome presence in Glasgow this week is a reminder that no party has held a UK-wide annual conference north of the border since the Lib Dems themselves were last by the Clyde in 1995. Labour last held its annual conference in Scotland in 1936, in Edinburgh, while the Conservative and Unionist party has never done so, in spite of its name. That omission is hardly one of Scotland's main grievances, but it is symptomatic of the way the London-based parties tend to think. Given the importance of next year's vote, it is good that the Lib Dems have travelled north â€“ and good that they will be back in Glasgow again in 2014, a few weeks after the referendum.
