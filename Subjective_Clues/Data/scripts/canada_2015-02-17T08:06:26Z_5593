Rob da Bank has announced that his annual festival, Bestival, will stage a two-day event in Toronto, Canada.Taking place on 12-13 June on the shore of Lake Ontario, the new offshoot of the event has been a long time coming, says its organiser. “We have waited 12 years to decide to launch another Bestival outside of the UK and our beloved Bestival, on the Isle of Wight, which has grown into one of the most important festivals in the global calendar,” said the former BBC Radio 1 DJ. “It took a really special city, and an even more exciting site, with Toronto and Toronto island, to make us take the leap.” This is the latest addition to the expanding Bestival brand, after organisers announced a new Southampton two-day music festival. Common People will host as many as 30,000 fans for a mix of rock, indie, pop and dance performers on 23 and 24 May. Da Bank has also recently discussed plans to launch Bestival in Europe.
