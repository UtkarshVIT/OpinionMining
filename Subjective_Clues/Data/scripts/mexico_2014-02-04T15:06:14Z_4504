Which countries have laws preventing violence against women? Which legislate for gender equality? And which countries allow abortion? To launch our new section on the Global development site, looking at women's rights and gender equality, we've taken World Bank and UN data to offer a snapshot of women's rights around the world. Women's hard-won rights are under pressure from reactionary policies. Working in partnership with two organisations – Mama Cash and Awid – we want our new section to offer a safe forum for debate and for sharing ideas, a place to that amplifies the voices of women's rights advocates.Ghana struggling to translate oil money into development gainsSexual slavery in Mexico – a pimp tells his storyTata Nano safety under scrutiny after dire crash test resultsFemale genital mutilation affects a fifth of young girls in sub-Saharan AfricaMove over quinoa, Ethiopia's teff poised to be next big super grainAnna Turley and Zohra Moosa: Why progress in women's rights has been compromisedMark Tran: Needs of least developed countries in danger of being sidelinedClaire Melamed: Development data: how accurate are the figures?Tanya Barron: Empowering girls is about rights, not just economicsAlex Renton: Get a taste for teff, the Ethiopian superfood• Video: Leprosy in Brazil - uncovering a hidden disease• In pictures: Sierra Leone - law and order meets traditional justice• Video: Tata Nano falls short of global crash test standardsWhy does violence against women occur?
