PS3 sales tumble in Japan is the headline on Gamesindusty.biz's little story based on Media Create's research into console sales. It says: "Japanese hardware sales have plummeted for the week ended October 12, hitting the PlayStation 3 hardest and reducing its sales down to 5,734 units, from 7,232 last week." One unexpected result is that the Xbox 360 also outsold Sony's PlayStation 2 in Japan, as well as the PS3. The numbers are 7,763 units against 6,982 for the PS2 and 5,734 for the PS3. Given the dire early sales of both Xboxes in Japan, Microsoft must be slightly chuffed.However, bear in mind that this is merely a fight to be a distant second: Ninteno's Wii was the top selling home console in Japan, shifting 22,877 units in the week. The Wii sold as many as the other three put together.During the whole of September, the Xbox 360 sold 54,793 units in Japan, against 31,798 units for the PS3.In the US, the Wii also led the way, selling 687,000 units in September, according to NPD. The Xbox 360 sold 347,000, while the PS3 did 232,000.In a post last Monday, I noted that Microsoft had cut the price of the Xbox 360 and Sony had declined to match it. Gamesindusty.biz quotes Anita Frazier of NPD saying: "The price reduction on the Xbox 360 helped deliver a month-over-month unit sales increase for that platform of 78%."
