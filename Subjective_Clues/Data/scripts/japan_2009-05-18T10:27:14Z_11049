Japan's main opposition party received a timely boost in the polls over the weekend as its newly elected leader, Yukio Hatoyama, attempts to unseat the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) for only the second time in more than half a century.Hatoyama, who was elected to lead the Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) at the weekend, will be buoyed by newspaper polls out today showing that his party leads the LDP by 13 percentage points, up from a three-point lead in the last poll.According to the Yomiuri newspaper, 40% of people would vote for the DPJ at the next election, which must be held by this autumn, with the LDP trailing on 27%.The opposition's preparations for the election were thrown into disarray in March after a senior aide to its then leader, Ichiro Ozawa, was arrested for allegedly accepting illegal donations.Ozawa resigned last week after it became clear that the scandal could cost his party votes at the election.The election campaign promises to be a battle between two scions of powerful political parties. Hatoyama's grandfather, Ichiro Hatoyama, was the LDP's first prime minister, in 1955; he replaced Shigeru Yoshida, grandfather of Japan's current leader, Taro Aso.Hatoyama, 62, represents a gamble for the opposition with polling day only months away. He is considered part of the old guard and too close to the disgraced Ozawa, whom he immediately put in charge of planning the election campaign.Some observers had expected the party to choose the more youthful Katsuya Okada, 55, a reformer who was more popular than Hatoyama with many voters.Tobias Harris, who blogs on the country's politics at Observing Japan, said that under Hatoyama, the DPJ will struggle to present itself as a viable alternative to the LDP."There are still plenty of reasons to think that the DPJ will have its best ever performance in a lower-house election," he wrote. "But under Hatoyama's watch the party looks that much less impressive, that much less formidable an opponent for a desperate LDP, and that much more vulnerable to the persistent claim of the LDP and its allies in the media that the DPJ is unfit to govern."
