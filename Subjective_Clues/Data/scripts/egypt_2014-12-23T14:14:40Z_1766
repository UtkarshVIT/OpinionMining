Qatar has moved to repair relations with Egypt and its own Gulf neighbours by shutting down a controversial pro-Islamist TV channel that has infuriated the military-backed authorities in Cairo.Al-Jazeera, which is owned by the Qatari royal family, announced on Monday that its affiliate Mubasher Misr (Egypt Direct) was ceasing broadcast immediately until “conditions are favourable” for it to return to Egypt, where it was banned last year.The surprise move triggered speculation that it could pave the way for the release of three al-Jazeera journalists, including the Australian Peter Greste, who will mark the first anniversary of their arrest on 29 December. On 1 January Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed are due to appeal against prison sentences ranging from seven to 10 years on internationally criticised charges of spreading false news and aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation.“Many hope that Mubasher closing is also good sign for al-Jazeera journos currently imprisoned in Egypt,” tweeted HA Hellyer, analyst with thinktank Brookings.Qatar, which backed the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Islamists across the Middle East and north Africa during the turmoil of the Arab spring, has been trying hard to mend fences in a region now dominated by conservative and military regimes – which are all alarmed by the rise of Isis in Iraq and Syria.Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain all withdrew their ambassadors from Doha in protest at its policies, especially its support for the Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi, who was deposed as Egyptian president by the army under its then commander and the current president, General Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, in June 2013.The confrontation plumbed new depths when UAE planes based in Egypt hit a Qatari-backed Libyan Islamist militia during fighting for Tripoli in August. But in September, in the first sign of its shifting policy, Qatar asked seven exiled Egyptian Brotherhood leaders to leave Doha.This month at a summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Qatar even expressed support for “a strong Egypt”. Qatari officials tried to counter the impression that they were changing policies under pressure, and insisted, albeit unconvincingly, on al-Jazeera’s purported editorial independence.The reconciliation drive has been led by Saudi Arabia, which along with the UAE has paid out billions of dollars to support the Egyptian government. On Saturday Sisi met a representative from the Qatari government for the first time since he assumed power this year. A senior Saudi official was also present.Egyptians had long demanded that Qatar shut down Mubasher Misr, whose coverage favoured Morsi and which was one of the few remaining Arabic channels to give voice to Brotherhood supporters and to challenge widening state repression. One pro-regime newspaper maintained a feature called the Jazeera-meter, which tracked the extent to which Mubasher was softening its line.Before the channel’s closure, Sameh Seif Elyazal, a former general and now head of the Gomhouria centre for political and security studies, said: “It’s a big headache for ordinary Egyptians, not only for the Egyptian government. If they shut it down, that would be a first step.”The channel’s coverage had softened perceptibly recently, referring to Sisi as “his excellency the president” in place of its previous description of him as “the first elected president after the coup”.The Brotherhood’s leaders are mostly in jail, but its officials have attributed Qatar’s changing position to international pressure rather than any strength of conviction.Michael Stephens, of the Royal United Services Institute, told Doha News: “It is the first step towards thawing relations between the two countries, and for Qatar to show it is willing to compromise on issues that the UAE and Saudi Arabia view as critically important to regional security.”Additional reporting by Manu Abdo
