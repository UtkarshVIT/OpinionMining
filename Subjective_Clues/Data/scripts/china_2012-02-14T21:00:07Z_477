Talking about the UK government's stance against torture, you make an accusation against China which is unfounded and unacceptable (An independent inquiry shows our commitment to ending torture, 31 January). China respects and protects human rights and has made remarkable achievement in promoting the human rights of the Chinese people. While making continued efforts to develop the economy and raise people's living standard, we remain committed to promoting democracy and the rule of law, with a view to safeguarding and advancing human rights in various  areas. China has all along stood firm in opposition to torture. Chinese law clearly prohibits torture of any form. Since China ratified the convention against torture in 1988, we have made unswerving efforts to bring  our legislation, law enforcement and judicial system in line with international law, so as to ban, prevent and punish torture of all forms more effectively.
