Visit both McCaig’s Tower, a 19th-century monument with views across the bay, and the ruins of Dunollie Castle on the edge of town. Walk along the new path from Ganavan beach to the fascinating Ocean Explorer Centre (free). Support Oban Phoenix, the town’s recently rescued, community-owned cinema.How about further afield?Oban is the gateway to the western isles and the place to start an island-hopping holiday. There are year-round ferries to 25 inhabited islands, including Mull, Iona and Islay.Anywhere for dinner?Try fresh seafood from the stalls on the ferry pier by the harbour, or the specials at the Oban Fish & Chip Shop, such as local monkfish scampi. The renovated Waterfront Fishouse has seabass ravioli and scallops from Mull, while Ee-usk has fantastic seafood platters. Despite the name, Coast has more meaty options, including Argyll venison and East Lothian partridge.

It brews its own beer and stocks 100 whiskies.
