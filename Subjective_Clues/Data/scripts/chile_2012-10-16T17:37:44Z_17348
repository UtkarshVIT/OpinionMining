Britain's ambassador to Chile has been forced to apologise for what was meant to be a private Twitter jibe against Argentina and its defeat in the Falklands war.Jon Benjamin, a diplomat for more than 25 years, was so happy about getting a ticket to World Cup qualifying clash between the South American countries in Santiago on Tuesday that he went more public than he meant with a posting.Adopting a Chilean football taunt that goes "Argentines, faggots, you lost the Malvinas because you are idiots", Benjamin tweeted in Spanish, asking: "Which islands did they take off who and for being what?" But he forgot to make it private.Twitter criticism of the self-styled "Hammers fan, Londoner at heart, Jewish atheist" included threats of violence and antisemitic responses.Benjamin deleted his offending tweet and apologised, saying it had been a private tweet and that he had "great affection for my Argentine friends and respect for their team". The Argentine sports daily Ole said that was no excuse.The Foreign Office said: "Our ambassador to Chile appears to have inadvertently caused some controversy in a tweet. He has deleted it."Benjamin was tweeting as usual on Tuesday, but on safer ground: retweeting the foreign secretary William Hague.
