After a week in which the world's focus was on political change in America, New Zealanders have voted for their first conservative government in almost a decade, ending the tenure of one of the world's longest-serving elected female leaders.Conceding defeat, Prime Minister Helen Clark told her supporters: 'Tonight is not our night.'The country's new prime minister will be John Key, a 47-year-old multimillionaire former currency trader and leader of the National party. Key had campaigned on a theme of change, promising to foster a new 'politics of aspiration'. 'In their hundreds and thousands across the country they have voted for change,' Key told supporters in Auckland. 'Today New Zealanders have voted for action, for a safer, more prosperous and more ambitious New Zealand.' Record numbers of people voted in the election, which polls had predicted would spell the end of Labour's nine-year rule.Clark, a 58-year-old former academic and avid wilderness trekker with a serious, even dour, demeanour, has led the country since 1999. She said she would stand down by the end of the year as Labour leader, a post she has held since 1993. Clark said: 'If I couldn't lead the party to victory, then it is time to go.'Clark won re-election in her district and is expected to stay in parliament for the near future. Key campaigned on a platform of change, but also blamed Clark's Labour government for letting the economy fall into recession even before the global financial crisis hit.The indigenous Maori party, led by Tariana Turia, added another seat to the four it has held since 2005 but fell short of winning its target of all seven Maori seats. Key may invite the Maori party to join his government to strengthen its majority, something Turia has said would be considered.
