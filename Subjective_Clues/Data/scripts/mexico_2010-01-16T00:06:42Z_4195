The darkly surreal edge that saturates both comedy and tragedy in Mexican cinema is a constant source of delight, and there's plenty of it on show in this season of contemporary Mexican talent. Rollicking circus black comedy Meet The Head Of Juan Pérez, for example, revolves around a magician's unfortunate decapitation, while in Rodrigo Pla's art-and animation-suffused The Desert Within, a peasant attempts to thwart a government ban on religion. There's also Daniel And Ana, a shocking tale of kidnapped siblings, and Five Days Without Nora, a heart-warming take on a well-organised suicide.Barbican Screen, EC2, Thu to 27 Jan Whether it's a twirl of Chaplin's cane, fisticuffs between Laurel and Hardy or a cartoon anvil falling on an unsuspecting cartoon head, chances are you're a secret, or not-so-secret, lover of slapstick comedy. And why not? As this sixth slapstick silent comedy festival proves, it's as popular today as ever. Catch up on the comedy that never went out of style with some classic Laurel and Hardy shorts, René Clair's brilliant 1928 screwball comedy The Italian Straw Hat, and documentaries on bygone impresarios such as Fred Karno, Will Hay and even Kenny Everett, usually with live musical accompaniment. There are also gala events in which national treasure Michael Palin discusses his career alongside a screening of Buster Keaton classic The Navigator, and Python/Rutles/Bonzo Dog co-conspirator Neil Innes is honoured with a new documentary, aptly titled The Seventh Python.Various venues, Thu to 24 Jan, visit slapstick.org.uk
