North Korea has moved a step closer to restarting its nuclear programme after removing a UN watchdog's seals from its Yongbyon reactor.Mohamed ElBaradei, the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the agency's board that Pyongyang had said it would reintroduce nuclear material within a week. Analysts have said North Korea would need at least several months - and probably more - to restart the largely dismantled complex.On Monday, North Korea asked the IAEA to remove seals and cameras from Yongbyon, its main atomic complex, after vowing to restart the facility, effectively reneging on a nuclear disarmament deal with the US, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea.At six-party talks last year, Pyongyang agreed to scrap its nuclear programme in return for aid from the US, and in November it began dismantling the Yongbyon plant. North Korea announced last month that it had stopped dismantling its nuclear facilities because of America's failure to fulfil a promise to remove it from the US state department's list of states that sponsor terrorism.Amid reports that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, might be seriously ill, North Korea seemed to harden its position on Friday last week, saying that it no longer wanted to be removed from the list. "We can go our own way," a foreign ministry official was quoted as saying.South Korea today called on North Korea to stop moves to restore its Yongbyon plant and urged its neighbour to return to disarmament talks."We express major concern about the North's continued move to restore its Yongbyon nuclear complex," a South Korean official said. "We call on the North to immediately restart the steps to disable it and return to talks on a verification mechanism."Diplomats and experts said North Korea's decision to restart its nuclear programme was yet another example of its brinkmanship rather than a pressing threat.The US envoy for North Korea, Christopher Hill, this week downplayed Pyongyang's hardened stance, describing it as part of the "rough and tumble" of negotiations. He said North Korea's actions came at a tough time in the negotiating process amid intensifying efforts to get it to agree to a mechanism on verifying its nuclear programme.
