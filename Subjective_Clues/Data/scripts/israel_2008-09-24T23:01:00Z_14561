Paul McCartney visited Christ's birthplace in the West Bank town of Bethlehem yesterday while Israel claimed that a visit he also made there, including a concert in Tel Aviv, was a political victory for the Jewish state.Ron Prosor, Israel's ambassador to the UK, described McCartney's tour as a "diplomatic success of great import"."When one of the most admired musicians in the world not only expresses his willingness to visit Tel Aviv, but also publicly talks about the positive things he's heard about Israel, this is an Israeli diplomatic and PR success of the first order," Prosor wrote in the local daily Ma'ariv.Several Palestinian groups urged McCartney to cancel his trip while an Islamist militant told a British paper that the 66-year-old rock star risked being the target of a suicide bombing attack if he visited Israel. Asked by the Guardian if he was concerned that his visit would become politicised, McCartney said: "Music is a great international voice for getting people together. I will do my best to speak to Palestinians and Israelis and get an idea of what the solution might be and support that. But my little bit is to bring people together through music."McCartney visited the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music where he jammed with Palestinian children. McCartney's entourage has booked 21 suites in the Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv. A butler has been posted on 24-hour duty in his suite and the hotel's chef has been told to cooperate with his personal chef.Before McCartney's performance this evening, a coalition of international aid agencies said that the Quartet of world powers charged with mediating the peace process - the UN, EU, US and Russia - is failing either to improve the lives of Palestinians or the prospects for reaching a settlement with Israel. Oxfam, Care International, Christian Aid, Save the Children and 17 other organisations said the Quartet was losing credibility because it had made inadequate progress or seen key indicators deteriorate since the Annapolis summit last November.Israel continues to build illegal settlements on Palestinian land and there has been only a negligible improvement in the Palestinians' ability to move freely in their own territory, to work, reach their schools or access basic services, they said.The number of obstacles - checkpoints, the West Bank security barrier and restricted roads - increased from 561 at the time of Annapolis to about 600 in August even though Tony Blair, the Quartet's envoy, made the issue of movement and access a priority. Blair is to brief leaders of the group when they meet at the UN in New York tomorrow.Separate reports from the World Bank, IMF and the UN (also prepared for the Quartet meeting) present similarly gloomy views of the big picture in the conflict. Despite the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, the Quartet has been unable to lift the blockade or secure an improvement in the humanitarian situation, the agencies said: 80% of Gaza's population remains wholly or partially dependent on aid, while stalled relief projects have yet to be resumed.
