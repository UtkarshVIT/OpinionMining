Is any bird more underrated than the turkey? Even as Americans prepare to tuck into about 46 million turkeys for Thanksgiving, it retains the air of the dutiful meal; the dull slab of protein that one attempts to drown in sauces or stuffing. Unloved as food, it is also picked on for its looks: humans don't have wattled throats – they have turkey necks. Meanwhile, critics casually dismiss duff ideas, books or albums as "turkeys". But much in this critical weighting of the bird itself is off-balance. For a start, the dryness of which turkey stands accused is a product of its being so low in fat, making it easy to overcook. Yet in the context in which it is normally served – big celebratory meals in which there are guests to be entertained and hundreds of other chores to be done – the easiest thing to do is sling it in the oven and ignore. The result: a bird as dry as the Nevada desert. More can be mustered in its defence: turkey is probably America's first major export to the rest of the world – Columbus took a few back with him to Europe, and from there they spread their way across the Old World. Indeed, Benjamin Franklin even wanted to make the turkey the republic's national bird. "Though a little vain and silly," he wrote to his daughter in 1784, "[it] would not hesitate to attack a grenadier of the British guards who should presume to invade his farmyard with a red coat on." Brave, homely and self-effacing at mealtimes, the turkey makes a suitably generous creature for this season.
