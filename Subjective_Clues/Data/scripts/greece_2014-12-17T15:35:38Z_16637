Greece’s parliament begins the process to elect a new president today. The presidential elections are indirect, meaning members of parliament elect the president.Here are four things you need to know about the vote:1. Stavros Dimas is the government’s nominee. Dimas is a former minister for foreign affairs, and between 2004-2009 he was European commissioner for the environment.2. A presidential candidate needs the votes of 200 members of parliament to secure the presidency. Failing this, a second round of voting is held. If the threshold isn’t met in neither rounds, a third vote - with the number of required votes lowered to 180 - will be held on 29 December.3. The government currently holds 155 seats, so short of the magic 180 mark, and will need independent and opposition MPs to support Dimas for him to secure the needed votes. 4. If the government fails to elect a new president this year, then the most likely consequence will be early parliamentary elections. Far-left party Syriza, which topped May’s European Parliament elections, is ahead in the polls.Based on the current parliamentary arithmetic this scenario seems quite possible.First ballot to elect president in #Greece to start at 7 pm.
