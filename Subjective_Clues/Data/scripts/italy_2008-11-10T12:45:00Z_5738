A Ryanair jet carrying 166 passengers today made an emergency landing at Rome Ciampino airport after birds were sucked into its engines.Two cabin crew and five passengers were taken to hospital with minor injuries after evacuating the aircraft via emergency chutes and the stairs. Ryanair said flight FR4102 from Frankfurt to Ciampino had suffered "multiple bird strikes" as it approached the airport at 7.56am (6.56am GMT). The left-hand landing gear had suffered "substantial damage", leaving the Boeing 737-800 jet stranded on the edge of the runway."As a result, Rome Ciampino airport has been closed to all flights including Ryanair's until sometime late this afternoon," Ryanair said. "The aircraft is still being examined by Ryanair engineers and the Italian aviation authority." The authority said the jet overshot the runway during the landing and "exited beyond the threshold" of the airstrip.The airline said passengers had not been allowed to access their baggage while the plane was being examined. Bird strikes are rare in commercial aviation but can cause significant damage.This morning's incident is the second emergency landing by a Ryanair plane in less than three months. In August, a flight carrying 168 passengers lost cabin pressure over France, forcing an emergency descent to Limoges international airport.
