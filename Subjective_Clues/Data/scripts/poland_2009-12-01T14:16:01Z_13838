Survivors of the Sobibor death camp and relatives of the Jewish prisoners killed there wept in court today as the names of some of the victims were read out in the trial of the 89-year-old accused of being part of the Nazi murder machine.On the second day of the trial of John Demjanjuk, accused of being accessory to the murder of 27,900 Jews at Sobibor, in Nazi-occupied eastern Poland, several co-plaintiffs sat with their heads in their hands as the names and the dates of their transport to the camp by train were listed.Demjanjuk was wheeled into the Munich court on a hospital stretcher.Dressed in a leather jacket and a blue baseball cap, and lying on his side so his back was turned to the public gallery for most of the morning session, he refused to participate in the proceedings. Demjanjuk's lawyer, Ulrich Busch, said his client would exercise his right to remain silent.At one point, the judge, Ralph Alt, interrupted a lawyer when Demjanjuk was heard to mumble. "Herr Demjanjuk wants to say something," he said.But the defendant's Ukrainian translator, who had been whispering translation of the proceedings into his left ear, replied: "No, he's just praying". Demjanjuk then appeared to cross himself.A 10-page charge sheet was read out by the state prosecutor, Hans Joachim Lutz.It described how people were transported to Sobibor in trainloads and "could have been shot at at any time" during the journey.He said Demjanjuk had "mercilessly and callously" helped other guards and SS soldiers to drive people into the gas chambers "because he himself wanted their deaths, believing, too, in the racist ideology behind it."The slow-moving trial was again delayed following the repeat of a request from Busch that the case be thrown out.The lawyer called Demjanjuk's deportation from his adopted home in Cleveland, Ohio, to Germany in May "illegal", and asked why it had taken 30 years to bring the case to court if the evidence against him was so compelling.Demjanjuk tops the list of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's most wanted Nazis.He is believed to have been one of around 150 Soviet war prisoners recruited as camp guards at Sobibor between spring 1942 and October 1943, when 250,000 Jews were murdered.Most of the victims perished within an hour of arriving at the camp.Demjanjuk, who suffers from a low-risk form of a bone marrow illness and other ailments, has been deemed fit to stand trial by three doctors.Individual sessions are being limited to between 90 minutes and two hours in length.Efraim Zuroff, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, said he was concerned that the first day of the trial had been dominated by an assessment of Demjanjuk's state of health."We didn't hear anything about Sobibor, only about his ailments," he said.
