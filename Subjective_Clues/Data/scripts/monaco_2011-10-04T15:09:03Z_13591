Fog was blamed for the success of a surprise raid by a combined fleet of 50 French, Genoese and Monégasque galleys on Southampton on 4 October, 1338. It was the start of the hundred years' war. The attackers had already burned Portsmouth when they moved on to the richer pickings of Southampton.It was Sunday and many of the inhabitants were in church when the overwhelming force entered the town under cover of sea fog. The militia fled leaving many inhabitants to be hanged in their homes. Others believed that St Michael's church would provide sanctuary, but the raiders set fire to wooden buildings nearby and massacred the congregation. Altogether 630 townsfolk were killed, about a third of the population. Others were taken as slaves. The raiders were not invaders but were more like pirates. They were after the valuable wool, which was Southampton's major export and its cellars of wine, the major import. The undefended merchants' houses along the quay, with their vast cellars full of potential loot, were the main targets.That foggy day had two lasting consequences. Charles Grimaldi, who commanded the Monégasque ships, used the booty he carried off, including the contents of Edward III's wine cellar, to found the principality of Monaco. The second was the fortification of the port, ordered by an enraged Edward, to prevent a repeat of this blow to English pride. Most of the medieval walls and towers built as a result can still be seen.
