Alexander Lebedev, the owner of The Independent and the London Evening Standard, refused to attend a London conference yesterday because he feared that, if he were to leave Russia, he would not be able to return.Lebedev explained to organisers of the Russian business week forum at the London School of Economics that he risked exile if he were to leave Moscow at present.In his letter, which is posted on his website, Lebedev wrote: "I am extremely sorry for not being able to attend your forum. Lamentable reason is, of course, the decline of business climate in Russia as attempts of the corrupt law enforcement officers to raid my businesses (National Reserve Bank, airline and potato farming) intensify..."These circumstances do not allow me currently to leave Moscow - they may provide for me not being let in back. I wish you enlightening discussions and productive exchanges of opinion!"He concluded with "regards to Mr Lavrov - his is a tough job." This was a reference to the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who opened yesterday's conference in Lebedev's absence.Last November, Lebedev was present when up to 30 masked and armed police burst into the NRB headquarters in Moscow to confiscate documents. The bank later complained to prosecutors that the raid had been a show of power designed to stop Mr Lebedev complaining about corruption. Lebedev helps to fund the opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta in Moscow, and he has been critical of Russia's prime minister Vladimir Putin.Lavrov was heckled after his speech at the opening of the business forum by a protester who demanded the release of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oil tycoon who is serving 14 years in jail.
