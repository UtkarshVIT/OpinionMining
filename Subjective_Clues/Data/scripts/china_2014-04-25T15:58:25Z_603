Chinese legislators have passed the first amendments to the country’s environmental protection law in 25 years, promising greater powers forenvironmental authorities and harsher punishments for polluters.The amendments, which the Standing Committee of National People’sCongress passed on Thursday after two years of debate, will allowauthorities to detain company bosses for 15 days if they do notcomplete environmental impact assessments or ignore warnings to stoppolluting. The new law will come into practice on 1 January.Since China’s environmental protection law was passed in 1989, thecountry has become the world’s second-largest economy and its biggestcarbon emitter; decades of breakneck economic growth have left many of its rivers desiccated and its cities perennially shrouded in smog.Over the past year, the Chinese government has begun to emphasiseenvironmental protection in its official rhetoric. The new law “setsenvironmental protection as the country’s basic policy,” state news agency Xinhua reported.At an annual parliamentary meeting in March, premier Li Keqiang saidthat the government will “resolutely declare war against pollution aswe declared war against poverty”.Yet environmental groups say that China’s greatest environmentalproblems arise from a gap between legislation and implementation.“If you look at China’s air pollution or water pollution control laws,they’re pretty good compared to global standards,” said Ma Tianjie,program director for mainland work at Greenpeace East Asia. “But nomatter how good [the laws] look on paper, the true test will always bethe willingness of local authorities to enforce them.”The amended law will remove limits on fines for polluting factories,which are currently so low that many enterprises prefer to pay themthan take long-term anti-pollution measures. It will also encourage“studies on the impact environmental quality causes on public health,urging prevention and control of pollution-related diseases,” Xinhuareported.“Local officials may be demoted or sacked, if they are guilty ofmisconduct, including covering up environment-related wrongdoing,” the newswire reported. “If offenders' behaviors constitute crimes, theywill be held criminally responsible.”This month, Chinese environmental researchers concluded that nearly60% of the country’s groundwater quality is either “relatively poor”or “very poor”. A separate official report claimed that 16% of thecountry’s land is polluted, some of it with chemicals such as arsenicand mercury. Earlier this month, dangerous levels of the carcinogenicchemical benzene were detected in the northwestern city Lanzhou’swater supply, triggering a run on bottled water.Reducing the country’s noxious smog has also become a challenge forgrowth-minded local officials. On Thursday, the UK shadow climate change minister Baroness Byrony Worthington led a well-attended "trainingcourse" for Chinese mayors on strategies for combatting air pollution.“Every single person we’ve met so far has mentioned the words, ‘smoggy weather,’” said Worthington, who is on a four-day trip to Chinarepresenting Globe International, an organisation of legislatorsfocused on sustainable development. “They fear that the external worldis pointing and laughing at this stage which China’s environment hasreached – it’s a kind of loss of face.”
