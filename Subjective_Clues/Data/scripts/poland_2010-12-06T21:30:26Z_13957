It is the biggest single concrete example of US support for Polish security on the ground. But the leaked embassy cables show that a battery of Patriot missiles in the north-east of the country lacked one crucial component – live missiles.In May this year the Americans finally started rotating the missiles in and out of Morag, close to Kaliningrad, the Russian territory on the Baltic sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. For two years, the Polish prime minister, foreign and defence ministers had sold the Patriots to the public as a great boost to national air defences (against Russia).So when the Americans told them in late 2008 that the missiles would not be live, at least initially, the furious Poles complained they had expected an operational weapon, not "potted plants", the cables report.Even then the Poles did not know the full truth. In February last year, the then US ambassador, Victor Ashe, cabled back to Washington: "Polish officials are not privy to the full range of US planning and thinking with regard to the prospective Patriot battery rotation here, but they do have expectations – some naive, some tactical."This is a good juncture to point out the most glaring gap in understanding between us and the Poles. The Poles have not been told that the battery will rotate without actual missiles – ie not only will the rotation not be operational in the initial phase, but it will also not be operational, and certainly interoperable, at any point in our current plans. This will be a question of basic definitions for the Poles: is it a Patriot battery if it doesn't have live missiles?"The Poles think the Patriots will become not only operable, but interoperable, over time – thus enhancing Poland's air defence."The Poles also believed the Patriot installation would be permanently manned by 110 Americans, while the US was planning to deploy at most 30.It was not until November last year that Vershbow told the Poles bluntly that the Patriot battery "will be solely for training and exercises".The Americans rubbed salt in Polish wounds by stressing that "the Patriot battery would not be operational at any time … It was made clear that training opportunities would be limited to basic familiarisation training due to current disclosure restrictions unless Poland decided to buy Patriot systems."While, publicly, the Polish leadership continued to stress the centrality of the Patriot battery to national defences, privately top officials talked only of its "political importance"."[Polish defence minister] Klich did not repeat government appeals that Patriot rotations be integrated into the Polish air defence system and include 'live' missiles, as he did in a meeting the previous week."Stanislaw Komorowski, the deputy defence minister and former ambassador in London, who did most of the negotiating, died a month before the Patriot battery arrived in the plane crash at Smolensk in Russia that killed scores of the Polish elite.In November last year he admitted that "the Patriot's contribution to Polish air defence is minimal, though important symbolically."Ian Traynor
