The world's leading troupe of dervishes and musicians recreate the entranced and entrancing power of the Sufi ceremonies. Dating back 700 years, these follow an established ritual order, from the opening chanting of Sufi poetry to the climactic whirling dances of the dervishes. For the theatre audiences who see it, the evening promises an extraordinary demonstration of the dervishes' legendary focus and stamina, but it is also a spiritual evocation of Sufi principles and their message of love and tolerance.Â· Festival Theatre, Fri Aug 29 to Sat Aug 30
