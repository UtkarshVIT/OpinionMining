Chinese animal welfare groups have accused the Canadian government of "racist bias" and "cultural imperialism" for selling their country seal products that have been banned by the European Union.A coalition of more than 40 organisations fired off the furious tirade after officials from Beijing and Ottawa signed a deal today to open up the world's fastest-growing consumer market to seal oil, hearts and other meat from Canada's annual hunt.Sealers hope the agreement will save a business that has been hit by high-profile opposition from European animal rights groups, who say the hunt is cruel and unnecessary. Amid a growing outcry, the EU – which formerly accounted for almost a quarter of sales – voted in 2009 to prohibit imports of seal products.To secure an alternative market, the Canadian government has been lobbying China, which has a rapidly growing economy and a huge population with an increasing appetite for meat and a history of eating wildlife with few qualms.The Canadian fisheries minister, Gail Shea, expressed hope that the industry could grow to a new scale. "Now that we have access to a new, very large market for edible seal products, hopefully it can become the industry it once was and provide for Canadian coastal families like it did in the past, or even at a greater level than it did in the past," she told reporters at a gathering in Beijing.Chinese animal rights activists said Canada's use of their country as a "dumping ground" was condescending and undermined their efforts to raise awareness about consumer ethics."Seal products have been rejected by the majority of Canadians and people in Europe and North America. It is insulting for Canada to market these products in China," said professor Lu Di, director of China Small Animal Protection Association. "The perception of Canada's sealing industry that the Chinese eat everything and the Chinese people do not care about animal suffering is indicative of the racist and cultural imperialistic attitude towards non-western societies still held by some Canadians."The seal hunting business is small – about $10m (£6.3m) each year – but politically sensitive, because many of the remaining 6,000 sealers are from Inuit communities, who have traditionally hunted the mammal for a living. Their incomes have collapsed in recent years due to the melting of Arctic ice and diminishing demand. The number of seals harvested has fallen by more than 75% in the last five years, to about 70,000. The price of pelts has also dropped."I'm pleased that the Chinese government has seen through the myths and distortions that have been widely disseminated by animal rights extremists in other parts of the world, such as Europe," said Mary Simon, president of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami organization. "We want to create a stable and secure future for our seal hunters."
