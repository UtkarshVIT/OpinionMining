Israel celebrated its 60th birthday yesterday but the nation's citizens still feel more Jewish than Israeli, according to an extensive national survey.Despite their rejoicing in typical Israeli style, flocking to parks and beaches to barbecue, and marvelling at their military with an aerial show of fighter jets and a naval performance off the coast, a survey by Israel's Democracy Institute showed that 47% identify first as Jewish while 39% identify first as Israeli.President Shimon Peres yesterday hosted a ceremony for past and present army commanders. Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, whose leadership is in doubt with a fresh corruption investigation under way, attended the event but was 10 minutes late and missed the traditional photo shoot.But in Jerusalem's devoutly religious neighbourhood, Mea Sharim, where men dress in long black coats with sidelocks protruding from black hats and women keep their arms, legs and heads covered, there were no celebrations."When the state was started they said it would be run according to Torah and Jewish law and since 1948 it's gone off those lines. The more orthodox aren't necessarily happy with the way things are going," said Mikal, a member of Jerusalem's deeply religious community, many of whom object to the Israeli state.Except for an incident in which members of the ultra-orthodox community assaulted a man carrying an Israeli flag into their neighbourhood, the residents of Mea Sharim went about their business as on any other day.So too did Israel's Arab citizens, who make up 20% of the population. In the southern Jerusalem neighbourhood of Beit Safafa, which fell on the Israeli side of the map when British Mandate Palestine was partitioned in 1948, Israeli Arab shops were doing a lively trade as Jewish traders were closed for the day.
