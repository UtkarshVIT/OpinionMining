Iran last night proposed a meeting with world powers in the next few weeks in Turkey to discuss strategic differences in the Middle East – but it was unclear whether Tehran was ready to negotiate over its nuclear programme.The proposal came in the form of a letter from Iran's chief negotiator on nuclear issues, Saeed Jalili, to the European representative on foreign affairs, Catherine Ashton, who is acting as a co-ordinator for a six-nation group of major powers.A meeting would be the first encounter in over a year. During that time, Iran's relations with the west have remained frozen over its enrichment of uranium in defiance of UN security council resolutions.In his letter, Jalili suggested 23 November or 5 December as acceptable dates for a meeting in Istanbul. He did not specify what the discussions would be about.Earlier in the day, a foreign ministry spokesman said Iran's nuclear programme would not be on the agenda. European diplomats said they were sure Iran accepted that talks on its nuclear plans would be unavoidable at any such meeting.The current plan is to hold talks lasting two or three days, allowing Iran to raise regional security issues, while still leaving time for other countries to raise their concerns about the nuclear programme.Ashton had initially suggested a meeting next week in Vienna. She will now consult the six-nation group – the US, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany – before replying to Jalili.The group reportedly views Turkey as an insufficiently neutral venue. In recent months, Ankara has been more supportive of Tehran. The group may offer Switzerland as a compromise.
