Sumo wrestling's most senior official resigned today and two wrestlers were given lifetime bans after testing positive for marijuana.Kitanoumi, chairman of the Japan sumo association and mentor of one of the disgraced wrestlers, denied he had been forced out by other officials desperate to avoid further damage to the ancient sport's reputation."It was my decision to resign," he said.Last week the sumo association conducted surprise drug tests on all 69 wrestlers in the top two divisions following the arrest in August of Wakanoho, a Russian fighter, for alleged possession of marijuana.He was immediately expelled, becoming the first sumo wrestler banned for drug use in the sport's 2,000-year history.His compatriots, Roho, 28, and Hakurozan, 26, both tested positive, and were banned for life after similar results from follow-up tests conducted by Mitsubishi Chemical Medience - the only Japanese laboratory accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency.The sibling fighters continued to deny the allegations over the weekend and demanded yet more examinations. But a Japanese anti-doping expert said today that the results indicated the pair had smoked the drug rather than inhaling it secondhand.Kitanoumi, who holds the record for becoming sumo's youngest-ever grand champion, has been heavily criticised for failing to supervise Hakurozan, who belongs to his stable."I am filled with remorse because it was my responsibility to keep an eye on my wrestlers at all times," Kitanoumi, 55, told reporters. "They denied [smoking marijuana] and I believed them."Last week's mass testing, the first the association had ever conducted, was supposed to allay fears that more wrestlers are using soft drugs.Instead it has resulted in the downfall of a man many consider one of sumo's all-time greats.He will be replaced by Musashigawa, another former grand champion who fought under the name Mienoumi before retiring in 1980.
