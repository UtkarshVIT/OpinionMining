The Cannes film festival has announced that Grace of Monaco will be the opening film for its 2014 edition.As a biopic of the intensely glamorous princess of the nearby principality who was also a legendary movie star, the film has obvious appeal to the Cannes organisers; it also stars Cannes favourite Nicole Kidman and is directed by Olivier Dahan, the French film-maker behind the popular Edith Piaf biopic La Vie en Rose.However, the announcement comes at an unlikely moment - just as it has emerged that the film's US distributor, the Weinstein Company, have cancelled plans for its release in a row over editing.Grace of Monaco was due for a March release in the US, but Dahan openly disagreed with changes demanded by the company, which is owned by Harvey and Bob Weinstein, labelling the Weinsteins' version "a pile of shit". However, it appears the director has the final word on any re-edit, and has refused to budge, hence the decision to pull the film from the US release schedules.However, the delay has meant the film has become even more attractive to Cannes, who prefer not to programme films that have already been released in overseas territories, and their Grace of Monaco screening can now be considered a world premiere.The Cannes film festival runs from 14-25 May 2014.â€¢ Grace of Monaco director calls Harvey Weinstein re-edit a 'pile of shit'
