One of the most touching moments of the year arrived with an email to our children's books website from a group of New Zealand schoolchildren, mysteriously named Faultline Fiction Fanatics.It went: "We would love to be part of a book club, especially one so far away. We are a group of aged 10 and 11-year-old boys and girls from children from Christchurch, New Zealand."In February our beautiful city suffered a massive earthquakeâ€¦ It is the earthquake which inspired our name. Reading takes our minds of all the damage that is around us and helps us cope. And we love it."Their favourite author, they said, was Michael Morpurgo. We were so touched by their message that we mentioned it to him during a podcast interview, and he sprang into action with this message to them, pledging to have copies of all his books sent to them.Speaking from London's National Theatre, scene of the hit stage version of his novel, War Horse, he said: "I know you people have been living through really difficult times because you've lost a lot, and it must have been appalling."He challenged the group to review his books and tell him how they could be improved. "Make me cry, go on try!"The books are now making their way around the globe and will soon be landing on the Fiction Fanatics' doormats. Meanwhile they sent us this eloquent account of their experiences in the earthquake and its aftermath.
