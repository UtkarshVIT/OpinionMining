Up to 30cm (12in) of snow was expected to fall in parts of Scotland today as the latest band of severe wintery weather arrived in the UK.The Met Office issued a series of warnings for heavy snow and icy roads in northern Scotland and mid-Wales.The effects of the snow in Scotland are likely to be compounded by strong winds, the Met Office forecaster, Philip Avery, said.Further south, a band of heavy and persistent rain is sitting across much of southern England bringing up to 3cm of rain and 2-5cm of snow on high ground in the Chilterns and South Downs."Northern Scotland is the greatest concern where the snow keeps on coming and is blown around by high winds," Avery said.The snow will clear from northern Scotland overnight leaving a cold night and temperatures of around -2C. The weather front will continue to bring rain to southern areas overnight and gradually fizzle out tomorrow.
