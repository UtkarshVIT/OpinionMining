James Murdoch thinks newspapers present one of the great opportunities for innovation and he does not share the growing gloom of other publishers. He also accused the industry - well, that bit of the industry not controlled by News Corporation, of course - of failing to attend to customers' changing wishes. Speaking at the Monaco Media Forum, he said: "The newspaper industry has spent so much time wringing its hands about things that are exogenous and not enough time thinking about customers' daily lives."Titles such as the Sunday Times are promoting other, non-print businesses, he said, while The Sun has become the largest short-break holiday company in the UK and is making millions from online bingo. Sounds exogenous to me. (Source: Ft.com)
