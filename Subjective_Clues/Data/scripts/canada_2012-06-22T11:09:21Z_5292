Canadian authorities have announced that plans to eavesdrop on travellers' conversations at airports and border crossings have been "halted" after a public outcry.Questions about an audio recording policy were first raised last week. Journalists discovered that equipment had been installed at Ottawa's international airport to monitor passengers in the "customs controlled areas". A Canada Border Services Agency official said that no audio had yet been recorded but the technology was intended to "record conversations". The government claimed that it needed such tools to catch smugglers and keep criminals and other unwelcome individuals out of Canada.The extent of the monitoring at Canadian ports of entry is not yet clear but in an email to a journalist, the CBSA said: "AV monitoring and recording technology has been in use for many years," It added that the information was usually deleted after 30 days, and signs warned travellers when they were in an area where audio recordings were made.More than 90% of respondents to a CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) Online poll described the move as "excessive."Chantal Bernier, Canada's deputy privacy watchdog, criticised the CBSA for not following proper procedures – which include submitting to a privacy review by her agency. The CBSA says it is now filing the necessary documents.Perry Flint of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) told the Guardian that while CCTV was now in widespread use, he hadn't heard of audio recordings being made of travellers anywhere else in the world.The move could be illegal under Canada's Charter of Rights, which guards against unreasonable search and seizure. Sukanya Pillay of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association said that any measure intruding on personal privacy had to be "justifiable" and "proportional" under the law, and demanded a privacy review.Vic Toews, minister of public safety, initially defended the policy, insisting privacy rights of "law-abiding Canadian citizens" would be respected. But within 24 hours he was forced to tell the CBSA to stop any audio recording – at least until the review was completed.
