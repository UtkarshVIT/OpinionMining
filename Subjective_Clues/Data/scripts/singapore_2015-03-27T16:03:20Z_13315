Hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans have been paying their respects to the state’s founding father Lee Kuan Yew. State officials have advised citizens to stop queuing, after the huge numbers waiting in line to view the former prime minister led to waits of up to ten hours. Dignitaries from around the world are expected to attend Mr Lee’s state funeral takes place on Sunday.When we published our editorial on Mr Lee’s legacy, we heard from Singaporeans’ thoughts on his time in office, and their hopes for the state in his absence.“He was never a king of ours,” said one. “He was just a great leader who propelled us to first world status. While I feel sad at his passing I feel that it is also a new beginning for us.”“This article shows LKY to have been a great man and politician,” said another. “We need the media [in Singapore] to recognise that he was human and flawed, too.”Living in Singapore? We’re like your help in capturing the mood of the nation at this key moment in its history. Please share photos of Singapore, and, if you wish, share your views on Mr Lee’s stewardship, and your hopes for the future of the city state. We’ll publish the the most interesting contributions on the Guardian site.
