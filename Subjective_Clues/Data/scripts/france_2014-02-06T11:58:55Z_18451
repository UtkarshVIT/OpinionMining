France became the first European country to destroy its stocks of illegal ivory on Thursday in a dramatic warning to those involved in the lucrative wildlife trade that is endangering elephants and other species.The three tonnes of ivory, mostly elephant tusks packed into white builders' bags, were unloaded from a lorry at the Champs de Mars in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower and laid out on a blue tarpaulin.In bitterly cold drizzling rain, the tusks were fed one by one on to a conveyer belt and into a pulveriser that spewed out a fine, dirty-white dust.It was intended as a powerful message to the poachers and traffickers: there is no future in ivory.The destruction of France's impounded ivory comes as London prepares to host a global summit to tackle the $19bn a year illegal wildlife trade on February 12 and 13, led by Prince Charles and David Cameron, to which 50 heads of state have been invited.Most of the tusks, either whole or carved into batons of ivory, weighing 2,304kg, had been seized by customs officers at Roissy and Orly airports either in freight cargo or from passengers.A further 15,357 pieces of ivory, including statues and jewellery, weighing 800kg, were also fed into the grinder. Officials said the powder would be encased in a composite material to make it impossible to retrieve, and used in construction.Philippe Martin the minister for ecology, durable development and energy, added that all ivory seized in France in future would be destroyed, apart from samples kept for scientific or educational purposes and those items that might help trace traffickers."The destruction of illegal ivory has become indispensable in the fight against trafficking of threatened species. It's a firm message that we are sending to the dealers who are threatening the survival of the elephant in Africa," Martin said."Our weapons against the illegal trade in wild species has been considerably reinforced and will continue to be in 2014."He said France had increased fines against those dealing in illegal ivory by up to 10 times."The message to the poachers and traffickers is clear: the trafficking of ivory has no future; with this action we are telling them ivory has no value."Hubert GÃ©ant, the director of police at the national office of hunting and wild fauna, said: "The contraband from wild animals has become the most lucrative criminal activity after drugs, fake money and the trafficking of human beings."All species included it brings in more than $14bn. Pure ivory can bring in $2,000 a kilo in the Asian black market, it's main destination. We estimate that the illegal trade in wild specials involves 500-600 million tropical fish, 15 million fur animals, five million birds, two million reptiles and 30,000 primates."In November last year the United States destroyed six tons of illegal ivory and in December China ground up the same amount.
