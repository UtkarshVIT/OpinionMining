Recent overtures by Turkey towards Kurds within and beyond its borders signify a major policy shift from Ankara. Domestically, Turkish president Abdullah Gul has declared the Kurdish question to be the "country's most pressing problem", while across the border in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Irbil, a conference in February brought together more than 100 officials and academics from both Turkey and the Kurdistan region of Iraq. More notable still is that Gul recently visited Iraq and met Nechirvan Barzani, prime minister of the Kurdistan regional government – the first time a Turkish leader has formally met an official from the Kurdish government.With more than 25 million Kurds straddled across borders between Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria, and with no state of their own, there is still some way to go for a complete resolution to the Kurdish problem. Turkey's engagement with the KRG and attempts at properly and openly addressing its own Kurdish problem for the first time is nevertheless substantial progress.More promising still is when the head of Turkey's traditionally anti-Kurdish military, General Ilker Basbug, speaks of a need to tackle the Kurdish problem from its social and economic roots or states that "even a terrorist is a human being". This is, after all, the same Turkish state that has historically denied the existence of the Kurdish identity and suppressed Kurdish human and civil rights and that has fought a domestic battle with the Turkish-born, but Kurdish, guerrilla organisation the PKK, resulting in more than 30,000 deaths.Similarly, relations with neighbouring Iraqi Kurds have historically been marked by distrust and heated exchanges as a consequence of issues related to KRG autonomy, its ambitions to annex oil-rich Kirkuk (which the Turks consider the economic engine of any future Kurdish state) and as a result of countless Turkish military incursions into KRG territory in pursuit of suspected PKK targets. Turkey as recently as 2007 refused to recognise and engage with the KRG.Now, however, geopolitical realities demand the cultivation of new relations to meet new challenges. By taking genuine steps to remedy its internal Kurdish problem – for example by establishing a 24-hour state-run Kurdish broadcasting station – Turkey takes itself towards stability, prosperity and eventual EU accession. But it also lays an otherwise difficult-to-lay foundation on which to build a sustainable relationship of mutual interests with the KRG – one based on security and strategic co-operation, and which counters the increasing reach of Iran.The KRG offers Ankara the opportunity to counter Iranian expansionism without embarking upon the costly endeavour of alienating Tehran: Turkey is heavily reliant on Iran for its energy needs (Iran provides a fifth of Turkey's natural gas) and is enjoying a growing economic partnership expected to take Turkish-Iranian trade to $20bn in the next two years.By building on the economic opportunities already exploited by about 500 Turkish companies currently operating in the relatively stable resource-rich Kurdish region, Turkey creates an axis of secularism with the KRG that acts as a buffer against instability in the rest of Iraq.Through this axis, Turkey firstly secures its counterweight against Iranian expansionism and secondly aborts the birth of an independent Kurdish state (making way, as a result, for compromise over issues like Kirkuk). Moreover, as the protector of land-locked Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkey simultaneously guarantees its access to the region's huge reserves of oil and gas and increases its diplomatic clout.The KRG, as a result of this guarantee of long-term inviolability, increased diplomatic and economic co-operation and unwavering Turkish support for Kurdish oil exports, benefits from increased foreign investment, technological expertise and access to the European markets that Turkey could offer as a transit country – something Iran could not offer and something that Baghdad would otherwise successfully impede.Turkey of course still has the option of choosing Baghdad over the Kurds to secure its foreign policy interests or it could forge an alliance with both; indeed, its nationalist establishment may still prefer the hardline stance towards the KRG, believing this will force it to give up the PKK (see agreement between Iraq and Turkey). But Turkey and its military establishment, which have a greater fear of Islamic Iran than the isolated PKK, no longer have the benefit of choice. Turkey has already lost its Baghdad pawn to Tehran, which trained, armed and funds the ruling Shia parties.Turkish-Kurdish history and the complexities of the Middle East might, at first sight, suggest no end to the impasse between Turk and Kurd. But time is running out for Turkey. Uncertainty and concern, the two hallmarks of the Turkish-Kurdish relationship, could transform the Kurds, historically Turkey's achilles heel, into its greatest asset amid an uncertain post-Saddam region witnessing decreased western influence and a rising, intransigent, controllable, but not stoppable Iran.
