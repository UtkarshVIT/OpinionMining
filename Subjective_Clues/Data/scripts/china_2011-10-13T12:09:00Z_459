What China slowdown? We're going gangbusters. That's the rough translation of today's update from Rio Tinto, the big Anglo Australian miner. Chief executive Tom Albanese said:Whilst we are mindful of current market volatility, the fundamentals are holding up well, particularly for bulk-traded commodities. We are operating at full capacity, selling all we produce and our growth programme is on track, supported by the strength of our balance sheet.Not much sign of doubt there.

In the middle of September at an investor conference he mentioned that "in a few cases, customers are asking to reschedule deliveries". No mention of that in today's update.Rio's confidence, it should be said, is supported by the prices of iron ore and coking coal, the two bulk commodities that represent about 70% of the miner's turnover. While the price of copper has fallen about a third from the recent top, iron ore and coking coal – feeding the Chinese steel-making industry – are still priced at close to peak levels.Hold on, though, growth in Chinese trade slowed in September, we also learned today. Of course, a 17% increase in exports from a year ago, and 21% growth in imports from September 2010, can hardly be described as weak.

The IMF warned today that the eurozone crisis represents a "severe" risk for Asia - it has cut its growth forecast for Asia for this year from 6.8% to 6.3%.The progress of Rio's share price (or lack of) this year gives a sense of investors' uncertainty – down a lot, down some more, up a bit …
