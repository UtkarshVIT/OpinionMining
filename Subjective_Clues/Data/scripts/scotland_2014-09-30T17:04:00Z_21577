If you thought some key social policy aspirations in the Scottish government’s ambitious independence white paper were shelved after last month’s referendum perhaps it’s time to think again.Whatever the outcome of talks designed to give Scotland fuller self-government within the UK – and the three main Westminster parties promised the earth to secure a no vote – Holyrood will shortly begin the process of assuming some taxation powers under legislation approved by Westminster in 2012.A new body, Revenue Scotland, will be created next year to oversee a Scottish rate of income tax from 2016 – for some a modest, but nonetheless significant step towards fuller fiscal autonomy.Under this deal, the Scottish government will control 10% of income tax revenue, worth around £5bn – giving it the power to raise tax above this level to fund ambitious social care programmes outlined in last year’s white paper.It made clear an independent Scotland would not be required “to raise the general rate of taxation to fund existing levels of spending”. But how, you might ask, could the country fund, say, one key plan for “transformational changes in childcare” from the age of one – creating an estimated 35,000 jobs – without raising spending?One leading Scottish finance expert is in no doubt that Holyrood – if it has the political will – will soon have the ability to begin an ambitious social care programme, moving towards a Nordic model lauded in that white paper.The Scottish government’s cabinet secretary for finance, the SNP’s John Swinney, says cautiously that the administration will have to decide towards the end of next year about what rate of income tax it should recommend to Holyrood.“No decisions have yet been taken about setting the rate – at 10p, above or below that level,” his department added. “Clearly these will be major decisions.” Too right.Of course, much will depend on the outcome of a fast-track commission, under the businessman Lord Smith of Kelvin, tasked with overseeing the process of greater devolution in line with the promises made by the three main Westminster party leaders. Agreement is needed by the end of November so that the draft bill can be published by 25 January, Burns night.The Tories, for instance, want all tax to be transferred; Labour, while favouring the transfer of some welfare functions, such as attendance allowance and housing benefit, has been more cautious – although the former prime minister Gordon Brown promised Scots they would be rewarded with a “modern form of Scottish home rule” if they remained in the union.For his part, Swinney – a member of Lord Smith’s commission – notes that the three main parties vowed to deliver substantial further devolution that included a “significant transfer of taxation and welfare powers”.The ideological divide between Labour and the SNP in the UK – though, not necessarily, with a semi-detached Scottish Labour – appears wide. Swinney, for instance, is at odds with the continued austerity favoured by the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls – preferring a fiscal stimulus to help revive the economy.Viewed from the outside, it’s hard yet to see an agreement in the Smith commission that will satisfy the SNP government – although, to be fair, discussions have barely begun. But, assuming that some welfare and more taxation powers will be devolved to Holyrood, supplementing those already agreed for 2016, the implications for England will be profound.How long, for instance, will English councils be prepared to operate in the vice of an ever-tightening funding settlement – they’ve already made savings of £10bn in this parliament – when Scots are granted a degree of fiscal independence while still enjoying a more generous Whitehall funding settlement?On the back of the referendum, Scotland is right to press Westminster to honour pledges made in the heat of last month’s campaign. But next year, England, the ultimate centralised state, deserves some reciprocity.
