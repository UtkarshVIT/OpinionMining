In the South Ayrshire town of Troon, a group of sixth form pupils are working hard to scotch the myth that our young people do nothing but cause problems in their neighbourhood by drinking, getting into trouble and indulging in antisocial behaviour.Tired of some reporting that painted the town's young people as drunk and disorderly, the enterprising group is taking part in a "pro-social behaviour" pilot project that sees them teach alcohol awareness to younger pupils at the school.This initiative, which has been repeated in schools across the region, followed a session run by the pupils in which they gathered local decision makers and adult members of the community together in a local hotel and challenged the negative perceptions that persisted around the behaviour of Troon's young people.There they delivered the essential message of the pro-social behaviour pilots – which are now being run by Young Scot and partners in various forms elsewhere in Scotland – that young people are far more likely to contribute to their local community than cause harm to it.The pilots, which have also seen young people make DVDs, run market stalls and present a regular show on Radio Borders, have grown out of the Scottish government's framework for tackling antisocial behaviour in Scotland.Published in 2009 in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), the strategy has at its heart the notion that criminal punishment is just one part of the solution to this problem. It is an important part, but we cannot simply rely on reactively punishing those caught for these offences.We must start to address the underlying issues that cause antisocial behaviour – issues such as drink, drugs and deprivation – and begin to engage our young people and encourage them to make a positive contribution to their neighbourhoods.The Promoting Positive Outcomes framework recognises that as well as effective criminal punishment, the policy we deploy at a local and national level needs to focus on prevention as well as early and effective intervention. It aims to promote positive behaviour in Scotland's communities by creating more choices and chances for young people and stopping the behaviour that can bring misery to law abiding citizens in the first place.This is not a soft option. As well as continuing to rely on the excellent work of police and prosecuting authorities in punishing bad behaviour, this strategy looks to make offenders face up to and overcome the deep-rooted problems that is causing their behaviour – a much better way to protect communities over the long term.As such, we believe the main focus for local agencies should be on making prevention the priority with education and support for young people central. We don't want to keep taking enforcement action over and over again – we want to stop antisocial behaviour for good and help people to realise their potential.This is evidence-based policy that is strongly supported by the police, local authorities, the judiciary, community justice authorities and widely within academia. We also have the support of the Children's Reporter Administration, the voluntary sector – including Victims Support Scotland, and – most importantly from within our hard-pressed communities.Alongside Promoting Positive Outcomes, we have made significant strides with our CashBack for Communities programme, that provides diversionary activities for young people and is funded by money seized from criminals under the Proceeds of Crime Act.Since its launch in 2007, we have invested more than £35m in these projects and more than half a million young people have taken part. The cashback projects are open to all, but the resources are concentrated in areas with problems with high crime and antisocial behaviour.There is more work to do, and because of the very nature of a long term strategy, some of the value will not become evident in reducing antisocial for some time. But if we truly wish to reduce antisocial behaviour in the long term, and put our young people on a positive path in life, we must solve the deep-rooted problems that fuel the problem.Fergus Ewing MSP is minister for community safety for the Scottish governmentThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
