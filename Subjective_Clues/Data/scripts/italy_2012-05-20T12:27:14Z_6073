Aftershocks continued to be felt in northern Italy on Sunday after a strong earthquake in the early hours killed at least four, injured more than 50 and reduced historic churches and castle towers to rubble.The epicentre of the quake, which the US Geological Survey recorded at magnitude 6.0, was 3.2 miles below ground, north of Bologna in the Emilia-Romagna region, and was felt across Italy, from Liguria to the Veneto.Hundreds of terrified residents fled their homes and hospitals were evacuated after the 20-second earthquake struck at 4.04am. While major towns including Bologna emerged unscathed, helicopters were flying over remote villages as day broke, looking for collapsed buildings in which survivors could be trapped.Four people killed by the quake were working overnight in factories which collapsed, including Geraldo Cesaro, 57, one of 10 employees at Tecopress, a maker of aluminium car parts in Sant' Agostino, where the town hall was seriously damaged and in danger of collapse ."We think everyone else got out of the factory, but he didn't make it out in time," said the firm's human resource director, Adriano Orlandini, after rescuers located Cesaro's body amid the rubble of the 45-year-old factory.Police were called to the site on Sunday as a group of Nigerian workers demanded information about a missing colleague. "I could never have imagined the violence of the quake here," said Orlandini as firefighters picked through wreckage.Two more night workers died at a nearby ceramics factory and a fourth man, a Moroccan, died when he was hit by a falling beam at a plastics factory in Ponte Rodoni di Bondeno. Two women, one German, died after reportedly suffering a heart attack during the quake.The last serious earthquake to strike Italy was the 6.3 scale shock in L'Aquila in 2009 which killed nearly 300.In the town of San Felice sul Panaro, the tops of several towers of a 14th-century castle collapsed while churches in the town were seriously damaged.In Finale Emilia the historic Palazzo dei Veneziani partially collapsed. Eleven residents survived but were forced to knock down a wall to escape. The Castello delle Rocche in the town was also damaged, while a clock tower was split down the middle, one said, disintegrating into rubble."After an initial survey, damage to cultural patrimony appears significant," Italy's cultural ministry said.In Finale Emilia a five-year-old girl was pulled out of a collapsed building after rescuers were telephoned by a doctor in New York. The girl's mother, who had been unable to get through to emergency services, had called the doctor for help.
