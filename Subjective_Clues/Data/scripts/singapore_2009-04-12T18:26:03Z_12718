Karam Butalia, former head of Standard Chartered's private equity operations, has received a departing pay package worth £16m, making him one of the best-paid executives to have worked for a London-listed bank last year.The payout was four times more than that received by Butalia's then boss, chief executive Peter Sands, who took home $6m (£4.1m). It is also close to the £17m in cash and shares received by Barclays' investment banking boss Bob Diamond.Among the few other executives of London-listed banks known to have been paid in double-digit millions is HSBC's Tom Cole, a New York-based banker who, like Butalia, heads up the firm's private equity financing operations.Despite receiving his MBA from Hull University, Butalia, 55, has spent almost none of his 30 years in banking in the UK. Although he oversaw Standard Chartered's private equity business around the globe, his six years at the bank saw him based in Singapore and working predominantly on Asian-focused leveraged buyout deals.His £16m pay deal is believed to represent the crystalising of several years' worth of long-term profit-sharing awards. He is not understood to have featured among the bank's very highest-paid employees in previous years.The filings reveal that the highest-paid executives at Standard Chartered were in total paid £46.2m.The pay packages of Butalia and Cole give a rare insight into the scale of remuneration below board level at UK-listed banks. Whereas corporate governance campaigners often focus on the rewards of decision makers in the boardrooms of banks little is known about the pay of star earners. Their pay deals have come to light only because of a regulatory requirement of companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
