Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) is poised to regain the power it lost 12 years ago after seven decades in charge of the country.The official quick count of a large sample of polling stations announced late on Sunday gave the PRI's candidate, Enrique Peña Nieto, around 38% of the vote and a lead of around seven percentage points over his nearest rival."This Sunday Mexico won", Peña Nieto said at his party's headquarters in the capital to the strains of a popular mariachi song, accompanied by his soap opera star wife and children. "Mexico voted for change with direction," he added.During his speech, the slick, telegenic former governor of the country's most populous state was at pains to address fears that a PRI comeback would mean a return to the periodic authoritarianism, corruption and corporatist hubris that had characterised the party's political hegemony for most of the last century."Mine will be a democratic presidency. We are a new generation and there will not be a return to the past," he said. "In today's plural and democratic Mexico everybody has a place."The candidate has also faced protests by students who shook up the electoral campaign with a movement that rejected his candidacy as a step back in the country's fledgling democracy, and focused attention on alleged bias in his favour by the media.Peña Nieto spoke shortly after his nearest rival in the quick count, Andrés Manuel López Obrador of the leftwing Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD), told his supporters he would wait until he had "all the information" before stating his formal position.The count gave him around 31% of the vote."The last word has not been spoken," López Obrador said.Despite claiming the campaign had not been fair and suggesting his own data differed from the official figures released so far, López Obrador's measured tones contrasted sharply with the radicalism that marked his refusal to accept defeat at the last presidential election six years ago. On that occasion his claims of fraud sparked a bitter post-election political crisis that lasted the entire five-month transition period.The governing National Action party (PAN) and its candidate Josefina Vázquez Mota were the unquestioned losers of the night. The quick count gave the first female presidential candidate ever to stand for a major Mexican political party around 25.5% of the ballots.Surrounded by members of her campaign, the candidate smiled throughout her acceptance of defeat early on in the night. She nevertheless had words of warning about a possible return to authoritarianism as well as for her own party, whom she urged to return to its origins in citizen organisation.Vázquez Mota's bid was hampered by widespread frustration at the brutal drug war that rages in many part of the country and the mediocre economic growth that has accompanied two successive PAN administrations, first under Vicente Fox and then under Felipe Calderón.She also received little obvious help from Calderón, who chose not to push the limits of legal restrictions on his own political activity during the three-month campaign as previous presidents have done.The election was peppered with reports of vote buying and other irregularities, but nothing that immediately appeared as something that could make up such a large difference.The president of the National Election Institute, Lenardo Valdez, hailed the election as "exemplary" and claimed that with it "we have consolidated our electoral democracy". He said turnout had been healthy at over 62%.While Peña Nieto's lead seems irreversible, it is smaller than many had predicted. Most pre-election polling had suggested he would win by well over 10 percentage points.The figures imply that the PRI is unlikely to be able to complement its control of the presidency with control of the legislature, which the electorate also voted for on Sunday.
