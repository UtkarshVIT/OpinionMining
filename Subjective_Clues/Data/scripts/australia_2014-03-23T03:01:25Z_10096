Labor will return to government in South Australia with the support of Geoff Brock, an independent MP.Jay Weatherill, the incumbent premier, announced Brock had agreed to support a minority Labor government and would receive a ministry. The announcement comes a week after a state election left Labor with 23 seats and the conservatives with 22, leaving two independents holding the keys to government."Mr Brock has chosen the Labor minority government here in South Australia."Brock told reporters in Adelaide he had accepted the position of regional development minister in Weatherill's cabinet, as well as responsibility for state and local government relations. "These portfolios will allow me to provide a voice for regional South Australia," Brock said.He has pledged to back the government on issues of confidence or supply but will remain free to vote against Labor on other issues.Brock said fundamental to his decision was the potential instability that could have resulted had he opted to support the Liberals.With Labor holding 23 seats in the 47-seat House of Assembly after the election and the Liberals 22, the balance of power was to rest with Brock and fellow independent MP Bob Such.Labor needed the support of just one independent to form a minority government; the Liberals needed both.But the uncertainty escalated on Saturday when it was revealed that Such was in hospital ahead of surgery on Wednesday and will take up to two months' sick leave.Had Brock sided with the Liberals, it would have left the major parties tied at 23 votes each and the potential for a fresh election to be called.Opposition leader Steven Marshall is yet to respond.South Australian Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: "Progressive South Australians have had a win today." There would have been election fatigue if the state had been forced to go back to the polls, she said.
