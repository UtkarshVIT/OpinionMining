The Singapore government has launched a training programme which hopes to create expert leaders across five sectors.The Public Service Leadership programme will prepare up to 500 officials for senior positions in economy building, infrastructure and environment, security, social affairs and central administration.According to Singaporean news website Channnel News Asia, candidates will include graduates, entrants from other sectors and nominees from within the service.Teo Chee Han, the deputy prime minister and minister for the civil service, said the programme would create a pool of expert leaders in each sector, as well as building strong teams with "a deeper range of governance capabilities, perspectives and expertise".It will be run by leadership committees from each sector, with input from senior permanent secretaries. The scheme will be overseen by the Public Service Division in the prime minister's office.Peter Ong, head of the civil service, said that by investing more resources in training, the government would develop "specialist leaders" who would go on to train colleagues at various levels.According to iGovernment, the curriculum and learning materials will be available to all employees regardless of whether they are part of the scheme. The website also says they will take part in placements across the sector.Ong hoped the programme would help civil servants of all grades "feel fully engaged and take pride in their work".In his Global Public Leaders Series lecture last year, Ong stressed the importance of strong leaders who are "far-sighted, adaptive to change and able to pull together a successful and highly capable team", adding that this requires "a constant unease about the status quo".• Want your say?
