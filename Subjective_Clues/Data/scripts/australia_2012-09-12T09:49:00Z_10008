A thriving industry depends on a steady intake of new talent.For that reason, the Australian government's Resourcing the Future report released in 2011 was cause for concern. The report predicted a major and growing shortfall of qualified tradespeople across the Australian construction, gas and mining industries, unless employers acted quickly to bridge the skills gap.The findings of the report came as no surprise to Debbie Butler from Anglo American's metallurgical coal business. As principal of operations training in the HR team in Brisbane, Debbie had already been working on her own study of Anglo American's trade's workforce, and identified a low intake of apprentices.But Debbie also saw an opportunity. As the government's needs dovetailed with Anglo American's, the timing was ideal to join forces to develop new and innovative ways to bring fresh talent into the business.Under her own initiative, Debbie has been working with the National Apprenticeships Steering Committee to design an Advanced Entry Apprenticeship Program. The programme recognises workers' existing experience and equips them with the skills they need to attain full trade qualifications in just 18 months (standard apprenticeships take four years).Twenty-five apprentices are currently taking part in the programme, each selected after a painstaking process to find exceptional talent.The programme would not have been possible without Debbie's dedication to partnership. She has worked tirelessly with government, industry bodies and internal stakeholders, allying concerns and adding her voice to steering committee forums."The programme could not have got off the ground if it wasn't for Debbie's efforts in partnering industry bodies, above and beyond her normal workload," says David Diamond, regional head human resources. "Her enthusiasm for providing people with an opportunity to gain qualifications and enter the resources industry is inspiring."Copy on this page is provided by Anglo American, sponsor of the social impact hub
