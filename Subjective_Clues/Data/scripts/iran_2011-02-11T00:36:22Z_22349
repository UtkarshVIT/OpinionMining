While the world was watching Egypt tonight, Iran snuck out a claim that it has built a nuclear fusion device.  Press TV reports that:The device uses Inertial Electrostatic Confinement method and can produce isotopes and radioisotopes used in diagnosing and curing cancer. The US, Japan, South Korea, Australia and France are the only countries which boast fusion technology. Press TV did not mention North Korea, which claimed to have mastered fusion technology last May. The Iranian boast is not so bold, though. Tehran is not saying it can generate energy through fusion, simply that it can manufacture medical isotopes. The political significance of the claim is clear. It suggests Iran would not need outside help for its Tehran Research Reactor - a need that was once seen as the basis for a short-term compromise on Iran's nuclear programme, or a confidence-building measure at least. But is the claim feasible? There are many bench-top experiments in fusion going on around the world, and at least one relatively low-tech design which seems to resemble the device Press TV is describing, and which has been shown to be a viable neutron source. But can one of these designs make medical isotopes, or is it a hoax? I would be interested to hear from experts.
