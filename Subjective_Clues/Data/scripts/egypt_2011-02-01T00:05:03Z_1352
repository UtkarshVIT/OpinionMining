The Jasmine revolution in Tunisia has offered much hope across the Arab world. We have seen young and hopeful demonstrators in Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, calling for much-needed reform and democracy in their own countries (Change is coming, 31 January). We offer our support to those courageous young demonstrators. Their aspirations and hopes are legitimate and the Jasmine revolution has shown that it may be possible to achieve them. We condemn the violent repression of those demonstrations and ask western governments, especially EU members and the US, to respect the Arab world's desire for change, and to halt their financial and military assistance to autocratic regimes in the region.David Held, Professor of Political Science at LSEHamid Dabashi, Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University,Inderjeet Parmar, Professor of Government at Manchester UniversityJameson W Doig, Professor Emeritus of Politics and International Affairs, Princeton UniversityJohn Esposito, Professor of Religion and International Affairs at Georgetown UniversityJohn Sidel, Sir Patrick Gillam Professor of International and Comparative Politics at LSEMary Kaldor, Professor of Global Governance at LSENoam Chomsky, Professor (Emeritus) of Linguistics at MITRainer Baubock, Professor of Social and Political Theory, European University InstituteRichard Caplan, Professor of International Relations, Oxford UniversityKevin Morgan, Professor of Politics and Contemporary History at University of Manchester
