An Iranian military supplier faces a death sentence after being found guilty of spying for Israel.State TV reported that Ali Ashtari, 45, a trader in electronic devices, had been supplying equipment to military facilities in Iran.He was accused of relaying sensitive information from groups such as Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation to Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service.Ashtari was detained in 2007 and his verdict issued yesterday by the Iranian revolutionary court, which tries state security cases. Under Iranian law he has 20 days to appeal.Mark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, said Israel had "no knowledge whatsoever of this case".The ruling against Ashtari was the first time since 2000 that an Iranian court had handed down a guilty verdict on a charge of spying for Israel. A closed-door trial in 2000 found 10 Iranian Jews guilty of Israeli espionage, sentencing them to prison terms ranging from four to 13 years.Ashtari's conviction comes amid renewed calls from Israel for the international community to step up diplomatic pressure on Iran over its nuclear activities, which it claims include a missile programme. Iran says it is merely producing electricity.Israel refuses to rule out a military strike against the alleged nuclear weapons facilities. Such a strike would likely give rise to retaliatory attacks against Israeli and western targets throughout the Middle East, backed by Iran.The New Yorker magazine recently reported that the Bush administration had significantly increased covert military operations inside Iran, aimed at destabilising the government.
