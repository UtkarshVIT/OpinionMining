Normally, North Korea's official state news agency is the place to go for reports ranging from the reclusive totalitarian state's unparalleled scientific achievements to the limitless love which its inhabitants reserve for their successive leaders.Yet in what appears to be a genuine world exclusive, the inimitable Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) has now broken the incredible news that archaeologists in Pyongyang have discovered a unicorn's lair.Or rather, the report says that they have "recently reconfirmed" the lair of one of the unicorns ridden by the ancient Korean King Tongmyong, founder of a kingdom which ruled parts of China and the Korean peninsula from the the 3rd century BC to 7th century AD.The KCNA goes on to state that the location happens to be 200 metres from a temple in the North Korean capital, adding: "A rectangular rock carved with words "Unicorn Lair" stands in front of the lair.""The carved words are believed to date back to the period of Koryo Kingdom (918-1392)," says the report.Archaeologists from the Academy of Social Sciences at North Korea's History Institute were credited with making the discovery.The news story comes days after eyebrows were raised by another news story relating to the state officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).On that occasion, it was the online version of China's Communist party newspaper which hailed a report by The Onion naming North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un as the sexiest man alive â€“ not realising it was satire.
