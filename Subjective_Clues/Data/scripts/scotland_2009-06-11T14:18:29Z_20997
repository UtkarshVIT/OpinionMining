Six paedophiles involved in what was believed to be Scotland's largest ring of child pornographers were given jail sentences today ranging from two to 17 years after a harrowing trial last month.The case followed a police inquiry in which nearly 125,000 indecent images were seized, some based on the abuse of babies in the Edinburgh area.The judge, Lord Bannatyne, told the defendants he was passing substantial sentences because of the seriousness of the crimes and the need to combat the trade in child pornography."These offences involve real children and many of the photographs involve children being sexually abused, often in the most appalling ways," he said. "There are real victims of these offences, namely the children who are photographed and abused."The gang's ringleaders, Neil Strachan, 41, a convicted sex offender, and James Rennie, 38, a lesbian and gay rights campaigner, face life terms when they are sentenced next month for more serious offences including the abuse of infant boys they were babysitting.The ring was uncovered during Operation Algebra, launched by police after the discovery of indecent images on a hard drive installed on Strachan's business laptop when he took it for repair.Using digital software analysis from the US and new techniques to trace emails, detectives in Edinburgh were able to tie all eight men into a conspiracy to create, share and then pass on child pornography using file-sharing sites and email.Their abuse and activities lasted for more than four years, and the investigation uncovered activity by about 200 people around the world. Leads on about 70 other people were sent to police forces across the UK.Ross Webber, 27, of North Berwick, Craig Boath, 24, of Dundee, Colin Slaven, 24, of Edinburgh, and John Milligan, 40, of Glasgow, were found guilty of conspiring to participate in the sexual abuse of children as well as other child pornography charges.Milligan, a civil servant, was jailed for 17 years, Boath, an insurance worker, for nine years and nine months, while Webber, a bank clerk, was given eight years and nine months. Slaven was given a three-year sentence, including one year for appearing drunk in court.Neil Campbell, 46, a cake firm manager from Glasgow, was given three years and four months, while John Murphy, 44, a sauna receptionist from Glasgow, was jailed for two years.The 10-week trial heard and saw harrowing and distressing evidence. At one point, the judge adjourned the trial after hearing about the rape of a four-year-old girl, and the court was cleared when jurors had to see some of the most challenging images.Five of the eight men – Strachan, Rennie, Webber, Boath and Milligan – were found guilty last month of conspiring to get access to a child or children to commit abuse. They had conspired to commit sexual offences, including rape and sodomy.Strachan was convicted of attempting to rape an 18-month-old boy in Edinburgh he was babysitting on New Year's Eve in 2005. Rennie was found guilty of molesting a young boy over more than four years; the infant was three months old when it began.Detective Inspector Stuart Hood, of Lothian and Borders police, said: "Operation Algebra uncovered a sickening volume of horrific images, and every single one will have caused the children involved untold trauma."These men shared these vile pictures, and took part in online discussions that would repulse any reasonable human being."As an investigator it is often difficult to reconcile why individuals resort to this abhorrent behaviour. Despite this, Algebra has taught us many lessons and we will use these to target those who seek to commit these crimes."
