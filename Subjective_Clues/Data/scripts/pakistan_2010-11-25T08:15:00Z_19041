The bullet-ridden body of journalist Lala Hameed Baloch, who disappeared last month in the Pakistan province of Balochistan, has been found with a note saying: "Eid present for the Baloch people."Hameed, a reporter and photographer for daily titles Karachi and Tawar, was also president of the Baloch national movement, a political organisation pressing for an autonomous Balochistan. Local journalists believe his critical reporting about the Pakistani authorities and his support for the movement were the motive for his abduction and murder. They claim Pakistan's security officials were involved in his murder.Two other journalists were killed in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, earlier this year.Source: IFEX
