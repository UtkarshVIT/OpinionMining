Even if you don't follow sport closely, you may have noticed that Spain is on a winning streak at the moment: they won the World Cup; Rafael Nadal won Wimbledon for the second time; over the weekend Alberto Contador won the Tour de France and (despite some controversy that led to a £100,000 fine for Ferrari) Fernando Alonso won the German Grand Prix.We're already in the second half of 2010. What's left for the Spanish to win?• Golf Spain's Sergio Garcia isn't having the greatest year of his career, but he's in with a chance at the Greenbrier Classic in a few days' time, the Bridgestone Invitational at the beginning of August and the 92nd PGA Championship after that.• Water Polo Spain won a silver medal at last year's World Aquatics Championships in Rome, after losing to Serbia in the final. Unfortunately the event is only held in odd years, so they'll have to wait until 2011 to go for gold.• The Oscars The Academy Awards are also in 2011, but the films they concern are from 2010. In the past Penélope Cruz has been nominated for three Oscars and won once, but this year the only film she has been in was Sex and the City 2, which is unlikely to garner many statuettes. Her husband and fellow Oscar-winner Javier Bardem has a better shot: he's already won a best actor award at this year's Cannes festival for his role in the film Biutiful.• Gibraltar Trilateral talks between the British territory, the Foreign Office and the Spanish government are ongoing. It's unlikely the UK would simply give up Gibraltar, especially by the end of the year, but the way the Spanish are going right now you wouldn't want to bet against them.
