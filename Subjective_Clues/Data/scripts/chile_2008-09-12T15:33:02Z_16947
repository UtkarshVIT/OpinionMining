A slight clarification to my 9-11 post of yesterday. I wrote in too much of a hurry. Obviously I'm well familiar with the Allende/Pinochet story. What I meant to write was that I hadn't quite grasped that the coup took place on 9-11; or more precisely, that back when I was learning about the coup, it was long before 2001, so the date had no special significance for me. It was only when visiting Chile and reading again about the coup that I thought, ah, 9-11, interesting.Note to Brooklynesque: Why don't you go see a shrink to discuss why you spend so much time reading the work of someone you so obviously loathe? Life's too short.
