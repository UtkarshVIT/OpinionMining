North Korea said yesterday it would eject South Korean tourists from a resort inside its territory which was once symbolic of reconciliation efforts between the two states.The move comes after a South Korean tourist was shot by a North Korean soldier at Diamond Mountain last month, prompting strong protests from Seoul.The North's military unit in the resort said in a statement through an official news agency that it would expel all South Koreans "we deem unnecessary". Tours to the resort were suspended after the shooting, but there are still more than 260 South Koreans working there.North Korea also warned it would take military action against "even the slightest hostile actions" in the mountain resort and its military areas. It said it would limit the passage of South Koreans and their vehicles through the border crossing leading to Diamond Mountain.The warning came two days after South Korea raised more doubts about North Korea's account of how the 53-year-old woman came to be shot dead by a soldier. The North has claimed she strayed into a restricted military area while strolling on a beach before dawn and ran away when ordered to halt.The South said tests at the beach to check North Korea's explanation showed the victim was probably shot while standing still or walking slowly. South Korea's president, Lee Myung-bak, presided over a security meeting yesterday to discuss the North's latest move.
