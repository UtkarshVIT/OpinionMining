Failure to resolve a sharp disagreement over the future of the US military presence in Japan could undermine trust between the two countries, Katsuya Okada, the Japanese foreign minister, said today.Japan's new centre-left government, which took office last September promising a more independent foreign policy, has given Washington assurances it will decide on a new location for a US marine base on the island of Okinawa, by the end of May.But the US, alarmed at a possible deterioration in ties with its key ally in the Asia-Pacific region, has indicated that it wishes to stick to an existing deal agreed with the previous conservative administration."I believe that we have to reach a final conclusion by the end of May," Okada said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. "That's something we can't afford to miss."If that cannot be consummated, I am afraid the trust between the two countries could be undermined."He declined to express a preference for the base's location, saying to do so would fuel current media speculation about a split in the cabinet.Last week, the commander of the US marines in the Pacific said the base should remain in Okinawa and not be moved, as some in Japan have suggested, to the US Pacific territory of Guam."Okinawa is in the perfect place in the region," Lt Gen Keith Stalder said. "It's literally a day away from almost anything that can occur in the region."Okada said he was confident the US would discuss any new proposal by Japan. Under the current agreement, Futenma airbase, located in the middle of a heavily populated city, would be moved to an offshore location in Okinawa, and 8,000 marines would be redeployed to Guam.Okada said he did not feel that US pressure over the base amounted to bullying, although he admitted Washington had been consistent in arguing that the current agreement was the best approach."I don't think the US would utterly refuse to talk to us regarding the conclusion we reach after we have discussed it in the cabinet," Okada said. "If that is the case, there is no point for us to continue to study the matter in the cabinet."He denied reports that the government and the Obama administration had already started negotiating an alternative location for Futenma."We will go to the US after a conclusion has been reached inside the cabinet," he said. "I'm aware that it's not easy to come up with a proposal that would satisfy the Okinawan people and the US government."Okada, speaking hours before Toyota's president, Akio Toyoda, was due to go before US congressional investigators to defend his firm's safety record, said he hoped the global recall of millions of Toyota cars would not further strain bilateral ties."I certainly would like to hope this matter will not undermine the trust of the Americans, not just [in] Toyota as a company, but Japan as a whole," he said. "It is essentially a matter of one enterprise ... there's very little the Japanese government can do."Turning to relations with China, Okada said Japan was concerned about a perceived lack of transparency about Beijing's growing military expenditure.China's expanding military capabilities made the US-Japan alliance all the more important, not just for Japan, but for the region as a whole.But he welcomed China's attempts to persuade North Korea to rejoin talks on its nuclear programme."We would like to see further [Chinese] efforts to influence North Korea," he said, but added, "Japan, South Korea and the US demand that North Korea come back to six-party talks with no conditions. To achieve that we are continuing economic sanctions."Okada's comments came as US negotiators arrived in the region to try and kick-start the talks, which Pyongyang abandoned last year, shortly before it conducted its second nuclear test.Japan's Asahi newspaper reported this week that China had told North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, to abandon his nuclear ambitions, open up the economy and end dynastic politics, in return for more food and energy aid.In an apparent sign of progress, China's president, Hu Jintao, met a senior North Korean official in Beijing on Tuesday and praised the co-operation between the two sides.
