European shares dropped to their lowest level in more than two years after the single currency's debt crisis forced Switzerland to take emergency action to cap the franc's rise on the world's foreign exchanges.Prompting fears of an outbreak of currency wars, the Swiss central bank said it would do whatever was necessary to halt the hot money flows that threaten one of the world's richest countries with recession and deflation.The move to set a limit of 1.20 Swiss francs to the euro came at the start of another turbulent day that saw shares under pressure, US and German bond prices rise and the Norwegian krone become the safe haven of choice for currency investors burnt by the Swiss decision to reverse the appreciation of the franc, which lost a record 9% of its value within 15 minutes of the announcement.Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency brokers World First, said: "That was the single largest foreign exchange move I have ever seen. This is intervention on a grand scale."This turns up the heat on the eurozone and other economies who have benefited from weakening their currency in the past couple of years."Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange strategy at ING, said the Swiss central bank's decision marked "a major new round in the currency war". He suggested the next country to act could be Japan, which is worried about the impact of a rising yen on its export-dominated economy. "Could not Japan also set a minimum US dollar exchange rate as a means to battle deflation?" Turner said.In a statement, the Swiss National Bank said: "The current massive overvaluation of the Swiss franc poses an acute threat to the Swiss economy and carries the risk of a deflationary development."It added that it was prepared to intervene in "unlimited quantities" to enforce the 1.20 limit and was "aiming for a substantial and sustained weakening of the Swiss franc".In recent months, currency investors have been deserting the euro in favour of the franc amid growing anxiety about the ability of Europe's leaders to tackle the sovereign debt crisis that has resulted in bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal and forced the European Central Bank to act to prevent Italian and Spanish borrowing costs spiralling.A general strike in Italy added to the jittery mood, with markets also awaiting the decision by Germany's constitutional court on the legality of the bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal.The Norwegian krone hit an eight-year high as investors sought a new currency refuge after Switzerland's move to curb the strength of the franc, posing a fresh dilemma for a Norwegian central bank that would like to raise rates to curb inflationary pressure.Gold was trading at just under $1,900 an ounce amid predictions that it could test the $2,000 an ounce level over the coming weeks.Speaking to the Treasury select committee, Jim O'Neill, former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said the central problem facing the eurozone was that too many countries had been allowed to join the single currency. He described the situation as "fragile and tricky", and said that the only way the euro could survive was with political unity and a single central eurozone treasury.European banks were the worst performers on a day that saw the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares close at its lowest level since July 2009.The price of credit default swaps – insurance against a borrower being unable to repay – on the UK's bailed-out banks, RBS and Lloyds Banking Group, hit new highs. It now costs about £350,000 to insure £10m of the banks' bonds against default for a year. Investors are worried about a range of problems facing the banks, from European debt exposure to problems raising funds and potentially huge bills looming from US lawsuits.Shares in London posted modest gains after two days of heavy falls, with the FTSE 100 index closing 54 points higher at 5157. However, Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average closed down 101 points, its third day of triple digit losses, despite a better-than-expected performance by the US service sector in August.Financial markets believe the slowdown in global growth will prompt the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to pump more money into their economies, and may persuade the European Central Bank to reverse the two interest rate increases announced this year.Amid evidence that the global private sector is growing at its weakest pace since August 2009, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is likely to cut its estimates for global growth this year and next when it publishes updated forecasts in Paris.JP Morgan's global all-industry output index, which is based on the results of purchasing manager surveys of thousands of companies worldwide, edged down from 52.5 in July to 51.5 last month."Growth of global output eased to its weakest in the recovery to date," said David Hensley of JP Morgan. "Although manufacturing was the main drag, the service sector fared only moderately better."
