The Egyptian authorities have intensified their onslaught on satellite broadcasters and journalists, according to IFEX members. Last week, security forces raided Cairo News Company, which leases services about 40 satellite channels in Egypt, and seized broadcasting equipment. Three satellite TV channels - Al Hiwar, Al Baraka, and Al Hikma - have been banned. The blackouts come at a time when soaring food prices are causing demonstrations that are receiving little coverage in the mainstream media. Journalists and bloggers who tried to cover the protests have been detained. (Via IFEX)
