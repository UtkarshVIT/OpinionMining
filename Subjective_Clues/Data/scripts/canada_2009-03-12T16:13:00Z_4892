A helicopter carrying 18 people ditched in the Atlantic ocean off the Canadian coast today.The helicopter was heading to the Hibernia offshore oil platform when it went down off Newfoundland.One person was taken out of the water and ferried to hospital in an ambulance. At least one other person was spotted in the Â­water, as well as a life-raft, but there is no sign of the helicopter, said Jeri Grychowski of the rescue co-ordination centre in Halifax.The S-92 Sikorsky helicopter went down 55 miles south-east of the provincial capital of St. John's, where it had picked up oil platform workers. The first call for help was placed to air traffic control just before 8am (1pm GMT). "Mechanical problems were reported, but we don't know the nature," Julie Leroux, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, said.A Hercules aircraft and four Cormorant rescue helicopters were on their way to the site, and a coastguard ship and a supply ship were about an hour away.Grychowski said winds were fairly strong in the area, the water temperature was just above freezing and there were waves two to three metres high.Dave Bowen, also of the rescue co-ordination centre, said a mayday call was issued."We don't have any further information on the raft itself," he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
