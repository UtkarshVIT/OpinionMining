When China eclipsed Japan as the world's second biggest economy in 2010, there was less gnashing of teeth in Tokyo than some had expected.Given China's size and dizzying growth over the last two decades, Japanese business leaders accepted long ago that a shift in the economic rankings was inevitable.Japan is more concerned about China's military growth: how it will affect long-running bilateral disputes over territory and access to energy sources, and where it will leave the regional balance of power in an era of post-US hegemony.The potential for bilateral discord was evident in 2010, when a Chinese trawler collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the Senkaku islands, an uninhabited archipelago in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but also claimed by China.The trawler's captain was released after a short detention, but the incident, and several less volatile encounters since, have reminded Japan that, strong economic ties aside, the potential remains for lasting friction with an increasingly formidable rival.There is much at stake for both countries. The Senkakus are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits.Underlying the rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic and economic reasons are concerns in Tokyo about the size and opacity of China's military spending.In response, Japan has reaffirmed its postwar alliance with the US and is building closer military ties to other countries in the region, including Australia, the Philippines and South Korea.Japan has also sought to strengthen its claims to disputed territories by stealth. Its recent decision to give Japanese names to dozens of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, including the Senkakus – known in China as the Diaoyu – drew an angry response from Beijing."No matter what names Japan has given to the islands affiliated to Diaoyu island, it will not change the fact that these islands belong to China," China's foreign ministry said in a statement.Although Japan senses a more immediate threat from North Korea's nuclear missile programme, China will remain a cause for concern as long as its military spending, and the increasingly combative behaviour of its navy, continues.That was clear this month when the chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, called on China to improve transparency over spending after it announced a double-digit increase in its defence budget for the second year in a row."There are some parts in the breakdown of China's defence budget that are unclear, and it's desirable to boost the transparency in the defence budget and China's [overall] defence policies," he said.China's defence spending surpassed Japan's in 2007, making it the second largest spender after the US.To demonstrate the strength of the regional alliance now forming in response to China, Japanese self-defence forces will participate for the first time in joint annual military exercises with the US and the Philippines within the next few weeks.In addition, the coast guard is to be given new powers allowing it to investigate illegal landings on disputed islands, eject suspicious vessels without inspecting them and make arrests.And the proposed relocation of 8,000 US troops from Okinawa will only happen provided Washington is assured of the southern Japanese island's role as a forward-deployment base for its core contingent of marines.In a recent report, Japan's national institute for defence studies warned that China's naval build-up presented a challenge to the country's security (pdf).China's aim, the report said, was to project enough power to deter other countries, including Japan, from independently developing energy resources and put itself on an equal maritime footing with the US."China's increasing assertiveness has had a negative impact on the maritime security environment in the Asia-Pacific," the institute said. "To date, peace and stability in the ocean have been maintained through co-operation between the United States, the only country that can deploy naval forces globally, and many countries that share interests."China's recent behaviour, as demonstrated by its advance into the surrounding waters … is irreconcilable with the existing order in many ways."
