Two British law graduates accused of claiming they were robbed in Brazil to pocket an insurance payout are expected to learn their punishment this week.Shanti Andrews and Rebecca Turner, both 23, went on trial in Rio de Janeiro yesterday and admitted charges of attempted insurance fraud, according to local reports.Andrews told the court she and Turner, who both studied at the University of Sussex, had a laptop stolen during a tourist excursion to the south of the country, according to the Brazilian newspaper O Globo. She admitted adding items that had not been stolen, including a purse, a mobile phone and a digital camera.The court heard from police who dealt with the students, with one officer saying his suspicions were raised by their quietness when they reported the losses, the paper said.The graduates' lawyer, Renato Tonini, previously said the likely punishment would be a fine or community service, although a prison sentence is a possibility.Andrews, from Frant, near Tunbridge Wells, in Kent, and Turner, from Woolton Hill, near Newbury, Berkshire, were arrested on 26 July after allegedly telling police that belongings totalling about £1,000 were stolen during a bus journey during a nine-month world tour. They spent a week in custody before they were bailed to stay at a hotel in Rio.After their arrests, Andrews's mother, Simone Headley, said the two friends were traumatised and it had been a "misunderstanding" at the end of their trip.
