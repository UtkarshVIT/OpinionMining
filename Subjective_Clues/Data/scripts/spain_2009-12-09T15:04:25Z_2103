Dubai, Greece and now Spain. Leading shares have moved into negative territory as Standard & Poor's cut it rating outlook on Spain from stable to negative.So having survived the pre-budget report pretty much unscathed, the FTSE 100 is now down 35.70 points to 5187.43. A opening dip on Wall Street is not helping sentiment.Back to Spain for a moment. Earlier today, before the S&P move, analysts at Credit Suisse issued a note looking at European countries and concluded:To us domestic Spain looks most vulnerable. Unlike in Greece, the price/book relative of domestic Spain is close to an all-time high (2% premium to Europe compared to a normal discount of 20%). Furthermore, the real effective exchange rate is 10% overvalued (i.e. domestic prices are 10% too high, relative to those in Europe, and with wage growth of 4% there has been no adjustment yet - so a 10% decline in price and wages is still needed relative to that of core Europe).Productivity growth has been zero for 20 years, so Spain can't innovate its way out of the crisis. Housing is still 12% overvalued, according to the IMF, (although on a house price to wage ratio of 6.2 we suspect housing is much more overvalued) and at peak 20% of GDP was accounted for by the housing sector and construction. Spain is about 20% overleveraged, looking at private sector debt as a proportion of GDP versus GDP per capita. And its aggregate leverage (private and government) is higher than that of Greece. S&P meanwhile warned that Spain faced a deeper deterioration in public finances and a longer period of weakness than it had expected in January:In our opinion, reducing Spain's sizable fiscal and economic imbalances requires strong policy actions which have not yet materialised.So with Spanish banks lower, there is some uncertainty among their UK counterparts. Royal Bank of Scotland is down 0.13p at 30.32p while Lloyds Banking Group is up 0.27p at 54.04p, off its earlier highs.
