After all the rhetoric, we now come to serious negotiation between the "P5+1" nations and Iran (West issues nuclear call to Iran as 'last chance' talks loom, 9 April). In the face of punitive sanctions, cyber attacks and assassinations of key personnel, Iran is doggedly maintaining its right to refine uranium, under article IV of the non-proliferation treaty. It would be to all our benefit if Iran also cites the blatant contravention by the western nations of article VI – the commitment to progressive disarmament. This obligation, which has been more or less ignored for decades, is now being flouted by development of new weapons systems. Iran has no nuclear weapons and no direct contravention of the NTP has been found there, but here in the English home counties we have more than 5,000 people shamelessly engaged in developing a new generation of genocidal weapons. If any good does come out of the current crisis, it will be to expose this hypocrisy.Martin BirdseyeLondon
