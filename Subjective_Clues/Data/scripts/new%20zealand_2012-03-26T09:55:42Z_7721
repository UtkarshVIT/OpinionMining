New Zealand police have decided not to press charges against a freelance cameraman who recorded a private conversation involving prime minister John Key and a political ally.Key claimed the recording of his discussion with John Banks during the run-up to last November's general election was illegal (as I reported here). Cameraman Brad Ambrose had left a recording device running on a cafe table while Key met with a political ally, John Banks. Key had earlier met with media at the cafe. The recording was leaked online and included a couple of coarse comments by Key.Key's party went on to win the election but fell short of an outright majority.Police assistant commissioner Malcolm Burgess said that although there was a clear case against Ambrose, a warning was sufficient because he had no previous criminal record and had written letters of regret to Key and Banks.Source: AP
