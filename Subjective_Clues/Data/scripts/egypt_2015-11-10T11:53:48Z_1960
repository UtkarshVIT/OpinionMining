He has overseen the widespread curtailing of the Egyptian press since the former president, Mohamed Morsi, was overthrown in 2013. Objections to Sisi’s red-carpet reception focused on mass killings, the imprisonment of Muslim Brotherhood supporters and human rights abuses.Negad al-Borai, a lawyer requested by Bahgat, said on Monday that the arrest was related to an article from October about the trial of military officers accused of a coup attempt. The detention order was for four days but could have been renewed indefinitely and more charges issued. Mahmoud Abou Zeid, another journalist, has been in pre-trial detention for more than two years.
