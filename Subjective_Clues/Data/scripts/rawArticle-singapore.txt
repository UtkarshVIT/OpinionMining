Shares in the Swiss bank are down 46% so far this year. It spent a further $6.88bn in January as part of a $14.5bn funding round for the embattled US bank Citigroup, Two months before, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), which with assets estimated at up to $900bn is reckoned to be the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, invested $7.5bn in Citigroup bonds that will convert to shares in 2010 and 2011 at prices from $31 to $37.But since then Citigroup has become one of the most high-profile casualties of the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US, and its share price has plunged as low as $20 - nearly 40% lower than when the ADIA made its investment.The pain shows no sign of letting up. Two months ago, Citigroup announced it had plunged into the red over the past three months of 2007 and sliced its dividend almost in half as it wiped more than $18bn off the value of its assets because of exposure to sub-prime mortgages. But Wall Street analysts reckon the firm could record a further $15bn write-down for this financial quarter. China Investment Corporation's investment in Morgan Stanley, made just before Christmas, is also facing a significant loss. The securities it picked up for $5bn will convert to stock at $48 to $57 a share in two years' time. At present, however, Morgan Stanley's share price is closer to $42.Another Beijing-backed money manager, China Development Bank, has also suffered as the stake in Barclays it bought in July has plunged in value. When it acquired the 3.1% shareholding, the bank's shares were trading at about 680p each. On Thursday, they were at 429p.The Singaporean fund Temasek is also nursing losses on the 2.1% Barclays stake it bought last year, although its investment in the London-listed bank Standard Chartered has fared better. The bank, which has little involvement in the US sub-prime crisis, has weathered the storm better than many of its peers.The losses sustained by sovereign wealth funds are relatively insignificant when compared with the $3.2tr they are believed to have at their control. Morgan Stanley reckons that with the price of commodities such as oil set to remain high, this amount will balloon to $12tr by 2015. But the losses may dampen their appetite for further involvement in bailing out western banks.Western politicians are increasingly concerned about the power of sovereign wealth funds in their markets. Earlier this week the US government agreed voluntary principles with ADIA and Singapore's GIC to regulate their investments.", "tags": ["Banking", "Investment funds", "Credit crunch", "Business", "Sovereign wealth funds", "Singapore", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Revealed: how sovereign wealth funds were left nursing multibillion losses"},{"date": "2008-01-22T16:53:05Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Smart and cosmopolitan Singapore has been marching into non-conformity with a new batch of boutique hotels, transforming old Chinatown shophouses into 21st-century modernism, and hip hostels wired for the digital generation. \u00b7 10a Upper Wilkie Road; + 65 6438 5588; dorm room \u00a312.50, double \u00a335.70\u00b7 Block 166, Woodlands Street 13 #01-545; + 65 97516451; dorm room \u00a31.15An eclectic abode fashioned out of an old red-light district shophouse punctuated by shuttered windows and come-hither balconies.

Cruise America (00 1 800 671 8042; cruiseamerica.com) has offices across America, including Las Vegas and Minneapolis. Expect to pay around \u00a365 a day, depending on exactly when you travel. If you can avoid July and August, you may be able to cut this rate further.The main pitfalls to be aware of are the insurance, collision damage waiver and fuel costs that are tacked on when you book. Get as much information about this as you can upfront and try to fill the fuel tank yourself rather than pay for them to do it. You'll often incur penalties for late or early drop-offs. Provided you're travelling in off-peak periods you shouldn't need to book in advance, but if you are in the US over the school holidays, reserve at least a few days ahead for campsites and RV grounds.

Shares in the Swiss bank are down 46% so far this year. It spent a further $6.88bn in January as part of a $14.5bn funding round for the embattled US bank Citigroup, Two months before, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), which with assets estimated at up to $900bn is reckoned to be the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, invested $7.5bn in Citigroup bonds that will convert to shares in 2010 and 2011 at prices from $31 to $37.But since then Citigroup has become one of the most high-profile casualties of the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US, and its share price has plunged as low as $20 - nearly 40% lower than when the ADIA made its investment.The pain shows no sign of letting up. Two months ago, Citigroup announced it had plunged into the red over the past three months of 2007 and sliced its dividend almost in half as it wiped more than $18bn off the value of its assets because of exposure to sub-prime mortgages. But Wall Street analysts reckon the firm could record a further $15bn write-down for this financial quarter. China Investment Corporation's investment in Morgan Stanley, made just before Christmas, is also facing a significant loss. The securities it picked up for $5bn will convert to stock at $48 to $57 a share in two years' time. At present, however, Morgan Stanley's share price is closer to $42.Another Beijing-backed money manager, China Development Bank, has also suffered as the stake in Barclays it bought in July has plunged in value. When it acquired the 3.1% shareholding, the bank's shares were trading at about 680p each. On Thursday, they were at 429p.The Singaporean fund Temasek is also nursing losses on the 2.1% Barclays stake it bought last year, although its investment in the London-listed bank Standard Chartered has fared better. The bank, which has little involvement in the US sub-prime crisis, has weathered the storm better than many of its peers.The losses sustained by sovereign wealth funds are relatively insignificant when compared with the $3.2tr they are believed to have at their control. Morgan Stanley reckons that with the price of commodities such as oil set to remain high, this amount will balloon to $12tr by 2015. But the losses may dampen their appetite for further involvement in bailing out western banks.Western politicians are increasingly concerned about the power of sovereign wealth funds in their markets. Earlier this week the US government agreed voluntary principles with ADIA and Singapore's GIC to regulate their investments.", "tags": ["Banking", "Investment funds", "Credit crunch", "Business", "Sovereign wealth funds", "Singapore", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Revealed: how sovereign wealth funds were left nursing multibillion losses"},{"date": "2008-02-16T00:03:32Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "The Langhe region is where barolo, barbaresco, asti and moscato wines come from, as well as many delicious goats cheeses, chestnut honeys, hazelnuts and - yes - Ferrero Rocher.

Its target audience is the \"newly connected middle classes\" in developing countries and blue collar workers elsewhere. It is trying to attract the millions who can't yet afford a web connection on a PC but who can through entry-level phones such as a Nokia or Samsung. It must be one of the biggest untapped markets in the world; myGamma, owned by BuzzCity in which the Singapore government is the smallest shareholder, is in the throes of a global expansion that could take it anywhere.It has a claimed user base of 2.4 million subscribers, rising fast. I found it easy to locate communities in South Africa - where there are 200,000 users - and China (despite not being able to communicate) though not Zimbabwe, which would have been particularly interesting at the moment. It has its own mail system and virtual currency and claims to be the biggest network designed for mobiles rather than being a bolt-on to a PC service. It also, unusually, has a global pay-per-click advertising service.myGamma is 100% user-generated content, which is both a strength (instant global reactions) and a weakness, as too much of the content is unmediated drivel that ought to be off limits to young children. Although designed for mobiles, that doesn't in itself solve the problem of legibility when so much information is squeezed into a small area.Part of its success is due to low-cost data tariffs in developing countries, such as two rupees a day in India. Unsurprisingly the first significant take-up in the UK (12,000 users) was by T-Mobile, an early adopter of all-you-can-eat data tariffs. Recently Arabic writing started to be typed in from countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia and people have just started joining in Iran. \"It just happened,\" says cofounder Dr Lai Kok Fung, who claims it could cope with a sudden increase in Europe without scaling problems.myGamma is one of a number of projects in developing countries that could spread to the rest of the world. The experiment by Safaricom - in which Vodafone has a 35% stake - in Kenya, where 80% of people are unbanked, seems to be going from strength to strength. Customers vest money with a registered agent such as a retailer who credits their \"virtual account\" (ie SIM card) with money which can be sent by SMS to a recipient who can cash it at an agent's office by showing their ID and entering a secret code. Safaricom went public this month amid long queues of investors hoping for a quick profit.If you want to help developing countries while monitoring progress, try the Guardian's Katine project to help our adopted village in Uganda or join a service such as the San Francisco based Kiva.org. This not-for-profit enables you to lend as little as $20 to a named entrepreneur for a project outlined on the site, typically for six to 12 months. It is now three years since the first loan was made and it claims a near-total repayment rate. It's like a socially conscious version of Zopa.com, the UK site that lines up lenders to borrowers, bypassing the banks.What is impressive about Kiva, which has been endorsed by President Clinton, is how it uses modern techniques such as blogging, networking, email updates and payment tracking to help reduce poverty, particularly in Africa, that traditional methods have not been spectacularly successful at. When you get your money back you can then re-lend to someone else.

Last year it was fined \u00a31,700 for depicting a kissing scene between two lesbians in the drama series, Without a Trace.Earlier this month the authority fined cable television operator StarHub \u00a33,500 for screening an advert that showed two women kissing.Homosexuality is still illegal in Singapore. But in October last year the government declared that private, consensual, adult homosexual sex would no longer be prosecuted.However, the offence remains on the statute book and anyone convicted of \"an act of gross indecency\" could face up to two years in jail.There have few prosecutions for gay sex, though the authorities have banned homosexual festivals and censored films, not wishing to be seen to condone it as a lifestyle choice.Before 2003, homosexuals were barred from \"sensitive positions\" in Singapore's civil service, a provision removed by the former prime minister, Goh Chok Tong.", "tags": ["World news", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Singapore TV fined for showing gay couple"},{"date": "2008-06-10T17:28:42Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Australia Two leading Australian scholars have been appointed to the prized annual chair of Australian studies at Harvard University for 2009.

Its target audience is the \"newly connected middle classes\" in developing countries and blue collar workers elsewhere. It is trying to attract the millions who can't yet afford a web connection on a PC but who can through entry-level phones such as a Nokia or Samsung. It must be one of the biggest untapped markets in the world; myGamma, owned by BuzzCity in which the Singapore government is the smallest shareholder, is in the throes of a global expansion that could take it anywhere.It has a claimed user base of 2.4 million subscribers, rising fast. I found it easy to locate communities in South Africa - where there are 200,000 users - and China (despite not being able to communicate) though not Zimbabwe, which would have been particularly interesting at the moment. It has its own mail system and virtual currency and claims to be the biggest network designed for mobiles rather than being a bolt-on to a PC service. It also, unusually, has a global pay-per-click advertising service.myGamma is 100% user-generated content, which is both a strength (instant global reactions) and a weakness, as too much of the content is unmediated drivel that ought to be off limits to young children. Although designed for mobiles, that doesn't in itself solve the problem of legibility when so much information is squeezed into a small area.Part of its success is due to low-cost data tariffs in developing countries, such as two rupees a day in India. Unsurprisingly the first significant take-up in the UK (12,000 users) was by T-Mobile, an early adopter of all-you-can-eat data tariffs. Recently Arabic writing started to be typed in from countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia and people have just started joining in Iran. \"It just happened,\" says cofounder Dr Lai Kok Fung, who claims it could cope with a sudden increase in Europe without scaling problems.myGamma is one of a number of projects in developing countries that could spread to the rest of the world. The experiment by Safaricom - in which Vodafone has a 35% stake - in Kenya, where 80% of people are unbanked, seems to be going from strength to strength. Customers vest money with a registered agent such as a retailer who credits their \"virtual account\" (ie SIM card) with money which can be sent by SMS to a recipient who can cash it at an agent's office by showing their ID and entering a secret code. Safaricom went public this month amid long queues of investors hoping for a quick profit.If you want to help developing countries while monitoring progress, try the Guardian's Katine project to help our adopted village in Uganda or join a service such as the San Francisco based Kiva.org. This not-for-profit enables you to lend as little as $20 to a named entrepreneur for a project outlined on the site, typically for six to 12 months. It is now three years since the first loan was made and it claims a near-total repayment rate. It's like a socially conscious version of Zopa.com, the UK site that lines up lenders to borrowers, bypassing the banks.What is impressive about Kiva, which has been endorsed by President Clinton, is how it uses modern techniques such as blogging, networking, email updates and payment tracking to help reduce poverty, particularly in Africa, that traditional methods have not been spectacularly successful at. When you get your money back you can then re-lend to someone else. Although conceived as a way of nurturing nascent entrepreneurialism in poor countries, you could easily see the model being used elsewhere.

Xiaxue, however, has been famous for five years, and has turned into a full-time professional blogger, attracting around 300,000 visitors per month. Singapore's National Library Board has added her to its electronic archives. She may have passed her peak \u2013 marked by her Best Asian Weblog award in the 2005 Bloggies \u2013 but there's no sign of this lippy former student/waitress going away. Xiaxue (\"snowing\") has described herself as \"just a normal girl who got rather lucky\". Her real name is Zheng Yan Yan, aka Wendy Cheng, and she's now 24. She started blogging in April 2003, and could easily have sunk without trace. Instead, she became, briefly, a celebrity blogger for The Straits Times newspaper, a Maxim columnist, and co-starred in a sort of reality TV series, Girls Out Loud. She now does a fortnightly series, Xiaxue's Guide To Life, which runs on Munkysuperstar's web-based TV channel, clicknetwork.tv. There are quite a few on YouTube.If you want to know about blinging your long nails with crystals, getting a tongue piercing, losing weight, cooking live crabs, shopping for slutty clothes or fitting out your totally pink Princess Room on the cheap, Xiaxue is your girl. She'd be an ideal Big Brother contestant.Part of Xiaxue's appeal is that she's offensive, by Singapore standards. \"Singaporean (Chinese) guys,\" she wrote, \"like girls who keep quiet and nods in agreement to everything they say, rather than a girl who speaks up for her own opinions. They like girls who are weak, diminutive and vulnerable, not girls who are strong and can protect themselves.\" They must also dress modestly and be virgins.Xiaxue \u2013 perhaps corrupted by reading California-based Sweet Valley High books \u2013 is the opposite of this Singaporean ideal. She's bitchy, swears, wears \"chio\" (pretty but provocative) clothes, writes in intimate detail about things like panty liners, and flaunts her American boyfriend, Mike. It provokes hundreds of comments.She also generates controversy by attacking other bloggers. One famous post dealt with the Top Seven Most Disgusting Bloggers in Singapore, including Xiaxue. She attacked herself for being a fake, short, fat and ugly. \"She is so hao lian [arrogant] of her stupid angmoh [caucasian monkey] boyfriend,\" she wrote. \"SPG!\" Sarong Party Girl: the ultimate insult.Some of Xiaxue's posts are labelled as advertorials: she's paid to write about products, review restaurants etc, and she also got a free \"nose job\". Since she's always writing about the things she does and the products she buys, these aren't much different from her usual slang-packed, heavily illustrated (and skilfully photoshopped) posts. You can take it or leave it. As you'd expect, most of Xiaxue's readers \u2013 around 70% \u2013 live in Singapore or Malaysia. For the rest of us, she's a virtual tourist spot, providing an uncensored, unmediated and somewhat voyeuristic peek into a different society. Every nation should have its own Xiaxue, and perhaps they do.

Pirate attacks occurred almost weekly. Insurance premiums jumped on the 70,000 vessels that took 40% of the world's trade through the 550-mile conduit every year.Then Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia allocated considerable naval firepower for coordinated \"aggressive patrols\", starting in 2004. It paid dividends. This year, the International Maritime Bureau in Kuala Lumpur, which tracks shipping attacks worldwide, has noted only two attacks in the straits - down from 38 in 2004. The south-east Asian governments are fortunate in having no safe havens, in the form of failed states, where pirates can cosset hijacked ships.

It saw a piracy surge in the South China Sea this year as pirates emerged from the Anambas Islands, Indonesia, and patrols were tipped off. \"I'm sure a lot of criminal syndicates are watching events in Somalia with great interest,\" says Choong. \"The Somali pirates are making so much money and have been facing very low risk.\"Ramli Nik, of the Maritime Institute of Malaysia, thinks partnership in Asia is the key - more difficult for Somalia, he says, given the lack of cooperation of states around the Gulf of Aden.", "tags": ["Piracy at sea", "Somalia", "World news", "Singapore", "Water transport", "Africa", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "How the Malacca straits were reclaimed"},{"date": "2009-02-17T00:01:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "How do you achieve a school system consistently in the top three in the world for maths and science, fourth for literacy, and described by experts as leading the world in teaching quality? Moreover, how do you manage to get 80% of pupils to pass five or more O-levels when they are taught in their second language in classes of 35? The answers are found in Singapore.I have just accompanied winners of the Teaching Awards on a study visit to Singapore. It was organised by the charity CfBT Education Trust, which has sent British teachers to several countries to see what they can learn from other school systems.So what did they expect to find? One assistant headteacher from the Midlands expected to see \"a very traditional curriculum, rows of pupils, teacher in front, students there to learn\". And indeed she did. But she also saw a whole lot more: traditional methods blended with more progressive thinking, and a focus on teaching the whole child, not just on exam results. It gave the British teachers plenty to ponder.International comparisons are fraught with difficulties; it is easy to forget that what works in one country will not flourish in another. But Singapore has many similarities to the UK. The official language of school instruction is English, there is a national curriculum, and the national examinations are O- and A-levels, administered by Cambridge Assessment.It was soon clear to the British teachers that there are similar challenges. Singapore is a multi-ethnic, multilingual society. Pupils are obsessed with mobile phones and computer games, and are, as one Singapore school principal put it, the \"strawberry generation: easily bruised and damaged\".So why does it work? First, education is the government's top priority. That is not just rhetoric: a country with no natural resources (it even has to import water) knows it lives and dies by its collective brainpower. The ministry of education is very close to schools; as all teachers and principals are civil servants, they regularly rotate through postings to the ministry.Teachers speak approvingly of the way the ministry supports initiatives with targeted funding. Or, as one former headteacher put it, the system runs on \"top-down support for bottom-up initiatives\".For example, there is a drive to boost learning outside the classroom. The government provides funds for school visits, clubs and extra-curricular activities, enabling them to make such activities compulsory. Pupils are regularly graded on these activities, and the grades count towards entry to further education.In another reform, the ministry announced recently that all primary schools would move to single-session teaching, with the juniors taught in the morning and the infants in the afternoon. This will bring smaller classes, better pupil-teacher ratios, and allow a programme of compulsory extra-curricular activities for the juniors in the afternoon.Like England, Singapore is undergoing a big school building programme. But there is no disruption while the builders are in, as the whole school decamps to a vacant school nearby. The government maintains spare capacity for this very purpose.In a reform called the Integrated Programme, schools with more able pupils are encouraged to bypass exams at 16, allowing greater curriculum flexibility right through to A-levels.One visiting headteacher from Essex was struck by the real stretch offered to more able pupils, the \"clear articulation of ideas between government and schools\", and the way the whole system not only \"talked the talk, but also walked the walk\".Perhaps the real key to Singapore's success, though, is the rare combination of traditional teaching and discipline, and a holistic, child-based approach.

The British challenger has been denied by a head by French runner Gloria De Campeao in the Singapore International from his coffin box draw in 12 of 12.Ryan Moore dropped the favourite out early from his very wide draw and Presvis was forced to race from the back. He was last until just before the home turn and after finding no room on the inside in the home straight, Moore was forced to switch to make his challenge. Presvis made up many lengths in the final furlong and only failed by a head to catch the leader.The runner-up was clearly the best horse in the race and it's such a shame that this former handicapper, who is now one of the highest-rated horses in the world, won't be racing in Britain this season but campaigned for top international prizes despite being trained in Newmarket.The winner was last seen in the Dubai World Cup when he was second, no less than 14 lengths behind runaway winner Well Armed.The racing manager to Coastal Path's owner Khalid Abdullah did warn that the Ascot Gold Cup hope wouldn't want it too soft and the ground may have been the reason for the favourite's abject performance as he trailed in last in the Prix Vicomtesse Vigier at Longchamp.The race was won by Coastal Path's stablemate Americain at 14-1 who held off Pointilliste in a close battle for the Group Two prize. Coastal Path was clear third favourite at around 8-1 for the Gold Cup before today's event. Victor Chandler responded by pushing him out to 12-1. They bet: 5-2 Patkai, 7-2 Yeats, 10-1 Eastern Anthem, 12-1 Coastal Path, Geordieland and 14-1 Pointilliste, Schiaparelli and Watar.Stacelita looked a filly going places as she kept her four-race unbeaten record with a convincing win in the Group One Prix Saint-Alary at Longchamp. She heads for the French Oaks next month and if the ground rides similarly soft she is going to have obvious claims. Half an hour later the same combination of jockey Christophe Lemaire and Jean-Claude Rouget made it a Group One double with Neve On Sunday in the Prix d'Isphan. Breeders' Cup hero Goldikova and the Luca Cumani-trained Curtain Call had every chance but found disappointingly little in the closing stages.Talking Horses finds a winner as Sirvino, who was denied a run all the way up the straight in the 4.10 at Ripon, gets home virtually on the line after finally getting in the clear. The 15-8 winner would have been an unlucky loser and can be supported next time as he can't be put up that much for this.They are just off at Fakenham and Beherayn is being held up and pulling far too hard!

Presvis made up many lengths in the final furlong and only failed by a head to catch the leader.The runner-up was clearly the best horse in the race and it's such a shame that this former handicapper, who is now one of the highest-rated horses in the world, won't be racing in Britain this season but campaigned for top international prizes despite being trained in Newmarket.The winner was last seen in the Dubai World Cup when he was second, no less than 14 lengths behind runaway winner Well Armed.The racing manager to Coastal Path's owner Khalid Abdullah did warn that the Ascot Gold Cup hope wouldn't want it too soft and the ground may have been the reason for the favourite's abject performance as he trailed in last in the Prix Vicomtesse Vigier at Longchamp.The race was won by Coastal Path's stablemate Americain at 14-1 who held off Pointilliste in a close battle for the Group Two prize. Coastal Path was clear third favourite at around 8-1 for the Gold Cup before today's event. Victor Chandler responded by pushing him out to 12-1. They bet: 5-2 Patkai, 7-2 Yeats, 10-1 Eastern Anthem, 12-1 Coastal Path, Geordieland and 14-1 Pointilliste, Schiaparelli and Watar.Stacelita looked a filly going places as she kept her four-race unbeaten record with a convincing win in the Group One Prix Saint-Alary at Longchamp. She heads for the French Oaks next month and if the ground rides similarly soft she is going to have obvious claims. Half an hour later the same combination of jockey Christophe Lemaire and Jean-Claude Rouget made it a Group One double with Neve On Sunday in the Prix d'Isphan. Breeders' Cup hero Goldikova and the Luca Cumani-trained Curtain Call had every chance but found disappointingly little in the closing stages.Talking Horses finds a winner as Sirvino, who was denied a run all the way up the straight in the 4.10 at Ripon, gets home virtually on the line after finally getting in the clear.

It meant CPG working alongside Asia World, a shady Burmese conglomerate with strong links to the ruling junta whose management are targeted by sanctions in Australia, the US and Europe.CPG is the Singapore consultancy arm of the Sydney-based engineering firm Downer EDI. So, naturally enough, Bland contacted Downer to ask why it was prepared to work in Burma.He says they used delaying tactics for a week or so before, rather surprisingly, telling him they had been unaware of the Burma engagement and that they were now pulling out.Downer EDI's corporate affairs manager Maryanne Graham said the company cancelled the contract because it contravened the company's stated policy of sustaining a \"zero-harm environment\".You can read Bland's full story here. It was also followed up in the Australian press, as this Sydney Morning Herald story  Aussie firm embarrassed by Burma link shows.As he says: \"It's pretty rare for a company to act so quickly based on a journalistic expos\u00e9.\" Indeed it is.

Correction: as the banks, the regulators and the British government ran amok in their different ways.One thing that was striking in last night's chit-chat was the affection, even respect, for the aforementioned Darling, a calm man with a very awkward inheritance. It was offset by hostility to Brown, some of it among people who used to be big fans.\"I believed Gordon for the first five years,\" admitted someone who should have been warier.

But the verdict of the hacks drinking Treasury Special Brew was that history will be very hard on Chancellor Brown.I asked one of my economic pundits who was to blame for the current financial crisis.\"Brown by a proportion of 70% to 30%. He lost control of public expenditure. If we'd entered this recession with a small surplus, say 1%, instead of a structural hole of 6% to 7%, we'd be in much better shape,\" he replied.As a non-economist, I'm much more inclined to blame the bankers, as regular readers know. My City reporting chum leans the other way, of course. \"I'll go no further than 60:40,\" he conceded.Me, I stick to my guns. The spectacle of the bankers threatening to go off to Switzerland or Singapore (my God, have they ever visited Singapore?) in a fit of righteous anger over Darling's threat to their bonuses surely tells us quite a lot.\"They're like the miners in 1983; they still don't get it,\" genial Digby Jones said when I bumped into him elsewhere this week.Today's Guardian carries an interesting report from the French quarter of South Kensington \u2013 so handy for the Lyc\u00e9e \u2013 suggesting why French bankers won't be going home, even without Brown's claimed victory in persuading Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel to tax their bank bonuses too.

Its latest undertaking, however, may be one of its most ambitious: a giant undersea cable that will significantly speed up internet access around the globe.The Californian search engine is part of a consortium that confirmed its plans to install the new Southeast Asia Japan Cable (SJC) yesterday, the centrepiece of a $400m (\u00a3245m) project that will create the highest capacity system ever built.Google is undertaking the scheme with a number of Asian telecommunications companies, including Japan's KDDI and India's Reliance Globalcom. The agreement to build the submarine cable was first proposed three years ago, but negotiations finally came to a close on Wednesday as officials signed what they promised was a groundbreaking deal.\"We will now be uniquely positioned to provide our customers voice, internet and data services across the entire Asian continent,\" said Punit Garg, the chief executive of Reliance. When it opens for business in 2012, the SJC will run 3,000 miles from Singapore to Japan - with branches reaching out to Hong Kong, the Philippines, Thailand and Guam. In total, it will consist of more than 5,000 miles of cable, sunk deep under the seabed.The move is intended to boost the amount of capacity available for phone calls and internet traffic by bringing new. In turn, this should ease any potential congestion and make it easier for communications traffic to route around the world.The SJC is set to break records by allowing up to 17 terabits of data to be sent every second - the equivalent of around 250m telephone lines, and large enough to allow the contents of every single book in the British Library to be transferred 20 times per second.And as if that was not enough, the line is also upgradeable and could eventually run as fast as 23Tbps - space for another 88m phone lines.It is not the first time that Google has made significant investments in the physical infrastructure that underpins the internet.Recently, the company took a leading role in developing a parallel project to build the $300m Unity cable, which will run a high-capacity line from Japan to Los Angeles.Demand for connectivity has grown drastically in recent years, thanks to increased internet traffic. Research company TeleGeography pinned annual growth between 2002 and 2007 at around 63% per year, and expects demand to double each year until 2012.Earlier this year a new line running into east Africa was finally completed, promising to bring improved broadband to countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and South Africa.", "tags": ["Google", "Telecommunications industry", "Telecoms", "Internet", "Technology", "Business", "World news", "Japan", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Google backs world's fastest internet cable"},{"date": "2009-11-30T00:05:56Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Unfriendly reporters are jailed, assaulted or assassinated by the governments of Burma, Iran and Sri Lanka.

But it's a safe bet that, by New Year, the conventional wisdom will have moved on and the reasons for attacking it been changed utterly.The BBC's Nick Robinson reported this morning that there were rows between No 10 and No 11 over the shape of the budget, amplifying Patrick Wintour's lead story in today's Guardian that Alistair Darling would have preferred to have raised \u00a34.8bn from a 1% VAT hike rather than a 1% NICs hike, but was ground down by the chap next door.Nothing unusual about that. Most PMs and chancellors fight and eventually fall out, as Mrs T did with all hers and Tony Blair famously did with his at least half the time.There is usually some right on both sides. Darling is unusual in having seen off Brown's barely-concealed desire to replace him with his consigliere, Ed Balls.Good. I've always been a fan of Darling, a modest man who is tougher than he looks, though I never cultivated him: too loyal to the team (to both Blair and Brown), too discreet, not egotistical enough to be a good source for hacks.As I've noted here before, one of my children works for the chancellor nowadays, which complicates things: another reason to keep a prudent distance.As one colleague put it when telling me last night about his daughter's new career: \"I can't tell you that, Dad, it's a secret.\"Both Darling and Sam White were circulating among officials, analysts and journalists at last night's Treasury reception. I spoke to them both, albeit briefly, but mostly to economic writers from other publications whom I rarely see.That's where Robinson picked up this morning's BBC report, I'd guess, chatting with all and sundry. No 10 will instantly have sussed that from a glance at the diary.Most of the hacks I spoke to \u2013 like most I read earlier in the day \u2013 seemed agreed that Darling's pre-budget report didn't do enough to tackle the debt mountain or reassure the money markets, on whom we depend to fund the debt.For their part, ministers present defended what they'd done: both the uncertainty of the economy's recovery and the political timetable point to the need to delay the savage cuts that await public services \u2013 far bigger than the tax hikes that await us all.After an initially calm reaction in the City on Wednesday, investors decided to panic yesterday \u2013 herd instinct again \u2013 and sold British Treasury gilts. The FTSE rose a little; the money has to go somewhere.We'll see what happens next. One erudite pundit I've known for decades assured me that the credit agencies that clipped Greek and Spanish credit this week will reduce the UK from a triple-A rating to a double-A soon enough.Another economic pundit who sits even further up the media food chain, whom I'd only just met, told me that they won't. \"If they downgraded Britain they'd have to downgrade the US too \u2013 and they can't do that,\" he chuckled.So much for the wisdom of credit agencies, the people who slumbered as the investment banks blew their collective gasket. Correction: as the banks, the regulators and the British government ran amok in their different ways.One thing that was striking in last night's chit-chat was the affection, even respect, for the aforementioned Darling, a calm man with a very awkward inheritance. It was offset by hostility to Brown, some of it among people who used to be big fans.\"I believed Gordon for the first five years,\" admitted someone who should have been warier. The BBC's Robert Preston, absent last night, is in that camp too.His Brownite book, Brown's Britain (2005), did not read well at the time and reads less well by the day.There are plenty in that position. Not me, as it happens. Forced to choose between what Brown or Blair, I was saying I usually went with Blair \u2013 or neither.But I did argue that Brown had earned his chance to succeed Blair and, fingers crossed, we'd have to see how it turned out.In 2007 there was no alternative \u2013 still isn't, really, and that's why he's still there. But the verdict of the hacks drinking Treasury Special Brew was that history will be very hard on Chancellor Brown.I asked one of my economic pundits who was to blame for the current financial crisis.\"Brown by a proportion of 70% to 30%. He lost control of public expenditure. If we'd entered this recession with a small surplus, say 1%, instead of a structural hole of 6% to 7%, we'd be in much better shape,\" he replied.As a non-economist, I'm much more inclined to blame the bankers, as regular readers know. My City reporting chum leans the other way, of course. \"I'll go no further than 60:40,\" he conceded.Me, I stick to my guns. The spectacle of the bankers threatening to go off to Switzerland or Singapore (my God, have they ever visited Singapore?) in a fit of righteous anger over Darling's threat to their bonuses surely tells us quite a lot.\"They're like the miners in 1983; they still don't get it,\" genial Digby Jones said when I bumped into him elsewhere this week.Today's Guardian carries an interesting report from the French quarter of South Kensington \u2013 so handy for the Lyc\u00e9e \u2013 suggesting why French bankers won't be going home, even without Brown's claimed victory in persuading Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel to tax their bank bonuses too. Too much red tape, too miserable at home, said some.Do bear that thought in mind before emigrating or jumping off a bridge. The Times's Anatole Kaletsky, a pundit I respect, argues gloomily that Darling has bombed the banks to all our disadvantage.But one of the nice things about Kaletsky's columns is that every new year he writes one admitting everything he got wrong. It's a habit that should be legislated into statute as the Pompous Pundits Penance Act.If you want a shrewder assessment as to why the City's golden decade may not return \u2013 it has little to do with the Darling bonus bomb \u2013 try Gillian Tett's column in today's Financial Times.

CPJ added that I was merely \"the latest on a long list of foreign journalists who have been targeted by the government for their news coverage\".Although I reported on some sensitive issues such as rising crime, the ageing population and business links with Burma, I did not break any of the taboos that normally lead to a government reprisal \u2013 namely criticising Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding father, or his son, the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong.

But researchers warn that because the industry is so diverse, spread across activities ranging from in-company translation, software development and subtitling of films and television programmes, its impact is often overlooked.One indication that this could change comes from evidence that investment companies are showing growing interest in the sector, the report's writers say. They point to evidence from eastern Europe where a small number of players are dominating translating services.The report also highlights a growing acceptance of machine translation tools. This is in response to a shortage of human translators and improved accuracy of computer-assisted translation.The translation and interpreting sector dominates the language industry, with an estimated value of $8bn in 2008, while language teaching was the next biggest sector, estimated to be worth $2.3bn.Singapore set to test foreign workers' English skillsForeigners seeking visas to work in Singapore's service sector will have to sit a test of English from later this year as part of a government campaign to raise English standards.Details of the test have yet to be revealed but Lee Yi Shyan, minister for manpower, told the Straits Times newspaper that the move was aimed at raising English language skills in the retail, food and beverage and hotels sectors. It comes after prime minister Lee Hsien Loong decried foreigners in service jobs who could not distinguish between phrases such as \"chilli\" or \"no chilli\".The government will also offer employers the opportunity to reduce a levy on foreign employees from $170 to $100 if they can prove that new staff are proficient in English.Malaysia speeds return of BahasaBahasa Malay will replace English as the medium of instruction in maths and science classes in Malaysia's schools in 2011, a year earlier than scheduled, said education minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. The government had the resources to implement the policy sooner than planned, he said.Muhyiddin said that English language standards had not benefitted from the use of the language for teaching. \"[Students'] proficiency in the language currently should not just be average and drastic measures are needed to address this problem,\" Muhyiddin told the Bernama news agency last month.He said foreign teachers would be recruited to act as \"master teachers\" to improve standards of English language tuition alongside new textbooks and language labs.Dutch eyes in Sweden's schools anger unionsSweden's schools inspectorate has called in a Dutch education consultancy to review English language teaching at 30 secondary school, angering Swedish teaching unions.A team of inspectors from Cito, the international assessment and testing company based in the Netherlands, will assess English language teaching for 11- to 16-year-olds under a contract worth $700,000.Teaching unions expressed surprise at the decision. \"I question how a Dutch firm can study a Swedish school.

Cognisant that volatility is likely to remain a feature of the Pru's share price over the coming weeks, we reiterate our buy recommendation \u2013 to us, the strategic rationale of this deal remains compelling.Overall the FTSE 100 has climbed 16.13 points to 5543.29 ahead of the US non-farm payrolls later. Owen Ireland at ODL Securities said:The release of the non-farm payroll data will dominate markets today, as investors look to see the strength of the economic recovery.

But researchers warn that because the industry is so diverse, spread across activities ranging from in-company translation, software development and subtitling of films and television programmes, its impact is often overlooked.One indication that this could change comes from evidence that investment companies are showing growing interest in the sector, the report's writers say. They point to evidence from eastern Europe where a small number of players are dominating translating services.The report also highlights a growing acceptance of machine translation tools. This is in response to a shortage of human translators and improved accuracy of computer-assisted translation.The translation and interpreting sector dominates the language industry, with an estimated value of $8bn in 2008, while language teaching was the next biggest sector, estimated to be worth $2.3bn.Singapore set to test foreign workers' English skillsForeigners seeking visas to work in Singapore's service sector will have to sit a test of English from later this year as part of a government campaign to raise English standards.Details of the test have yet to be revealed but Lee Yi Shyan, minister for manpower, told the Straits Times newspaper that the move was aimed at raising English language skills in the retail, food and beverage and hotels sectors. It comes after prime minister Lee Hsien Loong decried foreigners in service jobs who could not distinguish between phrases such as \"chilli\" or \"no chilli\".The government will also offer employers the opportunity to reduce a levy on foreign employees from $170 to $100 if they can prove that new staff are proficient in English.Malaysia speeds return of BahasaBahasa Malay will replace English as the medium of instruction in maths and science classes in Malaysia's schools in 2011, a year earlier than scheduled, said education minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. The government had the resources to implement the policy sooner than planned, he said.Muhyiddin said that English language standards had not benefitted from the use of the language for teaching. \"[Students'] proficiency in the language currently should not just be average and drastic measures are needed to address this problem,\" Muhyiddin told the Bernama news agency last month.He said foreign teachers would be recruited to act as \"master teachers\" to improve standards of English language tuition alongside new textbooks and language labs.Dutch eyes in Sweden's schools anger unionsSweden's schools inspectorate has called in a Dutch education consultancy to review English language teaching at 30 secondary school, angering Swedish teaching unions.A team of inspectors from Cito, the international assessment and testing company based in the Netherlands, will assess English language teaching for 11- to 16-year-olds under a contract worth $700,000.Teaching unions expressed surprise at the decision. \"I question how a Dutch firm can study a Swedish school.

They will go to where the opportunities are, to the US and to places like Singapore that have invested heavily in science, and are hiring from all over the world,\" said Cicerone.Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, revealed in his pre-Budget report in December that there will be a substantial reduction in the higher education, science and research budgets between 2011 and 2013.The Conservative science spokesman, Adam Afriyie, has said major science budget cuts are \"inevitable\" regardless of which party wins the forthcoming election.The cuts have raised concerns among the Russel Group of large research-intensive universities that they will no longer be able to compete with other top-ranking universities around the world. They also come as leading academic centres in the US are being supported by stimulus funds, some of which are being used specifically to attract foreign students and qualified scientists.Professor Cicerone's comments were backed by Peter Agre, winner of the 2003 Nobel prize for chemistry and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\"The politicians that are going to be cutting funding and discouraging young scientists can thank themselves for damaging a generation of science, not just science next year. And that isn't a political statement, that's the reality,\" Professor Agre said.\"When we have booms in scientific funding, young people devote their careers to this, and then we have busts and they can't afford to pay the rent and they are forced to quit. And when they quit, they're extinct \u2013 they quit forever,\" he added.\"The nations that fund science are investing in the future, but those that cut funding are hoping for the best.\"Professor Agre said Singapore, which has no natural resources , is thriving as a science-based economy and is likely to pull further ahead in economic hard times.", "tags": ["AAAS", "People in science", "Controversies", "Science", "Education", "Research funding", "Higher education", "Research", "UK news", "Guardian Careers", "All sectors"], "title": "Funding cuts will lead to brain drain from UK, warns senior US scientist"},{"date": "2010-06-08T09:13:03Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Singapore is seeking to extradite a British man accused of spray-painting a subway carriage last month.A court has issued an arrest warrant for Lloyd Dane Alexander for allegedly breaking into a train depot and vandalising a subway carriage on 16 May with Oliver Fricker, a Swiss national, the Singapore police force said today.Singapore has a reputation for meting out severe punishments for relatively minor crimes.

The city state of 4.9 million people has expanded its surface area from 582 sq km in the 1960s, to 710 sq km in 2008, an increase of 22%, and it has ambitious plans to reclaim further land from the sea.This requires far more sand than the island is able to provide for itself, prompting suppliers and middlemen to dredge and buy overseas.Cargo manifests and photographs in the report suggest Singapore imported 14.2m tonnes of sand worth $273m (\u00a3184m) in 2008 from Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia. Its sourcing has reportedly expanded recently to Burma, the Philippines and Bangladesh.The lucrative trade has alarmed neighbouring nations, which have seen chunks of their land being shipped off.

These are the applicants for Chevening scholarships, whose hopes for receiving education in Britain are now in limbo as the government reviews its expenses.First started in 1983, the Chevening programme is touted by the UK government as a prestigious international scholarship scheme that fully or partly funds some 1,000 individuals from over 130 countries to pursue postgraduate studies in British universities every year.In May, the Foreign Office \u2013 which administers the scheme \u2013 announced that it was reviewing the scholarships programme as part of its planned \u00a355m budget savings in line with the new government's directive to trim expenditure by \u00a36bn across the public sector.For current applicants, the next few days will be crucial. A statement on the Chevening website says existing offers cannot be confirmed until the end of this month or early next month. \"We do understand the frustration that this will cause but ask those affected to be patient.\"Some of these people are likely to have turned down job offers and other funding opportunities after being offered a scholarship while the Labour government was still at the helm.Little wonder, then, that a group of Chevening alumni and hopefuls have banded together to lobby for the programme's continuation, taking their campaign to Facebook by forming the Save Chevening group.As a former recipient who can vouch for its worth first-hand, I find the Chevening's possible death of a lamentable, even grim, prospect.On a personal level, the scheme had changed my life. It accorded me the opportunity to pursue a credible overseas education that would have otherwise been closed off to someone with limited financial resources. I have met fellow cash-strapped scholars who would attest likewise.Yet Chevening is more than just a developmental aid programme; it is above all Britain's best attempt at solving transnational issues.For one thing, the Chevening scheme can help plug knowledge gaps in other countries. In my case, the disciplines I chose to pursue \u2013 comparative literature and translation studies \u2013 were not offered at Singapore universities during my candidacy. Today, comparative literature still remains elusive. While reading these subjects at the University of Edinburgh, I met two south-east Asian scholars who were pursuing environment-related programmes that were not taught at their respective home countries. In a densely forested region struggling to cope with issues of climate change, their choice is naturally apt.It is also significant that the Foreign Office is willing to sponsor individuals undertaking intellectual pursuits in unconventional fields like comparative literature. Our pursuit of alternative ideas helps us to inject fresh perspectives into existing problems in our non-British contexts.That process for me began sooner rather than later when a Singapore newspaper published my article urging local policymakers to study Scotland's strategy of celebrating its diaspora. In our quest to retain talents, Singapore's thrust has been to bemoan our lost sons and daughters, and the Scottish example suggested an alternative approach.For Britain, the Chevening programme offers its people a chance to engage with the brightest in emerging countries in a way that is not condescending. This is especially significant in advancing its relations with former colonies like Singapore and India where Britain is vulnerable to accusations of re-colonisation given its imperial past.If I could factor in my personal \u2013 albeit small \u2013 contribution, then this could be exemplified in the way my collaboration with other non-western coursemates at the University of Edinburgh led the comparative literature department to introduce modules on postcolonial and world literature in a programme that until then was largely Eurocentric.By ensuring that the British people remain in the thick of innovative developments worldwide, the Chevening scheme is an important nation-building tool that also benefits Britain. In fact, in many countries it has become as much a symbol of Britain as the Queen.

This is especially significant in advancing its relations with former colonies like Singapore and India where Britain is vulnerable to accusations of re-colonisation given its imperial past.If I could factor in my personal \u2013 albeit small \u2013 contribution, then this could be exemplified in the way my collaboration with other non-western coursemates at the University of Edinburgh led the comparative literature department to introduce modules on postcolonial and world literature in a programme that until then was largely Eurocentric.By ensuring that the British people remain in the thick of innovative developments worldwide, the Chevening scheme is an important nation-building tool that also benefits Britain. In fact, in many countries it has become as much a symbol of Britain as the Queen.

Imperial, which was invited to set up the partnership by Singapore's government, will benefit financially from sharing expertise and the college hopes the partnership will lead to long-term benefits. The college aims to tap into \"generous research funding\" available in the Asian city-state, Prof Partridge said.\"I don't think anybody knows the exact bottom line, but I can categorically say that Imperial is not going to do this in any way at a loss.\"International students are a significant source of revenue for British universities, and increasing numbers want to study here. Overseas applications rose from just over 55,000 last year to over 71,000 this February. At present the proportion of overseas medical students at UK schools is capped at 7.5%. A foreign medical student who starts at Imperial this autumn can expect to pay \u00a326,250 a year.Other top British universities which have expanded abroad include Nottingham, which has a campus in Malaysia, while Liverpool has set up a partnership with a Chinese university in Suzhou, near Shanghai.The new medical school will admit its first 50 students in 2013. A British student who trained at the Singapore school would have no automatic right to practise in the NHS, as it is outside the EU. However, the college hopes to set up student exchanges between the UK and Singapore.Sir Keith O'Nions , rector of Imperial College London, said: \"We are extremely proud to be working with Singapore, a country we have long admired for its support and application of world-class science, engineering and medicine.\"We have many members of the Imperial family already in Singapore \u2014 the country is home to nearly 2,000 of our alumni.\"Paul Madden, British High Commissioner for Singapore, said the partnership was a further example of the \"deep linkages\" between Britain and Singapore in science, culture and trade.Imperial's school of medicine, formed in 1997, is one of the largest in the UK.

Libya's state-owned oil group has expressed its interest in buying a stake in the bombed-out oil group and there are rumours that management have approached several sovereign wealth funds.BP's chief executive, Tony Hayward, meanwhile, has just arrived in Azerbaijan for a one-day visit which should provide investors with some insight into the firm's plans for its assets in the Caspian Sea. BP has interests in offshore gas and oil fields as well as a stake in an export oil pipeline which goes to Turkey. The company is looking to raise $10bn (\u00a36.58bn) through a series of disposals but its Caspian assets have not yet been among those earmarked for sale.Discussion of BP's options among traders has helped offset reports that the British government has become increasingly concerned that the company could collapse. A report in the Times said that the Department for Business and the Treasury are examining the potential impact of a takeover of BP, once Britain's biggest company, on UK interests domestically and around the world. As well as employing more than 10,000 people in the UK and providing a crucial dividend stream to pension funds, it owns key domestic infrastructure including the Forties Pipeline System that links up oil and gas fields in the North Sea.Billions of pounds have been wiped from the value of BP's shares since the Deepwater Horizon disaster, making the company vulnerable to a takeover. The environmental damage has now affected all the US states along the Gulf of Mexico, with \"tar balls\" reportedly discovered over the weekend along the Texas shore. Samples of the tar are currently being tested to determine if the oil came from the Deepwater Horizon spill. On Monday BP said that the spill has so far cost it $3.12bn (\u00a32bn).The dramatic fall in BP's share price as a result of the political and environmental storm that has erupted since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April, has left it vulnerable to a takeover. Rivals ExxonMobil, Total and Royal Dutch Shell have all been mooted as potential predators. In an effort to see-off unwanted advances, BP has been talking with major international investors in order to drum up interest in its shares. The company does not, however, want to issue new shares. Instead it would like new investors to pick up their stakes in the market. It has approached several sovereign wealth funds, a senior source in the United Arab Emirates told Reuters, including representatives in Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Qatar and Singapore. The Kuwait Investment Authority already has a stake of 2.8% in BP while the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund has a 1.3% stake.On Monday Shokri Ghanem, chairman of Libya's national oil company, told the Zawya Dow Jones news service that BP is a bargain and the North African nation's sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority, should invest in it. \"BP is interesting now with the price lower by half, and I still have trust in BP,\" Ghanem added.Separately, it has emerged that BP has contacted its partners in the well to demand that they pick up part of the bill for the Gulf clean-up operation. BP has sent out demands for almost $400m to Anadarko and Japan's Mitsui Oil Exploration Company, both of which are minority shareholders in the well. Anadarko owns 25% of the well and Mitsui has 10%.", "tags": ["BP", "BP oil spill", "Environment", "Business", "Libya", "World news", "Sovereign wealth funds", "Africa"], "title": "BP shares rise on hopes of international rescue"},{"date": "2010-11-26T00:05:07Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Your editorial endorsed Mr Alan Shadrake's book as \"legitimate and ... largely accurate\" (Press freedom: The Singpore grip, 17 November).

The book includes an interview with Darshan Singh, the former chief executioner at Singapore's Changi prison, who was said to have executed 1,000 prisoners over half a century.However, the central theme of the book is Shadrake's claim that Singapore's legal system does not accord equal treatment to those suspected of capital offences. The death penalty is mandatory for a number of offences including murder and possession of drugs over a certain amount. In Singapore, as a result, he asserts that the question of who lives and who dies is an arbitrary lottery.He explains that this is because the manipulation and decision-making takes place at the time of investigation and prosecution. Those who are rich, powerful or likely to have the backing of a significant trade partner escape charges that carry the death penalty. Those who have no influence behind them are charged with capital crimes, convicted, sentenced to death and executed. If his analysis is correct, it makes a mockery of the claim that the law is applied equally to all and without discrimination.With a population of 5 million, Singapore has one of the world's highest per capita execution rates. While official figures are not produced, according to Amnesty International there have been at least 400 executions over the past two decades.Shadrake's case highlights two important issues. First, the power to punish a person for contempt on the ground of \"scandalising the court\" is in many parts of the world a rare offence. Legitimate criticism of judicial conduct is protected by the right to free expression and in turn strengthens public confidence. In Britain the judiciary has been subject to heavy and sometimes personalised criticism arising from miscarriage of justice cases. But it has never sought to invoke a criminal prosecution for \"scandalising the judiciary\".The prospect of judges punishing someone in the matter of a book criticising the legal system creates a very dangerous precedent. The judiciary should not be judges in their own cause. To convict a man for writing a book of this nature, and furthermore to imprison him, fails to deal with the issues he has raised; and this is the second point.Shadrake seeks to place the application of the death penalty in context. He argues that politics, international trade and business determine who lives and who dies at the gallows; and that foreign nationals, whose cases may result in negative political and economic fallout, have succeeded in escaping execution.He highlights the execution of the migrant Filipino maid Flor Contemplacion \u2013 whose treatment brought relations between the two countries to such a crisis point that Shadrake says the next Filipino maid could not be executed \u2013 and the case of Julia Bohl, a German woman who escaped the death penalty although she had originally been arrested for possession of drugs that carried a capital charge. Shadrake claims that because of the likely repercussions, the authorities eventually charged her with a lesser offence to which she pleaded guilty and for which she was ultimately sentenced to five years in prison.The book has drawn important attention to serious issues that surely require further investigation. Such disturbing details are of general concern and provide a strong basis for self-criticism by the Singapore government and perhaps even a commission of inquiry.

The conviction of Alan Shadrake, an outspoken but hitherto unknown British author, is not merely unjust; it reminds outsiders of the authoritarian and sinister side of a city state that most people associate only with shopping.Shadrake is the latest in a long line of victims of one of the world's most vicious defamation cultures. Pretty much any criticism can be deemed as \"insult\". International media have fallen foul \u2013 from the Economist to the Far Eastern Economic Review \u2013 and most of the tiny group of opposition politicians have over the years been bankrupted and then imprisoned for going against the grain.Shadrake, who divides his time between Malaysia and the UK, knew what he was doing, and he knew the consequences. He knew he was inviting trouble \u2013 more specifically charges of contempt \u2013 by calling into question the probity of the judiciary. But that does not make the attack on him any less acceptable or sensible. Imagine if Singapore had shown a little more foresight and ignored the affair. The book would not have matched Jamie or Nigella on the bestsellers.Sentencing has now been deferred for a week, with prosecutors asking for \"only\" 12 weeks jail. This is more lenient than anticipated, perhaps denoting an element of embarrassment at the bad press. But the trial should not have happened in the first place.As a frequent visitor to Singapore (where I was born), I have seen the best and the worst of the place. When nearly two years ago I wrote a piece for the Guardian previewing my book, Freedom for Sale as the model of the global tendency of people trading their liberty for either wealth or security \u2013 I was instantly denounced. They did not appreciate my description of the consumer culture there as \"the anaesthetic for the brain\".In spite of, or perhaps because of, the denunciations, I sought to engage the Singaporeans at the top of government. I suggested to them that their kneejerk response to all criticism, no matter the tone or subject matter, was doing their country enormous harm. They then surprised me by inviting me over to launch my book there. My father suggested they might \"do a Polanski on me\" and arrest me at the airport. In the event, I was treated well and the government-controlled Straits Times devoted two pages to a measured critique of my thesis.The vacillations in my treatment suggest that the government in Singapore is not talking with one voice. Everyone is wondering what will happen once the 87-year-old Lee Kuan Yew, the father of the independent nation and father of the present prime minister, passes on. Will Singapore begin to loosen its stifling grip and tolerate free expression? I examine these questions in a special report later this week on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.Singapore's population is well travelled and highly educated. The country is stable and completely integrated into the global economy and communications. Already it is allowing just a little more cultural freedom, but it does so nervously.

Such disturbing details are of general concern and provide a strong basis for self-criticism by the Singapore government and perhaps even a commission of inquiry. Instead Shadrake finds himself convicted of an attack on the judiciary. He has suffered because he chose to write a book that has brought to the fore the politics of the death penalty.

The first, compiled by the campaigning group Reporters Without Borders, places the country 136th in the world for press freedom \u2013 below Iraq and Zimbabwe. The second is the rate at which Singapore executes convicted criminals: arguably higher, per capita, than any other country in the world.Singapore presents itself as a modern liberal democracy: it has a parliament, elections, courts, a constitutional right to free speech and the consumerist gloss of capitalism. Its citizens are free to become rich and to travel. Many do both. The country has by any measure succeeded since independence. But its autocratic political culture \u2013 overseen by the country's founding father and now official minister mentor Lee Kuan Yew \u2013 is highly and needlessly restrictive. The media is largely state-owned. Defamation and contempt laws threaten dissent. The latest victim of these is Alan Shadrake, a British-born writer sentenced yesterday to six weeks in prison and a large fine after being found guilty of contempt of court. His book Once a Jolly Hangman questioned the independence of Singapore's legal system, and its use of the death penalty.It is depressing that a country as successful as Singapore should feel the need for such restrictions on free speech. Singapore argues that, without them, the balance between the country's Chinese, Malay and Indian populations would be upset. But the reality is that other successful parts of Asia \u2013 Hong Kong and Taiwan, for instance \u2013 have thrived by extending free speech and the rule of law. Singapore is making itself a less significant place by refusing to give its people the sorts of freedoms that are routine elsewhere.On a practical level, the decision to prosecute Mr Shadrake was also foolish. His book has had far greater attention because of it, and Singapore's reputation has been harmed. Mr Shadrake is quite right to attack a criminal justice system whose victims are often poor migrant workers. His book was legitimate and \u2013 despite the court's claim to the contrary \u2013 largely accurate. The suspicion is that the Singapore government resented the exposure of a squalid system of routine executions which sits uneasily with the image it likes to present to the world.

The conviction of Alan Shadrake, an outspoken but hitherto unknown British author, is not merely unjust; it reminds outsiders of the authoritarian and sinister side of a city state that most people associate only with shopping.Shadrake is the latest in a long line of victims of one of the world's most vicious defamation cultures. Pretty much any criticism can be deemed as \"insult\". International media have fallen foul \u2013 from the Economist to the Far Eastern Economic Review \u2013 and most of the tiny group of opposition politicians have over the years been bankrupted and then imprisoned for going against the grain.Shadrake, who divides his time between Malaysia and the UK, knew what he was doing, and he knew the consequences. He knew he was inviting trouble \u2013 more specifically charges of contempt \u2013 by calling into question the probity of the judiciary. But that does not make the attack on him any less acceptable or sensible. Imagine if Singapore had shown a little more foresight and ignored the affair. The book would not have matched Jamie or Nigella on the bestsellers.Sentencing has now been deferred for a week, with prosecutors asking for \"only\" 12 weeks jail. This is more lenient than anticipated, perhaps denoting an element of embarrassment at the bad press. But the trial should not have happened in the first place.As a frequent visitor to Singapore (where I was born), I have seen the best and the worst of the place. When nearly two years ago I wrote a piece for the Guardian previewing my book, Freedom for Sale as the model of the global tendency of people trading their liberty for either wealth or security \u2013 I was instantly denounced. They did not appreciate my description of the consumer culture there as \"the anaesthetic for the brain\".In spite of, or perhaps because of, the denunciations, I sought to engage the Singaporeans at the top of government. I suggested to them that their kneejerk response to all criticism, no matter the tone or subject matter, was doing their country enormous harm. They then surprised me by inviting me over to launch my book there. My father suggested they might \"do a Polanski on me\" and arrest me at the airport. In the event, I was treated well and the government-controlled Straits Times devoted two pages to a measured critique of my thesis.The vacillations in my treatment suggest that the government in Singapore is not talking with one voice. Everyone is wondering what will happen once the 87-year-old Lee Kuan Yew, the father of the independent nation and father of the present prime minister, passes on. Will Singapore begin to loosen its stifling grip and tolerate free expression? I examine these questions in a special report later this week on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.Singapore's population is well travelled and highly educated.

General Ma's answer was that \"they can survive on their own.\" The Deputy Secretary noted that the DPRK could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach. If not, North Korea faces a change of course by the United States, the ROK and Japan. MM Lee said he believes Japan may well \"go nuclear.\" MM Lee also offered views on the Chinese economy, Taiwan, Chinese leaders, and U.S.-China relations. End Summary.China and North Korea---------------------4. (S) Deputy Secretary Steinberg met with Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on May 30 on the margins of the Shangri-La Dialogue, the annual international security forum held in Singapore. The Deputy Secretary used the meeting with MM Lee to stress the importance of Chinese cooperation in addressing the North Korea nuclear issue and to elicit MM Lee's views on China and North Korea. MM Lee said the Chinese do not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Chinese do not want North Korea, which China sees as a buffer state, to collapse. The ROK would take over in the North and China would face a U.S. presence at its border. If China has to choose, Beijing sees a North Korea with nuclear weapons as less bad for China than a North Korea that has collapsed, he stated.5. (S) MM Lee said he asked Deputy Chief of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Ma Xiaotian what China can do about North Korea. General Ma's Delphic answer was that \"they can survive on their own.\" MM Lee said he interpreted this as meaning that even if China cut off aid, the DPRK leadership would survive. This is a leadership that has already taken actions like killing ROK Cabinet Members in Burma and shooting down a KAL flight. If they lose power, they will end up facing justice at The Hague, like Milosevic. They have been so isolated for so long that they have no friends, not even Russia. They have not trusted China since the Chinese began cultivating ties with the ROK, given China's interest in attracting foreign investment, he said. The Deputy Secretary noted that the DPRK could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach. If not, North Korea faces a change of course by the United States, the ROK and Japan. MM Lee expressed worry about the effect on Iran if the DPRK persists. MM Lee said he believes the DPRK can be contained and will not proliferate, but Iran has very high ambitions, ties to Shiite communities outside Iran, and oil wealth.6. (S) The Deputy Secretary noted that North Korea's decisions will have an impact in Japan. MM Lee said he believes Japan may well \"go nuclear.\" The Chinese must have factored this into their calculations and concluded that the prospect of Japan with nuclear weapons is less bad than losing North Korea as a buffer state. The Chinese take a long-term view and must think that within a few years the DPRK's current leadership will be gone and there will be new leadership, with new thinking. But there will still be a North Korea, he said.7. (S) MM Lee said he wishes the USG well in its efforts on North Korea, but he would be surprised if the North Koreans agree to give up nuclear weapons. They might give up a first-strike capacity, but they want nuclear weapons in case the USG decides to seek regime change. They are psychopathic types, with a \"flabby old chap\" for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation. MM Lee noted that he had learned from living through three and a half years of Japanese occupation in Singapore that people will obey authorities who can deny them food, clothing and medicine.8. (S) MM Lee said the ROK, after seeing what had happened with German unification, does not want immediate unification with the DPRK. There is \"nothing there\" in the DPRK, other than a military organization. Kim Jong-Il has already had a stroke. It is just a matter of time before he has another stroke. The next leader may not have the gumption or the bile of his father or grandfather. He may not be prepared to see people die like flies. China is calculating all this. They have their best men on the job. They want to help the United States to advance common objectives. But they do not want the South to take over the North, MM Lee said.Chinese Economy---------------9. (C) Regarding the Chinese economy, MM Lee said the global economic crisis has hit many countries, but the feel on the ground differs considerably from place to place. The Chinese economy is reportedly in the doldrums, but when MM Lee visited Jiangsu Province on May 24, his impression was one of continued prosperity. Shanghai has been harder hit, with container port traffic down 30-35 percent, similar to the situation in Singapore. There is no sign of deep unrest in China. The Chinese are very confident they will be able to sustain eight percent growth. The government is pumping resources into the economy, with a focus on developing Western China. Whether such policies can be sustained for three to four years is unclear, but China can certainly sustain these policies for at least a year, he said.10. (C) MM Lee stated that in the absence of a social safety net in China, the Chinese savings rate is 55 percent, exceeding even Singapore's 50 percent level. Consumption accounts for only 35 percent of Chinese GDP, as opposed to 70 percent of U.S. GDP. The Chinese leadership may be loath to shift permanently to a more consumption-oriented economy, but the leadership will do so temporarily, if only to avoid unrest. 20 million people have moved back to the countryside because of economic dislocations. The government is providing microfinance to facilitate the transition. The pragmatists are in charge. There is nothing Communist about it. They just want to preserve one party rule. The Deputy Secretary expressed concern that current Chinese policies designed to counter the economic crisis could undermine reform. MM Lee said this cannot be helped. China wants to prevent riots like the ones that happened in Guangzhou in March when Hong Kong-connected enterprises suddenly shut down, he said.Taiwan------11. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked MM Lee for his assessment of Taiwan. MM Lee said former President Chen Shui-bian had left Taiwan in a weak economic position, which had enabled President Ma Ying-Jeou to come to power with his pledge to strengthen the economy through means including expanding the three links with China. In Beijing, former President Jiang Zemin was wedded to his eight-point approach, but President Hu Jintao was more flexible. Jiang wanted to show he was a great man by solving the Taiwan issue in his lifetime, but Hu is more patient and does not have any fixed timeline. In Chinese domestic politics, Hu had wanted Vice Premier Li Keqiang from the Communist Youth League to emerge as his successor, not Vice President Xi Jinping, but Hu did his calculations and accepted Xi when it became clear that Xi had the necessary backing from the rest of the leadership. Similarly, on Taiwan, Hu will be pragmatic. It does not matter to Hu if it takes 10 years or 20 or 30. The key is building links with Taiwan. As in the case of Hong Kong, if necessary the tap could be turned off, he said.12. (C) In this context, MM Lee said, Hu could live with Ma's positions on the '92 consensus and on not addressing the reunification issue during his term in office. What mattered to Hu was that Taiwan not seek independence. If that happened, China has 1,000 missiles and is building its capacity to hold the U.S. fleet at a distance. The implicit question for Taiwan's leaders is if that is what they want, MM Lee said.13. (C) MM Lee stated that the alternative is Mainland investment in Taiwan stocks and property. The Mainland has already assured Hong Kong that it will help out economically. The Mainland has not said this to Taiwan, but the Mainland's Taiwan Affairs Director, Wang Yi, did urge Chinese companies to invest in Taiwan. In four years Taiwan's economy will pick up and Ma will win re-election. The DPP lacks strong potential candidates. Su Zhen-chang is promising, but seems unlikely to be able to win. Meanwhile, even the traditionally DPP-supporting farmers in Taiwan's South need China's market for vegetables and other products. Taiwan's continued participation in the World Health Assembly depends on Beijing. Beijing's calculation seems to be to prevent Taiwan independence in the near term, then bring Taiwan \"back to China,\" even if it takes 40 or 50 years. MM Lee said he is looking forward to visiting Fujian Province, where preparations are underway for a new southern economic area linked with Taiwan.Xi Jinping----------14. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked if in the future a leader like Xi Jinping would continue the policies on Taiwan followed by Hu Jintao. MM Lee responded affirmatively. Xi is a princeling who succeeded despite being rusticated. When the party needed his talents, Xi was brought in as Shanghai Party Secretary. Xi is seen as a Jiang Zemin protege, but in another three and a half years Jiang's influence will be gone. The focus now is on maintaining the system. There are no more strongmen like Deng Xiaoping. Jiang did not like Hu, but could not stop him, because Hu had the backing of the system and he did not make mistakes.Wang Qishan-----------15. (C) MM Lee said Vice Premier Wang Qishan, whom the MM saw in connection with celebrations in May of the 15th anniversary of Singapore-China Suzhou Industrial Park, is an exceptional talent, very assured and efficient. Wang handled SARS superbly when he was in Hainan. He excelled in coordinating the Beijing Olympics. Li Keqiang may not get the Premiership and the Party is looking for a way to keep Wang on past his 65th birthday until he is 70. MM Lee said he had met first Wang back in the 1990s but had forgotten their meeting. This time when they met, Wang told Lee he had reviewed the records of all Lee's meeting with Chinese leaders going back to the days of Deng Xiaoping to see how Lee's thinking had developed. Wang told Lee he respects him as a consistent man.China's Rise------------16. (C) MM Lee said China is following an approach consistent with ideas in the Chinese television series \"The Rise of Great Powers.\" The mistake of Germany and Japan had been their effort to challenge the existing order. The Chinese are not stupid; they have avoided this mistake. China's economy has surpassed other countries, with the exceptions of Japan and the United States. Even with those two countries, the gap is closing, with China growing at seven-nine percent annually, versus two-three percent in the United States and Japan. Overall GDP, not GDP per capita, is what matters in terms of power. China has four times the population of the United States. China is active in Latin America, Africa, and in the Gulf. Within hours, everything that is discussed in ASEAN meetings is known in Beijing, given China's close ties with Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, he stated.17. (C) MM Lee said China will not reach the American level in terms of military capabilities any time soon, but is rapidly developing asymmetrical means to deter U.S. military power. China understands that its growth depends on imports, including energy, raw materials, and food. This is why China is working with South Africa on the China-Africa Development Fund. China also needs open sea lanes. Beijing is worried about its dependence on the Strait of Malacca and is moving to ease the dependence by means like a pipeline through Burma.Build Ties with Young Chinese-----------------------------18. (C) MM Lee said the best course for the United States on China is to build ties with China's young people. China's best and brightest want to study in the United States, with the UK as the next option, then Japan. While they are there, it is important that they be treated as equals, with the cultural support they may need as foreigners. Why not have International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs for China? Why not have Chinese cadets at West Point alongside Vietnamese cadets and Indian cadets? America's advantage is that it can make use of the talent of the entire world, as in Silicon Valley. China still tends to try to keep the foreigners in Beijing and Shanghai. MM Lee noted that his own experience as a student in the UK had left him with an enduring fondness for the UK. When he spent two months at Harvard in 1968, an American professor had invited him home for Thanksgiving. This was not the sort of thing that happened in the UK, and Lee had realized he was dealing with a different civilization. In the future, China's leaders will have PhDs and MBAs from American universities, he predicted.19.

Mr Shadrake had alleged, without any basis, that the Singapore courts conspired with state agencies to suppress material evidence. Such a statement would be considered to be in contempt of court in many common law jurisdictions, including England, Australia, Ireland, Canada and Hong Kong.This was why Mr Shadrake was charged for contempt of court. The court found that he had made grave allegations against the independence and integrity of the Singapore judiciary, without rational basis and with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsehood. You quoted Mr Shadrake's statements confirming emphatically that his book questioned the independence and probity of the judiciary. Yet his lawyer argued in court that Mr Shadrake had not intended to allege any cover-up \"by the high echelons of the judiciary\". This duplicity was not lost on the court.The trial, along with Mr Shadrake's comment that it was a fair hearing, was fully reported by local, international and alternative media. The judgment has been published and is available for public scrutiny. Every society strikes its own balance between the rights of the individual and society. The death penalty has been and continues to be openly and vigorously debated in Singapore. But it is an issue for Singaporeans to decide, and the majority support the death penalty.The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report (2009-10) rated Singapore first out of 133 countries for public trust of politicians and transparency of government policymaking, and 19th out of 133 countries on judicial independence, ahead of Japan, France, Belgium and the US.

Part of the reason is that we have sensible rules that maintain the standing of our courts.Michael Eng Cheng TeoHigh commissioner of Singapore", "tags": ["Singapore", "World news", "Alan Shadrake", "Press freedom", "Media", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Letters: Singapore and press freedom"},{"date": "2010-11-16T22:00:02Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Last week, when the high court of Singapore convicted the British author Alan Shadrake for contempt, he knew that he faced the possibility of imprisonment for the offence. Today that became a reality when the 75-year-old was sentenced to six weeks in jail and fined for \"scandalising the judiciary\" for remarks in his book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock. The book includes an interview with Darshan Singh, the former chief executioner at Singapore's Changi prison, who was said to have executed 1,000 prisoners over half a century.However, the central theme of the book is Shadrake's claim that Singapore's legal system does not accord equal treatment to those suspected of capital offences. The death penalty is mandatory for a number of offences including murder and possession of drugs over a certain amount. In Singapore, as a result, he asserts that the question of who lives and who dies is an arbitrary lottery.He explains that this is because the manipulation and decision-making takes place at the time of investigation and prosecution. Those who are rich, powerful or likely to have the backing of a significant trade partner escape charges that carry the death penalty. Those who have no influence behind them are charged with capital crimes, convicted, sentenced to death and executed. If his analysis is correct, it makes a mockery of the claim that the law is applied equally to all and without discrimination.With a population of 5 million, Singapore has one of the world's highest per capita execution rates. While official figures are not produced, according to Amnesty International there have been at least 400 executions over the past two decades.Shadrake's case highlights two important issues. First, the power to punish a person for contempt on the ground of \"scandalising the court\" is in many parts of the world a rare offence. Legitimate criticism of judicial conduct is protected by the right to free expression and in turn strengthens public confidence. In Britain the judiciary has been subject to heavy and sometimes personalised criticism arising from miscarriage of justice cases. But it has never sought to invoke a criminal prosecution for \"scandalising the judiciary\".The prospect of judges punishing someone in the matter of a book criticising the legal system creates a very dangerous precedent. The judiciary should not be judges in their own cause. To convict a man for writing a book of this nature, and furthermore to imprison him, fails to deal with the issues he has raised; and this is the second point.Shadrake seeks to place the application of the death penalty in context. He argues that politics, international trade and business determine who lives and who dies at the gallows; and that foreign nationals, whose cases may result in negative political and economic fallout, have succeeded in escaping execution.He highlights the execution of the migrant Filipino maid Flor Contemplacion \u2013 whose treatment brought relations between the two countries to such a crisis point that Shadrake says the next Filipino maid could not be executed \u2013 and the case of Julia Bohl, a German woman who escaped the death penalty although she had originally been arrested for possession of drugs that carried a capital charge. Shadrake claims that because of the likely repercussions, the authorities eventually charged her with a lesser offence to which she pleaded guilty and for which she was ultimately sentenced to five years in prison.The book has drawn important attention to serious issues that surely require further investigation. Such disturbing details are of general concern and provide a strong basis for self-criticism by the Singapore government and perhaps even a commission of inquiry. Instead Shadrake finds himself convicted of an attack on the judiciary. He has suffered because he chose to write a book that has brought to the fore the politics of the death penalty.

The conviction of Alan Shadrake, an outspoken but hitherto unknown British author, is not merely unjust; it reminds outsiders of the authoritarian and sinister side of a city state that most people associate only with shopping.Shadrake is the latest in a long line of victims of one of the world's most vicious defamation cultures. Pretty much any criticism can be deemed as \"insult\". International media have fallen foul \u2013 from the Economist to the Far Eastern Economic Review \u2013 and most of the tiny group of opposition politicians have over the years been bankrupted and then imprisoned for going against the grain.Shadrake, who divides his time between Malaysia and the UK, knew what he was doing, and he knew the consequences. He knew he was inviting trouble \u2013 more specifically charges of contempt \u2013 by calling into question the probity of the judiciary. But that does not make the attack on him any less acceptable or sensible. Imagine if Singapore had shown a little more foresight and ignored the affair. The book would not have matched Jamie or Nigella on the bestsellers.Sentencing has now been deferred for a week, with prosecutors asking for \"only\" 12 weeks jail. This is more lenient than anticipated, perhaps denoting an element of embarrassment at the bad press. But the trial should not have happened in the first place.As a frequent visitor to Singapore (where I was born), I have seen the best and the worst of the place. When nearly two years ago I wrote a piece for the Guardian previewing my book, Freedom for Sale as the model of the global tendency of people trading their liberty for either wealth or security \u2013 I was instantly denounced. They did not appreciate my description of the consumer culture there as \"the anaesthetic for the brain\".In spite of, or perhaps because of, the denunciations, I sought to engage the Singaporeans at the top of government. I suggested to them that their kneejerk response to all criticism, no matter the tone or subject matter, was doing their country enormous harm. They then surprised me by inviting me over to launch my book there. My father suggested they might \"do a Polanski on me\" and arrest me at the airport. In the event, I was treated well and the government-controlled Straits Times devoted two pages to a measured critique of my thesis.The vacillations in my treatment suggest that the government in Singapore is not talking with one voice. Everyone is wondering what will happen once the 87-year-old Lee Kuan Yew, the father of the independent nation and father of the present prime minister, passes on. Will Singapore begin to loosen its stifling grip and tolerate free expression? I examine these questions in a special report later this week on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.Singapore's population is well travelled and highly educated.

MM Lee said he believes Japan may well \"go nuclear.\" MM Lee also offered views on the Chinese economy, Taiwan, Chinese leaders, and U.S.-China relations. End Summary.China and North Korea---------------------4. (S) Deputy Secretary Steinberg met with Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on May 30 on the margins of the Shangri-La Dialogue, the annual international security forum held in Singapore. The Deputy Secretary used the meeting with MM Lee to stress the importance of Chinese cooperation in addressing the North Korea nuclear issue and to elicit MM Lee's views on China and North Korea. MM Lee said the Chinese do not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Chinese do not want North Korea, which China sees as a buffer state, to collapse. The ROK would take over in the North and China would face a U.S. presence at its border. If China has to choose, Beijing sees a North Korea with nuclear weapons as less bad for China than a North Korea that has collapsed, he stated.5. (S) MM Lee said he asked Deputy Chief of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Ma Xiaotian what China can do about North Korea. General Ma's Delphic answer was that \"they can survive on their own.\" MM Lee said he interpreted this as meaning that even if China cut off aid, the DPRK leadership would survive. This is a leadership that has already taken actions like killing ROK Cabinet Members in Burma and shooting down a KAL flight. If they lose power, they will end up facing justice at The Hague, like Milosevic. They have been so isolated for so long that they have no friends, not even Russia. They have not trusted China since the Chinese began cultivating ties with the ROK, given China's interest in attracting foreign investment, he said. The Deputy Secretary noted that the DPRK could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach. If not, North Korea faces a change of course by the United States, the ROK and Japan. MM Lee expressed worry about the effect on Iran if the DPRK persists. MM Lee said he believes the DPRK can be contained and will not proliferate, but Iran has very high ambitions, ties to Shiite communities outside Iran, and oil wealth.6. (S) The Deputy Secretary noted that North Korea's decisions will have an impact in Japan. MM Lee said he believes Japan may well \"go nuclear.\" The Chinese must have factored this into their calculations and concluded that the prospect of Japan with nuclear weapons is less bad than losing North Korea as a buffer state. The Chinese take a long-term view and must think that within a few years the DPRK's current leadership will be gone and there will be new leadership, with new thinking. But there will still be a North Korea, he said.7. (S) MM Lee said he wishes the USG well in its efforts on North Korea, but he would be surprised if the North Koreans agree to give up nuclear weapons. They might give up a first-strike capacity, but they want nuclear weapons in case the USG decides to seek regime change. They are psychopathic types, with a \"flabby old chap\" for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation. MM Lee noted that he had learned from living through three and a half years of Japanese occupation in Singapore that people will obey authorities who can deny them food, clothing and medicine.8. (S) MM Lee said the ROK, after seeing what had happened with German unification, does not want immediate unification with the DPRK. There is \"nothing there\" in the DPRK, other than a military organization. Kim Jong-Il has already had a stroke. It is just a matter of time before he has another stroke. The next leader may not have the gumption or the bile of his father or grandfather. He may not be prepared to see people die like flies. China is calculating all this. They have their best men on the job. They want to help the United States to advance common objectives. But they do not want the South to take over the North, MM Lee said.Chinese Economy---------------9. (C) Regarding the Chinese economy, MM Lee said the global economic crisis has hit many countries, but the feel on the ground differs considerably from place to place. The Chinese economy is reportedly in the doldrums, but when MM Lee visited Jiangsu Province on May 24, his impression was one of continued prosperity. Shanghai has been harder hit, with container port traffic down 30-35 percent, similar to the situation in Singapore. There is no sign of deep unrest in China. The Chinese are very confident they will be able to sustain eight percent growth. The government is pumping resources into the economy, with a focus on developing Western China. Whether such policies can be sustained for three to four years is unclear, but China can certainly sustain these policies for at least a year, he said.10. (C) MM Lee stated that in the absence of a social safety net in China, the Chinese savings rate is 55 percent, exceeding even Singapore's 50 percent level. Consumption accounts for only 35 percent of Chinese GDP, as opposed to 70 percent of U.S. GDP. The Chinese leadership may be loath to shift permanently to a more consumption-oriented economy, but the leadership will do so temporarily, if only to avoid unrest. 20 million people have moved back to the countryside because of economic dislocations. The government is providing microfinance to facilitate the transition. The pragmatists are in charge. There is nothing Communist about it. They just want to preserve one party rule. The Deputy Secretary expressed concern that current Chinese policies designed to counter the economic crisis could undermine reform. MM Lee said this cannot be helped. China wants to prevent riots like the ones that happened in Guangzhou in March when Hong Kong-connected enterprises suddenly shut down, he said.Taiwan------11. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked MM Lee for his assessment of Taiwan. MM Lee said former President Chen Shui-bian had left Taiwan in a weak economic position, which had enabled President Ma Ying-Jeou to come to power with his pledge to strengthen the economy through means including expanding the three links with China. In Beijing, former President Jiang Zemin was wedded to his eight-point approach, but President Hu Jintao was more flexible. Jiang wanted to show he was a great man by solving the Taiwan issue in his lifetime, but Hu is more patient and does not have any fixed timeline. In Chinese domestic politics, Hu had wanted Vice Premier Li Keqiang from the Communist Youth League to emerge as his successor, not Vice President Xi Jinping, but Hu did his calculations and accepted Xi when it became clear that Xi had the necessary backing from the rest of the leadership. Similarly, on Taiwan, Hu will be pragmatic. It does not matter to Hu if it takes 10 years or 20 or 30. The key is building links with Taiwan. As in the case of Hong Kong, if necessary the tap could be turned off, he said.12. (C) In this context, MM Lee said, Hu could live with Ma's positions on the '92 consensus and on not addressing the reunification issue during his term in office. What mattered to Hu was that Taiwan not seek independence. If that happened, China has 1,000 missiles and is building its capacity to hold the U.S. fleet at a distance. The implicit question for Taiwan's leaders is if that is what they want, MM Lee said.13. (C) MM Lee stated that the alternative is Mainland investment in Taiwan stocks and property. The Mainland has already assured Hong Kong that it will help out economically. The Mainland has not said this to Taiwan, but the Mainland's Taiwan Affairs Director, Wang Yi, did urge Chinese companies to invest in Taiwan. In four years Taiwan's economy will pick up and Ma will win re-election. The DPP lacks strong potential candidates. Su Zhen-chang is promising, but seems unlikely to be able to win. Meanwhile, even the traditionally DPP-supporting farmers in Taiwan's South need China's market for vegetables and other products. Taiwan's continued participation in the World Health Assembly depends on Beijing. Beijing's calculation seems to be to prevent Taiwan independence in the near term, then bring Taiwan \"back to China,\" even if it takes 40 or 50 years. MM Lee said he is looking forward to visiting Fujian Province, where preparations are underway for a new southern economic area linked with Taiwan.Xi Jinping----------14. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked if in the future a leader like Xi Jinping would continue the policies on Taiwan followed by Hu Jintao. MM Lee responded affirmatively. Xi is a princeling who succeeded despite being rusticated. When the party needed his talents, Xi was brought in as Shanghai Party Secretary. Xi is seen as a Jiang Zemin protege, but in another three and a half years Jiang's influence will be gone. The focus now is on maintaining the system. There are no more strongmen like Deng Xiaoping. Jiang did not like Hu, but could not stop him, because Hu had the backing of the system and he did not make mistakes.Wang Qishan-----------15. (C) MM Lee said Vice Premier Wang Qishan, whom the MM saw in connection with celebrations in May of the 15th anniversary of Singapore-China Suzhou Industrial Park, is an exceptional talent, very assured and efficient. Wang handled SARS superbly when he was in Hainan. He excelled in coordinating the Beijing Olympics. Li Keqiang may not get the Premiership and the Party is looking for a way to keep Wang on past his 65th birthday until he is 70. MM Lee said he had met first Wang back in the 1990s but had forgotten their meeting. This time when they met, Wang told Lee he had reviewed the records of all Lee's meeting with Chinese leaders going back to the days of Deng Xiaoping to see how Lee's thinking had developed. Wang told Lee he respects him as a consistent man.China's Rise------------16. (C) MM Lee said China is following an approach consistent with ideas in the Chinese television series \"The Rise of Great Powers.\" The mistake of Germany and Japan had been their effort to challenge the existing order. The Chinese are not stupid; they have avoided this mistake. China's economy has surpassed other countries, with the exceptions of Japan and the United States. Even with those two countries, the gap is closing, with China growing at seven-nine percent annually, versus two-three percent in the United States and Japan. Overall GDP, not GDP per capita, is what matters in terms of power. China has four times the population of the United States. China is active in Latin America, Africa, and in the Gulf. Within hours, everything that is discussed in ASEAN meetings is known in Beijing, given China's close ties with Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, he stated.17. (C) MM Lee said China will not reach the American level in terms of military capabilities any time soon, but is rapidly developing asymmetrical means to deter U.S. military power. China understands that its growth depends on imports, including energy, raw materials, and food. This is why China is working with South Africa on the China-Africa Development Fund. China also needs open sea lanes. Beijing is worried about its dependence on the Strait of Malacca and is moving to ease the dependence by means like a pipeline through Burma.Build Ties with Young Chinese-----------------------------18. (C) MM Lee said the best course for the United States on China is to build ties with China's young people. China's best and brightest want to study in the United States, with the UK as the next option, then Japan. While they are there, it is important that they be treated as equals, with the cultural support they may need as foreigners. Why not have International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs for China? Why not have Chinese cadets at West Point alongside Vietnamese cadets and Indian cadets? America's advantage is that it can make use of the talent of the entire world, as in Silicon Valley. China still tends to try to keep the foreigners in Beijing and Shanghai. MM Lee noted that his own experience as a student in the UK had left him with an enduring fondness for the UK. When he spent two months at Harvard in 1968, an American professor had invited him home for Thanksgiving. This was not the sort of thing that happened in the UK, and Lee had realized he was dealing with a different civilization. In the future, China's leaders will have PhDs and MBAs from American universities, he predicted.19.

His lawyer, M Ravi, said earlier this month that his client should have been censured rather than jailed.Loh dismissed Shadrake's last-minute apology as \"nothing more than a tactical ploy to in court to obtain a reduced sentence\" \u2013 the longest given for contempt of court in Singapore, according to reports.Loh said Shadrake would have to serve an additional two weeks in prison if he failed to pay the fine.Shadrake's trial has reignited debate over Singapore's alleged use of contempt laws to stifle dissent and punish journalists deemed to have insulted the authorities.It was not clear if Shadrake would appeal against his sentence. He also faces separate charges of criminal defamation, punishable by a maximum of two years in prison and a hefty fine.Shadrake was arrested on 18 July after attending an event to launch his book in Singapore. In a recent interview with the Guardian, he admitted one minor inaccuracy in his book, but insisted the rest was \"devastatingly accurate\".\"They know the book is accurate, which is why they're going to all this trouble,\" he said.He added that he was undeterred by the prospect of going to prison: \"This story is never going away.

Mr Shadrake had alleged, without any basis, that the Singapore courts conspired with state agencies to suppress material evidence. Such a statement would be considered to be in contempt of court in many common law jurisdictions, including England, Australia, Ireland, Canada and Hong Kong.This was why Mr Shadrake was charged for contempt of court. The court found that he had made grave allegations against the independence and integrity of the Singapore judiciary, without rational basis and with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsehood. You quoted Mr Shadrake's statements confirming emphatically that his book questioned the independence and probity of the judiciary. Yet his lawyer argued in court that Mr Shadrake had not intended to allege any cover-up \"by the high echelons of the judiciary\". This duplicity was not lost on the court.The trial, along with Mr Shadrake's comment that it was a fair hearing, was fully reported by local, international and alternative media. The judgment has been published and is available for public scrutiny. Every society strikes its own balance between the rights of the individual and society. The death penalty has been and continues to be openly and vigorously debated in Singapore. But it is an issue for Singaporeans to decide, and the majority support the death penalty.The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report (2009-10) rated Singapore first out of 133 countries for public trust of politicians and transparency of government policymaking, and 19th out of 133 countries on judicial independence, ahead of Japan, France, Belgium and the US. You yourself acknowledge Singapore's successes. Part of the reason is that we have sensible rules that maintain the standing of our courts.Michael Eng Cheng TeoHigh commissioner of Singapore", "tags": ["Singapore", "World news", "Alan Shadrake", "Press freedom", "Media", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Letters: Singapore and press freedom"},{"date": "2010-11-16T22:00:02Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Last week, when the high court of Singapore convicted the British author Alan Shadrake for contempt, he knew that he faced the possibility of imprisonment for the offence. Today that became a reality when the 75-year-old was sentenced to six weeks in jail and fined for \"scandalising the judiciary\" for remarks in his book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock. The book includes an interview with Darshan Singh, the former chief executioner at Singapore's Changi prison, who was said to have executed 1,000 prisoners over half a century.However, the central theme of the book is Shadrake's claim that Singapore's legal system does not accord equal treatment to those suspected of capital offences. The death penalty is mandatory for a number of offences including murder and possession of drugs over a certain amount. In Singapore, as a result, he asserts that the question of who lives and who dies is an arbitrary lottery.He explains that this is because the manipulation and decision-making takes place at the time of investigation and prosecution. Those who are rich, powerful or likely to have the backing of a significant trade partner escape charges that carry the death penalty. Those who have no influence behind them are charged with capital crimes, convicted, sentenced to death and executed. If his analysis is correct, it makes a mockery of the claim that the law is applied equally to all and without discrimination.With a population of 5 million, Singapore has one of the world's highest per capita execution rates. While official figures are not produced, according to Amnesty International there have been at least 400 executions over the past two decades.Shadrake's case highlights two important issues. First, the power to punish a person for contempt on the ground of \"scandalising the court\" is in many parts of the world a rare offence. Legitimate criticism of judicial conduct is protected by the right to free expression and in turn strengthens public confidence. In Britain the judiciary has been subject to heavy and sometimes personalised criticism arising from miscarriage of justice cases. But it has never sought to invoke a criminal prosecution for \"scandalising the judiciary\".The prospect of judges punishing someone in the matter of a book criticising the legal system creates a very dangerous precedent. The judiciary should not be judges in their own cause. To convict a man for writing a book of this nature, and furthermore to imprison him, fails to deal with the issues he has raised; and this is the second point.Shadrake seeks to place the application of the death penalty in context. He argues that politics, international trade and business determine who lives and who dies at the gallows; and that foreign nationals, whose cases may result in negative political and economic fallout, have succeeded in escaping execution.He highlights the execution of the migrant Filipino maid Flor Contemplacion \u2013 whose treatment brought relations between the two countries to such a crisis point that Shadrake says the next Filipino maid could not be executed \u2013 and the case of Julia Bohl, a German woman who escaped the death penalty although she had originally been arrested for possession of drugs that carried a capital charge. Shadrake claims that because of the likely repercussions, the authorities eventually charged her with a lesser offence to which she pleaded guilty and for which she was ultimately sentenced to five years in prison.The book has drawn important attention to serious issues that surely require further investigation. Such disturbing details are of general concern and provide a strong basis for self-criticism by the Singapore government and perhaps even a commission of inquiry. Instead Shadrake finds himself convicted of an attack on the judiciary. He has suffered because he chose to write a book that has brought to the fore the politics of the death penalty. Let us hope he has not suffered in vain.", "tags": ["Alan Shadrake", "Law", "Singapore", "Books", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Death and discrimination in Singapore | Parvais Jabbar and Saul Lehrfreund"},{"date": "2010-11-17T00:05:12Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Singapore is proud of its place near the top of many international rankings. Its school system is by some measures the world's best. The island state promotes itself as diverse, competitive and cultured \u2013 an exciting global hub. But there are two league tables which shame Singapore. The first, compiled by the campaigning group Reporters Without Borders, places the country 136th in the world for press freedom \u2013 below Iraq and Zimbabwe. The second is the rate at which Singapore executes convicted criminals: arguably higher, per capita, than any other country in the world.Singapore presents itself as a modern liberal democracy: it has a parliament, elections, courts, a constitutional right to free speech and the consumerist gloss of capitalism. Its citizens are free to become rich and to travel. Many do both. The country has by any measure succeeded since independence. But its autocratic political culture \u2013 overseen by the country's founding father and now official minister mentor Lee Kuan Yew \u2013 is highly and needlessly restrictive. The media is largely state-owned. Defamation and contempt laws threaten dissent. The latest victim of these is Alan Shadrake, a British-born writer sentenced yesterday to six weeks in prison and a large fine after being found guilty of contempt of court. His book Once a Jolly Hangman questioned the independence of Singapore's legal system, and its use of the death penalty.It is depressing that a country as successful as Singapore should feel the need for such restrictions on free speech. Singapore argues that, without them, the balance between the country's Chinese, Malay and Indian populations would be upset. But the reality is that other successful parts of Asia \u2013 Hong Kong and Taiwan, for instance \u2013 have thrived by extending free speech and the rule of law. Singapore is making itself a less significant place by refusing to give its people the sorts of freedoms that are routine elsewhere.On a practical level, the decision to prosecute Mr Shadrake was also foolish. His book has had far greater attention because of it, and Singapore's reputation has been harmed. Mr Shadrake is quite right to attack a criminal justice system whose victims are often poor migrant workers. His book was legitimate and \u2013 despite the court's claim to the contrary \u2013 largely accurate. The suspicion is that the Singapore government resented the exposure of a squalid system of routine executions which sits uneasily with the image it likes to present to the world.

The conviction of Alan Shadrake, an outspoken but hitherto unknown British author, is not merely unjust; it reminds outsiders of the authoritarian and sinister side of a city state that most people associate only with shopping.Shadrake is the latest in a long line of victims of one of the world's most vicious defamation cultures. Pretty much any criticism can be deemed as \"insult\". International media have fallen foul \u2013 from the Economist to the Far Eastern Economic Review \u2013 and most of the tiny group of opposition politicians have over the years been bankrupted and then imprisoned for going against the grain.Shadrake, who divides his time between Malaysia and the UK, knew what he was doing, and he knew the consequences. He knew he was inviting trouble \u2013 more specifically charges of contempt \u2013 by calling into question the probity of the judiciary. But that does not make the attack on him any less acceptable or sensible. Imagine if Singapore had shown a little more foresight and ignored the affair. The book would not have matched Jamie or Nigella on the bestsellers.Sentencing has now been deferred for a week, with prosecutors asking for \"only\" 12 weeks jail. This is more lenient than anticipated, perhaps denoting an element of embarrassment at the bad press. But the trial should not have happened in the first place.As a frequent visitor to Singapore (where I was born), I have seen the best and the worst of the place. When nearly two years ago I wrote a piece for the Guardian previewing my book, Freedom for Sale as the model of the global tendency of people trading their liberty for either wealth or security \u2013 I was instantly denounced. They did not appreciate my description of the consumer culture there as \"the anaesthetic for the brain\".In spite of, or perhaps because of, the denunciations, I sought to engage the Singaporeans at the top of government. I suggested to them that their kneejerk response to all criticism, no matter the tone or subject matter, was doing their country enormous harm. They then surprised me by inviting me over to launch my book there. My father suggested they might \"do a Polanski on me\" and arrest me at the airport. In the event, I was treated well and the government-controlled Straits Times devoted two pages to a measured critique of my thesis.The vacillations in my treatment suggest that the government in Singapore is not talking with one voice. Everyone is wondering what will happen once the 87-year-old Lee Kuan Yew, the father of the independent nation and father of the present prime minister, passes on. Will Singapore begin to loosen its stifling grip and tolerate free expression? I examine these questions in a special report later this week on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.Singapore's population is well travelled and highly educated. The country is stable and completely integrated into the global economy and communications. Already it is allowing just a little more cultural freedom, but it does so nervously.

MM Lee said he believes Japan may well \"go nuclear.\" MM Lee also offered views on the Chinese economy, Taiwan, Chinese leaders, and U.S.-China relations. End Summary.China and North Korea---------------------4. (S) Deputy Secretary Steinberg met with Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on May 30 on the margins of the Shangri-La Dialogue, the annual international security forum held in Singapore. The Deputy Secretary used the meeting with MM Lee to stress the importance of Chinese cooperation in addressing the North Korea nuclear issue and to elicit MM Lee's views on China and North Korea. MM Lee said the Chinese do not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Chinese do not want North Korea, which China sees as a buffer state, to collapse. The ROK would take over in the North and China would face a U.S. presence at its border. If China has to choose, Beijing sees a North Korea with nuclear weapons as less bad for China than a North Korea that has collapsed, he stated.5. (S) MM Lee said he asked Deputy Chief of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Ma Xiaotian what China can do about North Korea. General Ma's Delphic answer was that \"they can survive on their own.\" MM Lee said he interpreted this as meaning that even if China cut off aid, the DPRK leadership would survive. This is a leadership that has already taken actions like killing ROK Cabinet Members in Burma and shooting down a KAL flight. If they lose power, they will end up facing justice at The Hague, like Milosevic. They have been so isolated for so long that they have no friends, not even Russia. They have not trusted China since the Chinese began cultivating ties with the ROK, given China's interest in attracting foreign investment, he said. The Deputy Secretary noted that the DPRK could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach. If not, North Korea faces a change of course by the United States, the ROK and Japan. MM Lee expressed worry about the effect on Iran if the DPRK persists. MM Lee said he believes the DPRK can be contained and will not proliferate, but Iran has very high ambitions, ties to Shiite communities outside Iran, and oil wealth.6. (S) The Deputy Secretary noted that North Korea's decisions will have an impact in Japan. MM Lee said he believes Japan may well \"go nuclear.\" The Chinese must have factored this into their calculations and concluded that the prospect of Japan with nuclear weapons is less bad than losing North Korea as a buffer state. The Chinese take a long-term view and must think that within a few years the DPRK's current leadership will be gone and there will be new leadership, with new thinking. But there will still be a North Korea, he said.7. (S) MM Lee said he wishes the USG well in its efforts on North Korea, but he would be surprised if the North Koreans agree to give up nuclear weapons. They might give up a first-strike capacity, but they want nuclear weapons in case the USG decides to seek regime change. They are psychopathic types, with a \"flabby old chap\" for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation. MM Lee noted that he had learned from living through three and a half years of Japanese occupation in Singapore that people will obey authorities who can deny them food, clothing and medicine.8. (S) MM Lee said the ROK, after seeing what had happened with German unification, does not want immediate unification with the DPRK. There is \"nothing there\" in the DPRK, other than a military organization. Kim Jong-Il has already had a stroke. It is just a matter of time before he has another stroke. The next leader may not have the gumption or the bile of his father or grandfather. He may not be prepared to see people die like flies. China is calculating all this. They have their best men on the job. They want to help the United States to advance common objectives. But they do not want the South to take over the North, MM Lee said.Chinese Economy---------------9. (C) Regarding the Chinese economy, MM Lee said the global economic crisis has hit many countries, but the feel on the ground differs considerably from place to place. The Chinese economy is reportedly in the doldrums, but when MM Lee visited Jiangsu Province on May 24, his impression was one of continued prosperity. Shanghai has been harder hit, with container port traffic down 30-35 percent, similar to the situation in Singapore. There is no sign of deep unrest in China. The Chinese are very confident they will be able to sustain eight percent growth. The government is pumping resources into the economy, with a focus on developing Western China. Whether such policies can be sustained for three to four years is unclear, but China can certainly sustain these policies for at least a year, he said.10. (C) MM Lee stated that in the absence of a social safety net in China, the Chinese savings rate is 55 percent, exceeding even Singapore's 50 percent level. Consumption accounts for only 35 percent of Chinese GDP, as opposed to 70 percent of U.S. GDP. The Chinese leadership may be loath to shift permanently to a more consumption-oriented economy, but the leadership will do so temporarily, if only to avoid unrest. 20 million people have moved back to the countryside because of economic dislocations. The government is providing microfinance to facilitate the transition. The pragmatists are in charge. There is nothing Communist about it. They just want to preserve one party rule. The Deputy Secretary expressed concern that current Chinese policies designed to counter the economic crisis could undermine reform. MM Lee said this cannot be helped. China wants to prevent riots like the ones that happened in Guangzhou in March when Hong Kong-connected enterprises suddenly shut down, he said.Taiwan------11. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked MM Lee for his assessment of Taiwan. MM Lee said former President Chen Shui-bian had left Taiwan in a weak economic position, which had enabled President Ma Ying-Jeou to come to power with his pledge to strengthen the economy through means including expanding the three links with China. In Beijing, former President Jiang Zemin was wedded to his eight-point approach, but President Hu Jintao was more flexible. Jiang wanted to show he was a great man by solving the Taiwan issue in his lifetime, but Hu is more patient and does not have any fixed timeline. In Chinese domestic politics, Hu had wanted Vice Premier Li Keqiang from the Communist Youth League to emerge as his successor, not Vice President Xi Jinping, but Hu did his calculations and accepted Xi when it became clear that Xi had the necessary backing from the rest of the leadership. Similarly, on Taiwan, Hu will be pragmatic. It does not matter to Hu if it takes 10 years or 20 or 30. The key is building links with Taiwan. As in the case of Hong Kong, if necessary the tap could be turned off, he said.12. (C) In this context, MM Lee said, Hu could live with Ma's positions on the '92 consensus and on not addressing the reunification issue during his term in office. What mattered to Hu was that Taiwan not seek independence. If that happened, China has 1,000 missiles and is building its capacity to hold the U.S. fleet at a distance. The implicit question for Taiwan's leaders is if that is what they want, MM Lee said.13. (C) MM Lee stated that the alternative is Mainland investment in Taiwan stocks and property. The Mainland has already assured Hong Kong that it will help out economically. The Mainland has not said this to Taiwan, but the Mainland's Taiwan Affairs Director, Wang Yi, did urge Chinese companies to invest in Taiwan. In four years Taiwan's economy will pick up and Ma will win re-election. The DPP lacks strong potential candidates. Su Zhen-chang is promising, but seems unlikely to be able to win. Meanwhile, even the traditionally DPP-supporting farmers in Taiwan's South need China's market for vegetables and other products. Taiwan's continued participation in the World Health Assembly depends on Beijing. Beijing's calculation seems to be to prevent Taiwan independence in the near term, then bring Taiwan \"back to China,\" even if it takes 40 or 50 years. MM Lee said he is looking forward to visiting Fujian Province, where preparations are underway for a new southern economic area linked with Taiwan.Xi Jinping----------14. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked if in the future a leader like Xi Jinping would continue the policies on Taiwan followed by Hu Jintao. MM Lee responded affirmatively. Xi is a princeling who succeeded despite being rusticated. When the party needed his talents, Xi was brought in as Shanghai Party Secretary. Xi is seen as a Jiang Zemin protege, but in another three and a half years Jiang's influence will be gone. The focus now is on maintaining the system. There are no more strongmen like Deng Xiaoping. Jiang did not like Hu, but could not stop him, because Hu had the backing of the system and he did not make mistakes.Wang Qishan-----------15. (C) MM Lee said Vice Premier Wang Qishan, whom the MM saw in connection with celebrations in May of the 15th anniversary of Singapore-China Suzhou Industrial Park, is an exceptional talent, very assured and efficient. Wang handled SARS superbly when he was in Hainan. He excelled in coordinating the Beijing Olympics. Li Keqiang may not get the Premiership and the Party is looking for a way to keep Wang on past his 65th birthday until he is 70. MM Lee said he had met first Wang back in the 1990s but had forgotten their meeting. This time when they met, Wang told Lee he had reviewed the records of all Lee's meeting with Chinese leaders going back to the days of Deng Xiaoping to see how Lee's thinking had developed. Wang told Lee he respects him as a consistent man.China's Rise------------16. (C) MM Lee said China is following an approach consistent with ideas in the Chinese television series \"The Rise of Great Powers.\" The mistake of Germany and Japan had been their effort to challenge the existing order. The Chinese are not stupid; they have avoided this mistake. China's economy has surpassed other countries, with the exceptions of Japan and the United States. Even with those two countries, the gap is closing, with China growing at seven-nine percent annually, versus two-three percent in the United States and Japan. Overall GDP, not GDP per capita, is what matters in terms of power. China has four times the population of the United States. China is active in Latin America, Africa, and in the Gulf. Within hours, everything that is discussed in ASEAN meetings is known in Beijing, given China's close ties with Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, he stated.17. (C) MM Lee said China will not reach the American level in terms of military capabilities any time soon, but is rapidly developing asymmetrical means to deter U.S. military power. China understands that its growth depends on imports, including energy, raw materials, and food. This is why China is working with South Africa on the China-Africa Development Fund. China also needs open sea lanes. Beijing is worried about its dependence on the Strait of Malacca and is moving to ease the dependence by means like a pipeline through Burma.Build Ties with Young Chinese-----------------------------18. (C) MM Lee said the best course for the United States on China is to build ties with China's young people. China's best and brightest want to study in the United States, with the UK as the next option, then Japan. While they are there, it is important that they be treated as equals, with the cultural support they may need as foreigners. Why not have International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs for China? Why not have Chinese cadets at West Point alongside Vietnamese cadets and Indian cadets? America's advantage is that it can make use of the talent of the entire world, as in Silicon Valley. China still tends to try to keep the foreigners in Beijing and Shanghai. MM Lee noted that his own experience as a student in the UK had left him with an enduring fondness for the UK. When he spent two months at Harvard in 1968, an American professor had invited him home for Thanksgiving. This was not the sort of thing that happened in the UK, and Lee had realized he was dealing with a different civilization. In the future, China's leaders will have PhDs and MBAs from American universities, he predicted.19.

He also faces separate charges of criminal defamation, which are punishable by a maximum of two years in prison and a hefty fine.

From 1990 to 2003 he wrote the popular but contentious Shooting From The Lip column for the Santa Monica-based paper that serves the large British expat community in California, the British Weekly.

Mr Shadrake had alleged, without any basis, that the Singapore courts conspired with state agencies to suppress material evidence. Such a statement would be considered to be in contempt of court in many common law jurisdictions, including England, Australia, Ireland, Canada and Hong Kong.This was why Mr Shadrake was charged for contempt of court. The court found that he had made grave allegations against the independence and integrity of the Singapore judiciary, without rational basis and with reckless disregard as to their truth or falsehood. You quoted Mr Shadrake's statements confirming emphatically that his book questioned the independence and probity of the judiciary. Yet his lawyer argued in court that Mr Shadrake had not intended to allege any cover-up \"by the high echelons of the judiciary\". This duplicity was not lost on the court.The trial, along with Mr Shadrake's comment that it was a fair hearing, was fully reported by local, international and alternative media. The judgment has been published and is available for public scrutiny. Every society strikes its own balance between the rights of the individual and society. The death penalty has been and continues to be openly and vigorously debated in Singapore. But it is an issue for Singaporeans to decide, and the majority support the death penalty.The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report (2009-10) rated Singapore first out of 133 countries for public trust of politicians and transparency of government policymaking, and 19th out of 133 countries on judicial independence, ahead of Japan, France, Belgium and the US.

Part of the reason is that we have sensible rules that maintain the standing of our courts.Michael Eng Cheng TeoHigh commissioner of Singapore", "tags": ["Singapore", "World news", "Alan Shadrake", "Press freedom", "Media", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Letters: Singapore and press freedom"},{"date": "2010-11-16T22:00:02Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Last week, when the high court of Singapore convicted the British author Alan Shadrake for contempt, he knew that he faced the possibility of imprisonment for the offence. Today that became a reality when the 75-year-old was sentenced to six weeks in jail and fined for \"scandalising the judiciary\" for remarks in his book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock. The book includes an interview with Darshan Singh, the former chief executioner at Singapore's Changi prison, who was said to have executed 1,000 prisoners over half a century.However, the central theme of the book is Shadrake's claim that Singapore's legal system does not accord equal treatment to those suspected of capital offences. The death penalty is mandatory for a number of offences including murder and possession of drugs over a certain amount. In Singapore, as a result, he asserts that the question of who lives and who dies is an arbitrary lottery.He explains that this is because the manipulation and decision-making takes place at the time of investigation and prosecution. Those who are rich, powerful or likely to have the backing of a significant trade partner escape charges that carry the death penalty. Those who have no influence behind them are charged with capital crimes, convicted, sentenced to death and executed. If his analysis is correct, it makes a mockery of the claim that the law is applied equally to all and without discrimination.With a population of 5 million, Singapore has one of the world's highest per capita execution rates. While official figures are not produced, according to Amnesty International there have been at least 400 executions over the past two decades.Shadrake's case highlights two important issues. First, the power to punish a person for contempt on the ground of \"scandalising the court\" is in many parts of the world a rare offence. Legitimate criticism of judicial conduct is protected by the right to free expression and in turn strengthens public confidence. In Britain the judiciary has been subject to heavy and sometimes personalised criticism arising from miscarriage of justice cases. But it has never sought to invoke a criminal prosecution for \"scandalising the judiciary\".The prospect of judges punishing someone in the matter of a book criticising the legal system creates a very dangerous precedent. The judiciary should not be judges in their own cause. To convict a man for writing a book of this nature, and furthermore to imprison him, fails to deal with the issues he has raised; and this is the second point.Shadrake seeks to place the application of the death penalty in context. He argues that politics, international trade and business determine who lives and who dies at the gallows; and that foreign nationals, whose cases may result in negative political and economic fallout, have succeeded in escaping execution.He highlights the execution of the migrant Filipino maid Flor Contemplacion \u2013 whose treatment brought relations between the two countries to such a crisis point that Shadrake says the next Filipino maid could not be executed \u2013 and the case of Julia Bohl, a German woman who escaped the death penalty although she had originally been arrested for possession of drugs that carried a capital charge. Shadrake claims that because of the likely repercussions, the authorities eventually charged her with a lesser offence to which she pleaded guilty and for which she was ultimately sentenced to five years in prison.The book has drawn important attention to serious issues that surely require further investigation. Such disturbing details are of general concern and provide a strong basis for self-criticism by the Singapore government and perhaps even a commission of inquiry. Instead Shadrake finds himself convicted of an attack on the judiciary. He has suffered because he chose to write a book that has brought to the fore the politics of the death penalty. Let us hope he has not suffered in vain.", "tags": ["Alan Shadrake", "Law", "Singapore", "Books", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Death and discrimination in Singapore | Parvais Jabbar and Saul Lehrfreund"},{"date": "2010-11-17T00:05:12Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Singapore is proud of its place near the top of many international rankings. Its school system is by some measures the world's best. The island state promotes itself as diverse, competitive and cultured \u2013 an exciting global hub. But there are two league tables which shame Singapore. The first, compiled by the campaigning group Reporters Without Borders, places the country 136th in the world for press freedom \u2013 below Iraq and Zimbabwe. The second is the rate at which Singapore executes convicted criminals: arguably higher, per capita, than any other country in the world.Singapore presents itself as a modern liberal democracy: it has a parliament, elections, courts, a constitutional right to free speech and the consumerist gloss of capitalism. Its citizens are free to become rich and to travel. Many do both. The country has by any measure succeeded since independence. But its autocratic political culture \u2013 overseen by the country's founding father and now official minister mentor Lee Kuan Yew \u2013 is highly and needlessly restrictive. The media is largely state-owned. Defamation and contempt laws threaten dissent. The latest victim of these is Alan Shadrake, a British-born writer sentenced yesterday to six weeks in prison and a large fine after being found guilty of contempt of court. His book Once a Jolly Hangman questioned the independence of Singapore's legal system, and its use of the death penalty.It is depressing that a country as successful as Singapore should feel the need for such restrictions on free speech. Singapore argues that, without them, the balance between the country's Chinese, Malay and Indian populations would be upset. But the reality is that other successful parts of Asia \u2013 Hong Kong and Taiwan, for instance \u2013 have thrived by extending free speech and the rule of law. Singapore is making itself a less significant place by refusing to give its people the sorts of freedoms that are routine elsewhere.On a practical level, the decision to prosecute Mr Shadrake was also foolish. His book has had far greater attention because of it, and Singapore's reputation has been harmed. Mr Shadrake is quite right to attack a criminal justice system whose victims are often poor migrant workers. His book was legitimate and \u2013 despite the court's claim to the contrary \u2013 largely accurate. The suspicion is that the Singapore government resented the exposure of a squalid system of routine executions which sits uneasily with the image it likes to present to the world. Singapore wants to be judged as a first-world nation. It must find the confidence to allow its citizens the freedoms that go with that status. Repression is not the route to success.

Shadrake's lawyer, M Ravi, insisted his client had not intended to scandalise the conservative state's \"hypersensitive\" judiciary, adding that comments critical of the criminal justice system were \"fair criticism\".The case was brought in response to Shadrake's book, Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore's Justice in the Dock, which accuses courts of bowing to diplomatic and economic pressure in deciding how to dispense justice.It also accuses them of favouring the wealthy and abusing the law to suppress political opponents.The book includes a profile of a former chief executioner and interviews with human rights activists, lawyers and former police officers.According to Amnesty International, Singapore, with a population of five million, has one of the world's highest per capita execution rates, having put more than 400 people to death over the past two decades.Loh said: \"This is a case about someone who says, among other things, the judges in Singapore are not impartial ... and are influenced by political and economic situations and biased against the weak and the poor.\"Last month, Singapore's attorney general's office described comments in Shadrake's book as \"especially pernicious\", adding that they \"cannot possibly come within any reasonable notion of fair criticism\".The book, which was published in Malaysia, where Shadrake is based, is reportedly not banned in Singapore, but sellers and distributors will have to seek legal advice before releasing it.Shadrake, whose passport has been confiscated by the authorities, was released on bail.

The conviction of Alan Shadrake, an outspoken but hitherto unknown British author, is not merely unjust; it reminds outsiders of the authoritarian and sinister side of a city state that most people associate only with shopping.Shadrake is the latest in a long line of victims of one of the world's most vicious defamation cultures. Pretty much any criticism can be deemed as \"insult\". International media have fallen foul \u2013 from the Economist to the Far Eastern Economic Review \u2013 and most of the tiny group of opposition politicians have over the years been bankrupted and then imprisoned for going against the grain.Shadrake, who divides his time between Malaysia and the UK, knew what he was doing, and he knew the consequences. He knew he was inviting trouble \u2013 more specifically charges of contempt \u2013 by calling into question the probity of the judiciary. But that does not make the attack on him any less acceptable or sensible. Imagine if Singapore had shown a little more foresight and ignored the affair. The book would not have matched Jamie or Nigella on the bestsellers.Sentencing has now been deferred for a week, with prosecutors asking for \"only\" 12 weeks jail. This is more lenient than anticipated, perhaps denoting an element of embarrassment at the bad press. But the trial should not have happened in the first place.As a frequent visitor to Singapore (where I was born), I have seen the best and the worst of the place. When nearly two years ago I wrote a piece for the Guardian previewing my book, Freedom for Sale as the model of the global tendency of people trading their liberty for either wealth or security \u2013 I was instantly denounced. They did not appreciate my description of the consumer culture there as \"the anaesthetic for the brain\".In spite of, or perhaps because of, the denunciations, I sought to engage the Singaporeans at the top of government. I suggested to them that their kneejerk response to all criticism, no matter the tone or subject matter, was doing their country enormous harm. They then surprised me by inviting me over to launch my book there. My father suggested they might \"do a Polanski on me\" and arrest me at the airport. In the event, I was treated well and the government-controlled Straits Times devoted two pages to a measured critique of my thesis.The vacillations in my treatment suggest that the government in Singapore is not talking with one voice. Everyone is wondering what will happen once the 87-year-old Lee Kuan Yew, the father of the independent nation and father of the present prime minister, passes on. Will Singapore begin to loosen its stifling grip and tolerate free expression? I examine these questions in a special report later this week on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.Singapore's population is well travelled and highly educated. The country is stable and completely integrated into the global economy and communications. Already it is allowing just a little more cultural freedom, but it does so nervously.

MM Lee said he believes Japan may well \"go nuclear.\" MM Lee also offered views on the Chinese economy, Taiwan, Chinese leaders, and U.S.-China relations. End Summary.China and North Korea---------------------4. (S) Deputy Secretary Steinberg met with Singapore Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew on May 30 on the margins of the Shangri-La Dialogue, the annual international security forum held in Singapore. The Deputy Secretary used the meeting with MM Lee to stress the importance of Chinese cooperation in addressing the North Korea nuclear issue and to elicit MM Lee's views on China and North Korea. MM Lee said the Chinese do not want North Korea to have nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Chinese do not want North Korea, which China sees as a buffer state, to collapse. The ROK would take over in the North and China would face a U.S. presence at its border. If China has to choose, Beijing sees a North Korea with nuclear weapons as less bad for China than a North Korea that has collapsed, he stated.5. (S) MM Lee said he asked Deputy Chief of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Ma Xiaotian what China can do about North Korea. General Ma's Delphic answer was that \"they can survive on their own.\" MM Lee said he interpreted this as meaning that even if China cut off aid, the DPRK leadership would survive. This is a leadership that has already taken actions like killing ROK Cabinet Members in Burma and shooting down a KAL flight. If they lose power, they will end up facing justice at The Hague, like Milosevic. They have been so isolated for so long that they have no friends, not even Russia. They have not trusted China since the Chinese began cultivating ties with the ROK, given China's interest in attracting foreign investment, he said. The Deputy Secretary noted that the DPRK could have a fair and attractive deal if it would change its approach. If not, North Korea faces a change of course by the United States, the ROK and Japan. MM Lee expressed worry about the effect on Iran if the DPRK persists. MM Lee said he believes the DPRK can be contained and will not proliferate, but Iran has very high ambitions, ties to Shiite communities outside Iran, and oil wealth.6. (S) The Deputy Secretary noted that North Korea's decisions will have an impact in Japan. MM Lee said he believes Japan may well \"go nuclear.\" The Chinese must have factored this into their calculations and concluded that the prospect of Japan with nuclear weapons is less bad than losing North Korea as a buffer state. The Chinese take a long-term view and must think that within a few years the DPRK's current leadership will be gone and there will be new leadership, with new thinking. But there will still be a North Korea, he said.7. (S) MM Lee said he wishes the USG well in its efforts on North Korea, but he would be surprised if the North Koreans agree to give up nuclear weapons. They might give up a first-strike capacity, but they want nuclear weapons in case the USG decides to seek regime change. They are psychopathic types, with a \"flabby old chap\" for a leader who prances around stadiums seeking adulation. MM Lee noted that he had learned from living through three and a half years of Japanese occupation in Singapore that people will obey authorities who can deny them food, clothing and medicine.8. (S) MM Lee said the ROK, after seeing what had happened with German unification, does not want immediate unification with the DPRK. There is \"nothing there\" in the DPRK, other than a military organization. Kim Jong-Il has already had a stroke. It is just a matter of time before he has another stroke. The next leader may not have the gumption or the bile of his father or grandfather. He may not be prepared to see people die like flies. China is calculating all this. They have their best men on the job. They want to help the United States to advance common objectives. But they do not want the South to take over the North, MM Lee said.Chinese Economy---------------9. (C) Regarding the Chinese economy, MM Lee said the global economic crisis has hit many countries, but the feel on the ground differs considerably from place to place. The Chinese economy is reportedly in the doldrums, but when MM Lee visited Jiangsu Province on May 24, his impression was one of continued prosperity. Shanghai has been harder hit, with container port traffic down 30-35 percent, similar to the situation in Singapore. There is no sign of deep unrest in China. The Chinese are very confident they will be able to sustain eight percent growth. The government is pumping resources into the economy, with a focus on developing Western China. Whether such policies can be sustained for three to four years is unclear, but China can certainly sustain these policies for at least a year, he said.10. (C) MM Lee stated that in the absence of a social safety net in China, the Chinese savings rate is 55 percent, exceeding even Singapore's 50 percent level. Consumption accounts for only 35 percent of Chinese GDP, as opposed to 70 percent of U.S. GDP. The Chinese leadership may be loath to shift permanently to a more consumption-oriented economy, but the leadership will do so temporarily, if only to avoid unrest. 20 million people have moved back to the countryside because of economic dislocations. The government is providing microfinance to facilitate the transition. The pragmatists are in charge. There is nothing Communist about it. They just want to preserve one party rule. The Deputy Secretary expressed concern that current Chinese policies designed to counter the economic crisis could undermine reform. MM Lee said this cannot be helped. China wants to prevent riots like the ones that happened in Guangzhou in March when Hong Kong-connected enterprises suddenly shut down, he said.Taiwan------11. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked MM Lee for his assessment of Taiwan. MM Lee said former President Chen Shui-bian had left Taiwan in a weak economic position, which had enabled President Ma Ying-Jeou to come to power with his pledge to strengthen the economy through means including expanding the three links with China. In Beijing, former President Jiang Zemin was wedded to his eight-point approach, but President Hu Jintao was more flexible. Jiang wanted to show he was a great man by solving the Taiwan issue in his lifetime, but Hu is more patient and does not have any fixed timeline. In Chinese domestic politics, Hu had wanted Vice Premier Li Keqiang from the Communist Youth League to emerge as his successor, not Vice President Xi Jinping, but Hu did his calculations and accepted Xi when it became clear that Xi had the necessary backing from the rest of the leadership. Similarly, on Taiwan, Hu will be pragmatic. It does not matter to Hu if it takes 10 years or 20 or 30. The key is building links with Taiwan. As in the case of Hong Kong, if necessary the tap could be turned off, he said.12. (C) In this context, MM Lee said, Hu could live with Ma's positions on the '92 consensus and on not addressing the reunification issue during his term in office. What mattered to Hu was that Taiwan not seek independence. If that happened, China has 1,000 missiles and is building its capacity to hold the U.S. fleet at a distance. The implicit question for Taiwan's leaders is if that is what they want, MM Lee said.13. (C) MM Lee stated that the alternative is Mainland investment in Taiwan stocks and property. The Mainland has already assured Hong Kong that it will help out economically. The Mainland has not said this to Taiwan, but the Mainland's Taiwan Affairs Director, Wang Yi, did urge Chinese companies to invest in Taiwan. In four years Taiwan's economy will pick up and Ma will win re-election. The DPP lacks strong potential candidates. Su Zhen-chang is promising, but seems unlikely to be able to win. Meanwhile, even the traditionally DPP-supporting farmers in Taiwan's South need China's market for vegetables and other products. Taiwan's continued participation in the World Health Assembly depends on Beijing. Beijing's calculation seems to be to prevent Taiwan independence in the near term, then bring Taiwan \"back to China,\" even if it takes 40 or 50 years. MM Lee said he is looking forward to visiting Fujian Province, where preparations are underway for a new southern economic area linked with Taiwan.Xi Jinping----------14. (C) The Deputy Secretary asked if in the future a leader like Xi Jinping would continue the policies on Taiwan followed by Hu Jintao. MM Lee responded affirmatively. Xi is a princeling who succeeded despite being rusticated. When the party needed his talents, Xi was brought in as Shanghai Party Secretary. Xi is seen as a Jiang Zemin protege, but in another three and a half years Jiang's influence will be gone. The focus now is on maintaining the system. There are no more strongmen like Deng Xiaoping. Jiang did not like Hu, but could not stop him, because Hu had the backing of the system and he did not make mistakes.Wang Qishan-----------15. (C) MM Lee said Vice Premier Wang Qishan, whom the MM saw in connection with celebrations in May of the 15th anniversary of Singapore-China Suzhou Industrial Park, is an exceptional talent, very assured and efficient. Wang handled SARS superbly when he was in Hainan. He excelled in coordinating the Beijing Olympics. Li Keqiang may not get the Premiership and the Party is looking for a way to keep Wang on past his 65th birthday until he is 70. MM Lee said he had met first Wang back in the 1990s but had forgotten their meeting. This time when they met, Wang told Lee he had reviewed the records of all Lee's meeting with Chinese leaders going back to the days of Deng Xiaoping to see how Lee's thinking had developed. Wang told Lee he respects him as a consistent man.China's Rise------------16. (C) MM Lee said China is following an approach consistent with ideas in the Chinese television series \"The Rise of Great Powers.\" The mistake of Germany and Japan had been their effort to challenge the existing order. The Chinese are not stupid; they have avoided this mistake. China's economy has surpassed other countries, with the exceptions of Japan and the United States. Even with those two countries, the gap is closing, with China growing at seven-nine percent annually, versus two-three percent in the United States and Japan. Overall GDP, not GDP per capita, is what matters in terms of power. China has four times the population of the United States. China is active in Latin America, Africa, and in the Gulf. Within hours, everything that is discussed in ASEAN meetings is known in Beijing, given China's close ties with Laos, Cambodia, and Burma, he stated.17. (C) MM Lee said China will not reach the American level in terms of military capabilities any time soon, but is rapidly developing asymmetrical means to deter U.S. military power. China understands that its growth depends on imports, including energy, raw materials, and food. This is why China is working with South Africa on the China-Africa Development Fund. China also needs open sea lanes. Beijing is worried about its dependence on the Strait of Malacca and is moving to ease the dependence by means like a pipeline through Burma.Build Ties with Young Chinese-----------------------------18. (C) MM Lee said the best course for the United States on China is to build ties with China's young people. China's best and brightest want to study in the United States, with the UK as the next option, then Japan. While they are there, it is important that they be treated as equals, with the cultural support they may need as foreigners. Why not have International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs for China? Why not have Chinese cadets at West Point alongside Vietnamese cadets and Indian cadets? America's advantage is that it can make use of the talent of the entire world, as in Silicon Valley. China still tends to try to keep the foreigners in Beijing and Shanghai. MM Lee noted that his own experience as a student in the UK had left him with an enduring fondness for the UK. When he spent two months at Harvard in 1968, an American professor had invited him home for Thanksgiving. This was not the sort of thing that happened in the UK, and Lee had realized he was dealing with a different civilization. In the future, China's leaders will have PhDs and MBAs from American universities, he predicted.19.

It confirms that there is no freedom of expression in the city-state island.Convicted of contempt of court, he must serve six weeks and pay a fine of SGD$20,000 (\u00a39,600). He also faces separate charges of criminal defamation, which are punishable by a maximum of two years in prison and a hefty fine. All the charges relate to his book, which argues that the Singaporean judiciary is not impartial in its application of the death penalty.There is a black irony in juxtaposing his conviction with the title of his book, Once a jolly hangman: Singapore's justice in the dock.I agree with Index on Censorship's chief executive John Kampfner who says that the \"sentence once again shows Singapore's desperate difficulties in dealing with criticism and free expression.\" When finding Shadrake guilty of contempt of court earlier this month, Singapore's high court judge, Quentin Loh, said the book contained \"half-truths and selective facts; sometimes outright falsehoods.\"In an interview two weeks ago with The Guardian, Shadrake admitted to one minor inaccuracy in his book, but insisted the rest was \"devastatingly accurate\".Shadrake, who suffers from an irregular heartbeat and a serious colonic illness, did offer a qualified apology last week, but stood by the claims made in his book. As Justin McCurry points out, Shadrake's trial has reignited debate over Singapore's use of contempt laws to stifle dissent and punish journalists deemed to have insulted the authorities.Shadrake enjoyed what's been called \"a rich and varied career\" as a journalist and author. Born in Essex, he spent a lengthy period in the 1960s as a Fleet Street correspondent in West Berlin.In the 1970s, he turned to writing books, having initial sales success with an authorised biography of Bruce Lee. After moving to Los Angeles in the mid-1980s, he quickly became a fixture at Ye Olde King's Head pub in Santa Monica. From 1990 to 2003 he wrote the popular but contentious Shooting From The Lip column for the Santa Monica-based paper that serves the large British expat community in California, the British Weekly. He later moved on to Las Vegas, where he enjoyed continuing success as a freelance writer for various publications across the world.

He also faces separate charges of criminal defamation, which carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a hefty fine. Shadrake's crime was to challenge the enthusiastic use of the death penalty in a country notoriously intolerant of dissent. Drawing on interviews with a retired chief executioner, lawyers, former police officers and human rights activists, his central claim is that justice in one of the world's most advanced economies is anything but blind.He highlights several inconsistent applications of the law which, he says, prove Singapore's judiciary \"picks and chooses how they respond depending on the state's diplomatic and economic interests\".In handing down the guilty verdict, the judge, Quentin Loh, said Shadrake had \"scandalised\" the judiciary through \"a dissembling and selective background of truths and half-truths, and sometimes outright falsehoods\".He offered the prolific British author the chance to \"make amends\", but Shadrake was unrepentant. \"They are effectively asking me to apologise, but I have done nothing wrong and I have no amends to make,\" he said. \"It's utter nonsense - I haven't scandalised anyone. \"I'm not going to run away or back down. If they want to jail me, then so be it.\" Past experience suggests that Shadrake should have taken the advice of the British high commission in Singapore and excused himself from the book launch.The country's elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew, whose son is now prime minister, has frequently used strict anti-defamation laws to crush dissent and punish foreign journalists.A Wall Street Journal editor was fined $10,000 last year for publishing articles deemed to have shown contempt for Singapore's judiciary, while three local activists were sentenced to short prison terms for wearing T-shirts illustrated with a kangaroo dressed as a judge.Shadrake's conviction has thrown into sharp relief the contradiction at the heart of Singapore's rise from colonial backwater to economic powerhouse: that the gains that have given its people the highest living standards in Asia since it declared independence from Britain in 1963, co-exist with an unapologetic contempt for freedoms taken for granted in other developed Asian economies.The government is also highly sensitive to attacks on its draconian attitude towards serious crime. According to Amnesty International, Singapore, a country of nearly 5 million, has the highest per capita rate of executions in the world, having put more than 420 people to death since 1991.In a 2004 report, Amnesty said the death penalty was disproportionately used against migrant workers, drug addicts and poorer people.\"Singapore's drug laws flout global fair-trial standards by shifting the burden of proof to suspects,\" says Lance Lattig, a researcher on Singapore for Amnesty in London. \"A drug trafficking suspect faces hanging unless he can manage to prove his innocence. If the Singapore government has issues with Shadrake's book, it should address his arguments directly, not threaten him with prison.\"Shadrake has admitted one minor inaccuracy in his book, but insists the rest of the material is \"devastatingly accurate\".\"They know the book is accurate, which is why they're going to all this trouble,\" he said.As he waits to learn his fate, the former Fleet Street journalist, who arrived in Singapore in 2002 to write travel articles for the local tourist board, admits to fantasising about swimming along the causeway and over the border to Malaysia, visible from his hotel room.But he has no intention of fleeing: \"I am prepared to go to jail: if I apologise, or try to abscond, it means I lied, that I got my facts wrong.\"With his client's biggest day in court only days away, Ravi is concerned about the toll the trial is taking on Shadrake's health. He suffers from high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat, and in August he spent two days in hospital after a longstanding colonic complaint caused internal bleeding.Shadrake, meanwhile, insists he is in good spirits, even managing to belt out a defiant karaoke version of \"My Way\" on the night of his conviction.And while the British high commission in Singapore has offered only \"words of comfort\" since his arrest, he says he has received countless messages of support from ordinary Singaporeans. \"The authorities overreacted without thinking through the consequences and the anti-Singapore hysteria that followed,\" he said. \"And that is growing all the time.\"Shadrake refuses to reveal how he will respond if he is sent to prison this week, saying only that he has several back-up plans in place: \"This story is never going away.

Singapore is very far from normal, something that Lee Kuan Yew, the city-state's prime minister from 1959 to 1990, is at pains to point out in his new book, Hard Truths. It's one of the most gripping and personal accounts of the thrills and spills of politics that I have read.Surrounded by countries that do not wish it well, and in competition with rising neighbours in Asia, Singapore's future is far from guaranteed. One reason why the city-state is so keen on water recycling and desalination, for example, is that Malaysia has periodically threatened to cut off the critical water it supplies. As a result Singapore plans to be self-sufficient in water by 2061, when their agreement to draw water from Malaysia ends.This propensity to think long is shot through Lee's book. In one memorable section \u2013 and there are many \u2013 he recalls a visit to Boston in 1968, where he had an eco-epiphany. Like Sherlock Holmes and the dog that didn't bark, he noticed that that the trees and other vegetation in the city centre were a rich, verdant green.

Singapore is very far from normal, something that Lee Kuan Yew, the city-state's prime minister from 1959 to 1990, is at pains to point out in his new book, Hard Truths. It's one of the most gripping and personal accounts of the thrills and spills of politics that I have read.Surrounded by countries that do not wish it well, and in competition with rising neighbours in Asia, Singapore's future is far from guaranteed. One reason why the city-state is so keen on water recycling and desalination, for example, is that Malaysia has periodically threatened to cut off the critical water it supplies. As a result Singapore plans to be self-sufficient in water by 2061, when their agreement to draw water from Malaysia ends.This propensity to think long is shot through Lee's book. In one memorable section \u2013 and there are many \u2013 he recalls a visit to Boston in 1968, where he had an eco-epiphany. Like Sherlock Holmes and the dog that didn't bark, he noticed that that the trees and other vegetation in the city centre were a rich, verdant green. He asked why they weren't as dusty and diseased as in Singapore? The answer: vehicle emissions were tightly controlled \u2013 something Lee promptly put into force back home.Dismissed as \"Disneyland with the death penalty\" and as \"an antiseptic island peopled by a passive citizenry and governed by paranoia\", Singapore demonstrates the power of triple bottom line strategy at the country level: economic competitiveness, social inclusion (up to a point) and a cleaner environment for all.

[I will identify this bird for you in 48 hours]Image: Marie Louise Ng, 17 March 2011 [velociraptorize].Nikon D7000, 500/4 This southeast Asian mystery bird has a peculiar and distinctive call which gives it its name. Can you identify it?About the Daily Mystery Bird: The Rules:1. Keep in mind that people live in 24 different time zones, and some people are following on their iPhones. So let everyone play the game. Don't spoil it for everyone else by identifying the bird in the first 24 to 36 hours.2. If you know the bird's identity, provide subtle hints to let others know that you know. Your hints may be helpful as small clues to less experienced players. 3. Describe the key field marks that distinguish this species from any similar ones.4. Comments that spoil others' enjoyment may be deleted.The Game:1. This is meant to be a learning experience where together we learn a few things about birds and about the process of identifying them (and maybe about ourselves, too).2. Each mystery bird is usually accompanied by a question or two. These questions can be useful for identifying the pictured species, but may instead be used to illustrate an interesting aspect of avian biology, behaviour or evolution, or may be intended to generate conversation on other topics, such as conservation or ethics. 3. Thoughtful comments will add to everyone's enjoyment, and will keep the suspense going until the next teaser is published. Interesting snippets may add to the knowledge of all.4. Each bird species will be demystified approximately 48 hours after publication. You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page.

And why, it might have added, so many parallel convulsions down in Mikey Gove's dream school canteen? On the menu this lunchtime: reindeer steak and noodles.You know how Gove and his minions tour the globe like magpies, hunting for bright educational wheezes to nick. Last year: Finland's policy of letting only the brightest graduates teach. This year: Singapore's \"special express\" ride for clever kids, so they skip GCSEs altogether and get on with As from age 14. First, let's ask for the whole menu.Both Finland and Singapore are world leaders when it comes to results. Finland is naturally great at community schools, at true comprehensives, at brilliant classroom leadership: an appetising stew of wholesome ingredients. Singapore stands for streaming, relentless testing, rigorous league rankings: the ultimate pressure cooker. And Gove's struggling old England? Think chips with everything.Thus we come to Professor Alison Wolf, Gove's close adviser and author of a new, headline-catching review that tells how we're failing the two-thirds of\u00a0our kids who aren't academically focused: students who will need a way of earning a living, or several different sorts of living \u2013 and make up the bulk of the million or so young who can't find work today. What is our system doing for them? Mostly failing, as usual.They don't have priority, says the professor. Keeping them in education \u2013 in class or training till 18 \u2013 won't be much use if the diplomas they toil away at lack street cred with employers. It's crazy to chain them to desks, but not to insist they do GCSE English and maths until they pass. But does any of that happen? Not really. Dreadful for them, bad and shameful for us, she concludes.And you can begin to see a pattern forming. University entrance shrinking in numbers, not expanding exponentially as the cuts bite. Universities themselves more divided than ever between the research-grounded best and the rest. Schools \u2013 under Gove's traditional tutelage \u2013 spending more time on the \"English bac\" subjects, and less on newer, softer options.Is there anything Finland or Singapore can throw into this pot? Absolutely: in the way that, two or three years from the end of schooling, they split into different areas. University aspirants go one way, the more technically inclined another. Everybody knows these human candidates, setting out on life, are of equal worth. Nobody pretends they are equally academic, or that one style of learning fits all.In the England of 50 years ago we'd have known the labels to fit such categories: universities, polytechnics; grammar schools, secondary moderns. But then came other, more aspirational labels. Ones where equal worth equalled equal status. Ones in which a single, giant size of school fitted all. Ones in which the same catchment area supposedly helped create cohesive, classless communities.But now, as you survey the results of so much churning, it's difficult not to feel that old English weakness returning. Take Wolf's bleak diagnosis of \"a systemic denial of opportunities\". Take the 66% who won't get to university, or perhaps anywhere much else. Take the status of our academic traditions, but not the reality of the training most children need. And take the actual example of Helsinki and the Straits, where separate institutions serve separate pupil needs.An end to the comprehensive ideal? The birth of advanced, new-age secondary moderns? Another convulsion replacing the last? From top to bottom, you can see its elements falling into place.

It was not that the prime minister dissolved parliament and called for general elections. Neither was it that, for the first time since independence, a majority of Singaporeans got to vote.Instead, a populace finally tired of living under an authoritarian system and of constantly being told how good their rulers were and that their rule was a right and not a privilege.The Singapore Democratic party (SDP), of which I am leader, was one of the six opposition parties that contested the ruling Peoples' Action party (PAP). We saw an unprecedented surge in the number of people coming forward to volunteer their help. Medical professionals, lawyers, educators, managers and students, poured forth and came into our office by the hundreds. I could see one message written all over their faces: \"We have had enough, we want change!\"In any other democracy, no one would bat a eyelid over such a development. But this is Singapore \u2013 a country which has seen one-party rule for more than half a century, where citizens are locked away without trial for dissent, and where protests can only occur with a licence from the authorities.I have been banned for standing in elections because I was sued for defamation by former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, and ordered to pay more than a million Singapore dollars in damages. I could not meet their demands and was made bankrupt. Under the law bankrupts cannot run for office. Previous opposition leaders have also been dealt with in a similar manner. I have also been repeatedly imprisoned for exercising my right to free speech and assembly. These convictions also bar me from standing in elections.The overall effect has been that few in Singapore are willing to offer themselves as opposition candidates. This has allowed the PAP an easy passage at every election since 1959. In fact, for an entire decade in the 1970s parliament comprised of only PAP members of parliament.Anger and disenchantment with the government, which has been accumulating over the years, is palpable. People are fed up with rulers who insist that they are the only ones capable of running the country. Ministers award themselves salaries several times that of the US president, while the poor find themselves homeless and stricken by poverty. Government leaders have lost all sense of what public service is.This arrogance has caused professionals from the establishment to join us and other opposition parties. Our party fielded two former top civil servants. This would have been unimaginable even a year ago.The SDP did not win the seats that we contested. It would have been a miracle if we had. For every mainstream media outlet is still firmly in the control of the PAP government. News of my party's campaign activities, our manifesto and our plans for our constituencies were either played down or completely blacked out.In the past this would have been fatal. But we, and more importantly our small army of supporters, fought back \u2013 on the internet. We were able to counter the untruths that were hurled at us and, crucially, put forth our own views and policy positions. The consequence is that we were able to make significant progress in the percentage of votes cast for us.Conversely, the internet community very successfully put the PAP on the defensive over several missteps. These would not have been evident without the probing in cyberspace.But years of autocratic rule have taken their toll and undoing this will take more than just one election campaign, a campaign limited to nine days.In any case, we saw Singaporeans come alive politically and express themselves in quite unprecedented ways.To be sure, there is still much fear among the people, especially the older generation who have witnessed the heavy hand of the PAP's patriarch and \"Minister Mentor\" Lee Kuan Yew. But it is also Lee who is generating much of the resentment against the government of which his son, Lee Hsien Loong, is prime minister.And it is this resentment, buttressed by the new media which has enabled citizens to come together, if only online, that has caused many Singaporeans to shed their fear.There is no turning back now.

Ajai Chopra, head of the IMF mission, flew to Dublin last Friday for the quarterly review and it looks as if everyone, including the Washington-based fund, has got it wrong \u2013 this week they almost halved their forecast for GDP growth in Ireland this year from 0.9% to 0.5%. And that's worrying because it's only a fraction of the 1.7% growth forecast by the department of finance whose figures informed last December's hellish budget.We all know what this means \u2013 Chopra is in charge and unless there is some Hungarian-style standoff between Ireland and the IMF, the disparity in figures can spell only one thing \u2013 more austerity, more pay cuts, more direct and indirect tax. See today's Irish Independent for more detail if you're a glutton for punishment. So that's why even the vaguest of hints by Allied Irish Banks yesterday of a new debt forgiveness programme for struggling mortgage customers made so many headlines today instead of its appalling loss of \u00a310bn in 2010 \u2013 as guest blogger economist Stephen Kinsella said: that's the equivalent of a few brand new hospitals.Still, the executive chairman of AIB, David Hodgkinson, is no slouch \u2013 he spent the best part of 40 years working for HSBC \u2013 and has led banks around the world through severe property crashes.When he arrived last October he was immediately on fire-fighting duty, with a second bailout ordered by the IMF, and a scandal over bank bonuses, as well as coping with his day job: to come up with a survival plan for the bank along with new management practices and prudential controls. \"I have never worked with quite as many problems as AIB had, particularly with property,\" he said. 'Do you know how hard it is to rent in Ballsbridge?'I caught up with him after the annual results news conference yesterday and he was remarkably upbeat about the future. \"Do you know how hard it is to find a place to live here in Ballsbridge?\" he says by way of explaining a recovery in landlord's yields.He admitted that his experience of trying to find a home in Dublin 4, one of Dublin's wealthiest districts, may not be typical, but he is still optimistic. He thinks Dublin, where house prices have fallen by as much as 53%, may have hit the bottom. But he is less convinced about areas outside the capital.\"Property in Dublin has stabilised. Properties are getting to investable yields. With gross yields of 6%, that may be worth buying again, but in some places it's going to take longer.\"He said he had worked through five property crashes \u2013 three in Hong Kong, one in Singapore and one in Saudi \u2013 but that Ireland's crash is probably the worst he has seen.\"It is the longest property boom I have seen. It went from the early 90s, then it stopped for a little bit and then the low interest rates from Europe made it even worse, and it just kept going,\" he said. He says Singapore had a similar crash in the 1980s but it \"bounced back within 18 months\". This is no cause for optimisim, however: he is quick to note one key difference between Singapore and Ireland \u2013 land. In Singapore and Hong Kong, property values were driven skyward because of the lack of development land.\"The problem for Ireland is Ireland had plenty of space and built in areas where demand might not recover,\" he said in reference to the country's notorious ghost estates. One in 10 buy-to-let customers in arrearsThe bank has made provisions to write off about \u20ac600m in mortgage debt this year alone and acknowledges the buy-to-let market is cause for deep concern with one in 10 customers behind payments for more than 90 days.Hodgkinson says \"there was a kind of collective madness,\" in Ireland during the boom with businesses and individuals chasing property investments like the gold rush. \"So when the crunch came it was very serious.\"Like the other banks in Ireland, AIB has two problems \u2013 it over-lent to customers for over-valued properties, but it also loosened its credit policy and started offering in tracker mortgages to head off upstarts such as Bank of Scotland that arrived in Ireland in the 2000s on an aggressive mortgage \"land-grab\".AIB said yesterday that 54% of all its mortgages were trackers \u2013 all of which are loss-making as they are linked to the record low ECB base rate.Those who are struggling with mortgages were given some solace by the revelation that the bank is looking at debt forgiveness initiatives.But in reality this is just rhetoric. All the bank is really talking about is practices already adopted by other banks, including loan holidays, interest-only repayment periods and loan extensions.AIB, which is costing the taxpayer more than \u20ac20bn in bailout funds, certainly won't be in a position to offer what might be better described as \"debt burial\" \u2013 a US-style system where customers can hand back the keys and walk away from their homes safe in the knowledge the debt won't follow them. \"It does depend on the situation of the customer, how transparent they are with us on their financial affairs and how deep a hole they're in,\" said Hodgkinson, confirming that debt rescheduling will be offered on a case by case basis.Talk of \"inter-generational mortgages\", however, is a bit concerning \u2013 this was something the banks conjured up at the peak of the boom allowing first-time buyers to buy over such a long time that their children would end up with the mortgage. But what was significant was that AIB, like Bank of Scotland, has said it is willing to work with landlords in the buy-to-let sector. This is something that the likes of KBC have steadfastly refused to do. KBC boss John Reynolds said in February: \"We lend people money over a long period of time and we expect to get it back over a long period of time.\"Asked would AIB be willing to restructure/write-off debt for buy-to-let mortgages, Hodgkinson said: \"That is one of the options, yes.\" Landlords, form an orderly queue now.\"My opinion is that both Ireland and AIB have serious issues to beresolved,\" he added. \"But I am convinced they both can and will recover.

But in the runup to Saturday's parliamentary elections more people have started to speak out against the clan that has ruled Singapore for almost 50 years. Parallels with the Arab spring are striking, even if revolution is not just around the corner.Most murmurs of discontent can be found online: fears of reprisal are diminished for anonymous bloggers. On internet forums, blogs, Facebook and Twitter, grumblings about high housing prices, the widening gap between rich and poor, immigration laws and the salaries of government ministers (among the highest in the world) are hot topics.The People's Action party (PAP) has been in power since independence in 1965, and is widely recognised as having turned this colonial outpost into a financial behemoth in a few decades. But it knows it has a battle on its hands. On Saturday, it will contest 82 of the 87 seats, up from 47 of 84 seats in 2006.More than one in four voters in Singapore's 5\u00a0million-strong population, are under the age of 35, and the internet is a main source of news. For the first time, candidates have been allowed to campaign using social media, and the effect has been far-reaching: many Singaporeans say this is the most debated and politicised election they have seen.Not all young people will be using their mandatory vote to go against the grain. Some, such as economics student and first-time voter Sofina Toh, 22, are swayed by the PAP's recent apology for past mistakes and promise to do better. \"The PAP has done so much for Singapore \u2013 just look at the country now from what it used to be,\" she says. \"Shouldn't we give credit where credit is due? They've promised to make changes. Maybe we can give them another chance.\"Others are not convinced. \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me,\" tweets a management student, Ong Rei En.At political rallies, for which turnout has arguably been the highest in Singapore's history, the energy is electric. An estimated 50,000 people crowded into an outdoor stadium on Thursday to wave blue flags and wield inflatable hammers, symbol of the opposition Workers' party. As the crowd chanted for change, fists raised in hope, armed police watched awkwardly, the sweat on their brows betraying the night's humidity.Rally attendance does not always translate to the polling booth. In 2006, despite large crowds at opposition speeches, the PAP won 67% of the vote. Many Singaporeans fear their ballots will be traced and their mortgages or jobs taken away if they vote for the opposition.Asked if Singapore is an Egypt in the making, Skope One furrows his brow as he bundles his spray-paint cans into a backpack. \"We don't want the same problems,\" he says finally. \"But we definitely echo the same feelings.\"", "tags": ["Singapore", "Protest", "Social media", "World news", "Facebook", "Media", "Internet", "Social networking", "Technology", "Twitter", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Singapore elections marked by online buzz of discontent"},{"date": "2011-04-13T12:45:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "The country is groaning with so much bad news every day, it's a wonder anyone still lives in Ireland.This morning there were quite a few items for the pain addicts among us to choose from, but the worst has got to be the news that the country is going to miss the International Monetary Fund recovery targets for the next four years by around \u20ac5bn.

The event attracted information communications technology (ICT) professionals from around the world, with topics including data centre energy efficiency and modernisation, and, most groundbreaking, discussions about the development of required standards for green data centres.This forum at the Singapore Management University epitomises Singapore's emergence as a leader in the green ICT economy. Once a sleepy backwater, the tiny nation declared independence 50 years ago, and is now a global financial, industrial, and technological hub. While Singapore's government has emphasised the need for clean and green cities since it declared independence, sustainability initiatives within both the private and public sectors have ramped up in the last five years. Singapore's success can be credited to its curious hybrid approach of free-market economics with rigorous long-term central planning by the government.According to Eugene Tay, editor of Singapore's Green Business Times, Singapore's political leaders have responded to the growing global concern over climate change with a three-pronged programme that emphasises the environment, water, and clean energy. Linked to this focus is the government's recent interest in green ICT. Collaboration between government agencies, industry associations, ICT companies, and service providers could result in a new global green data centre standard that will rank with ISO 26000 for corporate social responsibility, the Global Reporting Initiative for sustainability reporting, LEED for green building, and the Forest Stewardship Council's ratings for paper and packaging.Government agencies such as Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA) have partnered with Hewlett Packard to design a new set of energy efficiency benchmarks. This development has its origins in Singapore's emergence as an ICT economic tiger in the past 20 years because of a highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate, seamless logistics, and central location. Companies, including HP and IBM, have flocked to the 710-square kilometre (242-square miles) city-state to have their products manufactured and data stored there. Those same companies confronted an issue, however, that no tax credit or business-friendly law could solve: Singapore's year-round tropical climate, which causes energy bills to soar. Still, with Singapore's reliance on imported fuel, the collaboration between HP and Singapore's government could result in a new standard for data centre efficiency.In addition to the green data centre standards initiative, Singapore's government is pushing for increased energy efficiency measures from both manufacturing facilities and business offices throughout the country. One programme trains energy managers to implement energy efficiency measures throughout their respective companies. With the ongoing concern over increased energy prices, Singaporean leaders hope that a green, ICT-driven economy can foster an environment of even more innovation and, of course, investment.Finally, Singapore's investment in the water technology area has made the densely populated country of 5 million a global \"hydrohub,\" explained Tay. The need to achieve water self-sufficiency at an effective cost drives further experimentation and innovation by Singaporean engineers. The country has one desalination plant, with another larger one slated to open in 2013. With Singapore's water agreement with neighbouring Malaysia set to expire in 50 years, engineers and nanotechnology experts are in a race to guarantee the country's water security. In turn, that talent will contribute to Singapore's growing reputation as a global centre that combines both energy and technological innovation.The debate over climate issues often volleys between the argument between increased government regulation versus self-regulation by business. Singapore's work on its energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives is a lesson on how the government and private sector can be partners, not opponents \u2013 meanwhile attracting talent from around the world for both its clean tech and ICT sectors, leaving other countries green with envy.Leon Kaye is founder and editor of the Los Angeles-based sustainability website GreenGoPostThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Ajai Chopra, head of the IMF mission, flew to Dublin last Friday for the quarterly review and it looks as if everyone, including the Washington-based fund, has got it wrong \u2013 this week they almost halved their forecast for GDP growth in Ireland this year from 0.9% to 0.5%. And that's worrying because it's only a fraction of the 1.7% growth forecast by the department of finance whose figures informed last December's hellish budget.We all know what this means \u2013 Chopra is in charge and unless there is some Hungarian-style standoff between Ireland and the IMF, the disparity in figures can spell only one thing \u2013 more austerity, more pay cuts, more direct and indirect tax. See today's Irish Independent for more detail if you're a glutton for punishment. So that's why even the vaguest of hints by Allied Irish Banks yesterday of a new debt forgiveness programme for struggling mortgage customers made so many headlines today instead of its appalling loss of \u00a310bn in 2010 \u2013 as guest blogger economist Stephen Kinsella said: that's the equivalent of a few brand new hospitals.Still, the executive chairman of AIB, David Hodgkinson, is no slouch \u2013 he spent the best part of 40 years working for HSBC \u2013 and has led banks around the world through severe property crashes.When he arrived last October he was immediately on fire-fighting duty, with a second bailout ordered by the IMF, and a scandal over bank bonuses, as well as coping with his day job: to come up with a survival plan for the bank along with new management practices and prudential controls. \"I have never worked with quite as many problems as AIB had, particularly with property,\" he said. 'Do you know how hard it is to rent in Ballsbridge?'I caught up with him after the annual results news conference yesterday and he was remarkably upbeat about the future. \"Do you know how hard it is to find a place to live here in Ballsbridge?\" he says by way of explaining a recovery in landlord's yields.He admitted that his experience of trying to find a home in Dublin 4, one of Dublin's wealthiest districts, may not be typical, but he is still optimistic. He thinks Dublin, where house prices have fallen by as much as 53%, may have hit the bottom. But he is less convinced about areas outside the capital.\"Property in Dublin has stabilised. Properties are getting to investable yields. With gross yields of 6%, that may be worth buying again, but in some places it's going to take longer.\"He said he had worked through five property crashes \u2013 three in Hong Kong, one in Singapore and one in Saudi \u2013 but that Ireland's crash is probably the worst he has seen.\"It is the longest property boom I have seen. It went from the early 90s, then it stopped for a little bit and then the low interest rates from Europe made it even worse, and it just kept going,\" he said. He says Singapore had a similar crash in the 1980s but it \"bounced back within 18 months\". This is no cause for optimisim, however: he is quick to note one key difference between Singapore and Ireland \u2013 land. In Singapore and Hong Kong, property values were driven skyward because of the lack of development land.\"The problem for Ireland is Ireland had plenty of space and built in areas where demand might not recover,\" he said in reference to the country's notorious ghost estates. One in 10 buy-to-let customers in arrearsThe bank has made provisions to write off about \u20ac600m in mortgage debt this year alone and acknowledges the buy-to-let market is cause for deep concern with one in 10 customers behind payments for more than 90 days.Hodgkinson says \"there was a kind of collective madness,\" in Ireland during the boom with businesses and individuals chasing property investments like the gold rush. \"So when the crunch came it was very serious.\"Like the other banks in Ireland, AIB has two problems \u2013 it over-lent to customers for over-valued properties, but it also loosened its credit policy and started offering in tracker mortgages to head off upstarts such as Bank of Scotland that arrived in Ireland in the 2000s on an aggressive mortgage \"land-grab\".AIB said yesterday that 54% of all its mortgages were trackers \u2013 all of which are loss-making as they are linked to the record low ECB base rate.Those who are struggling with mortgages were given some solace by the revelation that the bank is looking at debt forgiveness initiatives.But in reality this is just rhetoric. All the bank is really talking about is practices already adopted by other banks, including loan holidays, interest-only repayment periods and loan extensions.AIB, which is costing the taxpayer more than \u20ac20bn in bailout funds, certainly won't be in a position to offer what might be better described as \"debt burial\" \u2013 a US-style system where customers can hand back the keys and walk away from their homes safe in the knowledge the debt won't follow them. \"It does depend on the situation of the customer, how transparent they are with us on their financial affairs and how deep a hole they're in,\" said Hodgkinson, confirming that debt rescheduling will be offered on a case by case basis.Talk of \"inter-generational mortgages\", however, is a bit concerning \u2013 this was something the banks conjured up at the peak of the boom allowing first-time buyers to buy over such a long time that their children would end up with the mortgage. But what was significant was that AIB, like Bank of Scotland, has said it is willing to work with landlords in the buy-to-let sector. This is something that the likes of KBC have steadfastly refused to do. KBC boss John Reynolds said in February: \"We lend people money over a long period of time and we expect to get it back over a long period of time.\"Asked would AIB be willing to restructure/write-off debt for buy-to-let mortgages, Hodgkinson said: \"That is one of the options, yes.\" Landlords, form an orderly queue now.\"My opinion is that both Ireland and AIB have serious issues to beresolved,\" he added. \"But I am convinced they both can and will recover. In AIB we are learning the lessons from past mistakes, but we must not get bogged down in despondency.\"", "tags": ["Ireland", "Business"], "title": "Ballsbridge is no Singapore, says AIB's boss"},{"date": "2011-06-17T11:54:51Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "It is often derided as a cultural desert, but a younger generation of Singapore's residents and expats is determined to bring an edgier side to the city. They are leading an improvisation drive, chiefly culinary, and the results are rarely dull.Borrowing from ideas hatched in New York and Hong Kong, secret dinner clubs are now the menu du jour, some with themes betraying Singapore's inherently geeky nature.Co-founded by expatriates Florian Cornu, 26, and Denisa Kera, 36, the Secret Cooks Club bases its dinners on novel technology, philosophy and food-science concepts. A recent five-course meal, labelled You are what you eat, But you can also eat what you are, required every dinner guest to send in saliva samples and then meals were created based upon their DNA.Another dinner pushed conservative cultural boundaries by copying the Japanese practice of nyotaimori \u2013 serving sushi on a naked woman's body.The two self-declared nerds, who met at Singapore's underground Hackerspace club, wanted to add an \"element of excitement to a city full of potential, but a bit sleepy and dull\", Kera said.Similarly interested in rebelling against what she felt was a lack of \"personality, history or unique ambiance\" in Singapore's restaurants, Zina Alam, 27, decided to start her own Bangladeshi-style supper club, Khana Commune.\"Singapore is changing every day, politically and culturally,\" said the former journalist, whose own change of direction was inspired by a visit to Edinburgh's supper clubs. \"People are a lot more open and adventurous now.\"Even larger establishments are catching on. At Kilo, a new Japanese-Italian fusion venture in a converted waterfront warehouse, diners are encouraged to step away from the table and into the kitchen where, from August, they will be able to act as \"guest chef\" for the evening. The aim is to prepare a meal of up to five courses that diners will \"love, hate, scrutinise \u2013 and everything else in between\", said Kilo's 32-year-old co-founder, Sharon Lee.Ideas are also emerging beyond the dinner plate. At Blink-BL-NK, an evening out, once a month, where people exchange ideas, participants share their expertise on subjects in forums, along the lines of the increasingly popular TED conferences. Recent talks focused on pilgrimages, psychosis and sex \u2013 the latter two traditionally taboo subjects in a \"rational, efficiency orientated society\", according to one regular attendee, Stella Lee, 28. \"You wouldn't see this anywhere else in Singapore,\" she said.Isaac Souweine, 32, the co-founder of Blink-BL-NK, said: \"\"This city is growing up. A hundred years ago, this place was a swamp. The economic development here happened really fast. Now the cultural development is following.\"While some grumble that Singapore's music and arts scene is still far from robust, at the Crazy Elephant, a popular live music bar on the busy Clarke Quay waterfront, novice musicians are invited to perform on stage in a weekly DIY music night. Drums, keyboards, guitars and microphones are all provided. \"It's a great way to get the crowd involved,\" said the venue's manager, Anita Lydia. \"Most people think Sundays are quiet, but budding artists too afraid to play in a bigger arena, or even well-known bands like Deep Purple, have all come to jam.\"The beauty of living in a \"cultural desert\", some say, is that it provides an empty space upon which a promising new future, like Singapore's, can be built. \"We are definitely at the cusp of finding a real national identity,\" Alam said.", "tags": ["Singapore", "World news", "Singapore holidays", "Asia", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Singapore finds its cultural feet with culinary renaissance"},{"date": "2011-05-10T10:41:11Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Something extraordinary happened in Singapore in May 2011.

They are leading an improvisation drive, chiefly culinary, and the results are rarely dull.Borrowing from ideas hatched in New York and Hong Kong, secret dinner clubs are now the menu du jour, some with themes betraying Singapore's inherently geeky nature.Co-founded by expatriates Florian Cornu, 26, and Denisa Kera, 36, the Secret Cooks Club bases its dinners on novel technology, philosophy and food-science concepts. A recent five-course meal, labelled You are what you eat, But you can also eat what you are, required every dinner guest to send in saliva samples and then meals were created based upon their DNA.Another dinner pushed conservative cultural boundaries by copying the Japanese practice of nyotaimori \u2013 serving sushi on a naked woman's body.The two self-declared nerds, who met at Singapore's underground Hackerspace club, wanted to add an \"element of excitement to a city full of potential, but a bit sleepy and dull\", Kera said.Similarly interested in rebelling against what she felt was a lack of \"personality, history or unique ambiance\" in Singapore's restaurants, Zina Alam, 27, decided to start her own Bangladeshi-style supper club, Khana Commune.\"Singapore is changing every day, politically and culturally,\" said the former journalist, whose own change of direction was inspired by a visit to Edinburgh's supper clubs. \"People are a lot more open and adventurous now.\"Even larger establishments are catching on. At Kilo, a new Japanese-Italian fusion venture in a converted waterfront warehouse, diners are encouraged to step away from the table and into the kitchen where, from August, they will be able to act as \"guest chef\" for the evening. The aim is to prepare a meal of up to five courses that diners will \"love, hate, scrutinise \u2013 and everything else in between\", said Kilo's 32-year-old co-founder, Sharon Lee.Ideas are also emerging beyond the dinner plate. At Blink-BL-NK, an evening out, once a month, where people exchange ideas, participants share their expertise on subjects in forums, along the lines of the increasingly popular TED conferences. Recent talks focused on pilgrimages, psychosis and sex \u2013 the latter two traditionally taboo subjects in a \"rational, efficiency orientated society\", according to one regular attendee, Stella Lee, 28. \"You wouldn't see this anywhere else in Singapore,\" she said.Isaac Souweine, 32, the co-founder of Blink-BL-NK, said: \"\"This city is growing up.

It was not that the prime minister dissolved parliament and called for general elections. Neither was it that, for the first time since independence, a majority of Singaporeans got to vote.Instead, a populace finally tired of living under an authoritarian system and of constantly being told how good their rulers were and that their rule was a right and not a privilege.The Singapore Democratic party (SDP), of which I am leader, was one of the six opposition parties that contested the ruling Peoples' Action party (PAP). We saw an unprecedented surge in the number of people coming forward to volunteer their help. Medical professionals, lawyers, educators, managers and students, poured forth and came into our office by the hundreds. I could see one message written all over their faces: \"We have had enough, we want change!\"In any other democracy, no one would bat a eyelid over such a development. But this is Singapore \u2013 a country which has seen one-party rule for more than half a century, where citizens are locked away without trial for dissent, and where protests can only occur with a licence from the authorities.I have been banned for standing in elections because I was sued for defamation by former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, and ordered to pay more than a million Singapore dollars in damages. I could not meet their demands and was made bankrupt. Under the law bankrupts cannot run for office. Previous opposition leaders have also been dealt with in a similar manner. I have also been repeatedly imprisoned for exercising my right to free speech and assembly. These convictions also bar me from standing in elections.The overall effect has been that few in Singapore are willing to offer themselves as opposition candidates. This has allowed the PAP an easy passage at every election since 1959. In fact, for an entire decade in the 1970s parliament comprised of only PAP members of parliament.Anger and disenchantment with the government, which has been accumulating over the years, is palpable. People are fed up with rulers who insist that they are the only ones capable of running the country. Ministers award themselves salaries several times that of the US president, while the poor find themselves homeless and stricken by poverty. Government leaders have lost all sense of what public service is.This arrogance has caused professionals from the establishment to join us and other opposition parties. Our party fielded two former top civil servants. This would have been unimaginable even a year ago.The SDP did not win the seats that we contested. It would have been a miracle if we had. For every mainstream media outlet is still firmly in the control of the PAP government. News of my party's campaign activities, our manifesto and our plans for our constituencies were either played down or completely blacked out.In the past this would have been fatal. But we, and more importantly our small army of supporters, fought back \u2013 on the internet. We were able to counter the untruths that were hurled at us and, crucially, put forth our own views and policy positions. The consequence is that we were able to make significant progress in the percentage of votes cast for us.Conversely, the internet community very successfully put the PAP on the defensive over several missteps. These would not have been evident without the probing in cyberspace.But years of autocratic rule have taken their toll and undoing this will take more than just one election campaign, a campaign limited to nine days.In any case, we saw Singaporeans come alive politically and express themselves in quite unprecedented ways.To be sure, there is still much fear among the people, especially the older generation who have witnessed the heavy hand of the PAP's patriarch and \"Minister Mentor\" Lee Kuan Yew. But it is also Lee who is generating much of the resentment against the government of which his son, Lee Hsien Loong, is prime minister.And it is this resentment, buttressed by the new media which has enabled citizens to come together, if only online, that has caused many Singaporeans to shed their fear.There is no turning back now. The road to freedom is without doubt still long and arduous. But Singapore has taken that first crucial step to making parliamentary democracy a reality.", "tags": ["Singapore", "Internet", "Technology", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Singapore is taking the first steps to true democracy | Chee Soon Juan"},{"date": "2011-05-06T11:34:54Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "It is a dangerous act in a country where graffiti can fetch eight strokes of the cane, more dangerous still because it parodies the leader of the ruling Lee dynasty. With a few deft applications of spray paint, Skope One finishes a pig-head depiction of the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, with a Nazi-styled SS logo on the lapel and an Uncle Sam-inspired banner emblazoned \"Lee Wants You\".\"We shouldn't be scared any more \u2013 it's about time something changed,\" says the 35-year-old artist, the founder of Singaporean graffiti. \"We need to have this freedom of alternative speech.\"Singapore is known worldwide for censorship and corporal punishment. But in the runup to Saturday's parliamentary elections more people have started to speak out against the clan that has ruled Singapore for almost 50 years. Parallels with the Arab spring are striking, even if revolution is not just around the corner.Most murmurs of discontent can be found online: fears of reprisal are diminished for anonymous bloggers. On internet forums, blogs, Facebook and Twitter, grumblings about high housing prices, the widening gap between rich and poor, immigration laws and the salaries of government ministers (among the highest in the world) are hot topics.The People's Action party (PAP) has been in power since independence in 1965, and is widely recognised as having turned this colonial outpost into a financial behemoth in a few decades. But it knows it has a battle on its hands. On Saturday, it will contest 82 of the 87 seats, up from 47 of 84 seats in 2006.More than one in four voters in Singapore's 5\u00a0million-strong population, are under the age of 35, and the internet is a main source of news. For the first time, candidates have been allowed to campaign using social media, and the effect has been far-reaching: many Singaporeans say this is the most debated and politicised election they have seen.Not all young people will be using their mandatory vote to go against the grain. Some, such as economics student and first-time voter Sofina Toh, 22, are swayed by the PAP's recent apology for past mistakes and promise to do better. \"The PAP has done so much for Singapore \u2013 just look at the country now from what it used to be,\" she says. \"Shouldn't we give credit where credit is due? They've promised to make changes. Maybe we can give them another chance.\"Others are not convinced. \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me,\" tweets a management student, Ong Rei En.At political rallies, for which turnout has arguably been the highest in Singapore's history, the energy is electric. An estimated 50,000 people crowded into an outdoor stadium on Thursday to wave blue flags and wield inflatable hammers, symbol of the opposition Workers' party. As the crowd chanted for change, fists raised in hope, armed police watched awkwardly, the sweat on their brows betraying the night's humidity.Rally attendance does not always translate to the polling booth. In 2006, despite large crowds at opposition speeches, the PAP won 67% of the vote. Many Singaporeans fear their ballots will be traced and their mortgages or jobs taken away if they vote for the opposition.Asked if Singapore is an Egypt in the making, Skope One furrows his brow as he bundles his spray-paint cans into a backpack. \"We don't want the same problems,\" he says finally. \"But we definitely echo the same feelings.\"", "tags": ["Singapore", "Protest", "Social media", "World news", "Facebook", "Media", "Internet", "Social networking", "Technology", "Twitter", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Singapore elections marked by online buzz of discontent"},{"date": "2011-04-28T09:00:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "On 31 March, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore and other government agencies hosted a green data centre forum. The event attracted information communications technology (ICT) professionals from around the world, with topics including data centre energy efficiency and modernisation, and, most groundbreaking, discussions about the development of required standards for green data centres.This forum at the Singapore Management University epitomises Singapore's emergence as a leader in the green ICT economy. Once a sleepy backwater, the tiny nation declared independence 50 years ago, and is now a global financial, industrial, and technological hub. While Singapore's government has emphasised the need for clean and green cities since it declared independence, sustainability initiatives within both the private and public sectors have ramped up in the last five years. Singapore's success can be credited to its curious hybrid approach of free-market economics with rigorous long-term central planning by the government.According to Eugene Tay, editor of Singapore's Green Business Times, Singapore's political leaders have responded to the growing global concern over climate change with a three-pronged programme that emphasises the environment, water, and clean energy. Linked to this focus is the government's recent interest in green ICT. Collaboration between government agencies, industry associations, ICT companies, and service providers could result in a new global green data centre standard that will rank with ISO 26000 for corporate social responsibility, the Global Reporting Initiative for sustainability reporting, LEED for green building, and the Forest Stewardship Council's ratings for paper and packaging.Government agencies such as Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA) have partnered with Hewlett Packard to design a new set of energy efficiency benchmarks. This development has its origins in Singapore's emergence as an ICT economic tiger in the past 20 years because of a highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate, seamless logistics, and central location. Companies, including HP and IBM, have flocked to the 710-square kilometre (242-square miles) city-state to have their products manufactured and data stored there. Those same companies confronted an issue, however, that no tax credit or business-friendly law could solve: Singapore's year-round tropical climate, which causes energy bills to soar. Still, with Singapore's reliance on imported fuel, the collaboration between HP and Singapore's government could result in a new standard for data centre efficiency.In addition to the green data centre standards initiative, Singapore's government is pushing for increased energy efficiency measures from both manufacturing facilities and business offices throughout the country. One programme trains energy managers to implement energy efficiency measures throughout their respective companies. With the ongoing concern over increased energy prices, Singaporean leaders hope that a green, ICT-driven economy can foster an environment of even more innovation and, of course, investment.Finally, Singapore's investment in the water technology area has made the densely populated country of 5 million a global \"hydrohub,\" explained Tay. The need to achieve water self-sufficiency at an effective cost drives further experimentation and innovation by Singaporean engineers. The country has one desalination plant, with another larger one slated to open in 2013. With Singapore's water agreement with neighbouring Malaysia set to expire in 50 years, engineers and nanotechnology experts are in a race to guarantee the country's water security. In turn, that talent will contribute to Singapore's growing reputation as a global centre that combines both energy and technological innovation.The debate over climate issues often volleys between the argument between increased government regulation versus self-regulation by business. Singapore's work on its energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives is a lesson on how the government and private sector can be partners, not opponents \u2013 meanwhile attracting talent from around the world for both its clean tech and ICT sectors, leaving other countries green with envy.Leon Kaye is founder and editor of the Los Angeles-based sustainability website GreenGoPostThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

It was not that the prime minister dissolved parliament and called for general elections. Neither was it that, for the first time since independence, a majority of Singaporeans got to vote.Instead, a populace finally tired of living under an authoritarian system and of constantly being told how good their rulers were and that their rule was a right and not a privilege.The Singapore Democratic party (SDP), of which I am leader, was one of the six opposition parties that contested the ruling Peoples' Action party (PAP). We saw an unprecedented surge in the number of people coming forward to volunteer their help. Medical professionals, lawyers, educators, managers and students, poured forth and came into our office by the hundreds. I could see one message written all over their faces: \"We have had enough, we want change!\"In any other democracy, no one would bat a eyelid over such a development. But this is Singapore \u2013 a country which has seen one-party rule for more than half a century, where citizens are locked away without trial for dissent, and where protests can only occur with a licence from the authorities.I have been banned for standing in elections because I was sued for defamation by former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, and ordered to pay more than a million Singapore dollars in damages. I could not meet their demands and was made bankrupt. Under the law bankrupts cannot run for office. Previous opposition leaders have also been dealt with in a similar manner. I have also been repeatedly imprisoned for exercising my right to free speech and assembly. These convictions also bar me from standing in elections.The overall effect has been that few in Singapore are willing to offer themselves as opposition candidates. This has allowed the PAP an easy passage at every election since 1959. In fact, for an entire decade in the 1970s parliament comprised of only PAP members of parliament.Anger and disenchantment with the government, which has been accumulating over the years, is palpable. People are fed up with rulers who insist that they are the only ones capable of running the country. Ministers award themselves salaries several times that of the US president, while the poor find themselves homeless and stricken by poverty. Government leaders have lost all sense of what public service is.This arrogance has caused professionals from the establishment to join us and other opposition parties. Our party fielded two former top civil servants. This would have been unimaginable even a year ago.The SDP did not win the seats that we contested. It would have been a miracle if we had. For every mainstream media outlet is still firmly in the control of the PAP government. News of my party's campaign activities, our manifesto and our plans for our constituencies were either played down or completely blacked out.In the past this would have been fatal. But we, and more importantly our small army of supporters, fought back \u2013 on the internet. We were able to counter the untruths that were hurled at us and, crucially, put forth our own views and policy positions. The consequence is that we were able to make significant progress in the percentage of votes cast for us.Conversely, the internet community very successfully put the PAP on the defensive over several missteps. These would not have been evident without the probing in cyberspace.But years of autocratic rule have taken their toll and undoing this will take more than just one election campaign, a campaign limited to nine days.In any case, we saw Singaporeans come alive politically and express themselves in quite unprecedented ways.To be sure, there is still much fear among the people, especially the older generation who have witnessed the heavy hand of the PAP's patriarch and \"Minister Mentor\" Lee Kuan Yew. But it is also Lee who is generating much of the resentment against the government of which his son, Lee Hsien Loong, is prime minister.And it is this resentment, buttressed by the new media which has enabled citizens to come together, if only online, that has caused many Singaporeans to shed their fear.There is no turning back now. The road to freedom is without doubt still long and arduous.

But in the runup to Saturday's parliamentary elections more people have started to speak out against the clan that has ruled Singapore for almost 50 years. Parallels with the Arab spring are striking, even if revolution is not just around the corner.Most murmurs of discontent can be found online: fears of reprisal are diminished for anonymous bloggers. On internet forums, blogs, Facebook and Twitter, grumblings about high housing prices, the widening gap between rich and poor, immigration laws and the salaries of government ministers (among the highest in the world) are hot topics.The People's Action party (PAP) has been in power since independence in 1965, and is widely recognised as having turned this colonial outpost into a financial behemoth in a few decades. But it knows it has a battle on its hands. On Saturday, it will contest 82 of the 87 seats, up from 47 of 84 seats in 2006.More than one in four voters in Singapore's 5\u00a0million-strong population, are under the age of 35, and the internet is a main source of news. For the first time, candidates have been allowed to campaign using social media, and the effect has been far-reaching: many Singaporeans say this is the most debated and politicised election they have seen.Not all young people will be using their mandatory vote to go against the grain. Some, such as economics student and first-time voter Sofina Toh, 22, are swayed by the PAP's recent apology for past mistakes and promise to do better. \"The PAP has done so much for Singapore \u2013 just look at the country now from what it used to be,\" she says. \"Shouldn't we give credit where credit is due? They've promised to make changes. Maybe we can give them another chance.\"Others are not convinced. \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me,\" tweets a management student, Ong Rei En.At political rallies, for which turnout has arguably been the highest in Singapore's history, the energy is electric. An estimated 50,000 people crowded into an outdoor stadium on Thursday to wave blue flags and wield inflatable hammers, symbol of the opposition Workers' party. As the crowd chanted for change, fists raised in hope, armed police watched awkwardly, the sweat on their brows betraying the night's humidity.Rally attendance does not always translate to the polling booth. In 2006, despite large crowds at opposition speeches, the PAP won 67% of the vote. Many Singaporeans fear their ballots will be traced and their mortgages or jobs taken away if they vote for the opposition.Asked if Singapore is an Egypt in the making, Skope One furrows his brow as he bundles his spray-paint cans into a backpack. \"We don't want the same problems,\" he says finally. \"But we definitely echo the same feelings.\"", "tags": ["Singapore", "Protest", "Social media", "World news", "Facebook", "Media", "Internet", "Social networking", "Technology", "Twitter", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Singapore elections marked by online buzz of discontent"},{"date": "2011-04-28T09:00:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "On 31 March, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore and other government agencies hosted a green data centre forum. The event attracted information communications technology (ICT) professionals from around the world, with topics including data centre energy efficiency and modernisation, and, most groundbreaking, discussions about the development of required standards for green data centres.This forum at the Singapore Management University epitomises Singapore's emergence as a leader in the green ICT economy. Once a sleepy backwater, the tiny nation declared independence 50 years ago, and is now a global financial, industrial, and technological hub. While Singapore's government has emphasised the need for clean and green cities since it declared independence, sustainability initiatives within both the private and public sectors have ramped up in the last five years. Singapore's success can be credited to its curious hybrid approach of free-market economics with rigorous long-term central planning by the government.According to Eugene Tay, editor of Singapore's Green Business Times, Singapore's political leaders have responded to the growing global concern over climate change with a three-pronged programme that emphasises the environment, water, and clean energy. Linked to this focus is the government's recent interest in green ICT. Collaboration between government agencies, industry associations, ICT companies, and service providers could result in a new global green data centre standard that will rank with ISO 26000 for corporate social responsibility, the Global Reporting Initiative for sustainability reporting, LEED for green building, and the Forest Stewardship Council's ratings for paper and packaging.Government agencies such as Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA) have partnered with Hewlett Packard to design a new set of energy efficiency benchmarks. This development has its origins in Singapore's emergence as an ICT economic tiger in the past 20 years because of a highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate, seamless logistics, and central location. Companies, including HP and IBM, have flocked to the 710-square kilometre (242-square miles) city-state to have their products manufactured and data stored there. Those same companies confronted an issue, however, that no tax credit or business-friendly law could solve: Singapore's year-round tropical climate, which causes energy bills to soar. Still, with Singapore's reliance on imported fuel, the collaboration between HP and Singapore's government could result in a new standard for data centre efficiency.In addition to the green data centre standards initiative, Singapore's government is pushing for increased energy efficiency measures from both manufacturing facilities and business offices throughout the country. One programme trains energy managers to implement energy efficiency measures throughout their respective companies. With the ongoing concern over increased energy prices, Singaporean leaders hope that a green, ICT-driven economy can foster an environment of even more innovation and, of course, investment.Finally, Singapore's investment in the water technology area has made the densely populated country of 5 million a global \"hydrohub,\" explained Tay. The need to achieve water self-sufficiency at an effective cost drives further experimentation and innovation by Singaporean engineers. The country has one desalination plant, with another larger one slated to open in 2013. With Singapore's water agreement with neighbouring Malaysia set to expire in 50 years, engineers and nanotechnology experts are in a race to guarantee the country's water security. In turn, that talent will contribute to Singapore's growing reputation as a global centre that combines both energy and technological innovation.The debate over climate issues often volleys between the argument between increased government regulation versus self-regulation by business. Singapore's work on its energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives is a lesson on how the government and private sector can be partners, not opponents \u2013 meanwhile attracting talent from around the world for both its clean tech and ICT sectors, leaving other countries green with envy.Leon Kaye is founder and editor of the Los Angeles-based sustainability website GreenGoPostThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Glencore's new board, with Murray at the helm, is thought to have met for the first time in Baar, Switzerland, on Wednesday and to have signed off the prospectus.Analysts said that demand for Glencore stock would be strong among state-owned Chinese and Asian institutions, which are keen to diversify out of US government debt and to secure supplies of vital raw materials.Jan Randolph, head of sovereign risk at IHS Global Insight, said: \"The Chinese want to lock in supply chains and reduce their exposure to the dollar. They are seeking to buy mining companies outright in Brazil, Australia and elsewhere. Purchasing equity in Glencore is another way of acquiring influence over the supply of commodities, from copper to aluminium.\"Randolph said that, over time, Chinese funds could build their stakes to between 10% and 15%, at which point they were \"quite entitled to ask for board representation\". He described CIC as \"sitting on the top of the Christmas tree when it comes to investment institutions mandated by Beijing to invest abroad\".CIC is shortly to receive another $200bn to funnel overseas, on top of the $100bn it already has in its coffers. In 2009, the Chinese fund invested $800m in Noble Group, a Singapore-listed commodity trading and shipping company that bears similarities to Glencore.Glencore has been dogged by controversy since it announced its plan to float two weeks ago. There was confusion after Lord Browne, the former BP chief, was chosen as chairman, only for him to drop out at the last minute \u2013 after his name had been leaked to Sky News and the BBC \u2013 apparently because of concerns about corporate governance.The baton was then passed to Simon Murray, a Hong Kong businessman and former soldier in the French Foreign Legion, who sparked uproar when he said that he was reluctant to employ women in senior positions because they tended to go off on maternity leave. He later retracted his remarks after facing accusations of sexism from the business secretary, Vince Cable.In the City, eyebrows have been raised over the appointment of Tony Hayward as senior independent director: he was head of BP at the time of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster and is hugely unpopular in the US.Standard Life was reported as saying that the Glencore board looked as if it was cobbled together at \"the eleventh hour\".Pre-IPO research from banks such as Citigroup and Credit Suisse has surfaced that showed Glencore has been paying virtually no tax on its huge profits, thanks to an elaborate partnership structure and Swiss domicile.", "tags": ["Commodities", "Business", "Sovereign wealth funds", "Corporate governance", "IPOs", "FTSE", "Stock markets", "Tony Hayward", "Lord Browne", "Glencore"], "title": "Glencore float to have backing from sovereign wealth funds"},{"date": "2011-04-13T12:45:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "The country is groaning with so much bad news every day, it's a wonder anyone still lives in Ireland.This morning there were quite a few items for the pain addicts among us to choose from, but the worst has got to be the news that the country is going to miss the International Monetary Fund recovery targets for the next four years by around \u20ac5bn. Ajai Chopra, head of the IMF mission, flew to Dublin last Friday for the quarterly review and it looks as if everyone, including the Washington-based fund, has got it wrong \u2013 this week they almost halved their forecast for GDP growth in Ireland this year from 0.9% to 0.5%. And that's worrying because it's only a fraction of the 1.7% growth forecast by the department of finance whose figures informed last December's hellish budget.We all know what this means \u2013 Chopra is in charge and unless there is some Hungarian-style standoff between Ireland and the IMF, the disparity in figures can spell only one thing \u2013 more austerity, more pay cuts, more direct and indirect tax. See today's Irish Independent for more detail if you're a glutton for punishment. So that's why even the vaguest of hints by Allied Irish Banks yesterday of a new debt forgiveness programme for struggling mortgage customers made so many headlines today instead of its appalling loss of \u00a310bn in 2010 \u2013 as guest blogger economist Stephen Kinsella said: that's the equivalent of a few brand new hospitals.Still, the executive chairman of AIB, David Hodgkinson, is no slouch \u2013 he spent the best part of 40 years working for HSBC \u2013 and has led banks around the world through severe property crashes.When he arrived last October he was immediately on fire-fighting duty, with a second bailout ordered by the IMF, and a scandal over bank bonuses, as well as coping with his day job: to come up with a survival plan for the bank along with new management practices and prudential controls. \"I have never worked with quite as many problems as AIB had, particularly with property,\" he said. 'Do you know how hard it is to rent in Ballsbridge?'I caught up with him after the annual results news conference yesterday and he was remarkably upbeat about the future. \"Do you know how hard it is to find a place to live here in Ballsbridge?\" he says by way of explaining a recovery in landlord's yields.He admitted that his experience of trying to find a home in Dublin 4, one of Dublin's wealthiest districts, may not be typical, but he is still optimistic. He thinks Dublin, where house prices have fallen by as much as 53%, may have hit the bottom. But he is less convinced about areas outside the capital.\"Property in Dublin has stabilised. Properties are getting to investable yields. With gross yields of 6%, that may be worth buying again, but in some places it's going to take longer.\"He said he had worked through five property crashes \u2013 three in Hong Kong, one in Singapore and one in Saudi \u2013 but that Ireland's crash is probably the worst he has seen.\"It is the longest property boom I have seen. It went from the early 90s, then it stopped for a little bit and then the low interest rates from Europe made it even worse, and it just kept going,\" he said. He says Singapore had a similar crash in the 1980s but it \"bounced back within 18 months\". This is no cause for optimisim, however: he is quick to note one key difference between Singapore and Ireland \u2013 land. In Singapore and Hong Kong, property values were driven skyward because of the lack of development land.\"The problem for Ireland is Ireland had plenty of space and built in areas where demand might not recover,\" he said in reference to the country's notorious ghost estates. One in 10 buy-to-let customers in arrearsThe bank has made provisions to write off about \u20ac600m in mortgage debt this year alone and acknowledges the buy-to-let market is cause for deep concern with one in 10 customers behind payments for more than 90 days.Hodgkinson says \"there was a kind of collective madness,\" in Ireland during the boom with businesses and individuals chasing property investments like the gold rush. \"So when the crunch came it was very serious.\"Like the other banks in Ireland, AIB has two problems \u2013 it over-lent to customers for over-valued properties, but it also loosened its credit policy and started offering in tracker mortgages to head off upstarts such as Bank of Scotland that arrived in Ireland in the 2000s on an aggressive mortgage \"land-grab\".AIB said yesterday that 54% of all its mortgages were trackers \u2013 all of which are loss-making as they are linked to the record low ECB base rate.Those who are struggling with mortgages were given some solace by the revelation that the bank is looking at debt forgiveness initiatives.But in reality this is just rhetoric. All the bank is really talking about is practices already adopted by other banks, including loan holidays, interest-only repayment periods and loan extensions.AIB, which is costing the taxpayer more than \u20ac20bn in bailout funds, certainly won't be in a position to offer what might be better described as \"debt burial\" \u2013 a US-style system where customers can hand back the keys and walk away from their homes safe in the knowledge the debt won't follow them. \"It does depend on the situation of the customer, how transparent they are with us on their financial affairs and how deep a hole they're in,\" said Hodgkinson, confirming that debt rescheduling will be offered on a case by case basis.Talk of \"inter-generational mortgages\", however, is a bit concerning \u2013 this was something the banks conjured up at the peak of the boom allowing first-time buyers to buy over such a long time that their children would end up with the mortgage. But what was significant was that AIB, like Bank of Scotland, has said it is willing to work with landlords in the buy-to-let sector. This is something that the likes of KBC have steadfastly refused to do. KBC boss John Reynolds said in February: \"We lend people money over a long period of time and we expect to get it back over a long period of time.\"Asked would AIB be willing to restructure/write-off debt for buy-to-let mortgages, Hodgkinson said: \"That is one of the options, yes.\" Landlords, form an orderly queue now.\"My opinion is that both Ireland and AIB have serious issues to beresolved,\" he added. \"But I am convinced they both can and will recover.

But this is Singapore \u2013 a country which has seen one-party rule for more than half a century, where citizens are locked away without trial for dissent, and where protests can only occur with a licence from the authorities.I have been banned for standing in elections because I was sued for defamation by former prime ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, and ordered to pay more than a million Singapore dollars in damages. I could not meet their demands and was made bankrupt. Under the law bankrupts cannot run for office. Previous opposition leaders have also been dealt with in a similar manner. I have also been repeatedly imprisoned for exercising my right to free speech and assembly. These convictions also bar me from standing in elections.The overall effect has been that few in Singapore are willing to offer themselves as opposition candidates. This has allowed the PAP an easy passage at every election since 1959. In fact, for an entire decade in the 1970s parliament comprised of only PAP members of parliament.Anger and disenchantment with the government, which has been accumulating over the years, is palpable. People are fed up with rulers who insist that they are the only ones capable of running the country. Ministers award themselves salaries several times that of the US president, while the poor find themselves homeless and stricken by poverty. Government leaders have lost all sense of what public service is.This arrogance has caused professionals from the establishment to join us and other opposition parties. Our party fielded two former top civil servants. This would have been unimaginable even a year ago.The SDP did not win the seats that we contested. It would have been a miracle if we had. For every mainstream media outlet is still firmly in the control of the PAP government. News of my party's campaign activities, our manifesto and our plans for our constituencies were either played down or completely blacked out.In the past this would have been fatal. But we, and more importantly our small army of supporters, fought back \u2013 on the internet. We were able to counter the untruths that were hurled at us and, crucially, put forth our own views and policy positions. The consequence is that we were able to make significant progress in the percentage of votes cast for us.Conversely, the internet community very successfully put the PAP on the defensive over several missteps. These would not have been evident without the probing in cyberspace.But years of autocratic rule have taken their toll and undoing this will take more than just one election campaign, a campaign limited to nine days.In any case, we saw Singaporeans come alive politically and express themselves in quite unprecedented ways.To be sure, there is still much fear among the people, especially the older generation who have witnessed the heavy hand of the PAP's patriarch and \"Minister Mentor\" Lee Kuan Yew. But it is also Lee who is generating much of the resentment against the government of which his son, Lee Hsien Loong, is prime minister.And it is this resentment, buttressed by the new media which has enabled citizens to come together, if only online, that has caused many Singaporeans to shed their fear.There is no turning back now. The road to freedom is without doubt still long and arduous. But Singapore has taken that first crucial step to making parliamentary democracy a reality.", "tags": ["Singapore", "Internet", "Technology", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Singapore is taking the first steps to true democracy | Chee Soon Juan"},{"date": "2011-05-06T11:34:54Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "It is a dangerous act in a country where graffiti can fetch eight strokes of the cane, more dangerous still because it parodies the leader of the ruling Lee dynasty.

But in the runup to Saturday's parliamentary elections more people have started to speak out against the clan that has ruled Singapore for almost 50 years. Parallels with the Arab spring are striking, even if revolution is not just around the corner.Most murmurs of discontent can be found online: fears of reprisal are diminished for anonymous bloggers. On internet forums, blogs, Facebook and Twitter, grumblings about high housing prices, the widening gap between rich and poor, immigration laws and the salaries of government ministers (among the highest in the world) are hot topics.The People's Action party (PAP) has been in power since independence in 1965, and is widely recognised as having turned this colonial outpost into a financial behemoth in a few decades. But it knows it has a battle on its hands. On Saturday, it will contest 82 of the 87 seats, up from 47 of 84 seats in 2006.More than one in four voters in Singapore's 5\u00a0million-strong population, are under the age of 35, and the internet is a main source of news. For the first time, candidates have been allowed to campaign using social media, and the effect has been far-reaching: many Singaporeans say this is the most debated and politicised election they have seen.Not all young people will be using their mandatory vote to go against the grain. Some, such as economics student and first-time voter Sofina Toh, 22, are swayed by the PAP's recent apology for past mistakes and promise to do better. \"The PAP has done so much for Singapore \u2013 just look at the country now from what it used to be,\" she says. \"Shouldn't we give credit where credit is due? They've promised to make changes. Maybe we can give them another chance.\"Others are not convinced. \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me,\" tweets a management student, Ong Rei En.At political rallies, for which turnout has arguably been the highest in Singapore's history, the energy is electric. An estimated 50,000 people crowded into an outdoor stadium on Thursday to wave blue flags and wield inflatable hammers, symbol of the opposition Workers' party. As the crowd chanted for change, fists raised in hope, armed police watched awkwardly, the sweat on their brows betraying the night's humidity.Rally attendance does not always translate to the polling booth. In 2006, despite large crowds at opposition speeches, the PAP won 67% of the vote. Many Singaporeans fear their ballots will be traced and their mortgages or jobs taken away if they vote for the opposition.Asked if Singapore is an Egypt in the making, Skope One furrows his brow as he bundles his spray-paint cans into a backpack. \"We don't want the same problems,\" he says finally. \"But we definitely echo the same feelings.\"", "tags": ["Singapore", "Protest", "Social media", "World news", "Facebook", "Media", "Internet", "Social networking", "Technology", "Twitter", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Singapore elections marked by online buzz of discontent"},{"date": "2011-04-28T09:00:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "On 31 March, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore and other government agencies hosted a green data centre forum. The event attracted information communications technology (ICT) professionals from around the world, with topics including data centre energy efficiency and modernisation, and, most groundbreaking, discussions about the development of required standards for green data centres.This forum at the Singapore Management University epitomises Singapore's emergence as a leader in the green ICT economy. Once a sleepy backwater, the tiny nation declared independence 50 years ago, and is now a global financial, industrial, and technological hub. While Singapore's government has emphasised the need for clean and green cities since it declared independence, sustainability initiatives within both the private and public sectors have ramped up in the last five years. Singapore's success can be credited to its curious hybrid approach of free-market economics with rigorous long-term central planning by the government.According to Eugene Tay, editor of Singapore's Green Business Times, Singapore's political leaders have responded to the growing global concern over climate change with a three-pronged programme that emphasises the environment, water, and clean energy. Linked to this focus is the government's recent interest in green ICT. Collaboration between government agencies, industry associations, ICT companies, and service providers could result in a new global green data centre standard that will rank with ISO 26000 for corporate social responsibility, the Global Reporting Initiative for sustainability reporting, LEED for green building, and the Forest Stewardship Council's ratings for paper and packaging.Government agencies such as Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA) have partnered with Hewlett Packard to design a new set of energy efficiency benchmarks. This development has its origins in Singapore's emergence as an ICT economic tiger in the past 20 years because of a highly skilled workforce, business-friendly climate, seamless logistics, and central location. Companies, including HP and IBM, have flocked to the 710-square kilometre (242-square miles) city-state to have their products manufactured and data stored there. Those same companies confronted an issue, however, that no tax credit or business-friendly law could solve: Singapore's year-round tropical climate, which causes energy bills to soar. Still, with Singapore's reliance on imported fuel, the collaboration between HP and Singapore's government could result in a new standard for data centre efficiency.In addition to the green data centre standards initiative, Singapore's government is pushing for increased energy efficiency measures from both manufacturing facilities and business offices throughout the country. One programme trains energy managers to implement energy efficiency measures throughout their respective companies. With the ongoing concern over increased energy prices, Singaporean leaders hope that a green, ICT-driven economy can foster an environment of even more innovation and, of course, investment.Finally, Singapore's investment in the water technology area has made the densely populated country of 5 million a global \"hydrohub,\" explained Tay. The need to achieve water self-sufficiency at an effective cost drives further experimentation and innovation by Singaporean engineers. The country has one desalination plant, with another larger one slated to open in 2013. With Singapore's water agreement with neighbouring Malaysia set to expire in 50 years, engineers and nanotechnology experts are in a race to guarantee the country's water security. In turn, that talent will contribute to Singapore's growing reputation as a global centre that combines both energy and technological innovation.The debate over climate issues often volleys between the argument between increased government regulation versus self-regulation by business. Singapore's work on its energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives is a lesson on how the government and private sector can be partners, not opponents \u2013 meanwhile attracting talent from around the world for both its clean tech and ICT sectors, leaving other countries green with envy.Leon Kaye is founder and editor of the Los Angeles-based sustainability website GreenGoPostThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Glencore's new board, with Murray at the helm, is thought to have met for the first time in Baar, Switzerland, on Wednesday and to have signed off the prospectus.Analysts said that demand for Glencore stock would be strong among state-owned Chinese and Asian institutions, which are keen to diversify out of US government debt and to secure supplies of vital raw materials.Jan Randolph, head of sovereign risk at IHS Global Insight, said: \"The Chinese want to lock in supply chains and reduce their exposure to the dollar. They are seeking to buy mining companies outright in Brazil, Australia and elsewhere. Purchasing equity in Glencore is another way of acquiring influence over the supply of commodities, from copper to aluminium.\"Randolph said that, over time, Chinese funds could build their stakes to between 10% and 15%, at which point they were \"quite entitled to ask for board representation\". He described CIC as \"sitting on the top of the Christmas tree when it comes to investment institutions mandated by Beijing to invest abroad\".CIC is shortly to receive another $200bn to funnel overseas, on top of the $100bn it already has in its coffers. In 2009, the Chinese fund invested $800m in Noble Group, a Singapore-listed commodity trading and shipping company that bears similarities to Glencore.Glencore has been dogged by controversy since it announced its plan to float two weeks ago. There was confusion after Lord Browne, the former BP chief, was chosen as chairman, only for him to drop out at the last minute \u2013 after his name had been leaked to Sky News and the BBC \u2013 apparently because of concerns about corporate governance.The baton was then passed to Simon Murray, a Hong Kong businessman and former soldier in the French Foreign Legion, who sparked uproar when he said that he was reluctant to employ women in senior positions because they tended to go off on maternity leave. He later retracted his remarks after facing accusations of sexism from the business secretary, Vince Cable.In the City, eyebrows have been raised over the appointment of Tony Hayward as senior independent director: he was head of BP at the time of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster and is hugely unpopular in the US.Standard Life was reported as saying that the Glencore board looked as if it was cobbled together at \"the eleventh hour\".Pre-IPO research from banks such as Citigroup and Credit Suisse has surfaced that showed Glencore has been paying virtually no tax on its huge profits, thanks to an elaborate partnership structure and Swiss domicile.", "tags": ["Commodities", "Business", "Sovereign wealth funds", "Corporate governance", "IPOs", "FTSE", "Stock markets", "Tony Hayward", "Lord Browne", "Glencore"], "title": "Glencore float to have backing from sovereign wealth funds"},{"date": "2011-04-09T23:06:08Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Would they dare to quit London?

He described Singapore as \"the most open and clear society in the world\", and that since every minister is paid at least $1m a year, \"there is no temptation and it is the cleanest society you would find anywhere\".If ministers need to be paid the amounts that they are in Singapore to prevent corruption, which is a criminal act, why can't we pay people like Letchmi enough to sustain her livelihood and health so that she doesn't resort to stealing?The Global Wage Report 2009, a study by the International Labor Organisation, found that among 13 countries surveyed (Singapore, Cyprus, Japan, South Korea, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Taiwan, Denmark, Spain, UK, and US) Singaporeans worked the most hours. Yet they saw their real wages decline. There is no minimum wage in Singapore.Prices and Earnings, a 2010 survey conducted by UBS, revealed that Singapore was the 11th most expensive city in the world out of 73. In that same study, it was found that the domestic purchasing power of Singaporeans was ranked at 49th.One of the most expensive cities in the world with its inhabitants paid poorly: are these not factors that drive workers like Letchmi to committing criminal acts?Even the elderly in Singapore are not spared. They are pushed to work way into their retirement years, and for less pay. It is a common sight to witness folks in their 70s, doubled over from old age, working as cleaners at public toilets and food centres in Singapore.And yet Singapore's government ministers defend their enormous salaries by making the case that if they are not paid more than excessively they will be tempted by corruption, an argument that now finds an adherent in Murdoch.In addition, the \"open\" system that Murdoch claims exists in Singapore is more a figment of his imagination. Let's start with the media. In the 1960s and 70s, many journalists were imprisoned. Independently owned newspapers were shut down. Today all Singaporean publications, TV channels and radio stations are owned and run by the government.Civil society is nonexistent. Non-government organisations, student bodies and trade unions are tightly controlled. Public assemblies outside a small and demarcated area are banned.The opposition is in a moribund state. Many of its leaders have been arrested and detained without trial, prosecuted in court, and sued till bankruptcy for defamation.The election system is far from free and fair. The \"election\" of the country's president to be held in a few weeks' time, for example, is restricted to a handful of candidates allowed by the prime minister.Political power amassed in the hands of the few in Singapore is also used to ensure that a disproportionate amount of financial power is accumulated in those same hands.Officials who seek authority as custodians of political power must have the character to keep away from crime no matter what the temptation might be. The argument that ministers should be paid millions of dollars to keep them from corruption does not hold water.No one denies those in charge of government should be paid well. But when politicians start to climb on to pedestals and insist that they be rewarded with stratospheric levels of remuneration, it raises serious questions of moral leadership. Public service enriches one's sense of loyalty and mission, not one's bank account. There are other vocations if one's goal is to amass financial fortunes.Public service and greed don't mix well.

Now the 76-year-old great-grandfather is enjoying a new lease of life after being imprisoned for writing a book that dared to criticise the judiciary in Singapore.\"I took two suitcases to Berlin, all the stuff I needed,\" he says when we meet at his daughter's house in Essex. \"And I came back from Singapore with two suitcases and nothing of my life in between \u2013 no houses, no cars, no wives.\"Shadrake has enjoyed a rip-roaring, itinerant writing career, his life shaped by the stories that he has pursued. \"What have you done now, Dad?\" his children laugh when he phones them from far-flung destinations. But Shadrake's family feared his determination to expose injustice in Singapore was an adventure too far. When he was found guilty of contempt of court last year for claims in his bestselling book, Once a Jolly Hangman, his youngest daughter emailed to ask: \"Will they hang you Dad?\" They did not but Shadrake has only recently been freed \u2013 and deported back to Britain \u2013 after five weeks in Changi prison.Shadrake is still recovering from his imprisonment. \"It was a pretty horrendous experience,\" he says. But he looks younger than his years. He began as a 15-year-old on the Hornchurch and Upminster News and worked his way up to the Daily Express in Manchester before moving to Berlin. There he filed stories for all the UK papers and wrote a book about the people-smuggling racket created by the wall. Later on, he moved to Los Angeles and Las Vegas, writing showbiz features for British tabloids.After his third wife died, Shadrake was just about to go to Cuba when a journalist friend phoned and asked him to write some travel stories about Singapore. So he flew to south-east Asia. On his only night off he was sitting alone at a bar when he met a Singaporean-Chinese woman who was to become his fourth wife.\"The very morning I moved into her flat in Singapore I switched the TV on and there was an announcement about a British guy wanted for two murders who had run off to Australia,\" remembers Shadrake. That suspect was protected from extradition until it was guaranteed that he would not be put to death and yet Shadrake also spotted the case of Nguyen Van Tuong, a young Australian who was found guilty of heroin trafficking at Changi airport and was hanged.\"I saw it as double standards,\" he says. \"I thought: find a hangman and interview him.\" The hangman he eventually tracked down changed his life. Shadrake was surprised to hit it off with Darshan Singh, Singapore's chief executioner for nearly 50 years who once executed 18 men in one day. \"We're old codgers together,\" he says. \"I used to talk to him about Manchester United. He loved it.\"Shadrake envisioned a biography of Singh's life but as he spoke to more local people he became convinced the judicial system did not always deliver justice. And so Once a Jolly Hangman tells of a judiciary that embraced the death penalty for murder, drug trafficking and firearms offences. Singapore only recently started revealing its execution rates \u2013 killing six criminals in 2008 and five in 2009 \u2013 and Shadrake argued the death penalty disproportionately applied to the young and the poor, while high-ranking criminals, wealthy foreigners and well-connected drug lords escaped.By the time the book was published, Shadrake had moved to Malaysia. He suspected his book would upset the Singaporean authorities but daringly ignored a warning from the British High Commission not to return to Singapore for his book launch. The evening before he flew in, he called his eldest daughter, Kim, and, with typical black humour, told her he was having his \"last dinner\". She joked: \"Make sure it's a good one, it may be your last for a long time.\" Inside the launch party, 150 diplomats and activists toasted Shadrake's book. Outside, police circled in unmarked cars.At 6.30am the next morning, Shadrake was woken in his hotel room by four police officers who ordered him to get dressed. He was interrogated for more than 10 hours a day for five days, a vent of cold air angled on to his neck. An officer opened a copy of his book and repeatedly asked him why he wrote certain sections. \"It was a bit ridiculous. I said: 'This book is true,'\" he remembers. Twice Shadrake was given the chance to publicly apologise before his trial and sentencing. He was also asked to promise not to impugn the integrity of Singapore's judiciary again. \"I suddenly thought, what is this all about? I'm going to apologise and they'll let me go? Then I thought, I'm not going to apologise. They had fallen into their own trap. They had got me and they didn't know what to do. They had caused this global outcry. I was nobody and I'm nobody now but I've just become famous through their stupidity.\"Facing 14 charges for \"scandalising the judiciary\" \u2013 in essence, writing a critical book that could undermine public faith in Singapore's judicial system \u2013 Shadrake became a global media story. He was found guilty of nine charges and sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment and a S$20,000 (\u00a310,000) fine. Shadrake, who has heart problems and chronic back pain from a slipped disc, was forced to sleep on a hard floor with only a couple of thin blankets, just along from the prisioners on death row. He fell ill and was rushed to hospital \u2013 chained to the bed \u2013 and put on a drip. His care improved, he says, when he warned the authorities it would be a PR disaster for them if he was photographed arriving back in Britain in a wheelchair.Before he went into jail, Shadrake made a vow: \"When I come out, I'm going to continue to be a thorn in the side of the Singapore authorities for as long as I live.\" He is proud of what he considers his best work in his 50-year career and has \"no regrets\". After recuperating in Britain he will return to Malaysia, where his book has sold 10,000 copies \u2013 many to traders who have smuggled it into Singapore, where his book is not officially banned but is, mysteriously, unavailable in any shops. \"The Singapore government scored an own-goal by persecuting Alan. His book has drawn the international spotlight to Singapore's use of the death penalty,\" said Lance Lattig, south-east Asia researcher at Amnesty International. \"When it comes to drug trafficking, Singapore operates an institutionalised system of unfair trials with automatic presumption of guilt and a mandatory death penalty. Singapore doesn't recognise the universal right to free speech. Instead, the government tightens or loosens restrictions on free speech as it pleases.\"Shadrake is in touch with human rights activists and Singaporean dissidents who have been energised by his book. He hopes that repression, injustice and the lack of separation between executive power and the judiciary in Singapore \u2013 criticisms that so inflamed the authorities \u2013 will come crumbling down just as surely as the Berlin Wall did as well. \"It's going to be very slow. It might take 10 years but there are definitely changes going on. It's moving in the right direction now,\" he says. \"I've had tremendous support in Singapore.

Since employers are not legally bound to grant days off, the weeks never end.In the country that officially works the longest hours in the world, where one in six families has domestic help, the legal right to a day off has long seemed unthinkable for maids.But a government minister's suggestion that a mandatory rest day could minimise stress has reignited a long-standing debate in Singapore over workers' rights.Halimah Yacob, Singapore's minister for community development, health and sports, says domestic workers need one day a week to \"rest and recuperate\". The government has said it is \"studying the suggestion\".But no legal right to a day off isn't the only problem for Singapore's 201,000 domestic workers, for whom there is, perhaps not surprisingly, no minimum wage either. It's the attitudes of their employers \u2013 and indeed the country at large \u2013 that stands in the way of progress.\"Are maids really that overworked?\" asked schoolteacher Low Ai Choo, in a letter to the local Straits Times. \"My maid has a day off once a month. Every time she comes back from her outings she appears even more tired and listless, and needs to recuperate from her outing.\"My maid is the one who goes to bed by nine every night and my husband and I are the ones still up way beyond nine to tuck in our children and catch up with school work.\"Low is one of many employers reacting angrily to Yacob's suggestion, which came after the International Labour Organisation (ILO) agreed last week to give domestic workers a day off every week, as well as other basic labour rights. Singapore, along with the UK, was among 63 member states that abstained from the vote.For some domestic employers such as Choo, the real issue lies in Singapore's \"workhorse\" mentality, whereby everyone \u2013 not just maids \u2013 could do with more time to relax.Singaporeans work the longest hours in the world according to the ILO, clocking up an average of 46.6 hours a week.New parents often struggle with the work-life balance, as statutory maternity leave in Singapore is limited to 16 weeks and there is no right to paternity leave. In the UK new mothers can take up to 52 weeks' maternity leave and fathers up to two weeks.Many domestic workers in Singapore are hired as live-in cooks, cleaners and nannies, and some agencies, such as Best Maid, capitalise on Singapore's strong work ethic. \"In Singapore, [a] maid is not a luxury, but a necessity,\" reads the company's website.But not everyone can afford domestic help. On top of the salary, employers are required to pay a \u00a32,500 security bond on their maid, as well as a monthly fee of around \u00a3135 throughout the standard two-year contract.Such rules can encourage employers to be less concerned about the welfare of their workers than \"getting value for money\", says Vincent Wijeysingha of the charity Transient Workers Count Too.\"Unlike more liberal countries where your rights are protected by law, here it all comes down to the personal goodwill of the employer, he said. \"Many think, 'I already pay so much for her, I don't want to let her out of the house where she might find a boyfriend, get pregnant and make me lose my security bond.'\"While physical abuse of domestic workers has decreased in recent years, psychological abuse is very common, says Bridget Tan of the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics, which counsels some 1,000 runaway domestic workers every year.\"Newcomers usually have their mobiles taken away, aren't allowed to communicate with family or neighbours and get no day off. The working conditions here are making people go crazy.\"Domestic helpers \u2013 nearly one-third of which come from the Philippines \u2013 work an average of 14 hours a day, with only 12% given one day off per week, according to a new report.Employers negotiate contracts directly with their workers, with many offering a monthly payment of around \u00a325 if no rest day is taken. Salaries range from around \u00a3125 to \u00a3350 a month, although many workers receive no pay for the first six to 11 months of their contract due to agency fees.Mandatory rest days are already enshrined in employment law in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and it seems Singapore's domestic employers may soon have to follow suit in allowing their employees some relaxation time, says Edmund Pooh of Universal Employment Agency. \"It will be difficult for them to attract good workers if they don't.\"For Filipina worker AJ, 40, who uses her weekly day off to attend computer classes and socialise with friends, more time to rest can only be a good thing.\"I came here for a better life \u2013 we all did,\" said the former agricultural worker.\"But you cannot work from 6am to 9pm every day with no rest and so little pay.

Expected to cook and clean for their employers at a moment's notice, they also have to pass a test to show they can speak English.But this is now set to change, as the city-state's mandatory examination for maids, which included English language testing, will be scrapped from June 2012 and replaced by a \"settling-in programme\", with modules on stress management, safety awareness and adapting to life and work abroad. It will not offer English language training, nor any classes on cooking or cleaning.One in six Singaporean families hires domestic help, but until now it's often been English that has unified employer with employee. The majority of Singapore's maids hail from its poorer neighbours, notably Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Burma.The exam was introduced in 2005 to improve the calibre of domestic workers coming to Singapore, and has often been cited as a source of stress for new arrivals, many of whom have already paid high recruitment fees to agencies back home in anticipation of a new life.Around 80 maids take the test every day, but failure is common. One Indonesian maid committed suicide last year after failing the test three times, the maximum number of tries allowed.Tan Chuang-Jin of Singapore's manpower ministry said that the new law should offer a more stress-free environment for domestic workers, four out of five of whom are said to face problems adapting to life in Singapore.\"While the entry test was introduced with good intentions \u2026 it is not a meaningful measure of quality and does not guarantee that the worker understands the English language,\" he said.\"It discourages some good foreign domestic workers from wanting to work here, while others spend valuable training time mugging for the test.\"Local employers and agencies have welcomed the news, with the Singaporean Association of Employment Agencies expecting the new law to increase the number of foreign maids applying to work in Singapore up to 25%. Around 3,000 new domestic workers arrive every month.Others, however, are worried that scrapping the law will pose more, rather than fewer, problems.According to Rieke Dyah Pitaloka, of Indonesia's House of Representatives commission, which oversees labour affairs, poor language skills caused 92% of disputes between Singaporean employers and their Indonesian domestic workers between January and July.\"Lax requirements will only cause problems, because [poor skills in] language can lead to poor communication between employers and employees,\" she told the Jakarta Globe.", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Singapore maids to be spared English and cooking test"},{"date": "2011-12-19T12:22:29Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Keeping it Christmassy, that wise man Michael Gove appears to spotted something shiny in the east.

The study, carried out in August and September, gathers data from site access by devices as well as other information gathered by the company.In the UK and US, 6.8% of web browsing comes from non-PC sources. Singapore, which leads the world, has 7.2% of web browsing coming from non-PC devices. In the UK, 67.6% of non-PC web browsing was from mobiles, 24.7% by tablets and 7.7% by other devices such as games consoles and e-readers. In the US the figure was 64.4%, 28.1% and 7.5%.That means in the UK and US about 4% of overall web browsing comes via smartphones and 1.6% from tablets. While small, they also indicate rapid growth in a markets which barely existed four years ago. The iPhone first went on sale in mid-2007, while the first Android phones were not available until the end of 2008. The iPad only became available in the UK in May 2010; since then about 40m iPads have been sold worldwide, with the number of tablets including Android models in use probably at 50m.That compares to an installed base of around 1.5bn PCs worldwide. Estimates for the number of smartphones in use worldwide are between 600m and 800m, depending on replacement speed. The comScore figures might imply at first that tablets are under-represented in web viewing, as the number in use is equivalent to 2.6% of the number of installed PCs. Similarly, there are nearly half as many smartphones as PCs in use.But instead the figures appear to point to the way that people are jumping between devices \u2013 and especially to the way that tablets have begun to be used at the beginning and end of the day instead of a PC.Thus tablet owners use their devices to browse news websites at the start of the day, and then move on to a PC during the working day, and then back to a tablet at the end of the day. Similarly, mobile phones may be used for web browsing through the day when people are away from a PC.The growth of tablet use is borne out by the fact that even as non-PC traffic grew over the past four months, the proportion from tablets rose within it from around 20% to 30%. Meanwhile smartphones were pushed down, as were games consoles and e-readers, even though usage increased.\"While tablets have thus far only penetrated a small percentage of the US population, the potential for this device to break into the mainstream is significant, as more manufacturers offer tablets at varying price points,\" comScore notes. \"Currently, half or more of tablet users report having engaged in activities such as consuming news, viewing entertainment, social networking, and shopping on their devices at least once in the previous month. With more publishers optimising their properties for tablet presentation and developers creating apps specific to tablets, it is likely that tablet owners' engagement with their devices will only continue to grow.\" Overall, comScore says the patterns are indicative of a new, global breed of \"digital omnivores\" who consume internet content across a multitude of devices through the day. In five global markets \u2013 the UK, US, Australia, Japan and Singapore \u2013 more than 5% of internet traffic came from non-PC devices.The increase in Wi-Fi availability in places such as coffee shops and some food outlets is also helping drive that use, with 37.2% of US digital traffic coming from mobile phones using a Wi-Fi connection. Yet tablets \u2013 commonly used with a Wi-Fi connection \u2013 were increasingly seen accessing the net via mobile broadband, with just less than 10% of connections coming on the move.In all, the US mobile population grew 19% to 116m users \u2013 compared to around 260m of the total population in the US \u2013 whose use of mobile media is being driven by smartphones. Of those, half use \"mobile media\" via the web; the others use a mixture of voice and texting.Tablets \u2013 principally the iPad \u2013 are growing rapidly in use, the report found. \"Although tablets have yet to be widely adopted, they already contribute nearly 2% of all US web browsing traffic, driven almost exclusively by the iPad, which currently accounts for more than 97% of all tablet traffic,\" the company said. Apple devices were also used disproportionately to their installed base, said comScore: Apple's iOS runs 43.1% of the smartphones and tablets in use in the US, compared to 34.1% for Android devices and 15.4% for BlackBerry maker RIM.But in browsing, iOS makes up 58.5% of the use, against 31.9% for Android and 5.0% for RIM \u2013 suggesting iOS users browse about 36% more than expected, Android users 6.5% less, and BlackBerry users only one-third as much.US tablet ownership was concentrated among young males, with half being used in households earning $100,000 (\u00a363,000) and above, the research found, though the expectation is that the Amazon Kindle Fire, priced at $199 against the iPad's $399, will broaden tablet adoption.Content availability was also important: half of tablet users had made a purchase via a tablet in the past month, the study found.", "tags": ["Tablet computers", "Smartphones", "iPad", "Apple", "Android", "Google", "Technology"], "title": "Tablets being used more during mornings and evenings"},{"date": "2011-12-06T17:46:59Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Singapore's vast army of maids doesn't have it easy.

Apple devices were also used disproportionately to their installed base, said comScore: Apple's iOS runs 43.1% of the smartphones and tablets in use in the US, compared to 34.1% for Android devices and 15.4% for BlackBerry maker RIM.But in browsing, iOS makes up 58.5% of the use, against 31.9% for Android and 5.0% for RIM \u2013 suggesting iOS users browse about 36% more than expected, Android users 6.5% less, and BlackBerry users only one-third as much.US tablet ownership was concentrated among young males, with half being used in households earning $100,000 (\u00a363,000) and above, the research found, though the expectation is that the Amazon Kindle Fire, priced at $199 against the iPad's $399, will broaden tablet adoption.Content availability was also important: half of tablet users had made a purchase via a tablet in the past month, the study found.", "tags": ["Tablet computers", "Smartphones", "iPad", "Apple", "Android", "Google", "Technology"], "title": "Tablets being used more during mornings and evenings"},{"date": "2011-10-10T20:43:35Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Before Monday, Liam Fox had only admitted to meeting Adam Werritty on trips to Sri Lanka and Dubai earlier this year, and then only after much media scrutiny.There had been speculation about meetings in Singapore too. But in the Commons, the defence secretary told MPs that he and Werritty had met abroad on 18 occasions in the last 16 months, and promised that the details would be published after he had finished his statement.The full list emerged after 7pm and gave remarkable details about how Werritty has tracked Fox across the globe as Fox has conducted official business.The 33-year-old was in Singapore in June last year when Fox was giving a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He met him in Abu Dhabi and Dubai days later. The following month they met at the US Central Command base in Tampa, Florida, for an \"informal dinner\" at a steakhouse with General John Allen, who replaced General David Petraeus as head of Nato forces in Afghanistan earlier this summer.Further meetings followed in Bahrain in December last year, in Hong Kong in January this year, and in Israel in February. Fox and Werritty went on a skiing trip together that month in Switzerland. In March, they met in Dubai, and in April he was on holiday with Fox and his wife in Abu Dhabi. In May, they were in Washington together, and shared a flight home to the UK on a private jet, listed as a trip \"on party donor's aircraft to attend the President Obama state visit\".Later that month they met in Washington and Hong Kong, and they were back in Washington again in July.The list shows that Werritty also accompanied Fox and his family during a two-week holiday in Spain in August.Fox asserts that the meetings with Werritty were all private, social functions, and had nothing to do with the business he was undertaking as secretary of state. And he insists Werritty has not financially benefited from these meetings, or his friendship, either. Nonetheless, the MoD list acknowledges that Werritty was present in both a personal and business capacity at a meeting between the UAE government and British military in Dubai last December.Fox did not go into these details in his statement to MPs, saying only that \"as a matter of transparency I would like to inform the house I have met Mr Werritty in a social capacity in the margins of 18 trips overseas, including my annual leave\".In the interim report from the MoD's chief civil servant, Ursula Brennan, she says, with some understatement, that \"the defence secretary's overseas visits are complex, often involving brief stopovers en route from one location to another\". She says that \"maintaining a proper degree of separation (between downtime and official engagements) is necessary for reasons of propriety\".Brennan seems to indicate she is not happy with the way Fox may have blurred the lines, even if accidentally. \"The department needs to ensure that a clear distinction is made between party political, personal and government business to avoid the occurrence of actual or perceived conflicts of interest,\" she says.She also notes the \"potentially grey area\" where personal meetings can stray into government business \u2013 which should not happen without a civil servant present.As part of her ongoing review she has commissioned a trawl for \"email and electronic evidence\" at the MoD on all of Fox's trips abroad, including his holidays, when Werritty is known to have been there. She is trying to establish \"who else was on these trips and who attended which formal and informal events\".In response to a Freedom of Information request, the Guardian discovered last week that Fox had met Werritty at the MoD on 14 occasions in the last 16 months. This provoked the furore about the access he had been given, and the potential for breaches of national security. But it emerged that there were even more visits than those declared under FoI, though no explanation was given about why the initial figures were inaccurate.In her report, Brennan sets out that Werritty \"was present on 22 rather than 14 occasions\", and that she cannot yet exclude the possibility that there may have been more visits. And though Brennan says she feels confident that most of the visits to the MoD were \"largely personal conversations \u2026 and that the department did not provide Mr Werritty with classified papers or briefings\", the sheer number of visits caused surprise across Westminster.Fox has conceded that at least one of the 22 visits, many of which took place in the Pillared Hall coffee bar in defence headquarters, was inappropriate. This involved Fox and Werritty meeting the forthcoming British ambassador to Israel. Brennan says that, \"Dr Fox acknowledges that it was not appropriate for Mr Werritty to have attended such a meeting at the MoD.\" In all, she has found - so far - there were only four occasions out of the 22 when Fox met Werritty with others in attendance.In Fox's statement to the Commons, he said that three of these related to Sri Lanka and one was with someone \"known socially to both of us\" - presumably, the British diplomat.Fox characterised Werritty's visits as \"short social meetings\". Despite having a large staff to support him, and all the security protocols that come with running one of the biggest and most sensitive departments in Whitehall, Brennan hints at the chaotic nature of Fox's engagement diary \u2013 saying that she has still to confirm the times and dates of all the times Werritty entered the building. She has asked for \"security control logs\" to give her a definitive number.When the list of all the meetings they had together was published last night, it emerged that Werritty's first meeting with Fox at the MoD occurred on 20 May \u2013 just after the general election. He met him again on 21 May.It was during one of their MoD meetings in June that Fox told his friend to stop using business cards with the portcullis emblem saying he was one of Fox's advisers, he said.Fox told the Commons he first learned Werritty was using them earlier that month, and at their next meeting, \"told him to stop using his business card stating he was my adviser\". Brennan explains that she raised the issue with Fox on 23 August at a routine meeting, the day she returned to the MoD after her summer break. She had read about the cards in a story published in the Guardian on 19 August.\"Dr Fox confirmed that he had already dealt with the problem and that it was wrong for Mr Werritty to have used such a card,\" she states. Brennan says she checked Fox's claim that he had asked Werritty to stop using the cards two months earlier with one of his special advisers. \"He recalls that immediately after this the defence secretary and the special advisers held a meeting with Mr Werritty at which Dr Fox told [him] that this was unacceptable and he must stop issuing the business cards.\"Answering questions in the Commons, Fox was asked if it was true that the former chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, had warned him about his closeness to Werritty. Fox said he did not recall having that conversation.Fox did not add anything new to his account of his controversial June meeting with Dubai businessman Harvey Boulter, maintaining it was organised after Werritty bumped into Boulter in a restaurant. He insisted that he had never discussed the issue of 3M boss George Buckley's knighthood with Boulter and suggested Boulter was unreliable because he had initially implied that the knighthood was discussed but he later insisted it was not.Ursula Brennan made it clear that Fox's officials had been unaware of the meeting and that she was unhappy about that. In her interim report she said: \"If there is a risk that a personal meeting may stray into government business, the private secretary should ensure that an official be present.\"Fox's insistence that the Boulter meeting was arranged after a chance encounter is undermined by correspondence seen by the Guardian which suggests talks had taken place between Werritty and Boulter about setting up a meeting with Fox as early as March. The June meeting was the second time the defence secretary had met the Dubai businessman. The two men met in Dubai in early April when, by coincidence, Fox was in town and was able to shake the private equity boss's hand.Fox says he did not discuss either commercial or defence matters during private meetings with Werritty. \"He had no access to classified material nor was he briefed on classified matters.\" The defence secretary does acknowledge that at the Dubai meeting on 17 June there was a general discussion about a communications encryption technology called Cellcrypt and how it might work for the MoD. Beyond that, there was \"no discussion of \u2026 any classified information\".Brennan says senior MoD civil servants believe that Werritty's 22-plus visits to the department were largely personal. But since others were present at only four of them she has only Fox's word for it. She says civil servants are confident they did not provide Werritty with classified papers or briefings.Boulter says that the call encryption technology he discussed with Fox in Dubai was sensitive and that he would not have done so if he had known Werritty did not have security clearance. In particular he says he discussed the possibility of providing it for UK troops in Afghanistan which would have been highly sensitive information.Brennan says that during the course of her review she learned that Fox or his office had provided some diary details to Werritty, in connection with visits where Werritty was to be present. She said: \"Dr Fox has accepted that it is not appropriate to ask officials to provide ministerial diary information to a third party.\"Questioned about providing diary details to a friend Fox was unapologetic. He claimed it was reasonable for ministers to let friends and family know of their movements in order to make arrangements to meet up socially. He does promise to stop meeting Werritty socially when abroad on official\u00a0business.", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "Adam Werritty", "Conservatives", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "title": "Not just Dubai: Liam Fox met Adam Werritty 18 times around the world"},{"date": "2011-12-06T17:46:59Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Singapore's vast army of maids doesn't have it easy. Expected to cook and clean for their employers at a moment's notice, they also have to pass a test to show they can speak English.But this is now set to change, as the city-state's mandatory examination for maids, which included English language testing, will be scrapped from June 2012 and replaced by a \"settling-in programme\", with modules on stress management, safety awareness and adapting to life and work abroad. It will not offer English language training, nor any classes on cooking or cleaning.One in six Singaporean families hires domestic help, but until now it's often been English that has unified employer with employee. The majority of Singapore's maids hail from its poorer neighbours, notably Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Burma.The exam was introduced in 2005 to improve the calibre of domestic workers coming to Singapore, and has often been cited as a source of stress for new arrivals, many of whom have already paid high recruitment fees to agencies back home in anticipation of a new life.Around 80 maids take the test every day, but failure is common. One Indonesian maid committed suicide last year after failing the test three times, the maximum number of tries allowed.Tan Chuang-Jin of Singapore's manpower ministry said that the new law should offer a more stress-free environment for domestic workers, four out of five of whom are said to face problems adapting to life in Singapore.\"While the entry test was introduced with good intentions \u2026 it is not a meaningful measure of quality and does not guarantee that the worker understands the English language,\" he said.\"It discourages some good foreign domestic workers from wanting to work here, while others spend valuable training time mugging for the test.\"Local employers and agencies have welcomed the news, with the Singaporean Association of Employment Agencies expecting the new law to increase the number of foreign maids applying to work in Singapore up to 25%. Around 3,000 new domestic workers arrive every month.Others, however, are worried that scrapping the law will pose more, rather than fewer, problems.According to Rieke Dyah Pitaloka, of Indonesia's House of Representatives commission, which oversees labour affairs, poor language skills caused 92% of disputes between Singaporean employers and their Indonesian domestic workers between January and July.\"Lax requirements will only cause problems, because [poor skills in] language can lead to poor communication between employers and employees,\" she told the Jakarta Globe.", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Singapore maids to be spared English and cooking test"},{"date": "2011-12-19T12:22:29Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Keeping it Christmassy, that wise man Michael Gove appears to spotted something shiny in the east.

Labour says that the government's expert panel has been sent back to the drawing board for failing to reflect Gove's \"ideological creed\".\u2022 Gove's ideological creed may allow private schools who want to become state academies to go on picking their pupils by ability, according to Daniel Boffey in the Observer.

The study, carried out in August and September, gathers data from site access by devices as well as other information gathered by the company.In the UK and US, 6.8% of web browsing comes from non-PC sources. Singapore, which leads the world, has 7.2% of web browsing coming from non-PC devices. In the UK, 67.6% of non-PC web browsing was from mobiles, 24.7% by tablets and 7.7% by other devices such as games consoles and e-readers. In the US the figure was 64.4%, 28.1% and 7.5%.That means in the UK and US about 4% of overall web browsing comes via smartphones and 1.6% from tablets. While small, they also indicate rapid growth in a markets which barely existed four years ago. The iPhone first went on sale in mid-2007, while the first Android phones were not available until the end of 2008. The iPad only became available in the UK in May 2010; since then about 40m iPads have been sold worldwide, with the number of tablets including Android models in use probably at 50m.That compares to an installed base of around 1.5bn PCs worldwide. Estimates for the number of smartphones in use worldwide are between 600m and 800m, depending on replacement speed. The comScore figures might imply at first that tablets are under-represented in web viewing, as the number in use is equivalent to 2.6% of the number of installed PCs. Similarly, there are nearly half as many smartphones as PCs in use.But instead the figures appear to point to the way that people are jumping between devices \u2013 and especially to the way that tablets have begun to be used at the beginning and end of the day instead of a PC.Thus tablet owners use their devices to browse news websites at the start of the day, and then move on to a PC during the working day, and then back to a tablet at the end of the day. Similarly, mobile phones may be used for web browsing through the day when people are away from a PC.The growth of tablet use is borne out by the fact that even as non-PC traffic grew over the past four months, the proportion from tablets rose within it from around 20% to 30%. Meanwhile smartphones were pushed down, as were games consoles and e-readers, even though usage increased.\"While tablets have thus far only penetrated a small percentage of the US population, the potential for this device to break into the mainstream is significant, as more manufacturers offer tablets at varying price points,\" comScore notes. \"Currently, half or more of tablet users report having engaged in activities such as consuming news, viewing entertainment, social networking, and shopping on their devices at least once in the previous month. With more publishers optimising their properties for tablet presentation and developers creating apps specific to tablets, it is likely that tablet owners' engagement with their devices will only continue to grow.\" Overall, comScore says the patterns are indicative of a new, global breed of \"digital omnivores\" who consume internet content across a multitude of devices through the day. In five global markets \u2013 the UK, US, Australia, Japan and Singapore \u2013 more than 5% of internet traffic came from non-PC devices.The increase in Wi-Fi availability in places such as coffee shops and some food outlets is also helping drive that use, with 37.2% of US digital traffic coming from mobile phones using a Wi-Fi connection. Yet tablets \u2013 commonly used with a Wi-Fi connection \u2013 were increasingly seen accessing the net via mobile broadband, with just less than 10% of connections coming on the move.In all, the US mobile population grew 19% to 116m users \u2013 compared to around 260m of the total population in the US \u2013 whose use of mobile media is being driven by smartphones.

Expected to cook and clean for their employers at a moment's notice, they also have to pass a test to show they can speak English.But this is now set to change, as the city-state's mandatory examination for maids, which included English language testing, will be scrapped from June 2012 and replaced by a \"settling-in programme\", with modules on stress management, safety awareness and adapting to life and work abroad. It will not offer English language training, nor any classes on cooking or cleaning.One in six Singaporean families hires domestic help, but until now it's often been English that has unified employer with employee. The majority of Singapore's maids hail from its poorer neighbours, notably Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Burma.The exam was introduced in 2005 to improve the calibre of domestic workers coming to Singapore, and has often been cited as a source of stress for new arrivals, many of whom have already paid high recruitment fees to agencies back home in anticipation of a new life.Around 80 maids take the test every day, but failure is common. One Indonesian maid committed suicide last year after failing the test three times, the maximum number of tries allowed.Tan Chuang-Jin of Singapore's manpower ministry said that the new law should offer a more stress-free environment for domestic workers, four out of five of whom are said to face problems adapting to life in Singapore.\"While the entry test was introduced with good intentions \u2026 it is not a meaningful measure of quality and does not guarantee that the worker understands the English language,\" he said.\"It discourages some good foreign domestic workers from wanting to work here, while others spend valuable training time mugging for the test.\"Local employers and agencies have welcomed the news, with the Singaporean Association of Employment Agencies expecting the new law to increase the number of foreign maids applying to work in Singapore up to 25%. Around 3,000 new domestic workers arrive every month.Others, however, are worried that scrapping the law will pose more, rather than fewer, problems.According to Rieke Dyah Pitaloka, of Indonesia's House of Representatives commission, which oversees labour affairs, poor language skills caused 92% of disputes between Singaporean employers and their Indonesian domestic workers between January and July.\"Lax requirements will only cause problems, because [poor skills in] language can lead to poor communication between employers and employees,\" she told the Jakarta Globe.", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Singapore maids to be spared English and cooking test"},{"date": "2011-12-19T12:22:29Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Keeping it Christmassy, that wise man Michael Gove appears to spotted something shiny in the east.

The study, carried out in August and September, gathers data from site access by devices as well as other information gathered by the company.In the UK and US, 6.8% of web browsing comes from non-PC sources. Singapore, which leads the world, has 7.2% of web browsing coming from non-PC devices. In the UK, 67.6% of non-PC web browsing was from mobiles, 24.7% by tablets and 7.7% by other devices such as games consoles and e-readers. In the US the figure was 64.4%, 28.1% and 7.5%.That means in the UK and US about 4% of overall web browsing comes via smartphones and 1.6% from tablets. While small, they also indicate rapid growth in a markets which barely existed four years ago. The iPhone first went on sale in mid-2007, while the first Android phones were not available until the end of 2008. The iPad only became available in the UK in May 2010; since then about 40m iPads have been sold worldwide, with the number of tablets including Android models in use probably at 50m.That compares to an installed base of around 1.5bn PCs worldwide. Estimates for the number of smartphones in use worldwide are between 600m and 800m, depending on replacement speed. The comScore figures might imply at first that tablets are under-represented in web viewing, as the number in use is equivalent to 2.6% of the number of installed PCs. Similarly, there are nearly half as many smartphones as PCs in use.But instead the figures appear to point to the way that people are jumping between devices \u2013 and especially to the way that tablets have begun to be used at the beginning and end of the day instead of a PC.Thus tablet owners use their devices to browse news websites at the start of the day, and then move on to a PC during the working day, and then back to a tablet at the end of the day. Similarly, mobile phones may be used for web browsing through the day when people are away from a PC.The growth of tablet use is borne out by the fact that even as non-PC traffic grew over the past four months, the proportion from tablets rose within it from around 20% to 30%. Meanwhile smartphones were pushed down, as were games consoles and e-readers, even though usage increased.\"While tablets have thus far only penetrated a small percentage of the US population, the potential for this device to break into the mainstream is significant, as more manufacturers offer tablets at varying price points,\" comScore notes. \"Currently, half or more of tablet users report having engaged in activities such as consuming news, viewing entertainment, social networking, and shopping on their devices at least once in the previous month. With more publishers optimising their properties for tablet presentation and developers creating apps specific to tablets, it is likely that tablet owners' engagement with their devices will only continue to grow.\" Overall, comScore says the patterns are indicative of a new, global breed of \"digital omnivores\" who consume internet content across a multitude of devices through the day. In five global markets \u2013 the UK, US, Australia, Japan and Singapore \u2013 more than 5% of internet traffic came from non-PC devices.The increase in Wi-Fi availability in places such as coffee shops and some food outlets is also helping drive that use, with 37.2% of US digital traffic coming from mobile phones using a Wi-Fi connection. Yet tablets \u2013 commonly used with a Wi-Fi connection \u2013 were increasingly seen accessing the net via mobile broadband, with just less than 10% of connections coming on the move.In all, the US mobile population grew 19% to 116m users \u2013 compared to around 260m of the total population in the US \u2013 whose use of mobile media is being driven by smartphones. Of those, half use \"mobile media\" via the web; the others use a mixture of voice and texting.Tablets \u2013 principally the iPad \u2013 are growing rapidly in use, the report found. \"Although tablets have yet to be widely adopted, they already contribute nearly 2% of all US web browsing traffic, driven almost exclusively by the iPad, which currently accounts for more than 97% of all tablet traffic,\" the company said. Apple devices were also used disproportionately to their installed base, said comScore: Apple's iOS runs 43.1% of the smartphones and tablets in use in the US, compared to 34.1% for Android devices and 15.4% for BlackBerry maker RIM.But in browsing, iOS makes up 58.5% of the use, against 31.9% for Android and 5.0% for RIM \u2013 suggesting iOS users browse about 36% more than expected, Android users 6.5% less, and BlackBerry users only one-third as much.US tablet ownership was concentrated among young males, with half being used in households earning $100,000 (\u00a363,000) and above, the research found, though the expectation is that the Amazon Kindle Fire, priced at $199 against the iPad's $399, will broaden tablet adoption.Content availability was also important: half of tablet users had made a purchase via a tablet in the past month, the study found.", "tags": ["Tablet computers", "Smartphones", "iPad", "Apple", "Android", "Google", "Technology"], "title": "Tablets being used more during mornings and evenings"},{"date": "2011-10-10T20:43:35Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Before Monday, Liam Fox had only admitted to meeting Adam Werritty on trips to Sri Lanka and Dubai earlier this year, and then only after much media scrutiny.There had been speculation about meetings in Singapore too. But in the Commons, the defence secretary told MPs that he and Werritty had met abroad on 18 occasions in the last 16 months, and promised that the details would be published after he had finished his statement.The full list emerged after 7pm and gave remarkable details about how Werritty has tracked Fox across the globe as Fox has conducted official business.The 33-year-old was in Singapore in June last year when Fox was giving a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He met him in Abu Dhabi and Dubai days later. The following month they met at the US Central Command base in Tampa, Florida, for an \"informal dinner\" at a steakhouse with General John Allen, who replaced General David Petraeus as head of Nato forces in Afghanistan earlier this summer.Further meetings followed in Bahrain in December last year, in Hong Kong in January this year, and in Israel in February. Fox and Werritty went on a skiing trip together that month in Switzerland. In March, they met in Dubai, and in April he was on holiday with Fox and his wife in Abu Dhabi. In May, they were in Washington together, and shared a flight home to the UK on a private jet, listed as a trip \"on party donor's aircraft to attend the President Obama state visit\".Later that month they met in Washington and Hong Kong, and they were back in Washington again in July.The list shows that Werritty also accompanied Fox and his family during a two-week holiday in Spain in August.Fox asserts that the meetings with Werritty were all private, social functions, and had nothing to do with the business he was undertaking as secretary of state. And he insists Werritty has not financially benefited from these meetings, or his friendship, either. Nonetheless, the MoD list acknowledges that Werritty was present in both a personal and business capacity at a meeting between the UAE government and British military in Dubai last December.Fox did not go into these details in his statement to MPs, saying only that \"as a matter of transparency I would like to inform the house I have met Mr Werritty in a social capacity in the margins of 18 trips overseas, including my annual leave\".In the interim report from the MoD's chief civil servant, Ursula Brennan, she says, with some understatement, that \"the defence secretary's overseas visits are complex, often involving brief stopovers en route from one location to another\". She says that \"maintaining a proper degree of separation (between downtime and official engagements) is necessary for reasons of propriety\".Brennan seems to indicate she is not happy with the way Fox may have blurred the lines, even if accidentally. \"The department needs to ensure that a clear distinction is made between party political, personal and government business to avoid the occurrence of actual or perceived conflicts of interest,\" she says.She also notes the \"potentially grey area\" where personal meetings can stray into government business \u2013 which should not happen without a civil servant present.As part of her ongoing review she has commissioned a trawl for \"email and electronic evidence\" at the MoD on all of Fox's trips abroad, including his holidays, when Werritty is known to have been there. She is trying to establish \"who else was on these trips and who attended which formal and informal events\".In response to a Freedom of Information request, the Guardian discovered last week that Fox had met Werritty at the MoD on 14 occasions in the last 16 months. This provoked the furore about the access he had been given, and the potential for breaches of national security. But it emerged that there were even more visits than those declared under FoI, though no explanation was given about why the initial figures were inaccurate.In her report, Brennan sets out that Werritty \"was present on 22 rather than 14 occasions\", and that she cannot yet exclude the possibility that there may have been more visits. And though Brennan says she feels confident that most of the visits to the MoD were \"largely personal conversations \u2026 and that the department did not provide Mr Werritty with classified papers or briefings\", the sheer number of visits caused surprise across Westminster.Fox has conceded that at least one of the 22 visits, many of which took place in the Pillared Hall coffee bar in defence headquarters, was inappropriate. This involved Fox and Werritty meeting the forthcoming British ambassador to Israel. Brennan says that, \"Dr Fox acknowledges that it was not appropriate for Mr Werritty to have attended such a meeting at the MoD.\" In all, she has found - so far - there were only four occasions out of the 22 when Fox met Werritty with others in attendance.In Fox's statement to the Commons, he said that three of these related to Sri Lanka and one was with someone \"known socially to both of us\" - presumably, the British diplomat.Fox characterised Werritty's visits as \"short social meetings\". Despite having a large staff to support him, and all the security protocols that come with running one of the biggest and most sensitive departments in Whitehall, Brennan hints at the chaotic nature of Fox's engagement diary \u2013 saying that she has still to confirm the times and dates of all the times Werritty entered the building. She has asked for \"security control logs\" to give her a definitive number.When the list of all the meetings they had together was published last night, it emerged that Werritty's first meeting with Fox at the MoD occurred on 20 May \u2013 just after the general election. He met him again on 21 May.It was during one of their MoD meetings in June that Fox told his friend to stop using business cards with the portcullis emblem saying he was one of Fox's advisers, he said.Fox told the Commons he first learned Werritty was using them earlier that month, and at their next meeting, \"told him to stop using his business card stating he was my adviser\". Brennan explains that she raised the issue with Fox on 23 August at a routine meeting, the day she returned to the MoD after her summer break. She had read about the cards in a story published in the Guardian on 19 August.\"Dr Fox confirmed that he had already dealt with the problem and that it was wrong for Mr Werritty to have used such a card,\" she states. Brennan says she checked Fox's claim that he had asked Werritty to stop using the cards two months earlier with one of his special advisers. \"He recalls that immediately after this the defence secretary and the special advisers held a meeting with Mr Werritty at which Dr Fox told [him] that this was unacceptable and he must stop issuing the business cards.\"Answering questions in the Commons, Fox was asked if it was true that the former chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, had warned him about his closeness to Werritty. Fox said he did not recall having that conversation.Fox did not add anything new to his account of his controversial June meeting with Dubai businessman Harvey Boulter, maintaining it was organised after Werritty bumped into Boulter in a restaurant. He insisted that he had never discussed the issue of 3M boss George Buckley's knighthood with Boulter and suggested Boulter was unreliable because he had initially implied that the knighthood was discussed but he later insisted it was not.Ursula Brennan made it clear that Fox's officials had been unaware of the meeting and that she was unhappy about that. In her interim report she said: \"If there is a risk that a personal meeting may stray into government business, the private secretary should ensure that an official be present.\"Fox's insistence that the Boulter meeting was arranged after a chance encounter is undermined by correspondence seen by the Guardian which suggests talks had taken place between Werritty and Boulter about setting up a meeting with Fox as early as March. The June meeting was the second time the defence secretary had met the Dubai businessman. The two men met in Dubai in early April when, by coincidence, Fox was in town and was able to shake the private equity boss's hand.Fox says he did not discuss either commercial or defence matters during private meetings with Werritty. \"He had no access to classified material nor was he briefed on classified matters.\" The defence secretary does acknowledge that at the Dubai meeting on 17 June there was a general discussion about a communications encryption technology called Cellcrypt and how it might work for the MoD. Beyond that, there was \"no discussion of \u2026 any classified information\".Brennan says senior MoD civil servants believe that Werritty's 22-plus visits to the department were largely personal. But since others were present at only four of them she has only Fox's word for it. She says civil servants are confident they did not provide Werritty with classified papers or briefings.Boulter says that the call encryption technology he discussed with Fox in Dubai was sensitive and that he would not have done so if he had known Werritty did not have security clearance. In particular he says he discussed the possibility of providing it for UK troops in Afghanistan which would have been highly sensitive information.Brennan says that during the course of her review she learned that Fox or his office had provided some diary details to Werritty, in connection with visits where Werritty was to be present.

The majority of Singapore's maids hail from its poorer neighbours, notably Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Burma.The exam was introduced in 2005 to improve the calibre of domestic workers coming to Singapore, and has often been cited as a source of stress for new arrivals, many of whom have already paid high recruitment fees to agencies back home in anticipation of a new life.Around 80 maids take the test every day, but failure is common. One Indonesian maid committed suicide last year after failing the test three times, the maximum number of tries allowed.Tan Chuang-Jin of Singapore's manpower ministry said that the new law should offer a more stress-free environment for domestic workers, four out of five of whom are said to face problems adapting to life in Singapore.\"While the entry test was introduced with good intentions \u2026 it is not a meaningful measure of quality and does not guarantee that the worker understands the English language,\" he said.\"It discourages some good foreign domestic workers from wanting to work here, while others spend valuable training time mugging for the test.\"Local employers and agencies have welcomed the news, with the Singaporean Association of Employment Agencies expecting the new law to increase the number of foreign maids applying to work in Singapore up to 25%. Around 3,000 new domestic workers arrive every month.Others, however, are worried that scrapping the law will pose more, rather than fewer, problems.According to Rieke Dyah Pitaloka, of Indonesia's House of Representatives commission, which oversees labour affairs, poor language skills caused 92% of disputes between Singaporean employers and their Indonesian domestic workers between January and July.\"Lax requirements will only cause problems, because [poor skills in] language can lead to poor communication between employers and employees,\" she told the Jakarta Globe.", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Singapore maids to be spared English and cooking test"},{"date": "2011-12-19T12:22:29Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Keeping it Christmassy, that wise man Michael Gove appears to spotted something shiny in the east.

The study, carried out in August and September, gathers data from site access by devices as well as other information gathered by the company.In the UK and US, 6.8% of web browsing comes from non-PC sources. Singapore, which leads the world, has 7.2% of web browsing coming from non-PC devices. In the UK, 67.6% of non-PC web browsing was from mobiles, 24.7% by tablets and 7.7% by other devices such as games consoles and e-readers. In the US the figure was 64.4%, 28.1% and 7.5%.That means in the UK and US about 4% of overall web browsing comes via smartphones and 1.6% from tablets. While small, they also indicate rapid growth in a markets which barely existed four years ago. The iPhone first went on sale in mid-2007, while the first Android phones were not available until the end of 2008. The iPad only became available in the UK in May 2010; since then about 40m iPads have been sold worldwide, with the number of tablets including Android models in use probably at 50m.That compares to an installed base of around 1.5bn PCs worldwide. Estimates for the number of smartphones in use worldwide are between 600m and 800m, depending on replacement speed. The comScore figures might imply at first that tablets are under-represented in web viewing, as the number in use is equivalent to 2.6% of the number of installed PCs. Similarly, there are nearly half as many smartphones as PCs in use.But instead the figures appear to point to the way that people are jumping between devices \u2013 and especially to the way that tablets have begun to be used at the beginning and end of the day instead of a PC.Thus tablet owners use their devices to browse news websites at the start of the day, and then move on to a PC during the working day, and then back to a tablet at the end of the day. Similarly, mobile phones may be used for web browsing through the day when people are away from a PC.The growth of tablet use is borne out by the fact that even as non-PC traffic grew over the past four months, the proportion from tablets rose within it from around 20% to 30%. Meanwhile smartphones were pushed down, as were games consoles and e-readers, even though usage increased.\"While tablets have thus far only penetrated a small percentage of the US population, the potential for this device to break into the mainstream is significant, as more manufacturers offer tablets at varying price points,\" comScore notes. \"Currently, half or more of tablet users report having engaged in activities such as consuming news, viewing entertainment, social networking, and shopping on their devices at least once in the previous month. With more publishers optimising their properties for tablet presentation and developers creating apps specific to tablets, it is likely that tablet owners' engagement with their devices will only continue to grow.\" Overall, comScore says the patterns are indicative of a new, global breed of \"digital omnivores\" who consume internet content across a multitude of devices through the day. In five global markets \u2013 the UK, US, Australia, Japan and Singapore \u2013 more than 5% of internet traffic came from non-PC devices.The increase in Wi-Fi availability in places such as coffee shops and some food outlets is also helping drive that use, with 37.2% of US digital traffic coming from mobile phones using a Wi-Fi connection. Yet tablets \u2013 commonly used with a Wi-Fi connection \u2013 were increasingly seen accessing the net via mobile broadband, with just less than 10% of connections coming on the move.In all, the US mobile population grew 19% to 116m users \u2013 compared to around 260m of the total population in the US \u2013 whose use of mobile media is being driven by smartphones. Of those, half use \"mobile media\" via the web; the others use a mixture of voice and texting.Tablets \u2013 principally the iPad \u2013 are growing rapidly in use, the report found. \"Although tablets have yet to be widely adopted, they already contribute nearly 2% of all US web browsing traffic, driven almost exclusively by the iPad, which currently accounts for more than 97% of all tablet traffic,\" the company said. Apple devices were also used disproportionately to their installed base, said comScore: Apple's iOS runs 43.1% of the smartphones and tablets in use in the US, compared to 34.1% for Android devices and 15.4% for BlackBerry maker RIM.But in browsing, iOS makes up 58.5% of the use, against 31.9% for Android and 5.0% for RIM \u2013 suggesting iOS users browse about 36% more than expected, Android users 6.5% less, and BlackBerry users only one-third as much.US tablet ownership was concentrated among young males, with half being used in households earning $100,000 (\u00a363,000) and above, the research found, though the expectation is that the Amazon Kindle Fire, priced at $199 against the iPad's $399, will broaden tablet adoption.Content availability was also important: half of tablet users had made a purchase via a tablet in the past month, the study found.", "tags": ["Tablet computers", "Smartphones", "iPad", "Apple", "Android", "Google", "Technology"], "title": "Tablets being used more during mornings and evenings"},{"date": "2011-10-10T20:43:35Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Before Monday, Liam Fox had only admitted to meeting Adam Werritty on trips to Sri Lanka and Dubai earlier this year, and then only after much media scrutiny.There had been speculation about meetings in Singapore too. But in the Commons, the defence secretary told MPs that he and Werritty had met abroad on 18 occasions in the last 16 months, and promised that the details would be published after he had finished his statement.The full list emerged after 7pm and gave remarkable details about how Werritty has tracked Fox across the globe as Fox has conducted official business.The 33-year-old was in Singapore in June last year when Fox was giving a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He met him in Abu Dhabi and Dubai days later. The following month they met at the US Central Command base in Tampa, Florida, for an \"informal dinner\" at a steakhouse with General John Allen, who replaced General David Petraeus as head of Nato forces in Afghanistan earlier this summer.Further meetings followed in Bahrain in December last year, in Hong Kong in January this year, and in Israel in February. Fox and Werritty went on a skiing trip together that month in Switzerland. In March, they met in Dubai, and in April he was on holiday with Fox and his wife in Abu Dhabi. In May, they were in Washington together, and shared a flight home to the UK on a private jet, listed as a trip \"on party donor's aircraft to attend the President Obama state visit\".Later that month they met in Washington and Hong Kong, and they were back in Washington again in July.The list shows that Werritty also accompanied Fox and his family during a two-week holiday in Spain in August.Fox asserts that the meetings with Werritty were all private, social functions, and had nothing to do with the business he was undertaking as secretary of state. And he insists Werritty has not financially benefited from these meetings, or his friendship, either. Nonetheless, the MoD list acknowledges that Werritty was present in both a personal and business capacity at a meeting between the UAE government and British military in Dubai last December.Fox did not go into these details in his statement to MPs, saying only that \"as a matter of transparency I would like to inform the house I have met Mr Werritty in a social capacity in the margins of 18 trips overseas, including my annual leave\".In the interim report from the MoD's chief civil servant, Ursula Brennan, she says, with some understatement, that \"the defence secretary's overseas visits are complex, often involving brief stopovers en route from one location to another\". She says that \"maintaining a proper degree of separation (between downtime and official engagements) is necessary for reasons of propriety\".Brennan seems to indicate she is not happy with the way Fox may have blurred the lines, even if accidentally. \"The department needs to ensure that a clear distinction is made between party political, personal and government business to avoid the occurrence of actual or perceived conflicts of interest,\" she says.She also notes the \"potentially grey area\" where personal meetings can stray into government business \u2013 which should not happen without a civil servant present.As part of her ongoing review she has commissioned a trawl for \"email and electronic evidence\" at the MoD on all of Fox's trips abroad, including his holidays, when Werritty is known to have been there. She is trying to establish \"who else was on these trips and who attended which formal and informal events\".In response to a Freedom of Information request, the Guardian discovered last week that Fox had met Werritty at the MoD on 14 occasions in the last 16 months. This provoked the furore about the access he had been given, and the potential for breaches of national security. But it emerged that there were even more visits than those declared under FoI, though no explanation was given about why the initial figures were inaccurate.In her report, Brennan sets out that Werritty \"was present on 22 rather than 14 occasions\", and that she cannot yet exclude the possibility that there may have been more visits. And though Brennan says she feels confident that most of the visits to the MoD were \"largely personal conversations \u2026 and that the department did not provide Mr Werritty with classified papers or briefings\", the sheer number of visits caused surprise across Westminster.Fox has conceded that at least one of the 22 visits, many of which took place in the Pillared Hall coffee bar in defence headquarters, was inappropriate. This involved Fox and Werritty meeting the forthcoming British ambassador to Israel. Brennan says that, \"Dr Fox acknowledges that it was not appropriate for Mr Werritty to have attended such a meeting at the MoD.\" In all, she has found - so far - there were only four occasions out of the 22 when Fox met Werritty with others in attendance.In Fox's statement to the Commons, he said that three of these related to Sri Lanka and one was with someone \"known socially to both of us\" - presumably, the British diplomat.Fox characterised Werritty's visits as \"short social meetings\". Despite having a large staff to support him, and all the security protocols that come with running one of the biggest and most sensitive departments in Whitehall, Brennan hints at the chaotic nature of Fox's engagement diary \u2013 saying that she has still to confirm the times and dates of all the times Werritty entered the building. She has asked for \"security control logs\" to give her a definitive number.When the list of all the meetings they had together was published last night, it emerged that Werritty's first meeting with Fox at the MoD occurred on 20 May \u2013 just after the general election. He met him again on 21 May.It was during one of their MoD meetings in June that Fox told his friend to stop using business cards with the portcullis emblem saying he was one of Fox's advisers, he said.Fox told the Commons he first learned Werritty was using them earlier that month, and at their next meeting, \"told him to stop using his business card stating he was my adviser\". Brennan explains that she raised the issue with Fox on 23 August at a routine meeting, the day she returned to the MoD after her summer break. She had read about the cards in a story published in the Guardian on 19 August.\"Dr Fox confirmed that he had already dealt with the problem and that it was wrong for Mr Werritty to have used such a card,\" she states. Brennan says she checked Fox's claim that he had asked Werritty to stop using the cards two months earlier with one of his special advisers. \"He recalls that immediately after this the defence secretary and the special advisers held a meeting with Mr Werritty at which Dr Fox told [him] that this was unacceptable and he must stop issuing the business cards.\"Answering questions in the Commons, Fox was asked if it was true that the former chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, had warned him about his closeness to Werritty. Fox said he did not recall having that conversation.Fox did not add anything new to his account of his controversial June meeting with Dubai businessman Harvey Boulter, maintaining it was organised after Werritty bumped into Boulter in a restaurant. He insisted that he had never discussed the issue of 3M boss George Buckley's knighthood with Boulter and suggested Boulter was unreliable because he had initially implied that the knighthood was discussed but he later insisted it was not.Ursula Brennan made it clear that Fox's officials had been unaware of the meeting and that she was unhappy about that. In her interim report she said: \"If there is a risk that a personal meeting may stray into government business, the private secretary should ensure that an official be present.\"Fox's insistence that the Boulter meeting was arranged after a chance encounter is undermined by correspondence seen by the Guardian which suggests talks had taken place between Werritty and Boulter about setting up a meeting with Fox as early as March. The June meeting was the second time the defence secretary had met the Dubai businessman. The two men met in Dubai in early April when, by coincidence, Fox was in town and was able to shake the private equity boss's hand.Fox says he did not discuss either commercial or defence matters during private meetings with Werritty. \"He had no access to classified material nor was he briefed on classified matters.\" The defence secretary does acknowledge that at the Dubai meeting on 17 June there was a general discussion about a communications encryption technology called Cellcrypt and how it might work for the MoD. Beyond that, there was \"no discussion of \u2026 any classified information\".Brennan says senior MoD civil servants believe that Werritty's 22-plus visits to the department were largely personal. But since others were present at only four of them she has only Fox's word for it. She says civil servants are confident they did not provide Werritty with classified papers or briefings.Boulter says that the call encryption technology he discussed with Fox in Dubai was sensitive and that he would not have done so if he had known Werritty did not have security clearance. In particular he says he discussed the possibility of providing it for UK troops in Afghanistan which would have been highly sensitive information.Brennan says that during the course of her review she learned that Fox or his office had provided some diary details to Werritty, in connection with visits where Werritty was to be present. She said: \"Dr Fox has accepted that it is not appropriate to ask officials to provide ministerial diary information to a third party.\"Questioned about providing diary details to a friend Fox was unapologetic. He claimed it was reasonable for ministers to let friends and family know of their movements in order to make arrangements to meet up socially. He does promise to stop meeting Werritty socially when abroad on official\u00a0business.", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "Adam Werritty", "Conservatives", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "title": "Not just Dubai: Liam Fox met Adam Werritty 18 times around the world"},{"date": "2011-12-08T15:35:21Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Dating back to 1975, the original congestion charge scheme started as a cumbersome, manual system of colour-coded paper licences that motorists had to buy and display at police checkpoints to enter a restricted zone. In 1995 it went electronic, with smart cards in cars registered by overhead gantries. The government has long stressed that the purpose is purely traffic management, with entry to the zone typically costing one or two Singapore dollars (50p-\u00a31) \u2013 nominal for a country where high road taxes and certificates make car ownership very expensive.With a national population half that of London, Norway seems an unlikely place for congestion charging. But its two largest cities, Oslo and Bergen, introduced tolls for ring roads in the 1980s, explicitly as a money-raising exercise. Public opposition gave way to grudging acceptance, with the development of an automated system and low operating costs and a political commitment that revenue was entirely devoted to roadbuilding and improvements.Ken Livingstone's brainchild, the congestion charge went live in February 2003. Bus use went up significantly, and road safety and journey times improved. Public opinion, which had been marginally against introducing the charge, quickly swung round substantially in favour. However, the 2007 western extension into plusher residential districts proved unpopular and was scrapped after Boris Johnson took over as mayor.Trials in the Swedish capital in 2006 had dramatic results, cutting traffic by 20-30%, and in 2007 a referendum approved making the scheme permanent. Drivers pay a modest 10-20 krona (95p-\u00a31.90) depending on times of day to enter or leave the capital on weekdays, and evenings and weekends are free. A similar electronic cordon is now planned for Gothenburg from 2013.New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, was keen to implement a scheme along the lines of London's. In 2007 his proposal for a weekday charge for vehicles south of 86th Street in Manhattan garnered surprisingly positive press and public backing. The city council voted in favour, but plans were blocked by the state assembly and eventually dropped. Although toll roads are widespread, no city congestion charge yet exists in the US, although San Francisco looks the most likely with pilots pencilled in for 2015.", "tags": ["Road transport", "World news", "Congestion charging"], "title": "Congestion charges around the world"},{"date": "2011-12-07T07:40:24Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "BlackBerry-maker RIM is having no luck of late.

It has passages on how couples should physically and spiritually approach sex, and claims that most women only satisfy 10% of their husbands' sexual needs.Club leaders, who argue that a wife should serve as a \"good sex worker\" and a \"whore\" to her husband, showed the book to journalists last month in an effort to dispel what they called misconceptions that it was obscene and demeaning to women.They said the book, which contains no explicit photographs, was intended to be a spiritual guide read exclusively by club members to help them better understand sex.Many Malaysians have denounced the club, saying it makes a mockery of modern gender roles in a country where women hold prominent posts in both the government and the private sector.A spokesman for the home ministry said the government's Islamic affairs department had studied the manual and recommended a ban on the grounds that it may confuse Malaysian Muslims about what constitutes acceptable religious teaching.People caught in possession of it could be fined up to 5,000 ringgit (\u00a3995), the spokesman said, and anyone who makes copies for sale could be imprisoned for three years and fined 20,000 ringgit.Representatives of the club did not respond to calls made to them on Thursday. The club is believed to have at least 800 members in Malaysia and has branches in Indonesia, Singapore, Jordan and Britain. Many members are in polygamous marriages, insisting the practice helps husbands to avoid committing adultery.The club's international vice-president, Rohaya Mohamad, explained the club's provocative pronouncements in an interview with a Malaysian paper earlier this year. \"Eve was created because Adam had needs,\" she told the Star. \"Men have [sexual] needs which they can't control. And if the needs are not fulfilled, men will find another woman. God created them like that.\"Her comments have been echoed by Darlan Zaini, co-founder of the Singapore club, who said: \"In Islam, if the husband wants sex and the wife is not in the mood, she has to give in to him.

Labour says that the government's expert panel has been sent back to the drawing board for failing to reflect Gove's \"ideological creed\".\u2022 Gove's ideological creed may allow private schools who want to become state academies to go on picking their pupils by ability, according to Daniel Boffey in the Observer. He reveals that:He quotes Roskilly as saying:\u2022 Oxford has accepted 32 black students for undergraduate study this year, the highest number in 10 years, the university has disclosed. The acceptance rate for black students among this year's intake was 14%, an improvement on last year's admissions round, when 8.8% of black applicants were successful compared with 24.1% of white applicants.\u2022 The Open University student association is strongly resisting the fees increase and has launched an e-petition to ask the government to rethink its proposals for higher education. It says:Great headteachers inspire more than they direct: Does education policy put too much faith in the dated concept of directive leadership when the commercial world has dumped it?\u2022 NUT leader Christine Blower says a deal is close with the government on teachers' pensions on a key day of negotiations, the BBC reports.

Growing numbers of students applying to university face checks on their school and family background as part of a drive to \"break the middle-class monopoly\" on places.\u2022 History is being banished from classrooms in some parts of the country, the Telegraph claims. More than 150 comprehensives failed to enter a single pupil in GCSE history exams last year, according to a report produced by Tory MP Chris Skidmore.\u2022 The Independent reported at the weekend that thousands of trainee teachers had to re-sit basic literacy and numeracy tests last year, with one candidate taking a literacy paper 36 times.\u2022 Debbie McVitty on wonke.com (@wonke) spares a thought for the \"poor neglected postgraduate student.\u2022 In the mood for watching a school being blown up?

The study, carried out in August and September, gathers data from site access by devices as well as other information gathered by the company.In the UK and US, 6.8% of web browsing comes from non-PC sources. Singapore, which leads the world, has 7.2% of web browsing coming from non-PC devices. In the UK, 67.6% of non-PC web browsing was from mobiles, 24.7% by tablets and 7.7% by other devices such as games consoles and e-readers. In the US the figure was 64.4%, 28.1% and 7.5%.That means in the UK and US about 4% of overall web browsing comes via smartphones and 1.6% from tablets. While small, they also indicate rapid growth in a markets which barely existed four years ago. The iPhone first went on sale in mid-2007, while the first Android phones were not available until the end of 2008. The iPad only became available in the UK in May 2010; since then about 40m iPads have been sold worldwide, with the number of tablets including Android models in use probably at 50m.That compares to an installed base of around 1.5bn PCs worldwide. Estimates for the number of smartphones in use worldwide are between 600m and 800m, depending on replacement speed. The comScore figures might imply at first that tablets are under-represented in web viewing, as the number in use is equivalent to 2.6% of the number of installed PCs. Similarly, there are nearly half as many smartphones as PCs in use.But instead the figures appear to point to the way that people are jumping between devices \u2013 and especially to the way that tablets have begun to be used at the beginning and end of the day instead of a PC.Thus tablet owners use their devices to browse news websites at the start of the day, and then move on to a PC during the working day, and then back to a tablet at the end of the day. Similarly, mobile phones may be used for web browsing through the day when people are away from a PC.The growth of tablet use is borne out by the fact that even as non-PC traffic grew over the past four months, the proportion from tablets rose within it from around 20% to 30%. Meanwhile smartphones were pushed down, as were games consoles and e-readers, even though usage increased.\"While tablets have thus far only penetrated a small percentage of the US population, the potential for this device to break into the mainstream is significant, as more manufacturers offer tablets at varying price points,\" comScore notes. \"Currently, half or more of tablet users report having engaged in activities such as consuming news, viewing entertainment, social networking, and shopping on their devices at least once in the previous month. With more publishers optimising their properties for tablet presentation and developers creating apps specific to tablets, it is likely that tablet owners' engagement with their devices will only continue to grow.\" Overall, comScore says the patterns are indicative of a new, global breed of \"digital omnivores\" who consume internet content across a multitude of devices through the day. In five global markets \u2013 the UK, US, Australia, Japan and Singapore \u2013 more than 5% of internet traffic came from non-PC devices.The increase in Wi-Fi availability in places such as coffee shops and some food outlets is also helping drive that use, with 37.2% of US digital traffic coming from mobile phones using a Wi-Fi connection. Yet tablets \u2013 commonly used with a Wi-Fi connection \u2013 were increasingly seen accessing the net via mobile broadband, with just less than 10% of connections coming on the move.In all, the US mobile population grew 19% to 116m users \u2013 compared to around 260m of the total population in the US \u2013 whose use of mobile media is being driven by smartphones. Of those, half use \"mobile media\" via the web; the others use a mixture of voice and texting.Tablets \u2013 principally the iPad \u2013 are growing rapidly in use, the report found. \"Although tablets have yet to be widely adopted, they already contribute nearly 2% of all US web browsing traffic, driven almost exclusively by the iPad, which currently accounts for more than 97% of all tablet traffic,\" the company said. Apple devices were also used disproportionately to their installed base, said comScore: Apple's iOS runs 43.1% of the smartphones and tablets in use in the US, compared to 34.1% for Android devices and 15.4% for BlackBerry maker RIM.But in browsing, iOS makes up 58.5% of the use, against 31.9% for Android and 5.0% for RIM \u2013 suggesting iOS users browse about 36% more than expected, Android users 6.5% less, and BlackBerry users only one-third as much.US tablet ownership was concentrated among young males, with half being used in households earning $100,000 (\u00a363,000) and above, the research found, though the expectation is that the Amazon Kindle Fire, priced at $199 against the iPad's $399, will broaden tablet adoption.Content availability was also important: half of tablet users had made a purchase via a tablet in the past month, the study found.", "tags": ["Tablet computers", "Smartphones", "iPad", "Apple", "Android", "Google", "Technology"], "title": "Tablets being used more during mornings and evenings"},{"date": "2011-10-10T20:43:35Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Before Monday, Liam Fox had only admitted to meeting Adam Werritty on trips to Sri Lanka and Dubai earlier this year, and then only after much media scrutiny.There had been speculation about meetings in Singapore too. But in the Commons, the defence secretary told MPs that he and Werritty had met abroad on 18 occasions in the last 16 months, and promised that the details would be published after he had finished his statement.The full list emerged after 7pm and gave remarkable details about how Werritty has tracked Fox across the globe as Fox has conducted official business.The 33-year-old was in Singapore in June last year when Fox was giving a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He met him in Abu Dhabi and Dubai days later. The following month they met at the US Central Command base in Tampa, Florida, for an \"informal dinner\" at a steakhouse with General John Allen, who replaced General David Petraeus as head of Nato forces in Afghanistan earlier this summer.Further meetings followed in Bahrain in December last year, in Hong Kong in January this year, and in Israel in February. Fox and Werritty went on a skiing trip together that month in Switzerland. In March, they met in Dubai, and in April he was on holiday with Fox and his wife in Abu Dhabi. In May, they were in Washington together, and shared a flight home to the UK on a private jet, listed as a trip \"on party donor's aircraft to attend the President Obama state visit\".Later that month they met in Washington and Hong Kong, and they were back in Washington again in July.The list shows that Werritty also accompanied Fox and his family during a two-week holiday in Spain in August.Fox asserts that the meetings with Werritty were all private, social functions, and had nothing to do with the business he was undertaking as secretary of state. And he insists Werritty has not financially benefited from these meetings, or his friendship, either. Nonetheless, the MoD list acknowledges that Werritty was present in both a personal and business capacity at a meeting between the UAE government and British military in Dubai last December.Fox did not go into these details in his statement to MPs, saying only that \"as a matter of transparency I would like to inform the house I have met Mr Werritty in a social capacity in the margins of 18 trips overseas, including my annual leave\".In the interim report from the MoD's chief civil servant, Ursula Brennan, she says, with some understatement, that \"the defence secretary's overseas visits are complex, often involving brief stopovers en route from one location to another\". She says that \"maintaining a proper degree of separation (between downtime and official engagements) is necessary for reasons of propriety\".Brennan seems to indicate she is not happy with the way Fox may have blurred the lines, even if accidentally. \"The department needs to ensure that a clear distinction is made between party political, personal and government business to avoid the occurrence of actual or perceived conflicts of interest,\" she says.She also notes the \"potentially grey area\" where personal meetings can stray into government business \u2013 which should not happen without a civil servant present.As part of her ongoing review she has commissioned a trawl for \"email and electronic evidence\" at the MoD on all of Fox's trips abroad, including his holidays, when Werritty is known to have been there. She is trying to establish \"who else was on these trips and who attended which formal and informal events\".In response to a Freedom of Information request, the Guardian discovered last week that Fox had met Werritty at the MoD on 14 occasions in the last 16 months. This provoked the furore about the access he had been given, and the potential for breaches of national security. But it emerged that there were even more visits than those declared under FoI, though no explanation was given about why the initial figures were inaccurate.In her report, Brennan sets out that Werritty \"was present on 22 rather than 14 occasions\", and that she cannot yet exclude the possibility that there may have been more visits. And though Brennan says she feels confident that most of the visits to the MoD were \"largely personal conversations \u2026 and that the department did not provide Mr Werritty with classified papers or briefings\", the sheer number of visits caused surprise across Westminster.Fox has conceded that at least one of the 22 visits, many of which took place in the Pillared Hall coffee bar in defence headquarters, was inappropriate. This involved Fox and Werritty meeting the forthcoming British ambassador to Israel. Brennan says that, \"Dr Fox acknowledges that it was not appropriate for Mr Werritty to have attended such a meeting at the MoD.\" In all, she has found - so far - there were only four occasions out of the 22 when Fox met Werritty with others in attendance.In Fox's statement to the Commons, he said that three of these related to Sri Lanka and one was with someone \"known socially to both of us\" - presumably, the British diplomat.Fox characterised Werritty's visits as \"short social meetings\". Despite having a large staff to support him, and all the security protocols that come with running one of the biggest and most sensitive departments in Whitehall, Brennan hints at the chaotic nature of Fox's engagement diary \u2013 saying that she has still to confirm the times and dates of all the times Werritty entered the building. She has asked for \"security control logs\" to give her a definitive number.When the list of all the meetings they had together was published last night, it emerged that Werritty's first meeting with Fox at the MoD occurred on 20 May \u2013 just after the general election. He met him again on 21 May.It was during one of their MoD meetings in June that Fox told his friend to stop using business cards with the portcullis emblem saying he was one of Fox's advisers, he said.Fox told the Commons he first learned Werritty was using them earlier that month, and at their next meeting, \"told him to stop using his business card stating he was my adviser\". Brennan explains that she raised the issue with Fox on 23 August at a routine meeting, the day she returned to the MoD after her summer break. She had read about the cards in a story published in the Guardian on 19 August.\"Dr Fox confirmed that he had already dealt with the problem and that it was wrong for Mr Werritty to have used such a card,\" she states. Brennan says she checked Fox's claim that he had asked Werritty to stop using the cards two months earlier with one of his special advisers. \"He recalls that immediately after this the defence secretary and the special advisers held a meeting with Mr Werritty at which Dr Fox told [him] that this was unacceptable and he must stop issuing the business cards.\"Answering questions in the Commons, Fox was asked if it was true that the former chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, had warned him about his closeness to Werritty. Fox said he did not recall having that conversation.Fox did not add anything new to his account of his controversial June meeting with Dubai businessman Harvey Boulter, maintaining it was organised after Werritty bumped into Boulter in a restaurant. He insisted that he had never discussed the issue of 3M boss George Buckley's knighthood with Boulter and suggested Boulter was unreliable because he had initially implied that the knighthood was discussed but he later insisted it was not.Ursula Brennan made it clear that Fox's officials had been unaware of the meeting and that she was unhappy about that. In her interim report she said: \"If there is a risk that a personal meeting may stray into government business, the private secretary should ensure that an official be present.\"Fox's insistence that the Boulter meeting was arranged after a chance encounter is undermined by correspondence seen by the Guardian which suggests talks had taken place between Werritty and Boulter about setting up a meeting with Fox as early as March. The June meeting was the second time the defence secretary had met the Dubai businessman. The two men met in Dubai in early April when, by coincidence, Fox was in town and was able to shake the private equity boss's hand.Fox says he did not discuss either commercial or defence matters during private meetings with Werritty. \"He had no access to classified material nor was he briefed on classified matters.\" The defence secretary does acknowledge that at the Dubai meeting on 17 June there was a general discussion about a communications encryption technology called Cellcrypt and how it might work for the MoD. Beyond that, there was \"no discussion of \u2026 any classified information\".Brennan says senior MoD civil servants believe that Werritty's 22-plus visits to the department were largely personal. But since others were present at only four of them she has only Fox's word for it. She says civil servants are confident they did not provide Werritty with classified papers or briefings.Boulter says that the call encryption technology he discussed with Fox in Dubai was sensitive and that he would not have done so if he had known Werritty did not have security clearance. In particular he says he discussed the possibility of providing it for UK troops in Afghanistan which would have been highly sensitive information.Brennan says that during the course of her review she learned that Fox or his office had provided some diary details to Werritty, in connection with visits where Werritty was to be present. She said: \"Dr Fox has accepted that it is not appropriate to ask officials to provide ministerial diary information to a third party.\"Questioned about providing diary details to a friend Fox was unapologetic. He claimed it was reasonable for ministers to let friends and family know of their movements in order to make arrangements to meet up socially. He does promise to stop meeting Werritty socially when abroad on official\u00a0business.", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "Adam Werritty", "Conservatives", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "title": "Not just Dubai: Liam Fox met Adam Werritty 18 times around the world"},{"date": "2011-12-08T15:35:21Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Dating back to 1975, the original congestion charge scheme started as a cumbersome, manual system of colour-coded paper licences that motorists had to buy and display at police checkpoints to enter a restricted zone. In 1995 it went electronic, with smart cards in cars registered by overhead gantries. The government has long stressed that the purpose is purely traffic management, with entry to the zone typically costing one or two Singapore dollars (50p-\u00a31) \u2013 nominal for a country where high road taxes and certificates make car ownership very expensive.With a national population half that of London, Norway seems an unlikely place for congestion charging. But its two largest cities, Oslo and Bergen, introduced tolls for ring roads in the 1980s, explicitly as a money-raising exercise. Public opposition gave way to grudging acceptance, with the development of an automated system and low operating costs and a political commitment that revenue was entirely devoted to roadbuilding and improvements.Ken Livingstone's brainchild, the congestion charge went live in February 2003. Bus use went up significantly, and road safety and journey times improved. Public opinion, which had been marginally against introducing the charge, quickly swung round substantially in favour. However, the 2007 western extension into plusher residential districts proved unpopular and was scrapped after Boris Johnson took over as mayor.Trials in the Swedish capital in 2006 had dramatic results, cutting traffic by 20-30%, and in 2007 a referendum approved making the scheme permanent. Drivers pay a modest 10-20 krona (95p-\u00a31.90) depending on times of day to enter or leave the capital on weekdays, and evenings and weekends are free. A similar electronic cordon is now planned for Gothenburg from 2013.New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, was keen to implement a scheme along the lines of London's. In 2007 his proposal for a weekday charge for vehicles south of 86th Street in Manhattan garnered surprisingly positive press and public backing. The city council voted in favour, but plans were blocked by the state assembly and eventually dropped. Although toll roads are widespread, no city congestion charge yet exists in the US, although San Francisco looks the most likely with pilots pencilled in for 2015.", "tags": ["Road transport", "World news", "Congestion charging"], "title": "Congestion charges around the world"},{"date": "2011-12-07T07:40:24Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "BlackBerry-maker RIM is having no luck of late. After announcing a huge write-off on its PlayBook tablet, seeing an executive in its Indonesia operation charged following a stampede at a new device launch, and firing two executives who caused a plane to be diverted, it has seen the \"BBX\" name it planned to use for software on phones to be released in 2012 injuncted.Software company Basis International said a US federal court in Albuquerque has granted a temporary restraining order against RIM, barring it from using Basis' BBX trademark.The court decision bars RIM from using the trademark at its Asian DevCon conference on Wednesday and Thursday in Singapore.However, late on Tuesday, RIM appeared to backtrack on using the trademark.\"RIM doesn't typically comment on pending litigation, however RIM has already unveiled a new brand name for its next generation mobile platform.

It has passages on how couples should physically and spiritually approach sex, and claims that most women only satisfy 10% of their husbands' sexual needs.Club leaders, who argue that a wife should serve as a \"good sex worker\" and a \"whore\" to her husband, showed the book to journalists last month in an effort to dispel what they called misconceptions that it was obscene and demeaning to women.They said the book, which contains no explicit photographs, was intended to be a spiritual guide read exclusively by club members to help them better understand sex.Many Malaysians have denounced the club, saying it makes a mockery of modern gender roles in a country where women hold prominent posts in both the government and the private sector.A spokesman for the home ministry said the government's Islamic affairs department had studied the manual and recommended a ban on the grounds that it may confuse Malaysian Muslims about what constitutes acceptable religious teaching.People caught in possession of it could be fined up to 5,000 ringgit (\u00a3995), the spokesman said, and anyone who makes copies for sale could be imprisoned for three years and fined 20,000 ringgit.Representatives of the club did not respond to calls made to them on Thursday. The club is believed to have at least 800 members in Malaysia and has branches in Indonesia, Singapore, Jordan and Britain. Many members are in polygamous marriages, insisting the practice helps husbands to avoid committing adultery.The club's international vice-president, Rohaya Mohamad, explained the club's provocative pronouncements in an interview with a Malaysian paper earlier this year. \"Eve was created because Adam had needs,\" she told the Star. \"Men have [sexual] needs which they can't control. And if the needs are not fulfilled, men will find another woman. God created them like that.\"Her comments have been echoed by Darlan Zaini, co-founder of the Singapore club, who said: \"In Islam, if the husband wants sex and the wife is not in the mood, she has to give in to him.

O'Neill's MPs have continued to pass legislation recognising him as leader.The battle escalated when MPs backing O'Neill stormed the governor general's gates a day after the supreme court ruling that Somare's removal and O'Neill's election by parliament in August was unconstitutional. \"We are unarmed and we're the legitimate government,\" the Australian Broadcasting Corporation quoted the MPs as telling police.Somare said on Wednesday that his cabinet had been sworn in by Ogio, who represents PNG's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II.Somare insisted he did not need to be sworn in himself because the supreme court had already reinstated him as prime minister. \"It is regretful that all of government was put on hold but this situation has been diffused by the swearing-in today of my cabinet,\" Somare said.The crisis continued on Wednesday, with MPs loyal to O'Neill passing a motion ordering Ogio to swear in O'Neill as prime minister. O'Neill could not be reached for comment but on Tuesday he said he had met with Ogio briefly after the march to the official residence in the capital, Port Moresby.The supreme court's 3-2 decision on Monday that ruled O'Neill's election unconstitutional came after O'Neill's government passed a series of retroactive laws legalising its decision to dump Somare from office while he was in Singapore recovering from a heart condition.One of Somare's first acts when the supreme court ordered his return to power was to reinstate the former police commissioner Fred Yakasa and oust O'Neill's appointee, Tom Kulunga. Both police chiefs were present at the governor general's home and held discussions with MPs loyal to O'Neill.Somare has based himself at the Ela Beach Hotel, where he has set up a cabinet made up mostly of ministers from his previous government.Somare had been in Singapore for five months between late March and 6 September, when he returned to parliament after three heart operations.Kevin Rudd, the foreign minister in neighbouring Australia, said the former Australian territory had entered uncharted waters.", "tags": ["Papua New Guinea", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "Monarchy", "The Queen", "World news"], "title": "Papua New Guinea in crisis as two claim to be prime minister"},{"date": "2011-12-06T17:46:59Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Singapore's vast army of maids doesn't have it easy. Expected to cook and clean for their employers at a moment's notice, they also have to pass a test to show they can speak English.But this is now set to change, as the city-state's mandatory examination for maids, which included English language testing, will be scrapped from June 2012 and replaced by a \"settling-in programme\", with modules on stress management, safety awareness and adapting to life and work abroad. It will not offer English language training, nor any classes on cooking or cleaning.One in six Singaporean families hires domestic help, but until now it's often been English that has unified employer with employee. The majority of Singapore's maids hail from its poorer neighbours, notably Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Burma.The exam was introduced in 2005 to improve the calibre of domestic workers coming to Singapore, and has often been cited as a source of stress for new arrivals, many of whom have already paid high recruitment fees to agencies back home in anticipation of a new life.Around 80 maids take the test every day, but failure is common. One Indonesian maid committed suicide last year after failing the test three times, the maximum number of tries allowed.Tan Chuang-Jin of Singapore's manpower ministry said that the new law should offer a more stress-free environment for domestic workers, four out of five of whom are said to face problems adapting to life in Singapore.\"While the entry test was introduced with good intentions \u2026 it is not a meaningful measure of quality and does not guarantee that the worker understands the English language,\" he said.\"It discourages some good foreign domestic workers from wanting to work here, while others spend valuable training time mugging for the test.\"Local employers and agencies have welcomed the news, with the Singaporean Association of Employment Agencies expecting the new law to increase the number of foreign maids applying to work in Singapore up to 25%. Around 3,000 new domestic workers arrive every month.Others, however, are worried that scrapping the law will pose more, rather than fewer, problems.According to Rieke Dyah Pitaloka, of Indonesia's House of Representatives commission, which oversees labour affairs, poor language skills caused 92% of disputes between Singaporean employers and their Indonesian domestic workers between January and July.\"Lax requirements will only cause problems, because [poor skills in] language can lead to poor communication between employers and employees,\" she told the Jakarta Globe.", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Singapore maids to be spared English and cooking test"},{"date": "2011-12-19T12:22:29Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Keeping it Christmassy, that wise man Michael Gove appears to spotted something shiny in the east.

The study, carried out in August and September, gathers data from site access by devices as well as other information gathered by the company.In the UK and US, 6.8% of web browsing comes from non-PC sources. Singapore, which leads the world, has 7.2% of web browsing coming from non-PC devices. In the UK, 67.6% of non-PC web browsing was from mobiles, 24.7% by tablets and 7.7% by other devices such as games consoles and e-readers. In the US the figure was 64.4%, 28.1% and 7.5%.That means in the UK and US about 4% of overall web browsing comes via smartphones and 1.6% from tablets. While small, they also indicate rapid growth in a markets which barely existed four years ago. The iPhone first went on sale in mid-2007, while the first Android phones were not available until the end of 2008. The iPad only became available in the UK in May 2010; since then about 40m iPads have been sold worldwide, with the number of tablets including Android models in use probably at 50m.That compares to an installed base of around 1.5bn PCs worldwide. Estimates for the number of smartphones in use worldwide are between 600m and 800m, depending on replacement speed. The comScore figures might imply at first that tablets are under-represented in web viewing, as the number in use is equivalent to 2.6% of the number of installed PCs. Similarly, there are nearly half as many smartphones as PCs in use.But instead the figures appear to point to the way that people are jumping between devices \u2013 and especially to the way that tablets have begun to be used at the beginning and end of the day instead of a PC.Thus tablet owners use their devices to browse news websites at the start of the day, and then move on to a PC during the working day, and then back to a tablet at the end of the day. Similarly, mobile phones may be used for web browsing through the day when people are away from a PC.The growth of tablet use is borne out by the fact that even as non-PC traffic grew over the past four months, the proportion from tablets rose within it from around 20% to 30%. Meanwhile smartphones were pushed down, as were games consoles and e-readers, even though usage increased.\"While tablets have thus far only penetrated a small percentage of the US population, the potential for this device to break into the mainstream is significant, as more manufacturers offer tablets at varying price points,\" comScore notes. \"Currently, half or more of tablet users report having engaged in activities such as consuming news, viewing entertainment, social networking, and shopping on their devices at least once in the previous month. With more publishers optimising their properties for tablet presentation and developers creating apps specific to tablets, it is likely that tablet owners' engagement with their devices will only continue to grow.\" Overall, comScore says the patterns are indicative of a new, global breed of \"digital omnivores\" who consume internet content across a multitude of devices through the day. In five global markets \u2013 the UK, US, Australia, Japan and Singapore \u2013 more than 5% of internet traffic came from non-PC devices.The increase in Wi-Fi availability in places such as coffee shops and some food outlets is also helping drive that use, with 37.2% of US digital traffic coming from mobile phones using a Wi-Fi connection. Yet tablets \u2013 commonly used with a Wi-Fi connection \u2013 were increasingly seen accessing the net via mobile broadband, with just less than 10% of connections coming on the move.In all, the US mobile population grew 19% to 116m users \u2013 compared to around 260m of the total population in the US \u2013 whose use of mobile media is being driven by smartphones. Of those, half use \"mobile media\" via the web; the others use a mixture of voice and texting.Tablets \u2013 principally the iPad \u2013 are growing rapidly in use, the report found. \"Although tablets have yet to be widely adopted, they already contribute nearly 2% of all US web browsing traffic, driven almost exclusively by the iPad, which currently accounts for more than 97% of all tablet traffic,\" the company said. Apple devices were also used disproportionately to their installed base, said comScore: Apple's iOS runs 43.1% of the smartphones and tablets in use in the US, compared to 34.1% for Android devices and 15.4% for BlackBerry maker RIM.But in browsing, iOS makes up 58.5% of the use, against 31.9% for Android and 5.0% for RIM \u2013 suggesting iOS users browse about 36% more than expected, Android users 6.5% less, and BlackBerry users only one-third as much.US tablet ownership was concentrated among young males, with half being used in households earning $100,000 (\u00a363,000) and above, the research found, though the expectation is that the Amazon Kindle Fire, priced at $199 against the iPad's $399, will broaden tablet adoption.Content availability was also important: half of tablet users had made a purchase via a tablet in the past month, the study found.", "tags": ["Tablet computers", "Smartphones", "iPad", "Apple", "Android", "Google", "Technology"], "title": "Tablets being used more during mornings and evenings"},{"date": "2011-10-10T20:43:35Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Before Monday, Liam Fox had only admitted to meeting Adam Werritty on trips to Sri Lanka and Dubai earlier this year, and then only after much media scrutiny.There had been speculation about meetings in Singapore too. But in the Commons, the defence secretary told MPs that he and Werritty had met abroad on 18 occasions in the last 16 months, and promised that the details would be published after he had finished his statement.The full list emerged after 7pm and gave remarkable details about how Werritty has tracked Fox across the globe as Fox has conducted official business.The 33-year-old was in Singapore in June last year when Fox was giving a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. He met him in Abu Dhabi and Dubai days later. The following month they met at the US Central Command base in Tampa, Florida, for an \"informal dinner\" at a steakhouse with General John Allen, who replaced General David Petraeus as head of Nato forces in Afghanistan earlier this summer.Further meetings followed in Bahrain in December last year, in Hong Kong in January this year, and in Israel in February. Fox and Werritty went on a skiing trip together that month in Switzerland. In March, they met in Dubai, and in April he was on holiday with Fox and his wife in Abu Dhabi. In May, they were in Washington together, and shared a flight home to the UK on a private jet, listed as a trip \"on party donor's aircraft to attend the President Obama state visit\".Later that month they met in Washington and Hong Kong, and they were back in Washington again in July.The list shows that Werritty also accompanied Fox and his family during a two-week holiday in Spain in August.Fox asserts that the meetings with Werritty were all private, social functions, and had nothing to do with the business he was undertaking as secretary of state. And he insists Werritty has not financially benefited from these meetings, or his friendship, either. Nonetheless, the MoD list acknowledges that Werritty was present in both a personal and business capacity at a meeting between the UAE government and British military in Dubai last December.Fox did not go into these details in his statement to MPs, saying only that \"as a matter of transparency I would like to inform the house I have met Mr Werritty in a social capacity in the margins of 18 trips overseas, including my annual leave\".In the interim report from the MoD's chief civil servant, Ursula Brennan, she says, with some understatement, that \"the defence secretary's overseas visits are complex, often involving brief stopovers en route from one location to another\". She says that \"maintaining a proper degree of separation (between downtime and official engagements) is necessary for reasons of propriety\".Brennan seems to indicate she is not happy with the way Fox may have blurred the lines, even if accidentally. \"The department needs to ensure that a clear distinction is made between party political, personal and government business to avoid the occurrence of actual or perceived conflicts of interest,\" she says.She also notes the \"potentially grey area\" where personal meetings can stray into government business \u2013 which should not happen without a civil servant present.As part of her ongoing review she has commissioned a trawl for \"email and electronic evidence\" at the MoD on all of Fox's trips abroad, including his holidays, when Werritty is known to have been there. She is trying to establish \"who else was on these trips and who attended which formal and informal events\".In response to a Freedom of Information request, the Guardian discovered last week that Fox had met Werritty at the MoD on 14 occasions in the last 16 months. This provoked the furore about the access he had been given, and the potential for breaches of national security. But it emerged that there were even more visits than those declared under FoI, though no explanation was given about why the initial figures were inaccurate.In her report, Brennan sets out that Werritty \"was present on 22 rather than 14 occasions\", and that she cannot yet exclude the possibility that there may have been more visits. And though Brennan says she feels confident that most of the visits to the MoD were \"largely personal conversations \u2026 and that the department did not provide Mr Werritty with classified papers or briefings\", the sheer number of visits caused surprise across Westminster.Fox has conceded that at least one of the 22 visits, many of which took place in the Pillared Hall coffee bar in defence headquarters, was inappropriate. This involved Fox and Werritty meeting the forthcoming British ambassador to Israel. Brennan says that, \"Dr Fox acknowledges that it was not appropriate for Mr Werritty to have attended such a meeting at the MoD.\" In all, she has found - so far - there were only four occasions out of the 22 when Fox met Werritty with others in attendance.In Fox's statement to the Commons, he said that three of these related to Sri Lanka and one was with someone \"known socially to both of us\" - presumably, the British diplomat.Fox characterised Werritty's visits as \"short social meetings\". Despite having a large staff to support him, and all the security protocols that come with running one of the biggest and most sensitive departments in Whitehall, Brennan hints at the chaotic nature of Fox's engagement diary \u2013 saying that she has still to confirm the times and dates of all the times Werritty entered the building. She has asked for \"security control logs\" to give her a definitive number.When the list of all the meetings they had together was published last night, it emerged that Werritty's first meeting with Fox at the MoD occurred on 20 May \u2013 just after the general election. He met him again on 21 May.It was during one of their MoD meetings in June that Fox told his friend to stop using business cards with the portcullis emblem saying he was one of Fox's advisers, he said.Fox told the Commons he first learned Werritty was using them earlier that month, and at their next meeting, \"told him to stop using his business card stating he was my adviser\". Brennan explains that she raised the issue with Fox on 23 August at a routine meeting, the day she returned to the MoD after her summer break. She had read about the cards in a story published in the Guardian on 19 August.\"Dr Fox confirmed that he had already dealt with the problem and that it was wrong for Mr Werritty to have used such a card,\" she states. Brennan says she checked Fox's claim that he had asked Werritty to stop using the cards two months earlier with one of his special advisers. \"He recalls that immediately after this the defence secretary and the special advisers held a meeting with Mr Werritty at which Dr Fox told [him] that this was unacceptable and he must stop issuing the business cards.\"Answering questions in the Commons, Fox was asked if it was true that the former chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, had warned him about his closeness to Werritty. Fox said he did not recall having that conversation.Fox did not add anything new to his account of his controversial June meeting with Dubai businessman Harvey Boulter, maintaining it was organised after Werritty bumped into Boulter in a restaurant. He insisted that he had never discussed the issue of 3M boss George Buckley's knighthood with Boulter and suggested Boulter was unreliable because he had initially implied that the knighthood was discussed but he later insisted it was not.Ursula Brennan made it clear that Fox's officials had been unaware of the meeting and that she was unhappy about that. In her interim report she said: \"If there is a risk that a personal meeting may stray into government business, the private secretary should ensure that an official be present.\"Fox's insistence that the Boulter meeting was arranged after a chance encounter is undermined by correspondence seen by the Guardian which suggests talks had taken place between Werritty and Boulter about setting up a meeting with Fox as early as March. The June meeting was the second time the defence secretary had met the Dubai businessman. The two men met in Dubai in early April when, by coincidence, Fox was in town and was able to shake the private equity boss's hand.Fox says he did not discuss either commercial or defence matters during private meetings with Werritty. \"He had no access to classified material nor was he briefed on classified matters.\" The defence secretary does acknowledge that at the Dubai meeting on 17 June there was a general discussion about a communications encryption technology called Cellcrypt and how it might work for the MoD. Beyond that, there was \"no discussion of \u2026 any classified information\".Brennan says senior MoD civil servants believe that Werritty's 22-plus visits to the department were largely personal. But since others were present at only four of them she has only Fox's word for it. She says civil servants are confident they did not provide Werritty with classified papers or briefings.Boulter says that the call encryption technology he discussed with Fox in Dubai was sensitive and that he would not have done so if he had known Werritty did not have security clearance. In particular he says he discussed the possibility of providing it for UK troops in Afghanistan which would have been highly sensitive information.Brennan says that during the course of her review she learned that Fox or his office had provided some diary details to Werritty, in connection with visits where Werritty was to be present. She said: \"Dr Fox has accepted that it is not appropriate to ask officials to provide ministerial diary information to a third party.\"Questioned about providing diary details to a friend Fox was unapologetic. He claimed it was reasonable for ministers to let friends and family know of their movements in order to make arrangements to meet up socially. He does promise to stop meeting Werritty socially when abroad on official\u00a0business.", "tags": ["Liam Fox and Adam Werritty links", "Liam Fox", "Politics", "Adam Werritty", "Conservatives", "UK news", "Lobbying"], "title": "Not just Dubai: Liam Fox met Adam Werritty 18 times around the world"},{"date": "2011-12-08T15:35:21Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Dating back to 1975, the original congestion charge scheme started as a cumbersome, manual system of colour-coded paper licences that motorists had to buy and display at police checkpoints to enter a restricted zone. In 1995 it went electronic, with smart cards in cars registered by overhead gantries. The government has long stressed that the purpose is purely traffic management, with entry to the zone typically costing one or two Singapore dollars (50p-\u00a31) \u2013 nominal for a country where high road taxes and certificates make car ownership very expensive.With a national population half that of London, Norway seems an unlikely place for congestion charging. But its two largest cities, Oslo and Bergen, introduced tolls for ring roads in the 1980s, explicitly as a money-raising exercise. Public opposition gave way to grudging acceptance, with the development of an automated system and low operating costs and a political commitment that revenue was entirely devoted to roadbuilding and improvements.Ken Livingstone's brainchild, the congestion charge went live in February 2003. Bus use went up significantly, and road safety and journey times improved. Public opinion, which had been marginally against introducing the charge, quickly swung round substantially in favour. However, the 2007 western extension into plusher residential districts proved unpopular and was scrapped after Boris Johnson took over as mayor.Trials in the Swedish capital in 2006 had dramatic results, cutting traffic by 20-30%, and in 2007 a referendum approved making the scheme permanent. Drivers pay a modest 10-20 krona (95p-\u00a31.90) depending on times of day to enter or leave the capital on weekdays, and evenings and weekends are free. A similar electronic cordon is now planned for Gothenburg from 2013.New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, was keen to implement a scheme along the lines of London's. In 2007 his proposal for a weekday charge for vehicles south of 86th Street in Manhattan garnered surprisingly positive press and public backing. The city council voted in favour, but plans were blocked by the state assembly and eventually dropped.

It has passages on how couples should physically and spiritually approach sex, and claims that most women only satisfy 10% of their husbands' sexual needs.Club leaders, who argue that a wife should serve as a \"good sex worker\" and a \"whore\" to her husband, showed the book to journalists last month in an effort to dispel what they called misconceptions that it was obscene and demeaning to women.They said the book, which contains no explicit photographs, was intended to be a spiritual guide read exclusively by club members to help them better understand sex.Many Malaysians have denounced the club, saying it makes a mockery of modern gender roles in a country where women hold prominent posts in both the government and the private sector.A spokesman for the home ministry said the government's Islamic affairs department had studied the manual and recommended a ban on the grounds that it may confuse Malaysian Muslims about what constitutes acceptable religious teaching.People caught in possession of it could be fined up to 5,000 ringgit (\u00a3995), the spokesman said, and anyone who makes copies for sale could be imprisoned for three years and fined 20,000 ringgit.Representatives of the club did not respond to calls made to them on Thursday. The club is believed to have at least 800 members in Malaysia and has branches in Indonesia, Singapore, Jordan and Britain. Many members are in polygamous marriages, insisting the practice helps husbands to avoid committing adultery.The club's international vice-president, Rohaya Mohamad, explained the club's provocative pronouncements in an interview with a Malaysian paper earlier this year. \"Eve was created because Adam had needs,\" she told the Star. \"Men have [sexual] needs which they can't control.

O'Neill's MPs have continued to pass legislation recognising him as leader.The battle escalated when MPs backing O'Neill stormed the governor general's gates a day after the supreme court ruling that Somare's removal and O'Neill's election by parliament in August was unconstitutional. \"We are unarmed and we're the legitimate government,\" the Australian Broadcasting Corporation quoted the MPs as telling police.Somare said on Wednesday that his cabinet had been sworn in by Ogio, who represents PNG's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II.Somare insisted he did not need to be sworn in himself because the supreme court had already reinstated him as prime minister. \"It is regretful that all of government was put on hold but this situation has been diffused by the swearing-in today of my cabinet,\" Somare said.The crisis continued on Wednesday, with MPs loyal to O'Neill passing a motion ordering Ogio to swear in O'Neill as prime minister. O'Neill could not be reached for comment but on Tuesday he said he had met with Ogio briefly after the march to the official residence in the capital, Port Moresby.The supreme court's 3-2 decision on Monday that ruled O'Neill's election unconstitutional came after O'Neill's government passed a series of retroactive laws legalising its decision to dump Somare from office while he was in Singapore recovering from a heart condition.One of Somare's first acts when the supreme court ordered his return to power was to reinstate the former police commissioner Fred Yakasa and oust O'Neill's appointee, Tom Kulunga. Both police chiefs were present at the governor general's home and held discussions with MPs loyal to O'Neill.Somare has based himself at the Ela Beach Hotel, where he has set up a cabinet made up mostly of ministers from his previous government.Somare had been in Singapore for five months between late March and 6 September, when he returned to parliament after three heart operations.Kevin Rudd, the foreign minister in neighbouring Australia, said the former Australian territory had entered uncharted waters.", "tags": ["Papua New Guinea", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "Monarchy", "The Queen", "World news"], "title": "Papua New Guinea in crisis as two claim to be prime minister"},{"date": "2011-12-25T17:38:01Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Croupiers and poker players could fuel Japan's recovery from the March earthquake and tsunami as the country moves closer to legalising casinos.A cross-party group of MPs wants to resurrect a 2006 campaign to put casinos on the same legal footing as betting on horse, speedboat and bicycle racing.The cost of rebuilding the north-east coastline, estimated at $245bn (\u00a3157bn), has given fresh impetus to the campaign, which has the support of a growing number of influential politicians including four former prime ministers.

The promise of bigger tax revenues in the midst of an economic crisis appears to be winning over politicians who had voiced moral objections to Macao-style casinos.Supporters point to the Singapore complex, which includes the world's most expensive hotel, as proof that casinos can operate without attracting organised crime or creating gambling addicts.Singapore Marina Bay Sands, which boasts 1,500 slot machines and 600 gaming tables, is expected to help generate about $1bn in gaming taxes this year, according to one estimate, while Macao's casinos could give the government $13bn.\"There is more momentum and greater optimism than there has ever been in the past,\" George Tanasijevich, the company's representative in Japan, told Bloomberg.The move has the support of Tokyo's governor, Shintaro Ishihara, and Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, who wants to use casino revenue to fund welfare programmes.Other forms of gambling in Japan, together with pachinko, a pinball derivative played by 18 million people, generated $322bn last year, according to the Japan Productivity Centre.Pachinko, in which prizes are exchanged off-premises for cash, generates 30 trillion yen a year \u2013 more than Japan's top five carmakers put together.Japan's parliament would have to pass a law to nullify the ban on casino gambling, and some commentators believe the pro-casino lobby could struggle to win over the public after two high-profile gambling scandals.The traditional sport of sumo was rocked by revelations last summer that dozens of wrestlers had gambled illegally on professional baseball matches, with members of the yakuza acting as bookmakers.Mototaka Ikawa, the former chairman of Daio, a leading paper maker, has been in the headlines amid allegations that he used more than 5.5bn yen borrowed from the firm's subsidiaries to fund trips to casinos around the world.\"The media has been running stories about how certain people become easily addicted to gambling, and in addition to wrecking their own lives in spectacular fashion, ruin the lives of others. That's great ammunition for the anti-casino crowd,\" says Mark Schreiber, a media commentator who writes about social trends.He is not convinced that casinos will aid tsunami reconstruction, even if MPs find time to debate a gambling bill. \"By the time the casino resorts are up and running \u2013 I reckon it would take three to five years \u2013 the recovery will be far enough along and Japan will have a completely new set of problems,\" he said.The move could fall victim to an ingrained cultural aversion to gambling among Japanese leaders stretching back to the 18th century, when authorities had run-ins with bakuto gamblers, the forerunners of the yakuza. Schreiber said: \"There is also an old Japanese expression \u2013 nomu, utsu, kau (booze, gambling and womanising) \u2013 to describe a samurai who had fallen into a dissolute life.\"", "tags": ["Japan", "Japan disaster", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Earthquakes"], "title": "Japan bets on casinos to fund earthquake recovery"},{"date": "2012-03-24T23:00:04Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "A Singapore-based consortium has become the fifth group to lodge a formal takeover bid for Rangers.

But now it goes head to head with the intriguingly subtitled Mr Andoh's Pennine Diary: Memoirs of a Japanese Chicken Sexer in 1935 Hebden Bridge, on the shortlist of the Diagram prize for the oddest book title of the year.Gosson's exhaustively researched maritime history is already the favourite of judges at the prize's administrator, the Bookseller magazine, and some are already calling out for more on the subject. \"I do feel there was a lot more information that could be covered, possibly requiring another volume,\" wrote a reader on Amazon.co.uk.But it is the public who will decide the eventual winner of the award, a public which has shown a marked fondness in the past for the lewder titles in the running (High Performance Stiffened Structures, The Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories and Living with Crazy Buttocks are all former winners). Koichi Andoh's account of his father's time training workers at a hatchery business in the art of determining the sex of one-day-old chicks \u2013 or as he puts it, his time as a Japanese Chicken Sexer \u2013 therefore looks like a strong contender, as does The Great Singapore Penis Panic: and the Future of American Mass Hysteria. \"I'm reading it at the moment ... and it genuinely is a fascinating true-life tale, even if it does sound as though it may have been born of a Monty Python mind as a spoof,\" said the prize's administrator Philip Stone.Cooking with Poo by Saiyuud Diwong (\"Poo\" is the Thai chef's nickname) will satisfy those in search of the scatological, while the Diagram prize's talent for delighting in the esoteric is revealed in its final three contenders: Estonian Sock Patterns All Around the World, The Mushroom in Christian Art (a revelation of how Jesus \"is a personification of the Holy Mushroom, Amanita muscaria\") and A Taxonomy of Office Chairs. This collection of more than 400 drawings of chairs has already found enthusiastic readers. \"As a self proclaimed office chair enthusiast (having used a Life, Think, Leap, Freedom, and currently own an Aeron) I eagerly placed my order with high expectations,\" wrote an Amazon reviewer. \"After receiving and reading I can happily say my expectations have been more than met.\"The prize's custodian Horace Bent, who received 75 submissions for this year's award, praised the shortlist's \"wonderfully international\" feel. \"We have one nominee from Estonia, one from Thailand and two from the United States. In addition, one of the UK-published nominees concerns the tale of a Japanese fellow who trained Yorkshiremen in the art of chicken sexing,\" he said.The award was dreamed up during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978 as a way to avoid boredom, with Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice its inaugural winner. Votes can be cast at the Bookseller and at the magazine's sister site, We Love This Book, with the winner to be revealed on 30 March. Nothing is given to the author or the publisher of the triumphant title. According to Bent, the \"increased publicity and therefore, potentially, sales, is prize enough\", but the book's nominator is given a bottle of \"fairly passable\" claret.A Century of Sand Dredging in the Bristol Channel: Volume Two by Peter Gosson (Amberley Publishing)Cooking with Poo by Saiyuud Diwong (Urban Neighbours of Hope)Estonian Sock Patterns All Around the World by Aino Praakli (Kirjastus Elmatar)The Great Singapore Penis Panic: And the Future of American Mass Hysteria by Scott D Mendelson (Createspace)Mr Andoh's Pennine Diary: Memoirs of a Japanese Chicken Sexer in 1935 Hebden Bridge by Stephen Curry and Takayoshi Andoh (Royd Press)A Taxonomy of Office Chairs by Jonathan Olivares (Phaidon)The Mushroom in Christian Art by John A Rush (North Atlantic Books)", "tags": ["Oddest book title prize", "Awards and prizes", "Books", "Culture", "Fiction"], "title": "Prize dredges up a vintage shortlist of the year's oddest book titles"},{"date": "2012-03-24T23:00:04Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "A Singapore-based consortium has become the fifth group to lodge a formal takeover bid for Rangers.

Brazil was the fastest growing market, recording an increase over 2010 of 48%, with Singapore and Taiwan close behind on 44% each.The volume of exports was up by a healthy 19% showing strong worldwide demand and growth was not simply driven by producers raising prices. In 2010, volume was only marginally ahead at 2%.The Scotch Whisky Association said the value of exports was up 23%. The USA was the biggest importer, followed by France, although by volume France was ahead.Rising demand in emerging and more mature markets has resulted in export values increasing by an average of 10% a year over the last five years, said the Scotch Whisky Association. Exports contribute \u00a3134 per second to the UK balance of trade.The value of exports to the USA broke the \u00a3600m barrier for the first time in 2011 to reach \u00a3654.9m \u2013 up 31% on 2010. Exports to France increased 27% to \u00a3535.4m.Affluent young professionals in fast growing economies are increasingly developing a taste for Scotch, viewing the drink as \"a status symbol\" and \"trendy,\" said SWA's Rosemary Gallagher.To meet increased demand, distillers are investing record amounts in production capacity across Scotland. In the last four years the Scotch whisky industry has invested more than \u00a31bn in new facilities. The industry employs 10,300 people in Scotland and another 35,000 across the UK supply chain.Gavin Hewitt, chief executive of the SWA, said: \"Despite continuing economic uncertainty, Scotch continues to meet increasing demand from all corners of the globe. It continues to appeal to consumers in countries such as the USA and France and is being enjoyed by younger professionals in newer markets in Asia and Latin America.\"Exports have increased for seven consecutive years, contributing to delivering an export-led recovery, a focus for the UK and Scottish governments. But some markets saw a decline, including Spain and South Korea.Hewitt added that securing fair market access and reducing tariffs is now a priority for the whisky industry. A free trade agreement between the European Union and South Korea came into force in July. India is a priority for this year.Hewitt said: \"We are hopeful a free trade agreement can be signed which will lead to a reduction in the onerous 150% import tariff. The industry is investing in Scotland to ensure it can seize these overseas opportunities.\"The SWA figures derive from HM Revenue & Customs data. They are based on individual company declarations of the export customs value and volume of shipments to each market (which may not be the final destination of the consignment). The figures do not reflect the mark-up charged by retailers.Scotland's Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said: \"Scotland is rightly hailed as a land of food and drink, which is underpinned by the record exports achieved in both areas in 2011.\"This demonstrates that people around the world are appreciating the high quality and delicious products that Scotland's larder has to offer.\"With exports increasing by more than a fifth, the whisky industry has seen hugely impressive year-on-year growth, while Scotland's seafood remains at the heart of our food exports offering. It's also heartening to see a substantial 60% boost in fruit and vegetable exports.\"James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink, said: \"Our food and drink industry is Scotland's biggest growth story right now.\"These new figures mean that the 10 year target industry set itself in 2007 - to grow our total exports by 38% - has been achieved six years early.\"Whisky has been a trailblazer across the globe. But our food sector is now following its lead, with exports up a staggering 62% in just four years, as our reputation as a land of food and drink grows day-by-day.\"", "tags": ["International trade", "Economics", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "Scotland", "UK news", "Whisky", "Life and style"], "title": "Value of scotch whisky exports soar 23% topping \u00a34bn"},{"date": "2012-02-24T00:01:03Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Some might have worried the publishers of Peter Gosson's A Century of Sand Dredging in the Bristol Channel were scraping the bottom of the barrel with the issue of a second volume. But now it goes head to head with the intriguingly subtitled Mr Andoh's Pennine Diary: Memoirs of a Japanese Chicken Sexer in 1935 Hebden Bridge, on the shortlist of the Diagram prize for the oddest book title of the year.Gosson's exhaustively researched maritime history is already the favourite of judges at the prize's administrator, the Bookseller magazine, and some are already calling out for more on the subject. \"I do feel there was a lot more information that could be covered, possibly requiring another volume,\" wrote a reader on Amazon.co.uk.But it is the public who will decide the eventual winner of the award, a public which has shown a marked fondness in the past for the lewder titles in the running (High Performance Stiffened Structures, The Big Book of Lesbian Horse Stories and Living with Crazy Buttocks are all former winners). Koichi Andoh's account of his father's time training workers at a hatchery business in the art of determining the sex of one-day-old chicks \u2013 or as he puts it, his time as a Japanese Chicken Sexer \u2013 therefore looks like a strong contender, as does The Great Singapore Penis Panic: and the Future of American Mass Hysteria. \"I'm reading it at the moment ... and it genuinely is a fascinating true-life tale, even if it does sound as though it may have been born of a Monty Python mind as a spoof,\" said the prize's administrator Philip Stone.Cooking with Poo by Saiyuud Diwong (\"Poo\" is the Thai chef's nickname) will satisfy those in search of the scatological, while the Diagram prize's talent for delighting in the esoteric is revealed in its final three contenders: Estonian Sock Patterns All Around the World, The Mushroom in Christian Art (a revelation of how Jesus \"is a personification of the Holy Mushroom, Amanita muscaria\") and A Taxonomy of Office Chairs. This collection of more than 400 drawings of chairs has already found enthusiastic readers. \"As a self proclaimed office chair enthusiast (having used a Life, Think, Leap, Freedom, and currently own an Aeron) I eagerly placed my order with high expectations,\" wrote an Amazon reviewer. \"After receiving and reading I can happily say my expectations have been more than met.\"The prize's custodian Horace Bent, who received 75 submissions for this year's award, praised the shortlist's \"wonderfully international\" feel. \"We have one nominee from Estonia, one from Thailand and two from the United States. In addition, one of the UK-published nominees concerns the tale of a Japanese fellow who trained Yorkshiremen in the art of chicken sexing,\" he said.The award was dreamed up during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978 as a way to avoid boredom, with Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Nude Mice its inaugural winner. Votes can be cast at the Bookseller and at the magazine's sister site, We Love This Book, with the winner to be revealed on 30 March. Nothing is given to the author or the publisher of the triumphant title.

The original tender document, issued last February, bound bidders to continue to produce \"high-quality\" ELT content.ELT programmes were downloaded from the Australia Network website over 200,000 times during November, according to ABC spokeswoman Sally Cray.\"ABC's English language programmes across the Asia Pacific are very popular especially in pod and vodcast formats where the audience can personalise the service and watch or listen when it suits them,\" She said.The government said it was in \"the national interest\" to cancel the tender process after the independent panel set up to evaluate bids was reported to have unanimously backed Sky.

In Singapore, however, a city obsessed with order and where \"vandals\" can be flogged, 27-year-old Samantha Lo \u2013 the so-called \"Sticker Lady\" \u2013 has inspired a massive online campaign after being arrested for posting stickers.Lo, founder of an online arts magazine, has been arrested for sticking messages on traffic signal buttons, including \"Press to Time Travel\" or \"Press to Stop Time\", as well as on suspicion of painting messages on roads reading \"My Grandfather Road\" \u2013 a Singaporean pun on bad driving and, some believe, the out-of-touch government of Singapore.Lo's arrest, which has been condemned by more than 14,000 people who have signed an online petition calling for leniency in the way she is treated, has triggered deep soul-searching in the city state, which is infamous for its enforcement of strict social order and banned the sale of chewing gum to keep its pavements clean.If charged under Singapore's draconian 1966 vandalism law, Lo could face up to three years in jail and a $2,000 (\u00a31,000) fine. Men who are convicted, even of first offences, also receive three strokes of the cane.Lo's stickers first appeared earlier this year, and included a monochrome image of an older man stylised in black-and-white, with the word \"Limpeh\" \u2013 meaning \"your father\" \u2013 which is sometimes used as a rude phrase in Singapore. Some have suggested that the man bears a resemblance to Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding statesman.While Lo herself was unavailable for comment, an online petition has attracted a large number of comments criticising Singapore's repressive laws. \"Creativity requires a little chaos,\" wrote one poster, while another, named Gene Ho, argues: \"I think it's tastefully done. Not political nor damaging to the nation. In fact, by issuing a fine or caning sentence shows just how tight-assed and conservative the nation is. Supporting the arts you say? Why not open up your minds first. Laugh at yourselves a little and maybe you will really understand what art is. It's not just ballet or drama or a che che symphonic event. It's more than that. So take the stick out of your asses and let the girl go. She's helped a lot of creatives open up.\"In a statement, however, Singapore's police insisted, \"the case is classified as vandalism\", adding that offenders would be dealt with severely.Defending the tough line, a police spokesman told a Singaporean website that it had diverted \"substantial resources to identify the suspect involved\" and carried out \"intensive inquiries and legwork\".\"This is on top of the considerable time, effort and cost to clean up the roads and affected areas. Vandalising public property is a very irresponsible act. Offenders will be dealt with in accordance with the law.\"In the escalating row over her treatment \u2013 in a country where locksmiths and other small businesses regularly put up advertising stickers but are rarely prosecuted \u2013 Lo has attracted the support of several members of Singapore's parliament, among them Janice Koh, who has compared Lo's work with that of the British street artist Banksy. She called on the authorities to handle the case \"with a light touch\".Koh said: \"It is almost impossible to talk about developing a culturally vibrant, creative or lovable city, without some tolerance for those slightly messy activities that sometimes challenge the rules. For Singapore, it would be useful to make a distinction between this kind of art and outright graffiti or vandalism that seeks to deliberately destroy public property for its own sake.\"Not all those who have commented publicly, however, have been so tolerant, with a number calling for Lo to be punished under the vandalism law.One, Ann Hee Kyet, insisted: \"This is definitely vandalism. Stop hiding behind the excuse of art. The stickers are creative and cheeky, in the style of schoolgirl pranks.

MFW found sponsorship this year from brands such as Aston Martin and Leica.What the majority of designers at MFW brought to menswear were new possibilities to be both comfortable and stylish. Approaching the music and menswear element most holistically was Hisashi Fukatami's label Diet Butcher Slim Skin, inspired by the experimental compositions of pianist H Zett M, who gave a live performance while the Japanese designer spun electro sounds on stage. The collection made combat style chic, with a touch of romanticism. Three-piece suits were fresh with cropped trousers, particularly in the ombr\u00e9s and embroidered linen. Another highlight came from Korean brand Beyond Closet, where designer Tae Yong used American sportswear to inject humour into the workplace \u2013 his opening look rather strangely but successfully spliced an old-fashioned blazer with elements from a varsity jacket, while another style elongated the baseball jacket to knee-length. One of more directional collections came from Britain's Bodybound, if perhaps aided by the buzz in the build-up to their show: Royal College of Art-educated Kim Choong-Wilkins \u2013 whose mother is of Singaporean descent \u2013 and Pliny Champion created a new collection that expanded on ideas from their home show, but a pair of clear PVC culottes set tongues wagging: Will they, won't they show bums? They covered up in the end, which served as a benign reminder that this is the country that issues penalties for public indecency. \"We didn't want it to be a statement for the sake of it,\" Champion said. The collection overturned traditional menswear with a considered jam on rivets, studs, transparency and metallic knits. But where is the local talent? Of the 19 designers chosen, just one \u2013 Reckless Ericka \u2013 could be truly considered Singaporean. The small island has always struggled with its own design scene; it is now playing its strength as an efficient melting point \u2013 \"a postmodern pastiche of the best bits,\" Charlie Casely-Hayford remarked. Afton Chen and Louis Koh, the duo behind the label, displayed great construction skills, creating volume and drama out of the lightest of fabrics (a must in the tropics) and received a well-deserved standing ovation.So does the Singapore approach represent a new future for fashion shows? Among attendees, there was some discussion as to whether the Singapore Men's fashion week is bringing back a charm that is lost and occasionally reminisced about\u2013 where professionals, with ever-increasing hunger for newness, dart in and out the European shows. \"At least there's entertainment here instead of all the waiting around and chaos in London \u2013 it's never this relaxing!\" another London-based journalist said to me, as K-pop group Se7en took the stage in between the catwalk shows. But as well as a dearth in homegrown designers, the music-fashion fusion puzzled some designers and industry attendees. Each fashion show was followed by a performance from K-pop and Asian stars throughout the five-day event. Never mind that I knew little of the artists or the songs; the energy sometimes failed to penetrate several guests as seats emptied after each designer's bow. The event's ambitions were grand; the 220,000 square feet venue was significant, though of what was fundamentally a showcase of 19 designers over five days, the result sometimes felt a little underwhelming. But let's remember that it took 20 years for power players to start taking London fashion week seriously. Like every new kid on the block, Singapore needs to offer something original to gain credibility. What I can be sure of is that Cintamani and Singapore have this in common: what they say they'll do, they will get done. And there certainly exists a growing group of locals tired of hearing what a cultural desert the country is. Within the next few years, Singapore's cab drivers may well become rather more fashion-literate.\u2022 This article was modified at 09:57 on 25 April to correct the spelling of Reckless Erika.

Some have suggested that the man bears a resemblance to Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding statesman.While Lo herself was unavailable for comment, an online petition has attracted a large number of comments criticising Singapore's repressive laws. \"Creativity requires a little chaos,\" wrote one poster, while another, named Gene Ho, argues: \"I think it's tastefully done.

Underneath the hard exterior of a city's infrastructure, such as green buildings or energy-efficient power grids, a whole host of factors from extensive master planning to urban governance support it.From the thinktank's perspective, says Cheng, governance is key. One of the fundamental roles of government is to provide a broader framework whereby the private sector can participate actively in the building of harmonious cities, where the spatial, social and environmental aspects of a city are of equal importance.\"The private sector wants clarity, certainty, some predictability. So, the government has to come up with the overall vision; create plans and policies that make that vision attractive to the private sector; and make those plans and policies transparent and credible,\" he says in an interview.In Singapore, one way the government achieves this is by opening sustainability projects to public tender, thus ensuring that such projects are benchmarked at a level feasible for private companies.A 2011 tender for the development of a major desalination plant, for example, was deliberately scoped to allow private sector participation \u2013 it was won by water management company Hyflux. Similarly, the design and development of the city-state's latest integrated resort Marina Bay Sands, which has received accolades for its eco-friendly practices, was carried out privately but according to the government's vision for the site.There is, of course, still more room for private sector participation above and beyond following the governmental lead. Cheng, an architect by profession who previously spent 13 years with Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority, cites green buildings, which have caught on in the city-state because developers see them as a way of selling projects. The infrastructure is widespread, but the mindset still has to catch up: there is room for improvement in the way these buildings are managed.\"To me, you can do good and do well at the same time,\" he says. \"It is not a bad thing to try to align private profit objectives with the greater good. When we introduce guidelines and legislation, we level the playing field and encourage the private sector to participate much more easily.\"The public sector must take the lead not just at the infrastructural and policy level, he adds. The next step: leaders at the city level will increasingly become more like CEOs, taking on a managing role and influencing the cities' push towards sustainability. Already, eco-cities are springing up across Asia and sustainability proposals are pouring out of major urban centres such as Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.\"We are entering an era of cities. This is where the action is taking place, where a lot of economic and intellectual powers are concentrated. People move to cities because the opportunities are there. Urbanisation will take place at the edges of the cities \u2013 when we talk about China urbanising, for example, it's not an overall transformation but an expansion of existing cities and the growth of towns into cities.\"As this continues, leadership, institutional strength and the ability to think in the long term \u2013 rather than focusing solely on short-term development \u2013 will determine how sustainable a city can become.But there is also a major mindset change waiting in the wings, Cheng adds, and in the context of Asia, this is the concept of what constitutes an eco-city to begin with. Conventional models prescribe a village-like, self-sufficient ecosystem, but this cannot be applied in developing parts of the world, where policymakers at all levels face a whole suite of complex socio-economic challenges ranging from widespread poverty to resource scarcity.Instead, what is needed is a compact, high-density model that utilises economies of scale for resource and energy efficiency \u2013 such as many cities in Asia are already implementing.\"A lot of people would criticise Singapore as a country for being non-self-sustainable,\" says Cheng, who has himself been involved in the planning of one of these eco-cities, the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City. \"But in 2010, we proposed at the Venice Architecture Biennale that if the whole world followed Singapore's model, only 0.5% of the Earth's area would be needed to house the population.\"Ultimately, he says, the relevant question for public and private sector alike is not whether a city or country can achieve some benchmark. \"Being sustainable is about socio-economic as well as environmental development.

Planning permission for the development in question was granted only in February.Like the man said, these super rich investors are, \"Buying for capital growth and as a safe haven.\" That's one way the London housing price bubble stays inflated. The other way is lack of supply. Not much sign of either changing. Fitzrovia News adds:Permission was given for the development in February after [Westminster] City Hall's planning committee agreed to a contribution of affordable housing provision, amounting to 17.4 percent of the total residential floorspace on-site plus \u00a35.94m towards the City Council's affordable housing fund.Planning policy normally requires that 25 percent of the apartments should be affordable housing, but a larger contribution of affordable housing was rejected by Exemplar who argued that it was not viable to provide any more. Westminster's planning committee agreed...The development...was given planning permission in the face of huge opposition from people living around the site.More on that here. Meanwhile, Westminster's new leader Philippa Roe has strongly refuted the charge that government housing benefit caps are leading to the alleged \"social cleansing\" of poorer residents, despite its own research forecasting that these might oblige a fifth of the borough's primary school pupils to move to somewhere cheaper. As the Guardian reported in March:Addressing the consequences from the cap in the private rented sector, she [Roe] retorts: \"Even in that sector we have a 45% 'churn', so even if the worst predictions are realised and every single person living in a property with rents above the cap had to move \u2013 it's less than 10% additional 'churn' in one year.\"\"Furthermore, one-bedroom flats are readily available beneath the cap in Westminster,\" she says. \"Two-bed flats you can get in some of the less expensive areas. It's only the larger properties [three and four bed homes] where people are going to have to move, and 50% of the people affected by the cap are in one-bed properties. We are seeing rents coming down. We've been negotiating with landlords, sometimes reducing rents from \u00a3800 to \u00a3400 a week.\"And she insists other nearby London boroughs can take up the slack. \"Even if people do have to move, they don't have to move very far - Camden, Brent, Southwark, Lambeth are on our doorstep and there are properties in those areas beneath the cap.\"A Westminster council officer has explained to those affected: \"To live in Westminster is a privilege, not a right.\" No-one suggests that these issues are straightforward.

The budget for this year is $8 million SPD (\u00a34 million), highlighting the scale of the project. \"We're making the first serious attempt to marry fashion and music,\" Cintamani, looking sharp in a Givenchy suit, tells me when I meet him during MFW. \"But the same objective remains \u2013 that this is a platform for Asian menswear designers.\" Is roping in a whole other industry a bit too much too soon? \"I couldn't wait half a generation before this picked up, I needed to inject the music component to propel it to the next level. It needs to be ten times the scale of what it is,\" he adds. MFW found sponsorship this year from brands such as Aston Martin and Leica.What the majority of designers at MFW brought to menswear were new possibilities to be both comfortable and stylish. Approaching the music and menswear element most holistically was Hisashi Fukatami's label Diet Butcher Slim Skin, inspired by the experimental compositions of pianist H Zett M, who gave a live performance while the Japanese designer spun electro sounds on stage. The collection made combat style chic, with a touch of romanticism. Three-piece suits were fresh with cropped trousers, particularly in the ombr\u00e9s and embroidered linen. Another highlight came from Korean brand Beyond Closet, where designer Tae Yong used American sportswear to inject humour into the workplace \u2013 his opening look rather strangely but successfully spliced an old-fashioned blazer with elements from a varsity jacket, while another style elongated the baseball jacket to knee-length. One of more directional collections came from Britain's Bodybound, if perhaps aided by the buzz in the build-up to their show: Royal College of Art-educated Kim Choong-Wilkins \u2013 whose mother is of Singaporean descent \u2013 and Pliny Champion created a new collection that expanded on ideas from their home show, but a pair of clear PVC culottes set tongues wagging: Will they, won't they show bums? They covered up in the end, which served as a benign reminder that this is the country that issues penalties for public indecency. \"We didn't want it to be a statement for the sake of it,\" Champion said. The collection overturned traditional menswear with a considered jam on rivets, studs, transparency and metallic knits. But where is the local talent? Of the 19 designers chosen, just one \u2013 Reckless Ericka \u2013 could be truly considered Singaporean. The small island has always struggled with its own design scene; it is now playing its strength as an efficient melting point \u2013 \"a postmodern pastiche of the best bits,\" Charlie Casely-Hayford remarked. Afton Chen and Louis Koh, the duo behind the label, displayed great construction skills, creating volume and drama out of the lightest of fabrics (a must in the tropics) and received a well-deserved standing ovation.So does the Singapore approach represent a new future for fashion shows? Among attendees, there was some discussion as to whether the Singapore Men's fashion week is bringing back a charm that is lost and occasionally reminisced about\u2013 where professionals, with ever-increasing hunger for newness, dart in and out the European shows. \"At least there's entertainment here instead of all the waiting around and chaos in London \u2013 it's never this relaxing!\" another London-based journalist said to me, as K-pop group Se7en took the stage in between the catwalk shows. But as well as a dearth in homegrown designers, the music-fashion fusion puzzled some designers and industry attendees. Each fashion show was followed by a performance from K-pop and Asian stars throughout the five-day event. Never mind that I knew little of the artists or the songs; the energy sometimes failed to penetrate several guests as seats emptied after each designer's bow. The event's ambitions were grand; the 220,000 square feet venue was significant, though of what was fundamentally a showcase of 19 designers over five days, the result sometimes felt a little underwhelming. But let's remember that it took 20 years for power players to start taking London fashion week seriously. Like every new kid on the block, Singapore needs to offer something original to gain credibility. What I can be sure of is that Cintamani and Singapore have this in common: what they say they'll do, they will get done. And there certainly exists a growing group of locals tired of hearing what a cultural desert the country is. Within the next few years, Singapore's cab drivers may well become rather more fashion-literate.\u2022 This article was modified at 09:57 on 25 April to correct the spelling of Reckless Erika.

Some have suggested that the man bears a resemblance to Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding statesman.While Lo herself was unavailable for comment, an online petition has attracted a large number of comments criticising Singapore's repressive laws. \"Creativity requires a little chaos,\" wrote one poster, while another, named Gene Ho, argues: \"I think it's tastefully done.

Underneath the hard exterior of a city's infrastructure, such as green buildings or energy-efficient power grids, a whole host of factors from extensive master planning to urban governance support it.From the thinktank's perspective, says Cheng, governance is key. One of the fundamental roles of government is to provide a broader framework whereby the private sector can participate actively in the building of harmonious cities, where the spatial, social and environmental aspects of a city are of equal importance.\"The private sector wants clarity, certainty, some predictability. So, the government has to come up with the overall vision; create plans and policies that make that vision attractive to the private sector; and make those plans and policies transparent and credible,\" he says in an interview.In Singapore, one way the government achieves this is by opening sustainability projects to public tender, thus ensuring that such projects are benchmarked at a level feasible for private companies.A 2011 tender for the development of a major desalination plant, for example, was deliberately scoped to allow private sector participation \u2013 it was won by water management company Hyflux. Similarly, the design and development of the city-state's latest integrated resort Marina Bay Sands, which has received accolades for its eco-friendly practices, was carried out privately but according to the government's vision for the site.There is, of course, still more room for private sector participation above and beyond following the governmental lead. Cheng, an architect by profession who previously spent 13 years with Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority, cites green buildings, which have caught on in the city-state because developers see them as a way of selling projects. The infrastructure is widespread, but the mindset still has to catch up: there is room for improvement in the way these buildings are managed.\"To me, you can do good and do well at the same time,\" he says. \"It is not a bad thing to try to align private profit objectives with the greater good. When we introduce guidelines and legislation, we level the playing field and encourage the private sector to participate much more easily.\"The public sector must take the lead not just at the infrastructural and policy level, he adds. The next step: leaders at the city level will increasingly become more like CEOs, taking on a managing role and influencing the cities' push towards sustainability. Already, eco-cities are springing up across Asia and sustainability proposals are pouring out of major urban centres such as Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.\"We are entering an era of cities. This is where the action is taking place, where a lot of economic and intellectual powers are concentrated. People move to cities because the opportunities are there. Urbanisation will take place at the edges of the cities \u2013 when we talk about China urbanising, for example, it's not an overall transformation but an expansion of existing cities and the growth of towns into cities.\"As this continues, leadership, institutional strength and the ability to think in the long term \u2013 rather than focusing solely on short-term development \u2013 will determine how sustainable a city can become.But there is also a major mindset change waiting in the wings, Cheng adds, and in the context of Asia, this is the concept of what constitutes an eco-city to begin with. Conventional models prescribe a village-like, self-sufficient ecosystem, but this cannot be applied in developing parts of the world, where policymakers at all levels face a whole suite of complex socio-economic challenges ranging from widespread poverty to resource scarcity.Instead, what is needed is a compact, high-density model that utilises economies of scale for resource and energy efficiency \u2013 such as many cities in Asia are already implementing.\"A lot of people would criticise Singapore as a country for being non-self-sustainable,\" says Cheng, who has himself been involved in the planning of one of these eco-cities, the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City. \"But in 2010, we proposed at the Venice Architecture Biennale that if the whole world followed Singapore's model, only 0.5% of the Earth's area would be needed to house the population.\"Ultimately, he says, the relevant question for public and private sector alike is not whether a city or country can achieve some benchmark. \"Being sustainable is about socio-economic as well as environmental development. It's almost like a journey. We need to ask ourselves: are we as sustainable as we can be?\"Mint Kang is a writer at Eco-Business.com This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Planning permission for the development in question was granted only in February.Like the man said, these super rich investors are, \"Buying for capital growth and as a safe haven.\" That's one way the London housing price bubble stays inflated. The other way is lack of supply. Not much sign of either changing. Fitzrovia News adds:Permission was given for the development in February after [Westminster] City Hall's planning committee agreed to a contribution of affordable housing provision, amounting to 17.4 percent of the total residential floorspace on-site plus \u00a35.94m towards the City Council's affordable housing fund.Planning policy normally requires that 25 percent of the apartments should be affordable housing, but a larger contribution of affordable housing was rejected by Exemplar who argued that it was not viable to provide any more. Westminster's planning committee agreed...The development...was given planning permission in the face of huge opposition from people living around the site.More on that here. Meanwhile, Westminster's new leader Philippa Roe has strongly refuted the charge that government housing benefit caps are leading to the alleged \"social cleansing\" of poorer residents, despite its own research forecasting that these might oblige a fifth of the borough's primary school pupils to move to somewhere cheaper. As the Guardian reported in March:Addressing the consequences from the cap in the private rented sector, she [Roe] retorts: \"Even in that sector we have a 45% 'churn', so even if the worst predictions are realised and every single person living in a property with rents above the cap had to move \u2013 it's less than 10% additional 'churn' in one year.\"\"Furthermore, one-bedroom flats are readily available beneath the cap in Westminster,\" she says. \"Two-bed flats you can get in some of the less expensive areas. It's only the larger properties [three and four bed homes] where people are going to have to move, and 50% of the people affected by the cap are in one-bed properties. We are seeing rents coming down. We've been negotiating with landlords, sometimes reducing rents from \u00a3800 to \u00a3400 a week.\"And she insists other nearby London boroughs can take up the slack. \"Even if people do have to move, they don't have to move very far - Camden, Brent, Southwark, Lambeth are on our doorstep and there are properties in those areas beneath the cap.\"A Westminster council officer has explained to those affected: \"To live in Westminster is a privilege, not a right.\" No-one suggests that these issues are straightforward.

Why the IRS and not the INS? Because the point of the list is not simply to keep track of who's in and who's out.The point of the list is to potentially bring shame on rich people who renounce their citizenship to dodge taxes.For one Facebook billionaire, the shaming deterrent appears to have been ineffectual.The most recent IRS list was published on 30 April. It contains 460 names. And if you scroll down to \"S,\" you find the name of one very, very rich person: Eduardo Luiz Saverin, the Facebook co-founder who still owns an estimated 4% of the company.Saverin's presence on the list was first reported by Bloomberg.With Facebook about to roll out an IPO, Saverin's 4% stake \u2013 worth about $3.8bn, if the IPO valuation holds \u2013 might leave him open to a major tax bill.Now Saverin, who is becoming a legal resident of Singapore, will face a significantly reduced US tax bill at the time of the IPO. Singapore does not have a capital gains tax.The Brazilian-born Saverin moved to the United States in 1992 and became a citizen in 1998. Three years ago he moved to Singapore, where he has set about doing the sorts of things that one imagines 30-year-old billionaires do, the Wall Street Journal reported last week:\"Mr. Saverin is regularly spotted lounging with models and wealthy friends at local night clubs, racking up tens of thousands of dollars in bar tabs by ordering bottles of Cristal Champagne and Belvedere vodka, according to people present on these occasions. He drives a Bentley, his friends say, wears expensive jackets and lives in one of Singapore's priciest penthouse apartments.\"Reporting on the IRS list of former US citizens earlier this week, the New York Times noted that the number of Americans renouncing their citizenship has increased in recent years:\"According to the international tax lawyer, Andrew Mitchel, the number of Americans renouncing their citizenship rose to 1,781 in 2011 from 231 in 2008 \u2026 According to Andrew Mitchel's research, the sharp rise in Americans renouncing their citizenship since 2008 is less pronounced than it appears if one looks at the full range of data available since 1997, when it first was collected.

But Sydney Sekeramayi, the state security minister, told the NewsDay newspaper: \"It's just the wish of our detractors. The president is alive and well.\" Other media reports quoted Webster Shamu, Zimbabwe's information minister, as saying: \"It's a lot of hogwash.\"Two senior officials from Mugabe's Zanu-PF party also denied the report, which originated on a small news site, the Zimbabwe Mail, claiming that Mugabe was \"battling for his life\" in a Singapore hospital. They said he was on an Easter break with his family.\"The president is well and away on a private holiday to help his daughter prepare for postgraduate studies, but we are expecting him home this week,\" one of the officials told Reuters. \"But some sick and malicious people are spreading false stories about him being seriously ill while others are saying he is dead or dying out there.\"The two officials confirmed Mugabe was in Singapore but declined to give any further details. Asked whether the president had also used his 10-day trip for a medical checkup, one said: \"We are not going to be engaged over rumours, speculation and wishful thinking.\"The president is reportedly in Hong Kong, on his way home. One of the officials said he was expected to chair a rescheduled cabinet session on Thursday.Mugabe has been in power for nearly 32 years, making him one of Africa's longest serving leaders. His health is a subject of ever-intensifying speculation. Witnesses have described him as looking ill and falling asleep at meetings. A June 2008 US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks suggested he was suffering from prostate cancer. His increasingly frequent trips to east Asia are widely assumed to include specialised medical care.But in an interview on state radio for his 88th birthday in February, Mugabe joked: \"I have died many times. That's where I have beaten Christ. Christ died once and resurrected once; I am as fit as a fiddle.\"The latest scare appears to have been triggered by a terse government statement saying a weekly cabinet meeting set for Tuesday had been postponed to Thursday.As is now also common with rumours over Nelson Mandela's health, the story quickly hit Twitter like a runaway train and spread to international media. Among the first to urge caution was Trevor Ncube, a leading Zimbabwean publisher, who posted: \"Please note that the source of the Mugabe rumour story is not a reliable one.\"By Monday night, the Zimbabwe Mail had published a fresh story, headlined \"Ailing Mugabe returns home Wednesday\". It quoted a member of the Zanu-PF politburo as saying: \"The president is on his Easter holidays, like everyone else. He returns to his post this week, at the same time as those who are asking about his whereabouts from their holiday hideouts.\"Mugabe is the only leader independent Zimbabwe has known. Questions over his health gain added urgency because of perpetual uncertainty about who will succeed him. .On Monday night, Andrew Meldrum, a former Guardian correspondent who reported from Zimbabwe for over two decades, blogged on the Globalpost site: \"Over the years there have been so many rumours about Robert Mugabe's ill health and impending death that journalists in Harare have become used to urgent phone calls from their editors who claim they have it on good authority that Mugabe has died or is on his deathbed. They clamour for a story of the dictator's demise.\"I've received many of those phone calls myself and have made many late-night calls to hospitals, doctors, members of Mugabe's cabinet and his Zanu-PF party, trying to get confirmation or denial of the reports of his death.\"And then Mugabe shows up, jaunty and outspoken, dashing the reports \u2026 until the next set of rumours surface \u2026 I remember when everyone was convinced that he suffered from inoperable throat cancer, when actually he was hoarse from a series of speaking engagements.\"", "tags": ["Robert Mugabe", "Zimbabwe", "Africa", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Zimbabwe regime dismisses Mugabe deathbed reports"},{"date": "2012-04-24T15:22:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "The short conversations you have with taxi drivers reveal a great deal about a city's character. In Milan, where I have discussed Armani and Dolce & Gabanna with Italian cabbies, the local fashion scene is covered with aplomb. In Singapore, while in the city to attend Men's fashion week, my chat about the country's biggest fashion event drew a blank with drivers. Instead, they were more interested in talking about what a mollycoddled generation Singapore has produced in its youth.Singapore has the highest concentration of millionaires and shopping malls in the world, but relatively few locals have had an interest in high fashion or the arts. I remember my frustrations growing up in Singapore in the early 2000s; my hunger for creative energy could only be satiated through copies of Vogue and Dazed & Confused. Today, however, change is in the air. The government is charging towards their goal to become a global arts hub by 2015. This is 'arts' in the broadest sense: the ban on casinos has been dropped, and locations such as Marina Bay Sands, a venue for the fashion weeks, have begun to attract international attention. \"We no longer want to be the Switzerland of the world, but the Monte Carlo of the world,\" said one local friend in a humourous but accurate remark.This men's fashion week (MFW) was the first of its kind in Asia, devised by Singaporean philanthropist and entrepreneur, Frank Cintamani, who set the ball rolling when he flew a group of Parisian couturiers to Singapore last October for the city's first Haute Couture week. The agenda for 2012 was to bring music and menswear together \u2013 \"Who is Lady Gaga without the fashion she wears?\" Cintamani quipped. The budget for this year is $8 million SPD (\u00a34 million), highlighting the scale of the project. \"We're making the first serious attempt to marry fashion and music,\" Cintamani, looking sharp in a Givenchy suit, tells me when I meet him during MFW. \"But the same objective remains \u2013 that this is a platform for Asian menswear designers.\" Is roping in a whole other industry a bit too much too soon? \"I couldn't wait half a generation before this picked up, I needed to inject the music component to propel it to the next level. It needs to be ten times the scale of what it is,\" he adds. MFW found sponsorship this year from brands such as Aston Martin and Leica.What the majority of designers at MFW brought to menswear were new possibilities to be both comfortable and stylish. Approaching the music and menswear element most holistically was Hisashi Fukatami's label Diet Butcher Slim Skin, inspired by the experimental compositions of pianist H Zett M, who gave a live performance while the Japanese designer spun electro sounds on stage. The collection made combat style chic, with a touch of romanticism. Three-piece suits were fresh with cropped trousers, particularly in the ombr\u00e9s and embroidered linen. Another highlight came from Korean brand Beyond Closet, where designer Tae Yong used American sportswear to inject humour into the workplace \u2013 his opening look rather strangely but successfully spliced an old-fashioned blazer with elements from a varsity jacket, while another style elongated the baseball jacket to knee-length. One of more directional collections came from Britain's Bodybound, if perhaps aided by the buzz in the build-up to their show: Royal College of Art-educated Kim Choong-Wilkins \u2013 whose mother is of Singaporean descent \u2013 and Pliny Champion created a new collection that expanded on ideas from their home show, but a pair of clear PVC culottes set tongues wagging: Will they, won't they show bums? They covered up in the end, which served as a benign reminder that this is the country that issues penalties for public indecency. \"We didn't want it to be a statement for the sake of it,\" Champion said. The collection overturned traditional menswear with a considered jam on rivets, studs, transparency and metallic knits. But where is the local talent? Of the 19 designers chosen, just one \u2013 Reckless Ericka \u2013 could be truly considered Singaporean. The small island has always struggled with its own design scene; it is now playing its strength as an efficient melting point \u2013 \"a postmodern pastiche of the best bits,\" Charlie Casely-Hayford remarked. Afton Chen and Louis Koh, the duo behind the label, displayed great construction skills, creating volume and drama out of the lightest of fabrics (a must in the tropics) and received a well-deserved standing ovation.So does the Singapore approach represent a new future for fashion shows? Among attendees, there was some discussion as to whether the Singapore Men's fashion week is bringing back a charm that is lost and occasionally reminisced about\u2013 where professionals, with ever-increasing hunger for newness, dart in and out the European shows. \"At least there's entertainment here instead of all the waiting around and chaos in London \u2013 it's never this relaxing!\" another London-based journalist said to me, as K-pop group Se7en took the stage in between the catwalk shows. But as well as a dearth in homegrown designers, the music-fashion fusion puzzled some designers and industry attendees. Each fashion show was followed by a performance from K-pop and Asian stars throughout the five-day event. Never mind that I knew little of the artists or the songs; the energy sometimes failed to penetrate several guests as seats emptied after each designer's bow. The event's ambitions were grand; the 220,000 square feet venue was significant, though of what was fundamentally a showcase of 19 designers over five days, the result sometimes felt a little underwhelming. But let's remember that it took 20 years for power players to start taking London fashion week seriously. Like every new kid on the block, Singapore needs to offer something original to gain credibility. What I can be sure of is that Cintamani and Singapore have this in common: what they say they'll do, they will get done. And there certainly exists a growing group of locals tired of hearing what a cultural desert the country is. Within the next few years, Singapore's cab drivers may well become rather more fashion-literate.\u2022 This article was modified at 09:57 on 25 April to correct the spelling of Reckless Erika.

In Singapore, however, a city obsessed with order and where \"vandals\" can be flogged, 27-year-old Samantha Lo \u2013 the so-called \"Sticker Lady\" \u2013 has inspired a massive online campaign after being arrested for posting stickers.Lo, founder of an online arts magazine, has been arrested for sticking messages on traffic signal buttons, including \"Press to Time Travel\" or \"Press to Stop Time\", as well as on suspicion of painting messages on roads reading \"My Grandfather Road\" \u2013 a Singaporean pun on bad driving and, some believe, the out-of-touch government of Singapore.Lo's arrest, which has been condemned by more than 14,000 people who have signed an online petition calling for leniency in the way she is treated, has triggered deep soul-searching in the city state, which is infamous for its enforcement of strict social order and banned the sale of chewing gum to keep its pavements clean.If charged under Singapore's draconian 1966 vandalism law, Lo could face up to three years in jail and a $2,000 (\u00a31,000) fine. Men who are convicted, even of first offences, also receive three strokes of the cane.Lo's stickers first appeared earlier this year, and included a monochrome image of an older man stylised in black-and-white, with the word \"Limpeh\" \u2013 meaning \"your father\" \u2013 which is sometimes used as a rude phrase in Singapore. Some have suggested that the man bears a resemblance to Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding statesman.While Lo herself was unavailable for comment, an online petition has attracted a large number of comments criticising Singapore's repressive laws. \"Creativity requires a little chaos,\" wrote one poster, while another, named Gene Ho, argues: \"I think it's tastefully done. Not political nor damaging to the nation. In fact, by issuing a fine or caning sentence shows just how tight-assed and conservative the nation is. Supporting the arts you say? Why not open up your minds first. Laugh at yourselves a little and maybe you will really understand what art is. It's not just ballet or drama or a che che symphonic event. It's more than that. So take the stick out of your asses and let the girl go. She's helped a lot of creatives open up.\"In a statement, however, Singapore's police insisted, \"the case is classified as vandalism\", adding that offenders would be dealt with severely.Defending the tough line, a police spokesman told a Singaporean website that it had diverted \"substantial resources to identify the suspect involved\" and carried out \"intensive inquiries and legwork\".\"This is on top of the considerable time, effort and cost to clean up the roads and affected areas. Vandalising public property is a very irresponsible act. Offenders will be dealt with in accordance with the law.\"In the escalating row over her treatment \u2013 in a country where locksmiths and other small businesses regularly put up advertising stickers but are rarely prosecuted \u2013 Lo has attracted the support of several members of Singapore's parliament, among them Janice Koh, who has compared Lo's work with that of the British street artist Banksy. She called on the authorities to handle the case \"with a light touch\".Koh said: \"It is almost impossible to talk about developing a culturally vibrant, creative or lovable city, without some tolerance for those slightly messy activities that sometimes challenge the rules. For Singapore, it would be useful to make a distinction between this kind of art and outright graffiti or vandalism that seeks to deliberately destroy public property for its own sake.\"Not all those who have commented publicly, however, have been so tolerant, with a number calling for Lo to be punished under the vandalism law.One, Ann Hee Kyet, insisted: \"This is definitely vandalism. Stop hiding behind the excuse of art. The stickers are creative and cheeky, in the style of schoolgirl pranks. If we allow such acts to go unpunished, more people would be encouraged to try their own versions.\"", "tags": ["Singapore", "Art", "Banksy", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Art and design"], "title": "Strict Singapore divided by arrest of its own Banksy"},{"date": "2012-05-10T11:28:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Sustainability, says Cheng Hsing Yao of Singapore's Centre for Liveable Cities, is like an iceberg. Underneath the hard exterior of a city's infrastructure, such as green buildings or energy-efficient power grids, a whole host of factors from extensive master planning to urban governance support it.From the thinktank's perspective, says Cheng, governance is key. One of the fundamental roles of government is to provide a broader framework whereby the private sector can participate actively in the building of harmonious cities, where the spatial, social and environmental aspects of a city are of equal importance.\"The private sector wants clarity, certainty, some predictability. So, the government has to come up with the overall vision; create plans and policies that make that vision attractive to the private sector; and make those plans and policies transparent and credible,\" he says in an interview.In Singapore, one way the government achieves this is by opening sustainability projects to public tender, thus ensuring that such projects are benchmarked at a level feasible for private companies.A 2011 tender for the development of a major desalination plant, for example, was deliberately scoped to allow private sector participation \u2013 it was won by water management company Hyflux. Similarly, the design and development of the city-state's latest integrated resort Marina Bay Sands, which has received accolades for its eco-friendly practices, was carried out privately but according to the government's vision for the site.There is, of course, still more room for private sector participation above and beyond following the governmental lead. Cheng, an architect by profession who previously spent 13 years with Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority, cites green buildings, which have caught on in the city-state because developers see them as a way of selling projects. The infrastructure is widespread, but the mindset still has to catch up: there is room for improvement in the way these buildings are managed.\"To me, you can do good and do well at the same time,\" he says. \"It is not a bad thing to try to align private profit objectives with the greater good. When we introduce guidelines and legislation, we level the playing field and encourage the private sector to participate much more easily.\"The public sector must take the lead not just at the infrastructural and policy level, he adds. The next step: leaders at the city level will increasingly become more like CEOs, taking on a managing role and influencing the cities' push towards sustainability. Already, eco-cities are springing up across Asia and sustainability proposals are pouring out of major urban centres such as Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.\"We are entering an era of cities.

They said he was on an Easter break with his family.\"The president is well and away on a private holiday to help his daughter prepare for postgraduate studies, but we are expecting him home this week,\" one of the officials told Reuters. \"But some sick and malicious people are spreading false stories about him being seriously ill while others are saying he is dead or dying out there.\"The two officials confirmed Mugabe was in Singapore but declined to give any further details.

His health is a subject of ever-intensifying speculation. Witnesses have described him as looking ill and falling asleep at meetings. A June 2008 US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks suggested he was suffering from prostate cancer. His increasingly frequent trips to east Asia are widely assumed to include specialised medical care.But in an interview on state radio for his 88th birthday in February, Mugabe joked: \"I have died many times. That's where I have beaten Christ. Christ died once and resurrected once; I am as fit as a fiddle.\"The latest scare appears to have been triggered by a terse government statement saying a weekly cabinet meeting set for Tuesday had been postponed to Thursday.As is now also common with rumours over Nelson Mandela's health, the story quickly hit Twitter like a runaway train and spread to international media.

Questions over his health gain added urgency because of perpetual uncertainty about who will succeed him. .On Monday night, Andrew Meldrum, a former Guardian correspondent who reported from Zimbabwe for over two decades, blogged on the Globalpost site: \"Over the years there have been so many rumours about Robert Mugabe's ill health and impending death that journalists in Harare have become used to urgent phone calls from their editors who claim they have it on good authority that Mugabe has died or is on his deathbed.

It was initially reported as being of 8.9 magnitude but was downgraded shortly after it hit. A 6.5-magnitude aftershock has since been reported.Traffic jams were reported in Aceh, where people scrambled for higher ground as sirens mingled with sounds from the mosques, Reuters reported. A rescue team from Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency was sent to the region to help.Officials in the neighbouring countries of Thailand, Malaysia and India issued precautionary evacuation orders along coastal regions. Thailand temporarily closed Phuket airport, according to local media, with warnings of waves up to 4 metres (13ft) in height hitting the holiday islands of Phuket and Krabi, although no tsunami waves have yet been reported.Tremors, some lasting for as long as five minutes, were felt across south-east Asia after the earthquake hit. Reports on Twitter described employees rushing out of office buildings and families looking for safety as far away as Rangoon, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Singapore, India and Sri Lanka.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) said an alert had been issued for 28 countries, including Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iran and Oman. An updated warning said sea-level readings indicated that a tsunami measuring 17cms (6.7ins) had been generated but that if no major waves had occurred \"for at least two hours after the estimated arrival time, or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours, then local authorities can assume the threat is passed\".It warned, however, that damage to boats and coastal structures could continue, owing to rapid currents.The PTWC lifted the tsunami warning for most areas of the Indian Ocean about four hours after the first quake.Bruce Presgrave of the USGS told the BBC a destructive tsunami was less likely because the quake had been caused by the earth moving horizontally instead of vertically.Indonesia sits above the ring of fire, a series of fault lines which make the archipelago nation of roughly 18,000 islands prone to volcanic and seismic activity.The 9.1-magnitude quake that occurred on Boxing Day 2004 triggered a tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed 230,000 people, nearly three-quarters of whom were in Aceh.Esmer Golluoglu is a pseudonym for a journalist working in Rangoon ", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Earthquakes", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather"], "title": "Indonesia lifts tsunami alert after 8.6-magnitude earthquake"},{"date": "2012-04-24T15:22:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "The short conversations you have with taxi drivers reveal a great deal about a city's character. In Milan, where I have discussed Armani and Dolce & Gabanna with Italian cabbies, the local fashion scene is covered with aplomb. In Singapore, while in the city to attend Men's fashion week, my chat about the country's biggest fashion event drew a blank with drivers. Instead, they were more interested in talking about what a mollycoddled generation Singapore has produced in its youth.Singapore has the highest concentration of millionaires and shopping malls in the world, but relatively few locals have had an interest in high fashion or the arts. I remember my frustrations growing up in Singapore in the early 2000s; my hunger for creative energy could only be satiated through copies of Vogue and Dazed & Confused. Today, however, change is in the air. The government is charging towards their goal to become a global arts hub by 2015. This is 'arts' in the broadest sense: the ban on casinos has been dropped, and locations such as Marina Bay Sands, a venue for the fashion weeks, have begun to attract international attention. \"We no longer want to be the Switzerland of the world, but the Monte Carlo of the world,\" said one local friend in a humourous but accurate remark.This men's fashion week (MFW) was the first of its kind in Asia, devised by Singaporean philanthropist and entrepreneur, Frank Cintamani, who set the ball rolling when he flew a group of Parisian couturiers to Singapore last October for the city's first Haute Couture week. The agenda for 2012 was to bring music and menswear together \u2013 \"Who is Lady Gaga without the fashion she wears?\" Cintamani quipped. The budget for this year is $8 million SPD (\u00a34 million), highlighting the scale of the project. \"We're making the first serious attempt to marry fashion and music,\" Cintamani, looking sharp in a Givenchy suit, tells me when I meet him during MFW. \"But the same objective remains \u2013 that this is a platform for Asian menswear designers.\" Is roping in a whole other industry a bit too much too soon? \"I couldn't wait half a generation before this picked up, I needed to inject the music component to propel it to the next level. It needs to be ten times the scale of what it is,\" he adds. MFW found sponsorship this year from brands such as Aston Martin and Leica.What the majority of designers at MFW brought to menswear were new possibilities to be both comfortable and stylish. Approaching the music and menswear element most holistically was Hisashi Fukatami's label Diet Butcher Slim Skin, inspired by the experimental compositions of pianist H Zett M, who gave a live performance while the Japanese designer spun electro sounds on stage. The collection made combat style chic, with a touch of romanticism. Three-piece suits were fresh with cropped trousers, particularly in the ombr\u00e9s and embroidered linen. Another highlight came from Korean brand Beyond Closet, where designer Tae Yong used American sportswear to inject humour into the workplace \u2013 his opening look rather strangely but successfully spliced an old-fashioned blazer with elements from a varsity jacket, while another style elongated the baseball jacket to knee-length. One of more directional collections came from Britain's Bodybound, if perhaps aided by the buzz in the build-up to their show: Royal College of Art-educated Kim Choong-Wilkins \u2013 whose mother is of Singaporean descent \u2013 and Pliny Champion created a new collection that expanded on ideas from their home show, but a pair of clear PVC culottes set tongues wagging: Will they, won't they show bums? They covered up in the end, which served as a benign reminder that this is the country that issues penalties for public indecency. \"We didn't want it to be a statement for the sake of it,\" Champion said. The collection overturned traditional menswear with a considered jam on rivets, studs, transparency and metallic knits. But where is the local talent? Of the 19 designers chosen, just one \u2013 Reckless Ericka \u2013 could be truly considered Singaporean. The small island has always struggled with its own design scene; it is now playing its strength as an efficient melting point \u2013 \"a postmodern pastiche of the best bits,\" Charlie Casely-Hayford remarked. Afton Chen and Louis Koh, the duo behind the label, displayed great construction skills, creating volume and drama out of the lightest of fabrics (a must in the tropics) and received a well-deserved standing ovation.So does the Singapore approach represent a new future for fashion shows? Among attendees, there was some discussion as to whether the Singapore Men's fashion week is bringing back a charm that is lost and occasionally reminisced about\u2013 where professionals, with ever-increasing hunger for newness, dart in and out the European shows. \"At least there's entertainment here instead of all the waiting around and chaos in London \u2013 it's never this relaxing!\" another London-based journalist said to me, as K-pop group Se7en took the stage in between the catwalk shows. But as well as a dearth in homegrown designers, the music-fashion fusion puzzled some designers and industry attendees. Each fashion show was followed by a performance from K-pop and Asian stars throughout the five-day event. Never mind that I knew little of the artists or the songs; the energy sometimes failed to penetrate several guests as seats emptied after each designer's bow. The event's ambitions were grand; the 220,000 square feet venue was significant, though of what was fundamentally a showcase of 19 designers over five days, the result sometimes felt a little underwhelming. But let's remember that it took 20 years for power players to start taking London fashion week seriously. Like every new kid on the block, Singapore needs to offer something original to gain credibility. What I can be sure of is that Cintamani and Singapore have this in common: what they say they'll do, they will get done. And there certainly exists a growing group of locals tired of hearing what a cultural desert the country is. Within the next few years, Singapore's cab drivers may well become rather more fashion-literate.\u2022 This article was modified at 09:57 on 25 April to correct the spelling of Reckless Erika.

In Singapore, however, a city obsessed with order and where \"vandals\" can be flogged, 27-year-old Samantha Lo \u2013 the so-called \"Sticker Lady\" \u2013 has inspired a massive online campaign after being arrested for posting stickers.Lo, founder of an online arts magazine, has been arrested for sticking messages on traffic signal buttons, including \"Press to Time Travel\" or \"Press to Stop Time\", as well as on suspicion of painting messages on roads reading \"My Grandfather Road\" \u2013 a Singaporean pun on bad driving and, some believe, the out-of-touch government of Singapore.Lo's arrest, which has been condemned by more than 14,000 people who have signed an online petition calling for leniency in the way she is treated, has triggered deep soul-searching in the city state, which is infamous for its enforcement of strict social order and banned the sale of chewing gum to keep its pavements clean.If charged under Singapore's draconian 1966 vandalism law, Lo could face up to three years in jail and a $2,000 (\u00a31,000) fine. Men who are convicted, even of first offences, also receive three strokes of the cane.Lo's stickers first appeared earlier this year, and included a monochrome image of an older man stylised in black-and-white, with the word \"Limpeh\" \u2013 meaning \"your father\" \u2013 which is sometimes used as a rude phrase in Singapore. Some have suggested that the man bears a resemblance to Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding statesman.While Lo herself was unavailable for comment, an online petition has attracted a large number of comments criticising Singapore's repressive laws. \"Creativity requires a little chaos,\" wrote one poster, while another, named Gene Ho, argues: \"I think it's tastefully done. Not political nor damaging to the nation. In fact, by issuing a fine or caning sentence shows just how tight-assed and conservative the nation is. Supporting the arts you say? Why not open up your minds first. Laugh at yourselves a little and maybe you will really understand what art is. It's not just ballet or drama or a che che symphonic event. It's more than that. So take the stick out of your asses and let the girl go. She's helped a lot of creatives open up.\"In a statement, however, Singapore's police insisted, \"the case is classified as vandalism\", adding that offenders would be dealt with severely.Defending the tough line, a police spokesman told a Singaporean website that it had diverted \"substantial resources to identify the suspect involved\" and carried out \"intensive inquiries and legwork\".\"This is on top of the considerable time, effort and cost to clean up the roads and affected areas. Vandalising public property is a very irresponsible act. Offenders will be dealt with in accordance with the law.\"In the escalating row over her treatment \u2013 in a country where locksmiths and other small businesses regularly put up advertising stickers but are rarely prosecuted \u2013 Lo has attracted the support of several members of Singapore's parliament, among them Janice Koh, who has compared Lo's work with that of the British street artist Banksy. She called on the authorities to handle the case \"with a light touch\".Koh said: \"It is almost impossible to talk about developing a culturally vibrant, creative or lovable city, without some tolerance for those slightly messy activities that sometimes challenge the rules. For Singapore, it would be useful to make a distinction between this kind of art and outright graffiti or vandalism that seeks to deliberately destroy public property for its own sake.\"Not all those who have commented publicly, however, have been so tolerant, with a number calling for Lo to be punished under the vandalism law.One, Ann Hee Kyet, insisted: \"This is definitely vandalism. Stop hiding behind the excuse of art. The stickers are creative and cheeky, in the style of schoolgirl pranks. If we allow such acts to go unpunished, more people would be encouraged to try their own versions.\"", "tags": ["Singapore", "Art", "Banksy", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Art and design"], "title": "Strict Singapore divided by arrest of its own Banksy"},{"date": "2012-05-10T11:28:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Sustainability, says Cheng Hsing Yao of Singapore's Centre for Liveable Cities, is like an iceberg. Underneath the hard exterior of a city's infrastructure, such as green buildings or energy-efficient power grids, a whole host of factors from extensive master planning to urban governance support it.From the thinktank's perspective, says Cheng, governance is key. One of the fundamental roles of government is to provide a broader framework whereby the private sector can participate actively in the building of harmonious cities, where the spatial, social and environmental aspects of a city are of equal importance.\"The private sector wants clarity, certainty, some predictability. So, the government has to come up with the overall vision; create plans and policies that make that vision attractive to the private sector; and make those plans and policies transparent and credible,\" he says in an interview.In Singapore, one way the government achieves this is by opening sustainability projects to public tender, thus ensuring that such projects are benchmarked at a level feasible for private companies.A 2011 tender for the development of a major desalination plant, for example, was deliberately scoped to allow private sector participation \u2013 it was won by water management company Hyflux. Similarly, the design and development of the city-state's latest integrated resort Marina Bay Sands, which has received accolades for its eco-friendly practices, was carried out privately but according to the government's vision for the site.There is, of course, still more room for private sector participation above and beyond following the governmental lead. Cheng, an architect by profession who previously spent 13 years with Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority, cites green buildings, which have caught on in the city-state because developers see them as a way of selling projects. The infrastructure is widespread, but the mindset still has to catch up: there is room for improvement in the way these buildings are managed.\"To me, you can do good and do well at the same time,\" he says. \"It is not a bad thing to try to align private profit objectives with the greater good. When we introduce guidelines and legislation, we level the playing field and encourage the private sector to participate much more easily.\"The public sector must take the lead not just at the infrastructural and policy level, he adds. The next step: leaders at the city level will increasingly become more like CEOs, taking on a managing role and influencing the cities' push towards sustainability. Already, eco-cities are springing up across Asia and sustainability proposals are pouring out of major urban centres such as Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.\"We are entering an era of cities. This is where the action is taking place, where a lot of economic and intellectual powers are concentrated. People move to cities because the opportunities are there. Urbanisation will take place at the edges of the cities \u2013 when we talk about China urbanising, for example, it's not an overall transformation but an expansion of existing cities and the growth of towns into cities.\"As this continues, leadership, institutional strength and the ability to think in the long term \u2013 rather than focusing solely on short-term development \u2013 will determine how sustainable a city can become.But there is also a major mindset change waiting in the wings, Cheng adds, and in the context of Asia, this is the concept of what constitutes an eco-city to begin with. Conventional models prescribe a village-like, self-sufficient ecosystem, but this cannot be applied in developing parts of the world, where policymakers at all levels face a whole suite of complex socio-economic challenges ranging from widespread poverty to resource scarcity.Instead, what is needed is a compact, high-density model that utilises economies of scale for resource and energy efficiency \u2013 such as many cities in Asia are already implementing.\"A lot of people would criticise Singapore as a country for being non-self-sustainable,\" says Cheng, who has himself been involved in the planning of one of these eco-cities, the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City. \"But in 2010, we proposed at the Venice Architecture Biennale that if the whole world followed Singapore's model, only 0.5% of the Earth's area would be needed to house the population.\"Ultimately, he says, the relevant question for public and private sector alike is not whether a city or country can achieve some benchmark. \"Being sustainable is about socio-economic as well as environmental development. It's almost like a journey. We need to ask ourselves: are we as sustainable as we can be?\"Mint Kang is a writer at Eco-Business.com This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Planning permission for the development in question was granted only in February.Like the man said, these super rich investors are, \"Buying for capital growth and as a safe haven.\" That's one way the London housing price bubble stays inflated. The other way is lack of supply. Not much sign of either changing. Fitzrovia News adds:Permission was given for the development in February after [Westminster] City Hall's planning committee agreed to a contribution of affordable housing provision, amounting to 17.4 percent of the total residential floorspace on-site plus \u00a35.94m towards the City Council's affordable housing fund.Planning policy normally requires that 25 percent of the apartments should be affordable housing, but a larger contribution of affordable housing was rejected by Exemplar who argued that it was not viable to provide any more. Westminster's planning committee agreed...The development...was given planning permission in the face of huge opposition from people living around the site.More on that here. Meanwhile, Westminster's new leader Philippa Roe has strongly refuted the charge that government housing benefit caps are leading to the alleged \"social cleansing\" of poorer residents, despite its own research forecasting that these might oblige a fifth of the borough's primary school pupils to move to somewhere cheaper. As the Guardian reported in March:Addressing the consequences from the cap in the private rented sector, she [Roe] retorts: \"Even in that sector we have a 45% 'churn', so even if the worst predictions are realised and every single person living in a property with rents above the cap had to move \u2013 it's less than 10% additional 'churn' in one year.\"\"Furthermore, one-bedroom flats are readily available beneath the cap in Westminster,\" she says. \"Two-bed flats you can get in some of the less expensive areas. It's only the larger properties [three and four bed homes] where people are going to have to move, and 50% of the people affected by the cap are in one-bed properties. We are seeing rents coming down. We've been negotiating with landlords, sometimes reducing rents from \u00a3800 to \u00a3400 a week.\"And she insists other nearby London boroughs can take up the slack. \"Even if people do have to move, they don't have to move very far - Camden, Brent, Southwark, Lambeth are on our doorstep and there are properties in those areas beneath the cap.\"A Westminster council officer has explained to those affected: \"To live in Westminster is a privilege, not a right.\" No-one suggests that these issues are straightforward.

It was initially reported as being of 8.9 magnitude but was downgraded shortly after it hit. A 6.5-magnitude aftershock has since been reported.Traffic jams were reported in Aceh, where people scrambled for higher ground as sirens mingled with sounds from the mosques, Reuters reported. A rescue team from Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency was sent to the region to help.Officials in the neighbouring countries of Thailand, Malaysia and India issued precautionary evacuation orders along coastal regions. Thailand temporarily closed Phuket airport, according to local media, with warnings of waves up to 4 metres (13ft) in height hitting the holiday islands of Phuket and Krabi, although no tsunami waves have yet been reported.Tremors, some lasting for as long as five minutes, were felt across south-east Asia after the earthquake hit. Reports on Twitter described employees rushing out of office buildings and families looking for safety as far away as Rangoon, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Singapore, India and Sri Lanka.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) said an alert had been issued for 28 countries, including Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iran and Oman. An updated warning said sea-level readings indicated that a tsunami measuring 17cms (6.7ins) had been generated but that if no major waves had occurred \"for at least two hours after the estimated arrival time, or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours, then local authorities can assume the threat is passed\".It warned, however, that damage to boats and coastal structures could continue, owing to rapid currents.The PTWC lifted the tsunami warning for most areas of the Indian Ocean about four hours after the first quake.Bruce Presgrave of the USGS told the BBC a destructive tsunami was less likely because the quake had been caused by the earth moving horizontally instead of vertically.Indonesia sits above the ring of fire, a series of fault lines which make the archipelago nation of roughly 18,000 islands prone to volcanic and seismic activity.The 9.1-magnitude quake that occurred on Boxing Day 2004 triggered a tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed 230,000 people, nearly three-quarters of whom were in Aceh.Esmer Golluoglu is a pseudonym for a journalist working in Rangoon ", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Earthquakes", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather"], "title": "Indonesia lifts tsunami alert after 8.6-magnitude earthquake"},{"date": "2012-06-25T18:16:01Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "The Liberal Democrats' fugitive donor was located by police in a Caribbean hideaway because he was desperate to receive medicines for his dog who is named after the party's former leader, Charles Kennedy.Michael Brown, who gave the party \u00a32.4m of stolen money, had been on the run for nearly four years when he told a business associate the address of his Dominican Republic bolthole as he grew increasingly concerned by tics infesting his alsatian-rottweiler cross Charlie.Bill Chua, a businessman from Singapore who is owed $140,000 (\u00a390,000) by Brown, claims he sent medicine for Charlie. But he also told City of London police the address, enabling detectives to close down bank accounts and forcing Brown to leave his villa.The disclosure explains for the first time how detectives came to know the whereabouts of one of Britain's most-wanted fraudsters and pass them on to the Dominican Republic authorities and Interpol.Brown, who had been sentenced to seven years for fraud-related charges in his absence, was forced to go on the run in the Dominican Republic without access to money.On Monday, Brown, 46 was handed a further six months in jail for fleeing the UK ahead of his trial. He has started serving his sentence.Chua, an energy trader from Singapore, said that he informed police after Brown sent a fake cheque to repay a $140,000 loan. \"Brown gave me his address because he loved Charlie the dog and wanted medicines which I sent to him. But he deserves to go to jail because he is a cheap fraudster,\" Chua said.The Liberal Democrats have faced calls to repay the donation but Nick Clegg has refused to do so, saying it was received in good faith. The high court ruled in 2006 that the money was only given to the Liberal Democrats so that Brown could give himself a veneer of respectability while defrauding victims of their savings.Brown emerged from nowhere in 2005 when he gave the money to Kennedy's general election campaign. He was not registered to vote, lived abroad and was not a party member but was welcomed with open arms when he offered the party its biggest ever donation.Brown told reporters at the time that he was backing Kennedy, not the Liberal Democrats. During the election campaign, Kennedy flew around Britain in Brown's private jet, sometimes with the donor. At the birth of Kennedy's child, Brown and his wife, Sharon, sent them a hamper.But months after the election, the truth about Brown began to emerge. He had set up a fraudulent scheme to entrap high-yield investors by claiming he had guaranteed bonds. Investors including the former Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards parted with up to \u00a336m.Brown went on the run in July 2008 while awaiting trial for theft and false accounting having changed his name to Campbell-Brown and altered his appearance.Chua, 62, said he first came across Brown when the Glaswegian posed as an oil trader called Michael Campbell-Brown in spring 2008. Unbeknown to Chua, Brown was on bail, but still attempted to sell Chua 100,000 tonnes of diesel for $42m.Even then, Brown's associates were boasting about Brown's Lib Dem connections.\"I was told by the guy who set up the deal that Brown was an influential guy who had funded a political party. He was some sort of kingmaker,\" Chua said.The pair met in London, but the phoney deal fell through. Chua said he then did not hear from Brown until the end of 2010 when Brown again contacted him offering to sell diesel. By this time, he was living in the Dominican Republic but refused to give his exact address. Chua said he began to Skype with Brown regularly. They would often talk of their mutual love of dogs. \"Brown would talk about Charlie all the time. Charlie's picture was his Skype identity and he told me about how they would go for long walks on beaches,\" he said.But in February 2011, Brown contacted Chua and made a claim that, at the time, seemed plausible to Chua.Brown claimed that he had been kidnapped and said that his life was in danger if he could not raise $140,000 in ransom, Chua said.\"I was stunned. I even spoke to a kidnapper. At that point I said OK I will pay,\" Chua said.Chua sent the money to bank accounts in the Dominican Republic and the US. In May 2011, Brown again called Chua in desperation. Brown's beloved dog, Charlie, had fallen ill.\"Brown told me that his dog was ill, had terrible tics and could hardly see. He wanted me to send him some medicine. And so he gave me his address.\" Brown's Skype identitity was Charlie the dog, Chua said.Brown, it emerged, had been living in a luxurious three-bedroom villa in the exclusive resort of Punta Cana, on the eastern most tip of the country with his dog and a housekeeper.Chua the sent the medicine to Brown, but became became increasingly irate that Brown had not repaid the \"ransom\".Brown eventually sent him a cheque, but it bounced. Chua was then contacted by a businessman who told him that the man posing under the names of Campbell-Brown had escaped the UK using the name of Darren Nally and was actually Michael Brown, a wanted fraudster.Chua then contacted the British police and told them of Brown's address.Detectives closed down some of Brown's bank accounts and told the Dominican Republic police of his whereabouts, forcing Brown to flee.On Monday, at Southwark crown court, Brown was jailed for a further six months, to run consecutively with his seven-year jail term. Judge Alistair McCreath said: \"When a defendant makes a considered decision to abscond as you did he or she has shown a contemptuous disregard for that important obligation and that in itself matters.\"", "tags": ["Michael Brown", "UK news", "Liberal Democrats", "Politics", "Party funding", "Crime", "Singapore", "Dominican Republic", "World news", "Charles Kennedy"], "title": "Lib Dem fugitive donor caught after plea for dog medicine"},{"date": "2012-04-24T15:22:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "The short conversations you have with taxi drivers reveal a great deal about a city's character. In Milan, where I have discussed Armani and Dolce & Gabanna with Italian cabbies, the local fashion scene is covered with aplomb. In Singapore, while in the city to attend Men's fashion week, my chat about the country's biggest fashion event drew a blank with drivers. Instead, they were more interested in talking about what a mollycoddled generation Singapore has produced in its youth.Singapore has the highest concentration of millionaires and shopping malls in the world, but relatively few locals have had an interest in high fashion or the arts. I remember my frustrations growing up in Singapore in the early 2000s; my hunger for creative energy could only be satiated through copies of Vogue and Dazed & Confused. Today, however, change is in the air. The government is charging towards their goal to become a global arts hub by 2015. This is 'arts' in the broadest sense: the ban on casinos has been dropped, and locations such as Marina Bay Sands, a venue for the fashion weeks, have begun to attract international attention. \"We no longer want to be the Switzerland of the world, but the Monte Carlo of the world,\" said one local friend in a humourous but accurate remark.This men's fashion week (MFW) was the first of its kind in Asia, devised by Singaporean philanthropist and entrepreneur, Frank Cintamani, who set the ball rolling when he flew a group of Parisian couturiers to Singapore last October for the city's first Haute Couture week. The agenda for 2012 was to bring music and menswear together \u2013 \"Who is Lady Gaga without the fashion she wears?\" Cintamani quipped. The budget for this year is $8 million SPD (\u00a34 million), highlighting the scale of the project. \"We're making the first serious attempt to marry fashion and music,\" Cintamani, looking sharp in a Givenchy suit, tells me when I meet him during MFW. \"But the same objective remains \u2013 that this is a platform for Asian menswear designers.\" Is roping in a whole other industry a bit too much too soon? \"I couldn't wait half a generation before this picked up, I needed to inject the music component to propel it to the next level. It needs to be ten times the scale of what it is,\" he adds. MFW found sponsorship this year from brands such as Aston Martin and Leica.What the majority of designers at MFW brought to menswear were new possibilities to be both comfortable and stylish. Approaching the music and menswear element most holistically was Hisashi Fukatami's label Diet Butcher Slim Skin, inspired by the experimental compositions of pianist H Zett M, who gave a live performance while the Japanese designer spun electro sounds on stage. The collection made combat style chic, with a touch of romanticism. Three-piece suits were fresh with cropped trousers, particularly in the ombr\u00e9s and embroidered linen. Another highlight came from Korean brand Beyond Closet, where designer Tae Yong used American sportswear to inject humour into the workplace \u2013 his opening look rather strangely but successfully spliced an old-fashioned blazer with elements from a varsity jacket, while another style elongated the baseball jacket to knee-length. One of more directional collections came from Britain's Bodybound, if perhaps aided by the buzz in the build-up to their show: Royal College of Art-educated Kim Choong-Wilkins \u2013 whose mother is of Singaporean descent \u2013 and Pliny Champion created a new collection that expanded on ideas from their home show, but a pair of clear PVC culottes set tongues wagging: Will they, won't they show bums? They covered up in the end, which served as a benign reminder that this is the country that issues penalties for public indecency. \"We didn't want it to be a statement for the sake of it,\" Champion said. The collection overturned traditional menswear with a considered jam on rivets, studs, transparency and metallic knits. But where is the local talent? Of the 19 designers chosen, just one \u2013 Reckless Ericka \u2013 could be truly considered Singaporean. The small island has always struggled with its own design scene; it is now playing its strength as an efficient melting point \u2013 \"a postmodern pastiche of the best bits,\" Charlie Casely-Hayford remarked. Afton Chen and Louis Koh, the duo behind the label, displayed great construction skills, creating volume and drama out of the lightest of fabrics (a must in the tropics) and received a well-deserved standing ovation.So does the Singapore approach represent a new future for fashion shows? Among attendees, there was some discussion as to whether the Singapore Men's fashion week is bringing back a charm that is lost and occasionally reminisced about\u2013 where professionals, with ever-increasing hunger for newness, dart in and out the European shows. \"At least there's entertainment here instead of all the waiting around and chaos in London \u2013 it's never this relaxing!\" another London-based journalist said to me, as K-pop group Se7en took the stage in between the catwalk shows. But as well as a dearth in homegrown designers, the music-fashion fusion puzzled some designers and industry attendees. Each fashion show was followed by a performance from K-pop and Asian stars throughout the five-day event. Never mind that I knew little of the artists or the songs; the energy sometimes failed to penetrate several guests as seats emptied after each designer's bow. The event's ambitions were grand; the 220,000 square feet venue was significant, though of what was fundamentally a showcase of 19 designers over five days, the result sometimes felt a little underwhelming. But let's remember that it took 20 years for power players to start taking London fashion week seriously. Like every new kid on the block, Singapore needs to offer something original to gain credibility. What I can be sure of is that Cintamani and Singapore have this in common: what they say they'll do, they will get done. And there certainly exists a growing group of locals tired of hearing what a cultural desert the country is. Within the next few years, Singapore's cab drivers may well become rather more fashion-literate.\u2022 This article was modified at 09:57 on 25 April to correct the spelling of Reckless Erika.

In Singapore, however, a city obsessed with order and where \"vandals\" can be flogged, 27-year-old Samantha Lo \u2013 the so-called \"Sticker Lady\" \u2013 has inspired a massive online campaign after being arrested for posting stickers.Lo, founder of an online arts magazine, has been arrested for sticking messages on traffic signal buttons, including \"Press to Time Travel\" or \"Press to Stop Time\", as well as on suspicion of painting messages on roads reading \"My Grandfather Road\" \u2013 a Singaporean pun on bad driving and, some believe, the out-of-touch government of Singapore.Lo's arrest, which has been condemned by more than 14,000 people who have signed an online petition calling for leniency in the way she is treated, has triggered deep soul-searching in the city state, which is infamous for its enforcement of strict social order and banned the sale of chewing gum to keep its pavements clean.If charged under Singapore's draconian 1966 vandalism law, Lo could face up to three years in jail and a $2,000 (\u00a31,000) fine. Men who are convicted, even of first offences, also receive three strokes of the cane.Lo's stickers first appeared earlier this year, and included a monochrome image of an older man stylised in black-and-white, with the word \"Limpeh\" \u2013 meaning \"your father\" \u2013 which is sometimes used as a rude phrase in Singapore. Some have suggested that the man bears a resemblance to Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding statesman.While Lo herself was unavailable for comment, an online petition has attracted a large number of comments criticising Singapore's repressive laws. \"Creativity requires a little chaos,\" wrote one poster, while another, named Gene Ho, argues: \"I think it's tastefully done. Not political nor damaging to the nation. In fact, by issuing a fine or caning sentence shows just how tight-assed and conservative the nation is. Supporting the arts you say? Why not open up your minds first. Laugh at yourselves a little and maybe you will really understand what art is. It's not just ballet or drama or a che che symphonic event. It's more than that. So take the stick out of your asses and let the girl go. She's helped a lot of creatives open up.\"In a statement, however, Singapore's police insisted, \"the case is classified as vandalism\", adding that offenders would be dealt with severely.Defending the tough line, a police spokesman told a Singaporean website that it had diverted \"substantial resources to identify the suspect involved\" and carried out \"intensive inquiries and legwork\".\"This is on top of the considerable time, effort and cost to clean up the roads and affected areas. Vandalising public property is a very irresponsible act. Offenders will be dealt with in accordance with the law.\"In the escalating row over her treatment \u2013 in a country where locksmiths and other small businesses regularly put up advertising stickers but are rarely prosecuted \u2013 Lo has attracted the support of several members of Singapore's parliament, among them Janice Koh, who has compared Lo's work with that of the British street artist Banksy. She called on the authorities to handle the case \"with a light touch\".Koh said: \"It is almost impossible to talk about developing a culturally vibrant, creative or lovable city, without some tolerance for those slightly messy activities that sometimes challenge the rules. For Singapore, it would be useful to make a distinction between this kind of art and outright graffiti or vandalism that seeks to deliberately destroy public property for its own sake.\"Not all those who have commented publicly, however, have been so tolerant, with a number calling for Lo to be punished under the vandalism law.One, Ann Hee Kyet, insisted: \"This is definitely vandalism. Stop hiding behind the excuse of art. The stickers are creative and cheeky, in the style of schoolgirl pranks.

Underneath the hard exterior of a city's infrastructure, such as green buildings or energy-efficient power grids, a whole host of factors from extensive master planning to urban governance support it.From the thinktank's perspective, says Cheng, governance is key. One of the fundamental roles of government is to provide a broader framework whereby the private sector can participate actively in the building of harmonious cities, where the spatial, social and environmental aspects of a city are of equal importance.\"The private sector wants clarity, certainty, some predictability. So, the government has to come up with the overall vision; create plans and policies that make that vision attractive to the private sector; and make those plans and policies transparent and credible,\" he says in an interview.In Singapore, one way the government achieves this is by opening sustainability projects to public tender, thus ensuring that such projects are benchmarked at a level feasible for private companies.A 2011 tender for the development of a major desalination plant, for example, was deliberately scoped to allow private sector participation \u2013 it was won by water management company Hyflux. Similarly, the design and development of the city-state's latest integrated resort Marina Bay Sands, which has received accolades for its eco-friendly practices, was carried out privately but according to the government's vision for the site.There is, of course, still more room for private sector participation above and beyond following the governmental lead. Cheng, an architect by profession who previously spent 13 years with Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority, cites green buildings, which have caught on in the city-state because developers see them as a way of selling projects. The infrastructure is widespread, but the mindset still has to catch up: there is room for improvement in the way these buildings are managed.\"To me, you can do good and do well at the same time,\" he says. \"It is not a bad thing to try to align private profit objectives with the greater good. When we introduce guidelines and legislation, we level the playing field and encourage the private sector to participate much more easily.\"The public sector must take the lead not just at the infrastructural and policy level, he adds. The next step: leaders at the city level will increasingly become more like CEOs, taking on a managing role and influencing the cities' push towards sustainability. Already, eco-cities are springing up across Asia and sustainability proposals are pouring out of major urban centres such as Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.\"We are entering an era of cities. This is where the action is taking place, where a lot of economic and intellectual powers are concentrated. People move to cities because the opportunities are there. Urbanisation will take place at the edges of the cities \u2013 when we talk about China urbanising, for example, it's not an overall transformation but an expansion of existing cities and the growth of towns into cities.\"As this continues, leadership, institutional strength and the ability to think in the long term \u2013 rather than focusing solely on short-term development \u2013 will determine how sustainable a city can become.But there is also a major mindset change waiting in the wings, Cheng adds, and in the context of Asia, this is the concept of what constitutes an eco-city to begin with. Conventional models prescribe a village-like, self-sufficient ecosystem, but this cannot be applied in developing parts of the world, where policymakers at all levels face a whole suite of complex socio-economic challenges ranging from widespread poverty to resource scarcity.Instead, what is needed is a compact, high-density model that utilises economies of scale for resource and energy efficiency \u2013 such as many cities in Asia are already implementing.\"A lot of people would criticise Singapore as a country for being non-self-sustainable,\" says Cheng, who has himself been involved in the planning of one of these eco-cities, the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City. \"But in 2010, we proposed at the Venice Architecture Biennale that if the whole world followed Singapore's model, only 0.5% of the Earth's area would be needed to house the population.\"Ultimately, he says, the relevant question for public and private sector alike is not whether a city or country can achieve some benchmark. \"Being sustainable is about socio-economic as well as environmental development. It's almost like a journey. We need to ask ourselves: are we as sustainable as we can be?\"Mint Kang is a writer at Eco-Business.com This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Planning permission for the development in question was granted only in February.Like the man said, these super rich investors are, \"Buying for capital growth and as a safe haven.\" That's one way the London housing price bubble stays inflated. The other way is lack of supply. Not much sign of either changing. Fitzrovia News adds:Permission was given for the development in February after [Westminster] City Hall's planning committee agreed to a contribution of affordable housing provision, amounting to 17.4 percent of the total residential floorspace on-site plus \u00a35.94m towards the City Council's affordable housing fund.Planning policy normally requires that 25 percent of the apartments should be affordable housing, but a larger contribution of affordable housing was rejected by Exemplar who argued that it was not viable to provide any more. Westminster's planning committee agreed...The development...was given planning permission in the face of huge opposition from people living around the site.More on that here. Meanwhile, Westminster's new leader Philippa Roe has strongly refuted the charge that government housing benefit caps are leading to the alleged \"social cleansing\" of poorer residents, despite its own research forecasting that these might oblige a fifth of the borough's primary school pupils to move to somewhere cheaper. As the Guardian reported in March:Addressing the consequences from the cap in the private rented sector, she [Roe] retorts: \"Even in that sector we have a 45% 'churn', so even if the worst predictions are realised and every single person living in a property with rents above the cap had to move \u2013 it's less than 10% additional 'churn' in one year.\"\"Furthermore, one-bedroom flats are readily available beneath the cap in Westminster,\" she says. \"Two-bed flats you can get in some of the less expensive areas. It's only the larger properties [three and four bed homes] where people are going to have to move, and 50% of the people affected by the cap are in one-bed properties. We are seeing rents coming down. We've been negotiating with landlords, sometimes reducing rents from \u00a3800 to \u00a3400 a week.\"And she insists other nearby London boroughs can take up the slack. \"Even if people do have to move, they don't have to move very far - Camden, Brent, Southwark, Lambeth are on our doorstep and there are properties in those areas beneath the cap.\"A Westminster council officer has explained to those affected: \"To live in Westminster is a privilege, not a right.\" No-one suggests that these issues are straightforward.

Singapore does not have a capital gains tax.The Brazilian-born Saverin moved to the United States in 1992 and became a citizen in 1998.

But Sydney Sekeramayi, the state security minister, told the NewsDay newspaper: \"It's just the wish of our detractors. The president is alive and well.\" Other media reports quoted Webster Shamu, Zimbabwe's information minister, as saying: \"It's a lot of hogwash.\"Two senior officials from Mugabe's Zanu-PF party also denied the report, which originated on a small news site, the Zimbabwe Mail, claiming that Mugabe was \"battling for his life\" in a Singapore hospital. They said he was on an Easter break with his family.\"The president is well and away on a private holiday to help his daughter prepare for postgraduate studies, but we are expecting him home this week,\" one of the officials told Reuters. \"But some sick and malicious people are spreading false stories about him being seriously ill while others are saying he is dead or dying out there.\"The two officials confirmed Mugabe was in Singapore but declined to give any further details. Asked whether the president had also used his 10-day trip for a medical checkup, one said: \"We are not going to be engaged over rumours, speculation and wishful thinking.\"The president is reportedly in Hong Kong, on his way home. One of the officials said he was expected to chair a rescheduled cabinet session on Thursday.Mugabe has been in power for nearly 32 years, making him one of Africa's longest serving leaders. His health is a subject of ever-intensifying speculation. Witnesses have described him as looking ill and falling asleep at meetings. A June 2008 US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks suggested he was suffering from prostate cancer. His increasingly frequent trips to east Asia are widely assumed to include specialised medical care.But in an interview on state radio for his 88th birthday in February, Mugabe joked: \"I have died many times. That's where I have beaten Christ. Christ died once and resurrected once; I am as fit as a fiddle.\"The latest scare appears to have been triggered by a terse government statement saying a weekly cabinet meeting set for Tuesday had been postponed to Thursday.As is now also common with rumours over Nelson Mandela's health, the story quickly hit Twitter like a runaway train and spread to international media. Among the first to urge caution was Trevor Ncube, a leading Zimbabwean publisher, who posted: \"Please note that the source of the Mugabe rumour story is not a reliable one.\"By Monday night, the Zimbabwe Mail had published a fresh story, headlined \"Ailing Mugabe returns home Wednesday\". It quoted a member of the Zanu-PF politburo as saying: \"The president is on his Easter holidays, like everyone else. He returns to his post this week, at the same time as those who are asking about his whereabouts from their holiday hideouts.\"Mugabe is the only leader independent Zimbabwe has known. Questions over his health gain added urgency because of perpetual uncertainty about who will succeed him. .On Monday night, Andrew Meldrum, a former Guardian correspondent who reported from Zimbabwe for over two decades, blogged on the Globalpost site: \"Over the years there have been so many rumours about Robert Mugabe's ill health and impending death that journalists in Harare have become used to urgent phone calls from their editors who claim they have it on good authority that Mugabe has died or is on his deathbed. They clamour for a story of the dictator's demise.\"I've received many of those phone calls myself and have made many late-night calls to hospitals, doctors, members of Mugabe's cabinet and his Zanu-PF party, trying to get confirmation or denial of the reports of his death.\"And then Mugabe shows up, jaunty and outspoken, dashing the reports \u2026 until the next set of rumours surface \u2026 I remember when everyone was convinced that he suffered from inoperable throat cancer, when actually he was hoarse from a series of speaking engagements.\"", "tags": ["Robert Mugabe", "Zimbabwe", "Africa", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Zimbabwe regime dismisses Mugabe deathbed reports"},{"date": "2012-04-11T11:13:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "A tsunami alert has been lifted around much of the Indian Ocean after an 8.6-magnitude earthquake struck off the western coast of Aceh, northern Sumatra, triggering panic as people fled for high ground.The quake's centre was 20 miles beneath the ocean floor and about 308 miles from the provincial capital of Banda Aceh, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). It was initially reported as being of 8.9 magnitude but was downgraded shortly after it hit. A 6.5-magnitude aftershock has since been reported.Traffic jams were reported in Aceh, where people scrambled for higher ground as sirens mingled with sounds from the mosques, Reuters reported. A rescue team from Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency was sent to the region to help.Officials in the neighbouring countries of Thailand, Malaysia and India issued precautionary evacuation orders along coastal regions. Thailand temporarily closed Phuket airport, according to local media, with warnings of waves up to 4 metres (13ft) in height hitting the holiday islands of Phuket and Krabi, although no tsunami waves have yet been reported.Tremors, some lasting for as long as five minutes, were felt across south-east Asia after the earthquake hit. Reports on Twitter described employees rushing out of office buildings and families looking for safety as far away as Rangoon, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Singapore, India and Sri Lanka.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) said an alert had been issued for 28 countries, including Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iran and Oman. An updated warning said sea-level readings indicated that a tsunami measuring 17cms (6.7ins) had been generated but that if no major waves had occurred \"for at least two hours after the estimated arrival time, or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours, then local authorities can assume the threat is passed\".It warned, however, that damage to boats and coastal structures could continue, owing to rapid currents.The PTWC lifted the tsunami warning for most areas of the Indian Ocean about four hours after the first quake.Bruce Presgrave of the USGS told the BBC a destructive tsunami was less likely because the quake had been caused by the earth moving horizontally instead of vertically.Indonesia sits above the ring of fire, a series of fault lines which make the archipelago nation of roughly 18,000 islands prone to volcanic and seismic activity.The 9.1-magnitude quake that occurred on Boxing Day 2004 triggered a tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed 230,000 people, nearly three-quarters of whom were in Aceh.Esmer Golluoglu is a pseudonym for a journalist working in Rangoon ", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Earthquakes", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather"], "title": "Indonesia lifts tsunami alert after 8.6-magnitude earthquake"},{"date": "2012-06-25T18:16:01Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "The Liberal Democrats' fugitive donor was located by police in a Caribbean hideaway because he was desperate to receive medicines for his dog who is named after the party's former leader, Charles Kennedy.Michael Brown, who gave the party \u00a32.4m of stolen money, had been on the run for nearly four years when he told a business associate the address of his Dominican Republic bolthole as he grew increasingly concerned by tics infesting his alsatian-rottweiler cross Charlie.Bill Chua, a businessman from Singapore who is owed $140,000 (\u00a390,000) by Brown, claims he sent medicine for Charlie. But he also told City of London police the address, enabling detectives to close down bank accounts and forcing Brown to leave his villa.The disclosure explains for the first time how detectives came to know the whereabouts of one of Britain's most-wanted fraudsters and pass them on to the Dominican Republic authorities and Interpol.Brown, who had been sentenced to seven years for fraud-related charges in his absence, was forced to go on the run in the Dominican Republic without access to money.On Monday, Brown, 46 was handed a further six months in jail for fleeing the UK ahead of his trial. He has started serving his sentence.Chua, an energy trader from Singapore, said that he informed police after Brown sent a fake cheque to repay a $140,000 loan. \"Brown gave me his address because he loved Charlie the dog and wanted medicines which I sent to him. But he deserves to go to jail because he is a cheap fraudster,\" Chua said.The Liberal Democrats have faced calls to repay the donation but Nick Clegg has refused to do so, saying it was received in good faith. The high court ruled in 2006 that the money was only given to the Liberal Democrats so that Brown could give himself a veneer of respectability while defrauding victims of their savings.Brown emerged from nowhere in 2005 when he gave the money to Kennedy's general election campaign. He was not registered to vote, lived abroad and was not a party member but was welcomed with open arms when he offered the party its biggest ever donation.Brown told reporters at the time that he was backing Kennedy, not the Liberal Democrats. During the election campaign, Kennedy flew around Britain in Brown's private jet, sometimes with the donor. At the birth of Kennedy's child, Brown and his wife, Sharon, sent them a hamper.But months after the election, the truth about Brown began to emerge. He had set up a fraudulent scheme to entrap high-yield investors by claiming he had guaranteed bonds. Investors including the former Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards parted with up to \u00a336m.Brown went on the run in July 2008 while awaiting trial for theft and false accounting having changed his name to Campbell-Brown and altered his appearance.Chua, 62, said he first came across Brown when the Glaswegian posed as an oil trader called Michael Campbell-Brown in spring 2008. Unbeknown to Chua, Brown was on bail, but still attempted to sell Chua 100,000 tonnes of diesel for $42m.Even then, Brown's associates were boasting about Brown's Lib Dem connections.\"I was told by the guy who set up the deal that Brown was an influential guy who had funded a political party. He was some sort of kingmaker,\" Chua said.The pair met in London, but the phoney deal fell through. Chua said he then did not hear from Brown until the end of 2010 when Brown again contacted him offering to sell diesel. By this time, he was living in the Dominican Republic but refused to give his exact address. Chua said he began to Skype with Brown regularly. They would often talk of their mutual love of dogs. \"Brown would talk about Charlie all the time. Charlie's picture was his Skype identity and he told me about how they would go for long walks on beaches,\" he said.But in February 2011, Brown contacted Chua and made a claim that, at the time, seemed plausible to Chua.Brown claimed that he had been kidnapped and said that his life was in danger if he could not raise $140,000 in ransom, Chua said.\"I was stunned. I even spoke to a kidnapper. At that point I said OK I will pay,\" Chua said.Chua sent the money to bank accounts in the Dominican Republic and the US. In May 2011, Brown again called Chua in desperation. Brown's beloved dog, Charlie, had fallen ill.\"Brown told me that his dog was ill, had terrible tics and could hardly see. He wanted me to send him some medicine. And so he gave me his address.\" Brown's Skype identitity was Charlie the dog, Chua said.Brown, it emerged, had been living in a luxurious three-bedroom villa in the exclusive resort of Punta Cana, on the eastern most tip of the country with his dog and a housekeeper.Chua the sent the medicine to Brown, but became became increasingly irate that Brown had not repaid the \"ransom\".Brown eventually sent him a cheque, but it bounced. Chua was then contacted by a businessman who told him that the man posing under the names of Campbell-Brown had escaped the UK using the name of Darren Nally and was actually Michael Brown, a wanted fraudster.Chua then contacted the British police and told them of Brown's address.Detectives closed down some of Brown's bank accounts and told the Dominican Republic police of his whereabouts, forcing Brown to flee.On Monday, at Southwark crown court, Brown was jailed for a further six months, to run consecutively with his seven-year jail term. Judge Alistair McCreath said: \"When a defendant makes a considered decision to abscond as you did he or she has shown a contemptuous disregard for that important obligation and that in itself matters.\"", "tags": ["Michael Brown", "UK news", "Liberal Democrats", "Politics", "Party funding", "Crime", "Singapore", "Dominican Republic", "World news", "Charles Kennedy"], "title": "Lib Dem fugitive donor caught after plea for dog medicine"},{"date": "2012-05-20T19:00:08Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Inevitably there's a diamond jubilee angle in the BBC's coverage, which runs throughout the week.

That is probably the most common question I was asked in my childhood from any family member, friends of family and adults in general. I enjoyed answering that question. The possibilities were endless. But I also wondered why adults liked asking that question. Did they like keeping up with our fleeting, crazy answers, or did they need to reminisce on 'what could have been' for themselves?As I went through the next 19 years of conscious adult life, I understood that it was the latter. Something (call it the education system, parents or the economy) during our 'educated years' has 'uneducated' us from our sense of selves. It promoted conformity instead \u2013 often towards prescribed paths to making a living, not designing a life.While a certain level of conformity is needed for national progress, the danger of blind and excessive conformity is one of unfulfilled lives. Six years ago, as a rebellious young adult, I left Singapore because of this. Singapore is a city nation whose wealth and modernity have been attained in an impressive four decades (it is predicted to be the wealthiest nation in the world by 2050). Some would argue that it funded its speedy national progress through a general loss of individualism. I would argue that it is an innovative nation trying to find a balance of both.Ever since then, I have been obsessed with cracking the conundrum of what it takes to enable individual honesty in its highest form \u2013 to oneself; and the ecosystem factors needed to enable that to flourish in not only a permissible way, but a celebrated way. While the self part mostly revolves around self-introspection, the ecosystem part is much more complicated. Self-emergence, I found is highly dependable on the outer surrounding: family, school, neighbourhood, city and country.During my MBA year as a Skoll Scholar at the Said Business School in Oxford, I had the opportunity to mainstream the field of social entrepreneurship. Working closely with Pamela Hartigan at the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, I realised that an environment that allows people to come alive includes a concentration of intellectual content, stimulating conversations, role models, permission to experiment, tolerance for different personalities and ideologies, and a community of like-minded people.This was further heightened when I came across The HUB in San Francisco. It was then a 10,000 sq ft space in the old San Francisco Chronicle building. In that space were about a hundred entrepreneurs and non-profit leaders, impact investors and ecosystem builders, co-working on their own ideas, building ventures that have positive impact on the world. Some were chatting animatedly, others were attending start-up workshops. At one corner, an investor was being pitched to, and at another, a team was having a conference call with Ghana. Collectively, it was a kind of energy that could make anyone believe that anything is possible, and that it is fine to live by your passion and do some good for the world, even at a young age. I soon found out that The HUB is a global network of community, co-work space and events platform for individuals and teams who are using entrepreneurial approaches for sustainable impact. It existed in 30 cities, but there was none in Asia. Shocking.After 400 coffee chats and eight months of endless hours of space-finding, fund-raising and community-building, Asia's first HUB was founded in May 2012, in Singapore. I picked Singapore because of its hunger to be innovative and more so, to be a hub for social innovation. Also, if done well in Singapore, the region will follow. More personally, I wanted to address the pain point I felt in Singapore six years before.The doors of The HUB Singapore have been opened for five months to a throng of what we call 'purpose-driven individuals'. They range from technicians to social entrepreneurs, film makers to bankers, Googlers to Linked-Iners. It is not a space for any one discipline, but for any discipline. The 'intention' becomes the main filtering question to be a Hubber \u2013 not status, educational qualifications, wealth or profession. The 5,400 sq ft space in the middle of Orchard, Singapore's main lifestyle and entertainment street, has quickly become the home for the outliers. At 200-membered strong, companies, foundations and government agencies are starting to come to The HUB for entrepreneurial ideas, to meet with 'Hubbers' and to have a casual chat over Chris' coffee. The best part is that we are working with the government (National Youth Council) and this is how potential large scale change can happen.The vision is for the community to grow to 1,000 members in two years. That is 0.0002% of the five million strong population. A drop in the ocean, perhaps, but most movements, ecosystems and innovations start with a small group of individuals.The HUB Singapore seeks to be that micro-ecosystem where individuals can pursue their passions and be celebrated for it.

That is probably the most common question I was asked in my childhood from any family member, friends of family and adults in general. I enjoyed answering that question. The possibilities were endless. But I also wondered why adults liked asking that question. Did they like keeping up with our fleeting, crazy answers, or did they need to reminisce on 'what could have been' for themselves?As I went through the next 19 years of conscious adult life, I understood that it was the latter. Something (call it the education system, parents or the economy) during our 'educated years' has 'uneducated' us from our sense of selves. It promoted conformity instead \u2013 often towards prescribed paths to making a living, not designing a life.While a certain level of conformity is needed for national progress, the danger of blind and excessive conformity is one of unfulfilled lives. Six years ago, as a rebellious young adult, I left Singapore because of this. Singapore is a city nation whose wealth and modernity have been attained in an impressive four decades (it is predicted to be the wealthiest nation in the world by 2050). Some would argue that it funded its speedy national progress through a general loss of individualism. I would argue that it is an innovative nation trying to find a balance of both.Ever since then, I have been obsessed with cracking the conundrum of what it takes to enable individual honesty in its highest form \u2013 to oneself; and the ecosystem factors needed to enable that to flourish in not only a permissible way, but a celebrated way. While the self part mostly revolves around self-introspection, the ecosystem part is much more complicated. Self-emergence, I found is highly dependable on the outer surrounding: family, school, neighbourhood, city and country.During my MBA year as a Skoll Scholar at the Said Business School in Oxford, I had the opportunity to mainstream the field of social entrepreneurship. Working closely with Pamela Hartigan at the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, I realised that an environment that allows people to come alive includes a concentration of intellectual content, stimulating conversations, role models, permission to experiment, tolerance for different personalities and ideologies, and a community of like-minded people.This was further heightened when I came across The HUB in San Francisco. It was then a 10,000 sq ft space in the old San Francisco Chronicle building. In that space were about a hundred entrepreneurs and non-profit leaders, impact investors and ecosystem builders, co-working on their own ideas, building ventures that have positive impact on the world. Some were chatting animatedly, others were attending start-up workshops. At one corner, an investor was being pitched to, and at another, a team was having a conference call with Ghana. Collectively, it was a kind of energy that could make anyone believe that anything is possible, and that it is fine to live by your passion and do some good for the world, even at a young age. I soon found out that The HUB is a global network of community, co-work space and events platform for individuals and teams who are using entrepreneurial approaches for sustainable impact. It existed in 30 cities, but there was none in Asia. Shocking.After 400 coffee chats and eight months of endless hours of space-finding, fund-raising and community-building, Asia's first HUB was founded in May 2012, in Singapore. I picked Singapore because of its hunger to be innovative and more so, to be a hub for social innovation. Also, if done well in Singapore, the region will follow. More personally, I wanted to address the pain point I felt in Singapore six years before.The doors of The HUB Singapore have been opened for five months to a throng of what we call 'purpose-driven individuals'. They range from technicians to social entrepreneurs, film makers to bankers, Googlers to Linked-Iners. It is not a space for any one discipline, but for any discipline. The 'intention' becomes the main filtering question to be a Hubber \u2013 not status, educational qualifications, wealth or profession. The 5,400 sq ft space in the middle of Orchard, Singapore's main lifestyle and entertainment street, has quickly become the home for the outliers. At 200-membered strong, companies, foundations and government agencies are starting to come to The HUB for entrepreneurial ideas, to meet with 'Hubbers' and to have a casual chat over Chris' coffee. The best part is that we are working with the government (National Youth Council) and this is how potential large scale change can happen.The vision is for the community to grow to 1,000 members in two years. That is 0.0002% of the five million strong population. A drop in the ocean, perhaps, but most movements, ecosystems and innovations start with a small group of individuals.The HUB Singapore seeks to be that micro-ecosystem where individuals can pursue their passions and be celebrated for it. On a national level, it is that incubator of new thinking models, unconventional career paths, novel solutions and big ideas, a safe place for both failures and successes. It is where new options are experimented daily because the common curse of conformity is the assumption that choices are finite to the availability of existing choices, when the advancement of progress and humanity relies on choices that have not yet been imagined.Grace Sai is the co-founder of The Hub Singapore, a community and space for purpose-driven individuals, and the founder of Books for Hope, a social enterprise in the field of childrens' education.

From traffic jams and inefficient buildings to social inequality and housing, the problems are complex and hard to tackle \u2014 but not insurmountable.Some cities are forging ahead with the use of innovative urban planning, technological and governance models, showing that with the right focus and resources, cities can become \"smart\" or more sustainable.According to the latest Siemens' Green City Index for Asia, Singapore is the best-performing city in the region when measured against a range of sustainability criteria.\"Singapore is at the leading edge of sustainability,\" says Nicholas You, chairman of the World Urban Campaign Steering Committee at UN-Habitat. \"It's an island state with limited resources so it had no choice but to go green if it wanted to survive economically.\"Singapore's experiences have important lessons for other urban centres. Take its water treatment. In 1963, water functionality was shared between multiple ministries and agencies, which made it difficult to formulate a coordinated, long-term strategy.With a rising population and finite freshwater resources, action was needed, so ministers set up a national water agency, PUB, which became the sole body responsible for the collection, production, distribution and reclamation of water in the city.Today, its water operation has been transformed. Two thirds of Singapore's land surface is now a water catchment area with water stored in 17 reservoirs, including the Marina Basin, right in the heart of the city.Called NEWater, wastewater is collected and treated to produce water that's good enough to drink. This meets 30% of the city's water needs, a target that will be increased to 50% of future needs by 2060.Earlier this year, Siemens was contracted to identify CO2 reduction opportunities in transport, residential and non-industrial buildings, and IT/communications in the Tampines district.As part of the city's plan to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, Siemens will report back in 2013 with implementation costs, a plan to implement the changes and the design of pilots to trail three technological solutions.\"This will be a good test-bed for new technologies to prove what we can do,\" says Dr Roland Busch, Siemens' CEO of infrastructure and cities sector. \"It's a way to demonstrate in the highly competitive environment that is Singapore, that we can bring energy efficiency to the next level in addressing all the basic needs of cities.\"EDF and Veolia recently signed an agreement with Singapore's Housing Development Board (HDB), the city-state's largest developer, to develop software that will help it develop sustainable, urban planning solutions in HDB towns.ForCity will simulate the built environment of a city and its impact on resources, the environment, people and intervention costs to help the HDB make its towns function more efficiently and become more pleasant to live in. The tool will be trialed in the Jurong East district of Singapore.Transport is another sector that has seen investment recently. On an island of 4.8 million people with limited space, moving people around as efficiently as possible is key to its economic viability. A decade ago, city administrators warned that congestion could cost Singapore's economy $2-3bn a year if transport infrastructure was not improved.Then, there were two separate transport-charging systems in the city: road tolls and public transport, including the metro and buses. But since 2009, after a series of smart card innovations, people have been able to use e-Symphony, an IBM-designed payment card that can be used to pay for road tolls, bus travel, taxis, the metro, and even shopping.The card can process 20 million fare transactions a day and collects extensive traffic data, allowing city administrators to constantly tweak routes to ensure the most efficient journeys and minimise congestion.All these measures combine to make Singapore a smarter city. \"What we have done is to research and try to distill the principles for Singapore's success in sustainable urban development \u2013 we call it a liveability framework,\" says Khoo Teng Chye, executive director at the Centre for Liveable Cities based in Singapore.\"Quality of life, environmental sustainability and competitive economics. These are the components that make cities liveable.\"As the competition for resources increases and cities expand to accommodate rising populations, even those without the geographic constraints of Singapore will have to embrace smart city principles. If they don't, they will lose out financially, unable to attract businesses and talent from cities that do. The planet simply can't sustain current levels of resource use and environmental degradation. It's not a choice; cities have to change.This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Two thirds of Singapore's land surface is now a water catchment area with water stored in 17 reservoirs, including the Marina Basin, right in the heart of the city.Called NEWater, wastewater is collected and treated to produce water that's good enough to drink. This meets 30% of the city's water needs, a target that will be increased to 50% of future needs by 2060.Earlier this year, Siemens was contracted to identify CO2 reduction opportunities in transport, residential and non-industrial buildings, and IT/communications in the Tampines district.As part of the city's plan to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, Siemens will report back in 2013 with implementation costs, a plan to implement the changes and the design of pilots to trail three technological solutions.\"This will be a good test-bed for new technologies to prove what we can do,\" says Dr Roland Busch, Siemens' CEO of infrastructure and cities sector. \"It's a way to demonstrate in the highly competitive environment that is Singapore, that we can bring energy efficiency to the next level in addressing all the basic needs of cities.\"EDF and Veolia recently signed an agreement with Singapore's Housing Development Board (HDB), the city-state's largest developer, to develop software that will help it develop sustainable, urban planning solutions in HDB towns.ForCity will simulate the built environment of a city and its impact on resources, the environment, people and intervention costs to help the HDB make its towns function more efficiently and become more pleasant to live in. The tool will be trialed in the Jurong East district of Singapore.Transport is another sector that has seen investment recently. On an island of 4.8 million people with limited space, moving people around as efficiently as possible is key to its economic viability. A decade ago, city administrators warned that congestion could cost Singapore's economy $2-3bn a year if transport infrastructure was not improved.Then, there were two separate transport-charging systems in the city: road tolls and public transport, including the metro and buses. But since 2009, after a series of smart card innovations, people have been able to use e-Symphony, an IBM-designed payment card that can be used to pay for road tolls, bus travel, taxis, the metro, and even shopping.The card can process 20 million fare transactions a day and collects extensive traffic data, allowing city administrators to constantly tweak routes to ensure the most efficient journeys and minimise congestion.All these measures combine to make Singapore a smarter city. \"What we have done is to research and try to distill the principles for Singapore's success in sustainable urban development \u2013 we call it a liveability framework,\" says Khoo Teng Chye, executive director at the Centre for Liveable Cities based in Singapore.\"Quality of life, environmental sustainability and competitive economics.

Delta, the biggest US airline, is understood to have offered to buy Singapore Airlines' 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic which could, in turn, lead to a bid to take a majority stake away from Branson.Sources close to the negotiations confirmed weekend reports that Delta has approached Singapore over its stake, but cautioned that there is no certainty that it would bid for control of Virgin Atlantic, which Branson \u2013 who owns a 51% stake \u2013 launched in 1984.Delta's move comes as Singapore aims to draw attention away from the crowded European market and concentrate on the rapidly expanding budget airline industry in south east Asia and Australia.However, if the Delta bid is successful, any offer to Branson would need Delta to team up with its European partners at Air France-KLM because of strict EU rules which say any operator within its boundaries must be controlled by a European-based business.Branson has made no secret of his desire that Virgin should join one of the three big airline alliances to keep Virgin Atlantic competitive. However, it is unclear whether he would be willing to relinquish his majority stake, which he has held since founding the airline.During a recent trip to India he said that airline economies would push Virgin Atlantic to become \"part of a bigger alliance in the next few months\".If Delta became his Virgin Atlantic partner, it would probably join the SkyTeam alliance of 19 airlines, including Delta, KLM and Air France. The other two alliances are Star (28 airlines, including Singapore, Air Canada and South African Airways) and OneWorld, which covers British Airways, American Airlines and 10 others.Delta is thought to be keen to increase its presence in the lucrative London to New York transatlantic route. It is the third biggest operator on the route behind British Airways and Virgin Atlantic.Singapore Airlines bought its 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic in 1999 for \u00a3600m, but in October it bought a 10% stake in Branson's Virgin Australia carrier for $108.5m (\u00a371m). The deal signalled the company's intent to focus on the Far East, giving it the company's first direct stake in Australia's aviation market, where Virgin is the second biggest airline after Qantas.Scott, Singapore's low-cost airline, now accounts for one in four of all Asia Pacific flights and follows cuts by the airline to its long-haul flights between the Far East and North America.Branson has been considering Virgin's future for several years and nearly signed a deal with Air France-KLM in February 2011, having appointed Deutsche Bank to look into possible offers. He was particularly concerned by a ruling by US authorities that allowed British Airways and American Airlines to run their transatlantic businesses jointly.In 2011 he said: \"We realised for the long-term stability of Virgin Atlantic we needed to look at an alliance partner, and whether it is purely an alliance or more than an alliance we're completely undecided. Most of the people we talked to are keen to have Virgin as part of their alliance. My preference would be to keep control of the airline.\" With the BA-AA deal passed, any link-up with Delta is unlikely to face many regulatory hurdles.A spokesman for Singapore Airlines said: \"We review our investments regularly, but no decision has been made about a divestment of our shareholding in Virgin Atlantic.\"Virgin Atlantic said: \"We are always talking to many airlines on a number of different matters but we never comment on the details of these discussions\"Delta Airlines declined to comment.Sir Richard Branson formed Virgin Atlantic with US lawyer Randolph Fields more than 28 years ago, launching their maiden flight from Gatwick to Newark on 22 June 1984. Billed as a budget airline, it aimed to compete on the lucrative transatlantic market, still dominated by British Airways.The pair fell out within months, causing Branson to turn to the City for more funds. Fields left, reducing his stake to 25%. He was eventually bought out by his former partner.The company received a boost to its coffers from Branson when he sold Virgin Records in 1992 for \u00a3510m, but by 1999, with rival airlines forming worldwide alliances, Branson sold a 49% stake to Singapore Airlines for \u00a3600m.Today Virgin has 44 planes.

Energy will be provided from renewable sources, transport will be publicly provided, waste will be diverted to other uses, and the city is planned by the Malaysian government as a showcase to be copied on a bigger scale across the region.The world's urban population overtook the number of rural-dwellers for the first time in 2007, and future population growth in south-east Asia \u2013 at least 9bn people are expected to inhabit this planet by 2050, up from 7bn at present \u2013 is expected to be mainly in cities in the developing world. By far the greatest growth will be in slums, by current estimates.Iskandar Malaysia offers an alternative. The plans are for a city that not only incorporates the latest in environmentally friendly technology, but that is designed for social integration. Green spaces and areas where people can mingle and relax will improve people's mental wellbeing and encourage social cohesion, it is hoped. Skyscrapers will be mixed with low-rise buildings and small self-contained \"neighbourhoods\".Najib Razak, prime minister of Malaysia, said in a speech: \"Iskandar Malaysia [is] a smart city template \u2013 protecting the environment, promoting equitable development and addressing urban development challenges [through] the creation of smart, liveable urban communities that will yield an improved quality of life for thousands of citizens, with safer, cleaner, healthier, more affordable and more vibrant neighbourhoods, serviced by more efficient and accessible transportation systems \u2013 great destinations for businesses.\"Ellis Rubinstein, president of the New York Academy of Sciences, which is working on the \"edu-city\" university campus area, said it could be \"a model to countries needing to accommodate the social and economic needs of fast-rising populations and environmental challenges\".However, the project's developers will have to overcome significant obstacles. New eco-cities have been planned in the past, from China to the US, but most have floundered. China's Dongtan was heralded as the world's first planned eco-city, but plans have been mired in difficulty for years.

That is probably the most common question I was asked in my childhood from any family member, friends of family and adults in general. I enjoyed answering that question. The possibilities were endless. But I also wondered why adults liked asking that question. Did they like keeping up with our fleeting, crazy answers, or did they need to reminisce on 'what could have been' for themselves?As I went through the next 19 years of conscious adult life, I understood that it was the latter. Something (call it the education system, parents or the economy) during our 'educated years' has 'uneducated' us from our sense of selves. It promoted conformity instead \u2013 often towards prescribed paths to making a living, not designing a life.While a certain level of conformity is needed for national progress, the danger of blind and excessive conformity is one of unfulfilled lives. Six years ago, as a rebellious young adult, I left Singapore because of this. Singapore is a city nation whose wealth and modernity have been attained in an impressive four decades (it is predicted to be the wealthiest nation in the world by 2050). Some would argue that it funded its speedy national progress through a general loss of individualism. I would argue that it is an innovative nation trying to find a balance of both.Ever since then, I have been obsessed with cracking the conundrum of what it takes to enable individual honesty in its highest form \u2013 to oneself; and the ecosystem factors needed to enable that to flourish in not only a permissible way, but a celebrated way. While the self part mostly revolves around self-introspection, the ecosystem part is much more complicated. Self-emergence, I found is highly dependable on the outer surrounding: family, school, neighbourhood, city and country.During my MBA year as a Skoll Scholar at the Said Business School in Oxford, I had the opportunity to mainstream the field of social entrepreneurship. Working closely with Pamela Hartigan at the Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, I realised that an environment that allows people to come alive includes a concentration of intellectual content, stimulating conversations, role models, permission to experiment, tolerance for different personalities and ideologies, and a community of like-minded people.This was further heightened when I came across The HUB in San Francisco. It was then a 10,000 sq ft space in the old San Francisco Chronicle building. In that space were about a hundred entrepreneurs and non-profit leaders, impact investors and ecosystem builders, co-working on their own ideas, building ventures that have positive impact on the world. Some were chatting animatedly, others were attending start-up workshops. At one corner, an investor was being pitched to, and at another, a team was having a conference call with Ghana. Collectively, it was a kind of energy that could make anyone believe that anything is possible, and that it is fine to live by your passion and do some good for the world, even at a young age. I soon found out that The HUB is a global network of community, co-work space and events platform for individuals and teams who are using entrepreneurial approaches for sustainable impact. It existed in 30 cities, but there was none in Asia. Shocking.After 400 coffee chats and eight months of endless hours of space-finding, fund-raising and community-building, Asia's first HUB was founded in May 2012, in Singapore. I picked Singapore because of its hunger to be innovative and more so, to be a hub for social innovation. Also, if done well in Singapore, the region will follow. More personally, I wanted to address the pain point I felt in Singapore six years before.The doors of The HUB Singapore have been opened for five months to a throng of what we call 'purpose-driven individuals'. They range from technicians to social entrepreneurs, film makers to bankers, Googlers to Linked-Iners. It is not a space for any one discipline, but for any discipline. The 'intention' becomes the main filtering question to be a Hubber \u2013 not status, educational qualifications, wealth or profession. The 5,400 sq ft space in the middle of Orchard, Singapore's main lifestyle and entertainment street, has quickly become the home for the outliers. At 200-membered strong, companies, foundations and government agencies are starting to come to The HUB for entrepreneurial ideas, to meet with 'Hubbers' and to have a casual chat over Chris' coffee. The best part is that we are working with the government (National Youth Council) and this is how potential large scale change can happen.The vision is for the community to grow to 1,000 members in two years. That is 0.0002% of the five million strong population. A drop in the ocean, perhaps, but most movements, ecosystems and innovations start with a small group of individuals.The HUB Singapore seeks to be that micro-ecosystem where individuals can pursue their passions and be celebrated for it. On a national level, it is that incubator of new thinking models, unconventional career paths, novel solutions and big ideas, a safe place for both failures and successes. It is where new options are experimented daily because the common curse of conformity is the assumption that choices are finite to the availability of existing choices, when the advancement of progress and humanity relies on choices that have not yet been imagined.Grace Sai is the co-founder of The Hub Singapore, a community and space for purpose-driven individuals, and the founder of Books for Hope, a social enterprise in the field of childrens' education.

From traffic jams and inefficient buildings to social inequality and housing, the problems are complex and hard to tackle \u2014 but not insurmountable.Some cities are forging ahead with the use of innovative urban planning, technological and governance models, showing that with the right focus and resources, cities can become \"smart\" or more sustainable.According to the latest Siemens' Green City Index for Asia, Singapore is the best-performing city in the region when measured against a range of sustainability criteria.\"Singapore is at the leading edge of sustainability,\" says Nicholas You, chairman of the World Urban Campaign Steering Committee at UN-Habitat. \"It's an island state with limited resources so it had no choice but to go green if it wanted to survive economically.\"Singapore's experiences have important lessons for other urban centres.

The deal signalled the company's intent to focus on the Far East, giving it the company's first direct stake in Australia's aviation market, where Virgin is the second biggest airline after Qantas.Scott, Singapore's low-cost airline, now accounts for one in four of all Asia Pacific flights and follows cuts by the airline to its long-haul flights between the Far East and North America.Branson has been considering Virgin's future for several years and nearly signed a deal with Air France-KLM in February 2011, having appointed Deutsche Bank to look into possible offers. He was particularly concerned by a ruling by US authorities that allowed British Airways and American Airlines to run their transatlantic businesses jointly.In 2011 he said: \"We realised for the long-term stability of Virgin Atlantic we needed to look at an alliance partner, and whether it is purely an alliance or more than an alliance we're completely undecided. Most of the people we talked to are keen to have Virgin as part of their alliance. My preference would be to keep control of the airline.\" With the BA-AA deal passed, any link-up with Delta is unlikely to face many regulatory hurdles.A spokesman for Singapore Airlines said: \"We review our investments regularly, but no decision has been made about a divestment of our shareholding in Virgin Atlantic.\"Virgin Atlantic said: \"We are always talking to many airlines on a number of different matters but we never comment on the details of these discussions\"Delta Airlines declined to comment.Sir Richard Branson formed Virgin Atlantic with US lawyer Randolph Fields more than 28 years ago, launching their maiden flight from Gatwick to Newark on 22 June 1984. Billed as a budget airline, it aimed to compete on the lucrative transatlantic market, still dominated by British Airways.The pair fell out within months, causing Branson to turn to the City for more funds. Fields left, reducing his stake to 25%. He was eventually bought out by his former partner.The company received a boost to its coffers from Branson when he sold Virgin Records in 1992 for \u00a3510m, but by 1999, with rival airlines forming worldwide alliances, Branson sold a 49% stake to Singapore Airlines for \u00a3600m.Today Virgin has 44 planes. It flew 5.3 million passengers in 2011. It has six Airbus A380 aircraft on order.", "tags": ["Richard Branson", "Business", "Virgin Atlantic", "Airline industry"], "title": "Delta bids for Singapore Airlines' 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic"},{"date": "2012-11-21T18:50:19Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Never mind its temperate 28C weather, low unemployment rate and high per-capita GDP \u2013 Singapore is the most emotionless society in the world, according to a new Gallup poll, beating the traditionally po-faced Georgia, Lithuania and Russia in a survey of more than 150 nations.Asking respondents questions such as \"Did you feel well-rested yesterday?\", \"Were you treated with respect all day yesterday?\" and \"Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?\", the survey found that Singaporeans were the least likely to reveal experiencing any emotions at all.Just 36% of Singaporeans reported feeling positive or negative emotions on a daily basis, while 60% of Filipinos recorded regularly feeling both \u2013 the highest response rate of any country worldwide.\"If you measure Singapore by the traditional indicators, they look like one of the best-run countries in the world,\" Gallup's Jon Clifton was quoted as saying in a Bloomberg report on the survey. \"But if you look at everything that makes life worth living, they're not doing so well.\"The poll's findings \u2013 released on Wednesday \u2013 soon went viral on the internet, where they became the butt of many jokes, not least among Singaporeans themselves. \"Singapore ranked most emotionless country in the world \u2013 not sure how to feel about that,\" ran a number of Singapore-based tweets. \"That [poll] is a lie,\" commented one reader on the online news portal Today. \"I use many emoticons to express how satisfied I am.\"Singapore's 5.2 million residents work \u2013 at 46.6 hours a week \u2013 the longest hours in the world, according to the ILO. And only 2% of the country's workforce describe themselves as engaged by their jobs, according to the Bloomberg report, despite the global average being 11%.While many Singaporeans seem to agree that the nation does indeed work excessively long hours, its population is not necessarily \"emotionless\", said the Singaporean native Adrianna Tan. \"Every culture expresses everything differently. [The] European love of siesta, or quality of life, is seen in Asian eyes to be laziness,\" said the 27-year-old IT consultant. \"You can't put one set of expectations that one group of people decides is 'how one should live' and apply it uniformly across the world.\"In the Philippines \u2013 which ranked as the world's most emotional society, followed by El Salvador and Bahrain \u2013 analysts were quick to point out that being emotional doesn't necessarily equate with being happy.

Energy will be provided from renewable sources, transport will be publicly provided, waste will be diverted to other uses, and the city is planned by the Malaysian government as a showcase to be copied on a bigger scale across the region.The world's urban population overtook the number of rural-dwellers for the first time in 2007, and future population growth in south-east Asia \u2013 at least 9bn people are expected to inhabit this planet by 2050, up from 7bn at present \u2013 is expected to be mainly in cities in the developing world. By far the greatest growth will be in slums, by current estimates.Iskandar Malaysia offers an alternative. The plans are for a city that not only incorporates the latest in environmentally friendly technology, but that is designed for social integration. Green spaces and areas where people can mingle and relax will improve people's mental wellbeing and encourage social cohesion, it is hoped. Skyscrapers will be mixed with low-rise buildings and small self-contained \"neighbourhoods\".Najib Razak, prime minister of Malaysia, said in a speech: \"Iskandar Malaysia [is] a smart city template \u2013 protecting the environment, promoting equitable development and addressing urban development challenges [through] the creation of smart, liveable urban communities that will yield an improved quality of life for thousands of citizens, with safer, cleaner, healthier, more affordable and more vibrant neighbourhoods, serviced by more efficient and accessible transportation systems \u2013 great destinations for businesses.\"Ellis Rubinstein, president of the New York Academy of Sciences, which is working on the \"edu-city\" university campus area, said it could be \"a model to countries needing to accommodate the social and economic needs of fast-rising populations and environmental challenges\".However, the project's developers will have to overcome significant obstacles. New eco-cities have been planned in the past, from China to the US, but most have floundered. China's Dongtan was heralded as the world's first planned eco-city, but plans have been mired in difficulty for years. A UK project for \"eco-towns\" was widely ridiculed and has been all but abandoned.So far, the Malaysian government has managed to attract support from Pinewood Studios, which will build new facilities in Iskandar, and Legoland which will build its first Asian theme park in the city.

The full video of his lecture is available here.Ong was appointed head of the Singapore civil service in September 2010, moving to the post from his position as permanent secretary in the finance ministry. The Singapore public service has built a reputation for professionalism and efficiency and, more importantly, of integrity. It is widely regarded as one of the most efficient bureaucracies in the world, with a high standard of discipline and accountability.In an interview with Singapore in-house civil service magazine Challenge in 2011, Ong said that the operating environment for the Singapore public service is becoming more complex, with volatility the norm and citizens' expectations growing rapidly. In common with other administrations around the world, the Singapore public service has to deal with issues that are not single, but require public servants to work across different agencies. Such issues might include Singapore's relationship with superpowers such as China, or planning for land use in a way that balances economic development with environmental issues.Ong has devoted his career to public service, having worked in six Singapore ministries since graduating in economics; his departments include home affairs and defence. But Ong has said that, even at this stage of his career, he is still learning.He views technology as a key enabler of inter-government information sharing, but his key focus remains on the 120,000 people employed by the Singapore public service and developing their sense of pride and professionalism in the job they do for Singapore's citizens.\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian public leaders network, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

Like Lewis Carroll's original, this cartoon Alice is curious about the world \u2013 \"she gives up her cash to fly around rash\" \u2013 but the moral here is that this twentysomething Singaporean is so busy being \"wild and reckless\" that she stands to lose her chance of starting a family.Welcome to adult education in marriage and fertility, Singapore-style.\"Alice\" is one of 15 fairytales revamped for a new government-backed scheme to encourage Singaporeans to get married and start having babies earlier. Faced with a rapidly ageing society, skyrocketing housing prices, low birth rates and a population that works the longest hours in the world, this country of 5.3 million people has made various attempts over the years to encourage its citizens to marry and procreate, from government-funded speed-dating schemes to educational flyers on how to flirt. Now, however, it is changing its tactics in search of a happy ending.Aimed at 21- to 30-year-olds, the \"Singaporean Fairytale\" was created by four final-year university students who wanted to \"find an interesting way to connect with young adults \u2026 on what it takes to start, live and be a family in Singapore\", says the project manager, Chan Luo Er, 23.\"Fairytales are very accessible, as almost everyone grew up with a fairytale or two \u2013 our little poem on a woman's declining fertility as she ages ties in quite nicely with the Golden Goose.\"The fairytales \u2013 which have been distributed by leaflet to universities around Singapore \u2013 include versions of Cinderella, the Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel and Snow White, each involving a reworked tale that relates to fertility, sex or marriage, and a resulting moral. The lesson with \"careless\" Alice, for example, is that \"the extended adolescence of twentysomethings today has a biological cost for women\" and the story ends with a stark warning: \"After 40, [fertility] drops 95%.\"The scheme has proved popular on both its website and Facebook page among students who appreciate its attempts at creative humour. But it comes at a time of widespread disillusionment with the government's efforts to boost population figures. Just last month, parliament passed a controversial white paper that will see the island increase its population by a third by 2030, in effect granting citizenship to more foreigners and squashing the native population to just over half the total, in order \"to remain a key node in the network of global cities\". .Perhaps more tellingly, the fairytale initiative raises the question of what exactly the Singaporean fairytale is \u2013 a notion that the government and the public have been debating in recent months.\"When we were much younger, I think many of us were exposed to the idea of obtaining the five Cs: cash, car, condo, country club and credit card,\" says Chan. \"But we think times are changing \u2026 For us, the Singaporean fairytale is about living life the way that makes you happy \u2013 so it could either be setting up your own business or even starting a family early.\"Activists and critics say too much stress is placed on Singapore's TFR \u2013 total fertility rate \u2013 when the city state really needs to assess its work-life balance. They say such government schemes fail to account for women who choose to be single, do not want babies, or are in non-heterosexual relationships.\"These fairytales barely begin to scratch the surface of the overwhelming decisions Singaporeans face when considering [life's] trade-offs and do little to provide them with the information they need to help them with that,\" wrote Singaporean blogger Fikri Alkhatib in response to the group's notion that \"[Singaporeans] can have it all, if only you choose to\".\"Singaporeans aren't just 'choosing' not to have it 'all'. That's pretty extraordinarily insulting. They either cannot, or they choose to reject the idea of your 'all'.\"Critics point to other recent schemes promoting conventional themes about women's roles in society as proof that Singapore is simply out of touch. In the Singapore Dating Guidebook, the modern-day, corporate woman is called a \"Singapore New Independent Princess\" (SNIP) and is offered dating advice such as: \"If he lets you pick up the tab or worse \u2013 expects payment-in-kind \u2013 RUN!\"\"It entrenches all the stereotypes and it's unfortunate that it's supported by the government,\" says Corinna Lim of Singapore's Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware) of the similarly outdated fairytale advice.\"It's an old-fashioned way of trying to solve this problem. It's going backwards when going forwards would be what Scandinavian countries are doing \u2013 making it easier for women to have babies and allowing men to take part [through paternity schemes], instead of pressuring women by saying they're not married yet.\"The government recently passed a \u00a31bn parenthood and fertility package which will fund assisted reproduction and finally give fathers a week of paternity leave. It has also released a series of educational cartoons for those looking for love, with tips such as: \"Look out for a favourite topic your date has, or anything that your date has mentioned \u2013 this gives the feeling that you are interested in your date,\" and: \"Scout your surroundings for possible chat topics, or comment on an interesting accessory your date is wearing\" to avoid awkward conversation.But the mere fact that the government feels it has to teach its citizens how to flirt may alone show why the population isn't higher.Lim says: \"It's an indication that our education system, in focusing so intensively on grades, has failed to give us the life skills we need.\"", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "Fertility problems", "Ageing", "Women", "World news"], "title": "Singapore uses 'modern fairytales' to warn women of declining fertility"},{"date": "2013-01-03T09:38:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Planning for the future, providing competitive rates of pay and encouraging involvement with the private sector are just three of the lessons the UK can learn from Singapore's civil service, according to former cabinet secretary and head of the civil service Gus O'Donnell.Speaking as part of the Global Public Leaders Series, O'Donnell says that when recruiting new talent, salaries that rival those of the private sector are an important incentive for the best and brightest to join.

Faced with a rapidly ageing society, skyrocketing housing prices, low birth rates and a population that works the longest hours in the world, this country of 5.3 million people has made various attempts over the years to encourage its citizens to marry and procreate, from government-funded speed-dating schemes to educational flyers on how to flirt. Now, however, it is changing its tactics in search of a happy ending.Aimed at 21- to 30-year-olds, the \"Singaporean Fairytale\" was created by four final-year university students who wanted to \"find an interesting way to connect with young adults \u2026 on what it takes to start, live and be a family in Singapore\", says the project manager, Chan Luo Er, 23.\"Fairytales are very accessible, as almost everyone grew up with a fairytale or two \u2013 our little poem on a woman's declining fertility as she ages ties in quite nicely with the Golden Goose.\"The fairytales \u2013 which have been distributed by leaflet to universities around Singapore \u2013 include versions of Cinderella, the Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel and Snow White, each involving a reworked tale that relates to fertility, sex or marriage, and a resulting moral. The lesson with \"careless\" Alice, for example, is that \"the extended adolescence of twentysomethings today has a biological cost for women\" and the story ends with a stark warning: \"After 40, [fertility] drops 95%.\"The scheme has proved popular on both its website and Facebook page among students who appreciate its attempts at creative humour. But it comes at a time of widespread disillusionment with the government's efforts to boost population figures. Just last month, parliament passed a controversial white paper that will see the island increase its population by a third by 2030, in effect granting citizenship to more foreigners and squashing the native population to just over half the total, in order \"to remain a key node in the network of global cities\". .Perhaps more tellingly, the fairytale initiative raises the question of what exactly the Singaporean fairytale is \u2013 a notion that the government and the public have been debating in recent months.\"When we were much younger, I think many of us were exposed to the idea of obtaining the five Cs: cash, car, condo, country club and credit card,\" says Chan. \"But we think times are changing \u2026 For us, the Singaporean fairytale is about living life the way that makes you happy \u2013 so it could either be setting up your own business or even starting a family early.\"Activists and critics say too much stress is placed on Singapore's TFR \u2013 total fertility rate \u2013 when the city state really needs to assess its work-life balance.

Social media, newspapers, blogs and even parliament itself have been rife with commentary, and a rare public protest \u2013 with over 3,500 already planning to attend \u2013 has been scheduled for Saturday. \"There is this fear that foreigners will eventually replace and take over our country,\" explains protest organiser Gilbert Goh, who hopes for a referendum. \"There is no known employment protection for local workers here \u2013 people can be easily replaced at the workplace \u2026 [and] workers have been known to be replaced by foreigners, as many employers are now foreigners as well.\"Racial tensions already run high, not least between the ethnic Chinese, Malay and Indian Singaporeans who already make up the city-state, but also among new immigrants, says Barr.Some of that tension is due to the country's focus on economics rather than culture. Local opposition politician Nicole Seah, who ran as the youngest female candidate in the 2011 general elections, recently said that the \"Singapore Inc\" brand cultivated by the government has created a \"transient state where people from all over come, make their fortunes and leave\".She added: \"The policies over the past decades have created an erosion of our social roots, widespread resentment, and a loss of who we are as Singaporeans.

The Singapore civil service, he says, \"have a pay policy which means they look at comparability with the private sector\". In the UK, on the other hand, \"we have very strict limits on [civil service] pay. They are way below the private sector at the top particularly, and therefore can't compete as much.\"He agrees with head of the Singapore civil service, Peter Ong, who stresses the importance of recruiting talent from the commercial world and allowing civil servants to continue their involvement with the private sector throughout their career. \"They take in very, very good people whose qualifications are such that they could make it to the top in the public or private sector, and then they work in both,\" O'Donnell says. \"They allow their public servants to work in the private sector, and they have spells out in the private sector.\" O'Donnell says that this engagement with the private sector encourages society to hold civil servants in high regard.\"If you just look at things, say, through a financial lens then you miss a really important part of things. We do need different sets of backgrounds, different sets of experiences, that can allow us to look at and imagine very different futures.\" Gender is another area where O'Donnell says diversity needs to be encouraged. Although he cites Canada, Australia and the UK as positive examples, he adds that Singapore is outstanding in this respect.Finally, O'Donnell says the UK civil service should follow Singapore's lead by becoming more forward-thinking and planning for the future. \"There's obviously a thought that thinking the unthinkable is quite dangerous in the UK. Information is all potentially disclosable now, so I think that's potentially embarrassing for governments.\"He adds that planning for the future has been intermittent for this reason, but says \"we shouldn't be embarrassed about it; we should actually be embarrassed about not doing it.

They are way below the private sector at the top particularly, and therefore can't compete as much.\"He agrees with head of the Singapore civil service, Peter Ong, who stresses the importance of recruiting talent from the commercial world and allowing civil servants to continue their involvement with the private sector throughout their career. \"They take in very, very good people whose qualifications are such that they could make it to the top in the public or private sector, and then they work in both,\" O'Donnell says. \"They allow their public servants to work in the private sector, and they have spells out in the private sector.\" O'Donnell says that this engagement with the private sector encourages society to hold civil servants in high regard.\"If you just look at things, say, through a financial lens then you miss a really important part of things. We do need different sets of backgrounds, different sets of experiences, that can allow us to look at and imagine very different futures.\" Gender is another area where O'Donnell says diversity needs to be encouraged. Although he cites Canada, Australia and the UK as positive examples, he adds that Singapore is outstanding in this respect.Finally, O'Donnell says the UK civil service should follow Singapore's lead by becoming more forward-thinking and planning for the future. \"There's obviously a thought that thinking the unthinkable is quite dangerous in the UK. Information is all potentially disclosable now, so I think that's potentially embarrassing for governments.\"He adds that planning for the future has been intermittent for this reason, but says \"we shouldn't be embarrassed about it; we should actually be embarrassed about not doing it.

Faced with a rapidly ageing society, skyrocketing housing prices, low birth rates and a population that works the longest hours in the world, this country of 5.3 million people has made various attempts over the years to encourage its citizens to marry and procreate, from government-funded speed-dating schemes to educational flyers on how to flirt. Now, however, it is changing its tactics in search of a happy ending.Aimed at 21- to 30-year-olds, the \"Singaporean Fairytale\" was created by four final-year university students who wanted to \"find an interesting way to connect with young adults \u2026 on what it takes to start, live and be a family in Singapore\", says the project manager, Chan Luo Er, 23.\"Fairytales are very accessible, as almost everyone grew up with a fairytale or two \u2013 our little poem on a woman's declining fertility as she ages ties in quite nicely with the Golden Goose.\"The fairytales \u2013 which have been distributed by leaflet to universities around Singapore \u2013 include versions of Cinderella, the Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel and Snow White, each involving a reworked tale that relates to fertility, sex or marriage, and a resulting moral. The lesson with \"careless\" Alice, for example, is that \"the extended adolescence of twentysomethings today has a biological cost for women\" and the story ends with a stark warning: \"After 40, [fertility] drops 95%.\"The scheme has proved popular on both its website and Facebook page among students who appreciate its attempts at creative humour. But it comes at a time of widespread disillusionment with the government's efforts to boost population figures. Just last month, parliament passed a controversial white paper that will see the island increase its population by a third by 2030, in effect granting citizenship to more foreigners and squashing the native population to just over half the total, in order \"to remain a key node in the network of global cities\". .Perhaps more tellingly, the fairytale initiative raises the question of what exactly the Singaporean fairytale is \u2013 a notion that the government and the public have been debating in recent months.\"When we were much younger, I think many of us were exposed to the idea of obtaining the five Cs: cash, car, condo, country club and credit card,\" says Chan. \"But we think times are changing \u2026 For us, the Singaporean fairytale is about living life the way that makes you happy \u2013 so it could either be setting up your own business or even starting a family early.\"Activists and critics say too much stress is placed on Singapore's TFR \u2013 total fertility rate \u2013 when the city state really needs to assess its work-life balance. They say such government schemes fail to account for women who choose to be single, do not want babies, or are in non-heterosexual relationships.\"These fairytales barely begin to scratch the surface of the overwhelming decisions Singaporeans face when considering [life's] trade-offs and do little to provide them with the information they need to help them with that,\" wrote Singaporean blogger Fikri Alkhatib in response to the group's notion that \"[Singaporeans] can have it all, if only you choose to\".\"Singaporeans aren't just 'choosing' not to have it 'all'. That's pretty extraordinarily insulting.

Like many other Singaporeans, her life revolves around work, family and the stress of making ends meet in a nation that works the longest hours in the world. But lately her life has taken on a more immediate concern: a government initiative to increase Singapore's population by a third by 2030, a move that would see citizenship granted to more foreigners and squash the native population to just over half the total.\"I love my country,\" says the advertising executive. \"[But] the cost of living is high, the income gap is widening, transport is failing and unfamiliar faces are crowding our land. People are getting increasingly fed up because our daily lives are affected.\"Singapore has long been heralded as the success story of south-east Asia, a small island nation less than half the geographical land size of Greater London that in just 50 years has transformed from colonial backwater to one of the world's most formidable economic powerhouses.But that gain has come at increasing cost. Skyrocketing housing prices, overcrowding, long working hours, low birth rates and an ageing population \u2013 that the government terms Singapore's \"silver tsunami\" \u2013 are all major contributors to discontent often been focused on the country's rapid immigration.The city-state currently has a population of 5.3 million, and is now more densely populated than Hong Kong. Under a government white paper \u2013 which was approved last week despite widespread public anger \u2013 Singapore will aim to increase its population to 6.9 million people over the next 20 years by granting permanent residency to 30,000 people and allowing an inflow of some 25,000 new citizens every year. New social programmes, including marriage and parenthood initiatives, as well as infrastructure schemes, will accommodate the burgeoning population, with immigration calibrated to retain its current ethnic ratios.\"We are producing too few babies, our society is ageing, and if we do nothing, our population will soon start shrinking,\" said Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong.\"Singapore must continue to develop and upgrade to remain a key node in the network of global cities, a vibrant place where jobs and opportunities are created.\"It is the government's focus on Singapore's economy, rather than its people, that has stirred much of the public's discontent. Singapore is the third most expensive city in Asia.The ruling People's Action Party (Pap), in power since independence in 1965, is seemingly on a one-track mission to maintain its own rule, despite having heavily lost a recent byelection and potentially standing to lose more, says Singapore expert Michael Barr of Australia's Flinders University.\"Pap has always presented itself as a party above vested interests \u2026 [but] that is not washing anymore,\" says Barr.\"Just like a multinational company's CEO has bonuses tied to the rise and fall of share prices, ministers and civil servants have bonuses tied to economic growth in Singapore. And we're talking about million-dollar bonuses here and more, so there's a lot at stake.\"Dissent over the white paper has been huge. Social media, newspapers, blogs and even parliament itself have been rife with commentary, and a rare public protest \u2013 with over 3,500 already planning to attend \u2013 has been scheduled for Saturday. \"There is this fear that foreigners will eventually replace and take over our country,\" explains protest organiser Gilbert Goh, who hopes for a referendum. \"There is no known employment protection for local workers here \u2013 people can be easily replaced at the workplace \u2026 [and] workers have been known to be replaced by foreigners, as many employers are now foreigners as well.\"Racial tensions already run high, not least between the ethnic Chinese, Malay and Indian Singaporeans who already make up the city-state, but also among new immigrants, says Barr.Some of that tension is due to the country's focus on economics rather than culture. Local opposition politician Nicole Seah, who ran as the youngest female candidate in the 2011 general elections, recently said that the \"Singapore Inc\" brand cultivated by the government has created a \"transient state where people from all over come, make their fortunes and leave\".She added: \"The policies over the past decades have created an erosion of our social roots, widespread resentment, and a loss of who we are as Singaporeans. We have been taught to prioritise money-making practicality over what it means to have a solid culture.\"The bubbling discontent in Singapore has recently been compounded by a string of scandals causing some outsiders to wonder if the Asian utopia so carefully crafted by the nation's so-called founder, Lee Kuan Yew, is finally crumbling. Most young professionals still live at home because they can't afford to move out, the government has had to subsidise speed-dating schemes to encourage partnerships, and abortion rates among married women now account for over half the total \u2013 as many families struggle to stay afloat.\"The government does not give allowance for people who are different from them and this is one of the reasons why we are so politically and creatively stunted,\" says Ng. \"My perspective is, I'm different, I don't want to toe the line, and that's why we have to speak up and push through until something happens.\"", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Singapore protest: 'Unfamiliar faces are crowding our land'"},{"date": "2013-03-19T14:14:05Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Germany's civil service has found it a challenge to move to a results-oriented approach, New Zealand puts the emphasis on personal, departmental accountability, and the US is flexible, but with a potential lack of continuity.Those are just some of the findings in a recent comparison of four civil service systems around the world.Over the past couple of years, the UK civil service has come in for stinging criticism from many ministers, including the prime minister David Cameron, who in March 2011 said civil servants were the \"enemies of enterprise\", to Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, complaining in October 2012 about civil servants blocking ministerial plans.In December 2012, as part of its hunt for new models of public administration, the UK government commissioned thinktank IPPR to analyse the working and accountability of civil service systems overseas. That report is due out soon; in the meantime, there are some fascinating insights to be had from comparing, for instance, New Zealand's system, which has the merit of tight budgetary control, but which is weaker in implementing cross-sector policy-making, with that of the US, with its system of political appointees.\u2022 Want your say?

He described the fears as capable of being overstated.In his first public address since the end of the inquiry, Jay criticised the \"prurient or intrusive tendencies\" of tabloid newspapers that invade the privacy of individuals without a public interest defence.\"What the Leveson inquiry demonstrated beyond argument is that sections of the British press are unruly and that the basis for asserting that the press is under-regulated appears strong,\" Jay told the Singapore Academy of Law in a speech earlier this month.He added: \"My impression is that the press in the UK could well qualify as the most unruly and irreverent in the world, and I have travelled widely; it is fearless, and it speaks its mind.\"To be described as 'unruly and irreverent' would be regarded by most editors and journalists as a badge of honour, not of aspersion. Many would argue that these qualities make the press in the UK the best in the world, because the dividing line between fearlessness in holding power to account and unruliness in disparaging the rights of private individuals is almost impossible to draw.\"Jay said that an ideal press should be able to launch serious investigations into \"the dark crevices of government\" while respecting the rights of individuals where there is no public interest in prying further. It was \"somewhat pessimistic\" to argue that a free press will occasionally intrude on the private lives of innocent members of the public, he added.Jay used the speech to back the key proposals of the Leveson report into the future of press regulation, published in November, and said any opinions were his and not the judge's.\"I would not wish to sound complacent, but in my view in the cultural context of the UK, those fears [about statutory underpinning for a new press regulator] amount to scaremongering. I do not see any slope, let alone a slippery one,\" he said.\"Statute can be both the servant and enemy of press freedom, depending on the cultural context and on exactly what it provides.\"He argued that Leveson's recommendation of a new law to create an independent press regulator would not \"be anathema to the constitutional principles which a mature democracy jealously safeguards\".That proposal in Leveson's 2,000-page report has proved divisive for many editors and politicians. The prime minister dismissed the recommendation as \"the crossing of a Rubicon\" within hours of its public unveiling in November.Jay, predicted that another of Leveson's proposals \u2013 an arbitration arm that resolves privacy and libel disputes involving newspapers \u2013 would soon become the norm in the UK.Jay's speech to lawyers and academics in Singapore marks a return to the public eye for Leveson's chief inquisitor, who grilled David Cameron, Rupert Murdoch, Tony Blair and dozens of celebrities at the inquiry.The speech will be welcomed by fans of Jay's often flamboyant wordplay, with references to \"metaphorical doldrums\", \"inchoate\" privacy rights, and \"a rough and ready rather than a Rolls Royce\" system of justice.\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

People are getting increasingly fed up because our daily lives are affected.\"Singapore has long been heralded as the success story of south-east Asia, a small island nation less than half the geographical land size of Greater London that in just 50 years has transformed from colonial backwater to one of the world's most formidable economic powerhouses.But that gain has come at increasing cost. Skyrocketing housing prices, overcrowding, long working hours, low birth rates and an ageing population \u2013 that the government terms Singapore's \"silver tsunami\" \u2013 are all major contributors to discontent often been focused on the country's rapid immigration.The city-state currently has a population of 5.3 million, and is now more densely populated than Hong Kong. Under a government white paper \u2013 which was approved last week despite widespread public anger \u2013 Singapore will aim to increase its population to 6.9 million people over the next 20 years by granting permanent residency to 30,000 people and allowing an inflow of some 25,000 new citizens every year. New social programmes, including marriage and parenthood initiatives, as well as infrastructure schemes, will accommodate the burgeoning population, with immigration calibrated to retain its current ethnic ratios.\"We are producing too few babies, our society is ageing, and if we do nothing, our population will soon start shrinking,\" said Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong.\"Singapore must continue to develop and upgrade to remain a key node in the network of global cities, a vibrant place where jobs and opportunities are created.\"It is the government's focus on Singapore's economy, rather than its people, that has stirred much of the public's discontent. Singapore is the third most expensive city in Asia.The ruling People's Action Party (Pap), in power since independence in 1965, is seemingly on a one-track mission to maintain its own rule, despite having heavily lost a recent byelection and potentially standing to lose more, says Singapore expert Michael Barr of Australia's Flinders University.\"Pap has always presented itself as a party above vested interests \u2026 [but] that is not washing anymore,\" says Barr.\"Just like a multinational company's CEO has bonuses tied to the rise and fall of share prices, ministers and civil servants have bonuses tied to economic growth in Singapore. And we're talking about million-dollar bonuses here and more, so there's a lot at stake.\"Dissent over the white paper has been huge. Social media, newspapers, blogs and even parliament itself have been rife with commentary, and a rare public protest \u2013 with over 3,500 already planning to attend \u2013 has been scheduled for Saturday. \"There is this fear that foreigners will eventually replace and take over our country,\" explains protest organiser Gilbert Goh, who hopes for a referendum. \"There is no known employment protection for local workers here \u2013 people can be easily replaced at the workplace \u2026 [and] workers have been known to be replaced by foreigners, as many employers are now foreigners as well.\"Racial tensions already run high, not least between the ethnic Chinese, Malay and Indian Singaporeans who already make up the city-state, but also among new immigrants, says Barr.Some of that tension is due to the country's focus on economics rather than culture. Local opposition politician Nicole Seah, who ran as the youngest female candidate in the 2011 general elections, recently said that the \"Singapore Inc\" brand cultivated by the government has created a \"transient state where people from all over come, make their fortunes and leave\".She added: \"The policies over the past decades have created an erosion of our social roots, widespread resentment, and a loss of who we are as Singaporeans. We have been taught to prioritise money-making practicality over what it means to have a solid culture.\"The bubbling discontent in Singapore has recently been compounded by a string of scandals causing some outsiders to wonder if the Asian utopia so carefully crafted by the nation's so-called founder, Lee Kuan Yew, is finally crumbling. Most young professionals still live at home because they can't afford to move out, the government has had to subsidise speed-dating schemes to encourage partnerships, and abortion rates among married women now account for over half the total \u2013 as many families struggle to stay afloat.\"The government does not give allowance for people who are different from them and this is one of the reasons why we are so politically and creatively stunted,\" says Ng. \"My perspective is, I'm different, I don't want to toe the line, and that's why we have to speak up and push through until something happens.\"", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Singapore protest: 'Unfamiliar faces are crowding our land'"},{"date": "2013-03-19T14:14:05Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Germany's civil service has found it a challenge to move to a results-oriented approach, New Zealand puts the emphasis on personal, departmental accountability, and the US is flexible, but with a potential lack of continuity.Those are just some of the findings in a recent comparison of four civil service systems around the world.Over the past couple of years, the UK civil service has come in for stinging criticism from many ministers, including the prime minister David Cameron, who in March 2011 said civil servants were the \"enemies of enterprise\", to Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, complaining in October 2012 about civil servants blocking ministerial plans.In December 2012, as part of its hunt for new models of public administration, the UK government commissioned thinktank IPPR to analyse the working and accountability of civil service systems overseas. That report is due out soon; in the meantime, there are some fascinating insights to be had from comparing, for instance, New Zealand's system, which has the merit of tight budgetary control, but which is weaker in implementing cross-sector policy-making, with that of the US, with its system of political appointees.\u2022 Want your say?

He described the fears as capable of being overstated.In his first public address since the end of the inquiry, Jay criticised the \"prurient or intrusive tendencies\" of tabloid newspapers that invade the privacy of individuals without a public interest defence.\"What the Leveson inquiry demonstrated beyond argument is that sections of the British press are unruly and that the basis for asserting that the press is under-regulated appears strong,\" Jay told the Singapore Academy of Law in a speech earlier this month.He added: \"My impression is that the press in the UK could well qualify as the most unruly and irreverent in the world, and I have travelled widely; it is fearless, and it speaks its mind.\"To be described as 'unruly and irreverent' would be regarded by most editors and journalists as a badge of honour, not of aspersion. Many would argue that these qualities make the press in the UK the best in the world, because the dividing line between fearlessness in holding power to account and unruliness in disparaging the rights of private individuals is almost impossible to draw.\"Jay said that an ideal press should be able to launch serious investigations into \"the dark crevices of government\" while respecting the rights of individuals where there is no public interest in prying further. It was \"somewhat pessimistic\" to argue that a free press will occasionally intrude on the private lives of innocent members of the public, he added.Jay used the speech to back the key proposals of the Leveson report into the future of press regulation, published in November, and said any opinions were his and not the judge's.\"I would not wish to sound complacent, but in my view in the cultural context of the UK, those fears [about statutory underpinning for a new press regulator] amount to scaremongering. I do not see any slope, let alone a slippery one,\" he said.\"Statute can be both the servant and enemy of press freedom, depending on the cultural context and on exactly what it provides.\"He argued that Leveson's recommendation of a new law to create an independent press regulator would not \"be anathema to the constitutional principles which a mature democracy jealously safeguards\".That proposal in Leveson's 2,000-page report has proved divisive for many editors and politicians. The prime minister dismissed the recommendation as \"the crossing of a Rubicon\" within hours of its public unveiling in November.Jay, predicted that another of Leveson's proposals \u2013 an arbitration arm that resolves privacy and libel disputes involving newspapers \u2013 would soon become the norm in the UK.Jay's speech to lawyers and academics in Singapore marks a return to the public eye for Leveson's chief inquisitor, who grilled David Cameron, Rupert Murdoch, Tony Blair and dozens of celebrities at the inquiry.The speech will be welcomed by fans of Jay's often flamboyant wordplay, with references to \"metaphorical doldrums\", \"inchoate\" privacy rights, and \"a rough and ready rather than a Rolls Royce\" system of justice.\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Since launching in 2008, Social Media Week has grown to include events in cities during two weeks, in February and September.This month, events and activities will be taking place in New York \u2013 where the event is supported by the Guardian \u2013 Copenhagen, Hamburg, Lagos, Miami, Milan, Paris, Singapore, Tokyo and Washington DC.

Ford will discuss its social media efforts, which include the first automotive social movement, the Fiesta Movement, and Monty will discuss how brands can avoid pitfalls in the unpredictable social world.Google will also have a large presence, with a team from Google+ offering a masterclass in using Google Hangouts \u2013 its live chat tool. A number of media organisations have invested time and effort in using Hangouts to engage readers and their community; HuffPost Live uses the platform as a social two-way in its video service, while the Washington Post is among a number of media groups to have used the feature to engage with its users.In another highly anticipated event, Eli Pariser from Upworthy and Reddit's Alexis Ohanian will discuss the battle to protect free information on the internet, and the \"need to encourage\" governments and social networks to leave content people are creating unfiltered in a bid to preserve free speech.

Andhra stands out because of its psychedelic exterior \u2013 a kaleidoscope of garish colours. And though the speciality here is south Indian vegetarian dishes, it is also known for its Hyderabadi biryani, Mysore mutton (cooked with green chillies and coriander), a spicy fish pulusu (baked with tamarind and raw mango), and the great Singaporean favourite \u2013 fish-head curry (never a cheap dish, around \u00a311).

It's as close to a national dish as you can come, which is surprising given that it doesn't really come from the Chinese island of Hainan at all, but was invented in colonial Malaya by Hainanese chefs cooking for the British.The recipe couldn't be simpler: tender steamed chicken, served slightly cooled, fluffy rice, sliced cucumber, coriander \u2013 and two key ingredients \u2013 a homemade chili sauce and bowl of chicken broth. Chinatown's Maxwell Food Centre, a converted 1950s market, has about a hundred tempting hawker stalls, but the longest queues are at Tian Tian, where a plate of chicken rice goes for less than \u00a32, with some aficionados ordering just wings, claws or whatever goes into what the menu terms \"spare parts\".\u2022 Stall 10, Maxwell Food Centre,1 Kadayanallur Street, tiantianchickenrice.comSigns tell tourists that Smith Street is \"food street\", and it's true that it's one of the few places where there are still old-fashioned hawker stalls lining the street at night.

For once, this isn't sanitised Singapore, and customers take more notice of how delicious the cooking is than the hygiene rating. Satay Bee Hoon can claim to be a genuine Singapore invention, a fusion of Chinese and Malay influences, where delicate rice vermicelli, cuttle fish, cockles, pork and kangkong (water spinach) are smothered in a spicy, crunchy satay sauce, all for \u00a31.50 a portion.\u2022 Stall 02-112, Chinatown Complex food court, 335 Smith StreetSingaporeans are big on nostalgia, typified by the crowds that sit out every morning at the shady terrace of the Ya Kun restaurant in the heart of Chinatown.

It is also the place to try a traditional preparation of lor mee, a delicious dish of thick yellow noodles served in a thick gravy, with fish cake, fried wonton, stewed pork and slices of ngor hiang (five-spiced meal roll). In the final moments of the cooking process, vinegar and minced garlic are added, giving a tangy, savoury taste.

The deal is dependent on Boeing itself deciding to proceed with manufacturing the plane, a slightly larger version of the current model with more seats and cargo space.Meanwhile, the airline has placed firm orders for 30 A350-900s from Airbus, to be delivered in 2016-17, with options for 20 more planes \u2013 potentially upgrading these to the larger A350-1000 model. Some will be used to replace the existing craft but the order represents some likely fleet expansion.The order is seen as reaffirming Singapore's commitment to the premium medium- and long-haul market, where it has faced increasing competition from the Gulf carriers, after it launched a low-cost subsidiary, Scoot, in 2011.The Singapore Airlines chief executive, Goh Choon Phong, said: \"Today's aircraft orders are among the biggest in Singapore Airlines' history, helping to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position. They demonstrate our commitment to the Singapore hub and our confidence in the future for premium full-service travel.\"These new aircraft will provide opportunities to grow and renew our fleet and enhance our network, benefiting customers by offering more travel options and the latest in-flight cabin products.\"The new, stretched version of the Dreamliner has been mooted by Boeing for some time \u2013 a plane that would offer about 50 more seats, sacrificing some of the 787s famed range to make it more suitable for the busier routes around Asia.However, the project has been on ice as Boeing struggled to return its pioneering plane to the sky after recurring battery fires saw the entire worldwide fleet grounded earlier this year.Singapore has a record as an early adopter, having been the first airline to fly the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger aircraft.Thursday's Airbus deal is the third order from Singapore Airlines for the A350 XWB (extra wide body), now totalling 70 planes. Airbus's chief operating officer, John Leahy, said it was a \"major endorsement\" for a plane that would represent a \"step-change\" in the market.The aviation consultant John Strickland said: \"Singapore has had a significant part of its fleet made up of more expensive, four-engine aircraft which are too big for some routes. These orders will reduce average capacity while putting it back in the leading edge of new-generation long-range twin jets which will offer superb operating economics without excess numbers of seats. This, combined with its legendary service reputation, should allow it to recover profitability and market share.\"", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Boeing", "Airbus", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Business"], "title": "Singapore Airlines announces $17bn aircraft order from Airbus and Boeing"},{"date": "2013-06-21T10:26:56Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Smog from Indonesian fires has smothered Singapore this week, with a smokey haze causing dramatic views across the city-state.While Singaporeans are urged to stay indoors to avoid high levels of air pollution (read our full story here), Guardian readers in the area are sharing their views of smoke-shrouded skyscrapers.Here is a selection of the best:@guardianworld Pic taken around noon. +400 psi values measured.

Don't expect a traditional English fry-up on the menu, but a local breakfast that has been served since 1944 \u2013 the Kaya Toast set menu. For under \u00a32 you get a plate of toast filled with kaya coconut jam, two very runny eggs (don't even think about asking for them to be more cooked) and a cup a dense coffee, magically filtered through a strange-looking sock device. They like to add a big dose of super-thick condensed milk \u2013 delicious but frighteningly sweet.\u2022 18 China Street, +65 6438 3638, yakun.comThe narrow streets of Chinatown are crammed with restaurants, coffee shops and hawker stalls, but Yum Cha is hidden away on the first floor of an anonymous budget hotel, so it can come as a shock when you walk into a huge, noisy dining room. Although there is a tempting full menu \u2013 chili crabs, salted egg prawns, steamed pomfret \u2013 this is the place to come for dim sum. Portions are from \u00a31.50, and the best are the delicate spinach prawn dumpling, beancurd stuffed with fish, \"vegetarian\" ham in tau pok (fried tofu), and crispy red bean paste with banana. Try to visit at the weekend when the restaurant reverts to the old-fashioned method of service, as waitresses weave between the tables pushing rickety trolleys filled with steamed goodies.\u2022 20 Trengganu Street, +65 6372 1717, yumcha.com.sgKampong Glam is the lively Muslim part of downtown Singapore with everything from Moroccan couscous restaurants to shisha cafes, and even a halal Parisian bistro.

It is a run by a charitable association, Temple of Fine Arts, that finances art, music and dance centres, and clients are asked to make a donation at the end of the meal of what they can afford. In practice, people usually leave S$15 for a generous buffet of gourmet vegetarian delicacies. The waiters and cooks are all volunteers, and their specialities are dosai filled with spiced potatoes and chutney, and oothappam (rice and lentil pancakes), topped with onions, fried cauliflower, chillies and yogurt. It's a very popular venue at the weekend, when a reservation is advised.\u2022 Central Square, 20 Havelock Road, +65 6339 9993, annalakshmi.com.sgA short bus ride from the city centre, Tiong Bahru is where the earliest public housing was built in Singapore \u2013 very low-rise compared to today's skyscrapers \u2013 and the 1950s-style market houses a busy wet market on the ground floor and some of Singapore's best hawker stalls upstairs. This is like a flashback to the past, with a musician entertaining diners on an electric piano, and no one looking stressed or rushed. It is also the place to try a traditional preparation of lor mee, a delicious dish of thick yellow noodles served in a thick gravy, with fish cake, fried wonton, stewed pork and slices of ngor hiang (five-spiced meal roll). In the final moments of the cooking process, vinegar and minced garlic are added, giving a tangy, savoury taste.

And now, if you want wee nam kee \u2013 poached chicken on top of rice glistening with chicken fat \u2013 you'll have to visit one of the country's 107 \"hawker centres\". Odd, then, for Singapore to host a congress of world street food, and to invite a man who is all about life off the beaten track to make the keynote address.Bourdain took the opportunity to bemoan the state of fine dining in London, New York or Paris, where he said the food was unlikely to have a sense of place. \"But on the streets of Mexico,\" he said, \"you know where you are.\" He raved about pho on the streets of Vietnam, and how it tasted better on a low plastic stool amid the durian and diesel fumes. But he didn't rubbish the hawker centres. Even a food hedonist like Bourdain can see that they have a lot to recommend them.The 107 centres \u2013 with 10 more planned in the next five years \u2013 are similar to western food courts, lined with avenues of uniform little boxes serving food. In the middle are plastic tables and wipe-clean seating. Each stall is given a government cleanliness rating, which is displayed at eye level \u2013 the difference between an A and a B can be a month's salary. All of the food is good. Some of it is great. But something is missing \u2013 the individuality that we prize so highly in British street food.To see the lunchtime queues at Maxwell Road, a hawker centre in Singapore's central business district, you wonder if that really matters.

Singapore's love affair with hawker cuisine will be celebrated from 31\u00a0May to 9\u00a0June at the inaugural World Street Food Congress, a 10-day festival where 37 vendors from 10 countries will roll up to serve their dishes at the F1 Pit Building and Paddock, 1 Republic Blvd, at Marina Bay on the south-east of the island \u2013 including taco stands from Mexico, food carts from Malaysia, mobile kiosks from India and gourmet food trucks from the US, as well as participants from the host country and elsewhere.As well as the street chefs and stalls, there will be food writers and street-food specialists, including American TV chef Anthony Bourdain and Claus Meyer, the co-founder of Copenhagen's Noma restaurant, three-time winner of the World's 50 Best Restaurants awards. The event will also host the first World Street Food Awards, intended to raise global awareness of the genre.To whet your appetite, here's our pick of 10 of the best spots in Singapore to find great affordable food, from the hawker food centres, to the food courts of Chinatown, curry houses of Little India and cafes of Kampong Glam.Katong is Singapore's old Peranakan neighbourhood, where the blending of Chinese ingredients with Malay spices and cooking created nyonya cuisine. It also forms part of the name of \"328\u00a0Katong Laksa\". This friendly coffee shop, run by a former beauty queen serves one of the best laksa soups you'll find \u2013 a delicious mix of spicy lemak coconut milk, prawns, cockles, tofu, beansprouts and noodles. A bowl costs S$4 (about \u00a32) and hungry customers can also order traditional otak otak, a fish paste steamed in banana leaf, or nasi lemak, rice with crunchy anchovies, peanuts, cucumber and a wicked sambal sauce. There are lots of food shops along the road, selling sticky kueh cakes and barbecued honey-glazed pork.\u2022 51 East Coast Road, on the junction with Cylon Road, near the Hotel Grand MercureLittle India, to the east of Orchard Road, is one of Singapore's liveliest quarters, with scores of reasonably priced restaurants, cafes and shops selling colourful silks, fragrant incense and glitzy bangles. Andhra stands out because of its psychedelic exterior \u2013 a kaleidoscope of garish colours. And though the speciality here is south Indian vegetarian dishes, it is also known for its Hyderabadi biryani, Mysore mutton (cooked with green chillies and coriander), a spicy fish pulusu (baked with tamarind and raw mango), and the great Singaporean favourite \u2013 fish-head curry (never a cheap dish, around \u00a311).

Two aged gentlemen share rolling and cooking duties, turning out a piping hot flatbread every couple of minutes. For chapati-dipping, there are about 20 curries to choose from, including classic mutton masala and the more challenging curried goat brain.

It's as close to a national dish as you can come, which is surprising given that it doesn't really come from the Chinese island of Hainan at all, but was invented in colonial Malaya by Hainanese chefs cooking for the British.The recipe couldn't be simpler: tender steamed chicken, served slightly cooled, fluffy rice, sliced cucumber, coriander \u2013 and two key ingredients \u2013 a homemade chili sauce and bowl of chicken broth. Chinatown's Maxwell Food Centre, a converted 1950s market, has about a hundred tempting hawker stalls, but the longest queues are at Tian Tian, where a plate of chicken rice goes for less than \u00a32, with some aficionados ordering just wings, claws or whatever goes into what the menu terms \"spare parts\".\u2022 Stall 10, Maxwell Food Centre,1 Kadayanallur Street, tiantianchickenrice.comSigns tell tourists that Smith Street is \"food street\", and it's true that it's one of the few places where there are still old-fashioned hawker stalls lining the street at night.

Each time I try to explain what I research, my mind skims through the intricacies of a definition that is neither precise nor finite in scope. In interviews in Singapore and throughout Taiwan and over the last four months, I have asked social entrepreneurs their definition of social enterprise, and social innovation. Here's my latest conclusion: it doesn't really matter.Each foundation, social enterprise, or funding agency I have interviewed has defined social innovation in the positive; no one has decidedly excluded an organisation or group from their view of social innovation. The definition of social entrepreneurship has been more precise, favouring a focus on financial sustainability (\"a capitalist mind and a socialist heart\" in the words of entrepreneur Priya Chen from Aurora Social Enterprise Co), but most people still give open and growing definitions of a field, sector and way of thinking that is expansive in its ambition to tackle pressing social problems. Amid this lack of clarity on definitional issues, examining whom social innovations serve is perhaps a more important way of analysing social innovation capacity: it shows you who is empowered to solve social problems within a local economy. Does social innovation happen with government, non-profit organisations, or members of the marginalised communities themselves?Here in Taiwan, social innovation and social enterprise seem to concentrate on specific thematic issues, predominantly employment, disability inclusion and matters related to aboriginal communities, rather than taking place in one specific sector. However, it's hard to tell whether the prevalence of social innovations in these areas is because of truly innovative solutions stemming from those sectors, or is the result of prevalent subsidies. Indeed, the availability of subsidies in those areas could also be considered a kind of social innovation, because they empower those with a vested interest in crafting and delivering a solution. The role of government policy and funding in dictating where social innovation takes place can be significant in the absence of a strong pool of social entrepreneurs.In Singapore, many of the most prominent social enterprises do not focus on issues facing exclusively Singapore. Many organisations, like the World Toilet Organisation, are global in their reach. However, Jack Sim, the dynamic founder of WTO, began his work focused on what he noticed as an issue in Singapore before extending his mandate and forming the WTO. Perhaps, then, what is unique about Singapore is not the nature of its social challenges or marginalised communities, but that its ecosystem and economy are structured to be outward-facing and conducive to growth. It is easier to imagine this sort of structure functioning in a city-state of five million people than a country with greater size and population.The differences in whom social innovations serve in different environments makes the lack of standard definition meaningful: with one definition, it might be easier to unify people working within or across similar subject matter, but more difficult to unify those working under different constraints and in different environments. In South Korea, the Leveraging Social Enterprise Act quantitatively evaluates social enterprises, and businesses cannot use the moniker without being registered. There may be some value in such an approach to limit the novelty of \"social enterprise\" as a buzzword (if not as a technical understanding of the sector); five years ago, \"international\" was the buzzword among organisations and government ministries. Now \"innovation\" has taken the helm \u2013 a desirable word to describe oneself, yet a difficult one to measure against.By repeatedly asking what social innovation is, I've seen that the best social innovations and the social entrepreneurs behind them all have laser-sharp focus on their end users and solving their pains, and that they prize financial sustainability so they can keep doing it. Precise definitions and tailored taxation models might be helpful, but they're not critical to identify effectively and leverage social enterprise opportunities, and are not what will inspire the next generation of change makers.So how do we harness the ambiguity of social innovation? Governments could begin by making it easier for innovation entities \u2013 social enterprises, social purpose businesses, revenue-generating non-profits and innovation entities within larger organizations \u2013 to have the flexibility they need to succeed. Social innovators need to continue drawing outside the lines without being placed in government-approved buckets that do not accurately capture the type of work they do. Practitioners can begin to talk about social innovation in terms of metrics, such as community engagement and sustainability, and the media and academics can spend less time glorifying organisations for merely associating with \"innovation\" and praise real efforts toward testing new financial model and learning sharing between organisations.So, after all the questioning, it turns out that I don't care about the definition. Please, join the \"social innovation\" bandwagon. But there should be standardised metrics, there should be reporting, and we should begin to see social innovation in terms of the communities they serve and not just how its defined.Melinda Jacobs is a co-founder of the social innovation research group, which is developing a series of in-depth case studies on why social innovation succeeds and fails in TaiwanThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

And while it is the office towers in London's centre that are making all the headlines, the city is also building high-rise residential properties far and wide, with reports that there are more than 140 residential towers of 20 or more storeys either recently completed or in the pipeline.(Recently on this network, Hannah Fearn argued that high-rise was the only solution to avoid building on the green belt.)Despite this apparent popularity, high-rise living is still unappealing to many, and in particular to families with children who see the lack of social-communal spaces and the distance between the flat and the street as a physical and psychological barrier.This is hardly surprising given that low-rise suburban living can offer the street, the protective front garden and the generously-sized back garden, whereas all high-rise can seemingly offer is the corridor and lift-lobby, both squeezed down to the minimum that regulations allow, and more often than not, without access to natural light and view. The upshot is that, without spaces and facilities for play, interaction and recreation, the high-rise seems only to appeal to three demographic groups: young singles, couples, and empty nesters (those who are older and whose children have left home). For families it is the dream of the two-storey house and garden that prevails, and fuels the exodus of couples from apartment living to the suburbs when children arrive on the scene. Some have suggested a solution is a shift in our aspirations, but surely we also need to change the design of these monotonous residential towers if they are to appeal to a broader cross-section.Perhaps inspiration can be found by looking east, and in particular, to Singapore. In this city-state of more than 5 million people, an astonishing 85% of the population live in high-rise social housing, leading to innovative design solutions and regulations to improve the quality of life at height. Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in the Pinnacle@Duxton \u2013 a development of seven towers linked together with skybridges at the 26th and 50th floors which include a host of social spaces such as an outdoor gym for the elderly, children's play area, mini parks and seating areas, and perhaps most radically, an 800-metre running track linking together the seven towers, all with access to view, light and air in a safe environment above the city.The economics stack up too. Singaporean regulations allow developers who include community spaces at height to build taller, and to exclude such spaces from the taxable area of their developments. This has led to towers with skygardens springing up all over the island, with lush, planted social spaces appearing at height across the city.To many, these concepts are nothing new, being just an extension of the modernist ideas of streets-in-the-sky, such as the post-war developments at Pruitt-Igoe in the US and Robin Hood Gardens in Poplar, London, both of which failed spectacularly. But these failures were not just architectural, with a lack of mixed-use programs, poor maintenance and a lack of broader occupant social support also carrying the blame.However, these ideas are now being reinvented and reinvigorated in Asia, transforming streets-in-the-sky from the glorified concrete corridors of the 1960s to lush green spaces, with dedicated functions and activities, which are well maintained and looked after.While future UK housing will likely be multi-typological, with terraced, low-rise and strategically located high-rise all necessary, tall buildings can never fulfil their potential until we make living at height appealing to families with children.

It followed the rollout of a number of vans displaying signs encouraging illegal immigrants to \"go home\" in a pilot that has been widely criticised as heavy-handed.Mark Harper, minister for immigration, defended the government against claims that its spot checks were random by pointing to the number of arrests of suspected illegal immigrants. Yet, speaking to the Observer about last week's crackdown at railway stations, Dr Martin Ruhs, a longstanding member of the government's migration advisory committee, said that he believed the issue was being oversimplified by policymakers. He said: \"In liberal democracies generally we don't want to do the kinds of things that are commonplace in Singapore or maybe the Middle East.\"You have to draw the line somewhere. Different people will draw the line in different places over what is acceptable in how you treat people. Obviously the government has to do something about irregular immigration, but the issue is more complex than many policymakers believe. Some policies have an element of a spectacle \u2013 you want to send a signal, and those policies aren't necessarily the most effective.\"Ruhs spoke out as evidence also emerged of growing tensions within the government, with one senior Liberal Democrat source insisting that there had been no agreement within the coalition to target areas containing a large proportion of ethnic minorities with spot checks, and expressed concern over the direction of travel of Theresa May, the home secretary, and her fellow Tory ministers.The source said: \"We would have strong concerns about any suggestion of blanket racial profiling in high ethnic-minority areas. We have not agreed to any such policy as it would be a disproportionate, distasteful and ineffective way to tackle illegal immigration.\" The home secretary, who is widely believed to have ambitions for the leadership of the Conservative party, is particularly keen to be seen to have got to grips with immigration and is expected to announce further controversial policies this month. The Observer has learned that special advisers working for May have had a series of meals with representatives of the controversial thinktank Migration Watch, which recently predicted that 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians will come each year for the next five years from 2014 when people there are allowed to work in the UK. Three of May's advisers last had a lunch with representatives of Migration Watch in March, the third such meeting in two years.In another development, the Observer has learned that May has also launched a strongly worded attack on a high court judge in legal documents recently filed in regard to her policy of setting earnings thresholds for people wishing to sponsor the UK visas of spouses coming from abroad.Last month Mr Justice Blake said the policy was a disproportionate interference in people's lives and suggested the income threshold should be lowered from around \u00a318,000 to \u00a313,000. Legal documents submitted by May in appeal, and obtained by the Observer, hit out at the courts by claiming Blake had committed \"the error of usurping the role of the democratically accountable decision maker in the formulation of policy\". On Saturday night, the shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The government's policy on illegal immigration seems to be based on headline-grabbing, deliberate controversy and causing offence rather than sensible evidence of what works.\"", "tags": ["Immigration and asylum", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "UK news", "Politics", "Conservatives", "Liberal Democrats", "Theresa May", "Race issues"], "title": "Government adviser's warning over spot checks for illegal immigrants"},{"date": "2013-10-15T16:08:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "If you'd like to nominate an individual or organisation, email robin.hough@theguardian.com Joining Ericsson in 1995, Arun has been heading Ericsson's Southeast Asia and Oceania region since 2010.

Singaporeans, apparently, get cross at being asked about it. If they're not keen, maybe we should make a bid for it instead?Super-thin rice noodles, or vermicelli, are de rigueur here, but as with pad thai the secret is all in the preparation. The noodles need softening before they're added to the wok. Approaches to this vary from cooking them and leaving them to cool \u2013 from the blogger Lizzie Mabbott, aka Hollow Legs \u2013 to merely soaking in warm water: Ken Hom suggests 25 minutes, Delia Smith (who credits her recipe to the late, great restauranteur Ken Lo) 15 minutes and Ching-He Huang a paltry 10.Smith and Huang's noodles are a bit chewy for my taste, while Hom's seem rather mushy (of which more later). Mabbott's are perfectly cooked, although I slightly prefer those from the blog Taste Hong Kong, which takes a similar approach but scalds them in boiling water for a mere 30 seconds before leaving them to cool and dry for half an hour. The strands remain more separate, although I find they need very slightly longer in the hot water for my taste.As with so many noodle dishes, the protein element is very much up to the individual diner. Prawns are common; Taste Hong Kong marinates them in salt and white pepper before use, but with so many other salty elements in the dish, I'd prefer to let them remain au naturel. Smith uses dried shrimp, soaked in water, which I find too strongly fishy.Pork also pops up a lot: Smith and Huang both use bacon, while Hom suggests ham or, like Taste Hong Kong, char siu pork. Smith gives the option of cooked chicken or pork, and indeed almost any meat you happen to have left over would work, but I really like the strong sweet and savoury flavour of the barbecue pork here. (If you're cooking the meat specially, I recommend this recipe by Nigel Slater as a solid place to start.)Egg also makes a nice addition \u2013 Taste Hong Kong whisk theirs with fish sauce first, while Hom seasons his with sweet, nutty sesame oil, which I prefer. Most recipes seem to stir the egg into the noodles, but I like to stir-fry separately it until it's almost set, so there are distinct flakes of egg in the finished dish.Mabbott uses tofu puffs, which she describes as \"optional, but great for texture\". They do indeed add an interestingly chewy element to the dish; I don't want to overload it with ingredients, but if you'd prefer to keep it strictly vegetarian, they're a good thing to consider.That said, non meat-eaters won't go hungry without tofu, because Singapore noodles tend to boast a plethora of vegetables, from kale or cabbage (Mabbott) to beansprouts and carrot (Huang). To be honest, the choice is largely up to you, but the selection below offers a pleasing contrast of flavour and texture: red pepper (Huang) and peas (Hom) for sweetness, water chestnut (Hom) and blanched green beans (Mabbott) for crunch, and shitaake mushrooms (Huang) for yielding chewiness and savoury flavour. (Hom and Smith both use dried mushrooms, but even after soaking I find these a little too chewy.) The fresh flavour of spring onions, meanwhile, works better here than Smith's yellow version, which has a tendency to melt into the other ingredients.The first rule of Singapore noodles is that they have to be a bright, unnatural yellow: it's the law. The most usual way of achieving that colour is with curry powder, and it does the job nicely; if you're worried about them being pallid, you could add turmeric as well, as Taste Hong Kong suggests, but leaving out the curry powder altogether, as in Huang's recipe, misses a trick on the flavour front. Root ginger and garlic are also a must as a flavour base, and I like the hint of heat that Hom and Mabbott's green chilli provides. Coriander leaves, as used by the same pair for garnish, add a touch of colour and freshness to the dish.All the recipes, apart from that of Taste Hong Kong, add a little liquid to the noodles as they cook. Smith makes a rich broth from the mushroom-soaking liquid and dry sherry, while Huang goes for soy and oyster sauce and rice vinegar, and Mabbott keeps things simple with a mixture of light and dark soy sauces.Hom, meanwhile, makes a fairly substantial sauce with coconut milk, sugar, shaoxing rice wine and chicken stock, which he then simmers the noodles in. I find this makes them a bit mushy, and though delicious the coconut flavour changes the character of the dish completely. \"It tastes sort of Thai,\" as my chief tester puts it.I like the savoury flavour of the rice wine (you can use dry sherry if you can't get hold of it) and soy sauce, rounded out with just a pinch of sugar; those who fancy a little more heat should sprinkle with Mabbott's chilli oil.As with all stir-fries, the trick is in the mise en place: have everything lined up next to the hob, ready to go, before you so much as light the gas. I also like Taste Hong Kong's tip for making the task a little easier. After describing the \"dai pai dong, that is the street-side open-air food stalls, where you might be able to witness their chefs tossing these noodles up in the air from the iron woks\", the author admits that \"holding such a large cooking vessel is already a big challenge, not to mention manipulating the foods at the same time with one single arm\". To reduce the workload, they toss the scalded noodles with curry powder and seasoning before adding them to the wok, so they're already well combined: all you have to do is heat them through. Those well-versed in the art of stir frying may wish to skip this step, but I found it helpful.Whether you cheat or not, the whole process should take little more than five minutes, plus drying time for the noodles. Not bad for a veritable feast.(Serves 2)125g rice vermicelliHandful of green beans2 \u00bd tsp curry powder3 tbsp soy sauce2 tbsp rice wine or dry sherryPinch of sugar2 garlic cloves, crushed1 tbsp peeled and grated ginger root1 green bird's eye chilli, finely chopped2 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal6 water chestnuts, sliced\u00bd red pepper, thinly sliced5 shitaake mushrooms, slicedHandful of peas50g prawns50g char siu pork or cooked chicken, shredded1 egg, beaten with a pinch of salt and a splash of sesame oil2 tbsp peanut or other neutral oilHandful of chopped coriander, to servePut the vermicelli in a bowl, and tip boiling water over until covered.

Add half the curry powder and all the soy sauce, wine and sugar and toss together well until the noodles are well coated.Put the garlic, ginger, chilli, spring onion and remaining curry powder in one bowl, the vegetables in another and the meat in a third. Put these near the hob along with the beaten egg.Heat the oil in a wok until smoking, then tip in the garlic and ginger mixture. Stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant, then tip in the vegetables. Stir-fry for a couple of minutes, then push to the side of the wok and tip in the egg. Allow to cook undisturbed until almost set, then scramble into the remaining ingredients. Add the meat and prawns and mix in, then tip in the noodles and toss everything together for a couple of minutes, so it's all well combined.Heap on to a serving plate, top with coriander and serve immediately.Singapore noodles: greasy takeaway stodge or Cantonese culinary genius?

Cosy as our Victorian model of rustic idyll may be, I can't help but wonder: is this a good thing for gardening? Is it even very Victorian?Meanwhile, over on the other side\u00a0of the planet, there is a place where horticulture is all about cutting-edge\u00a0innovation. The island\u00a0state of\u00a0Singapore is less than\u00a0half the size of London, but in terms of garden design it punches far above its weight, with some of the most ambitious gardens of the\u00a021st century.It was the brainchild of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew. When he swept to power in 1959, Cambridge-educated Lee rejected calls to patch up the densely packed slums and demanded a fresh start. In his garden city, modelled on the 19th-century ideals of Letchworth Garden City, plants were central. Five decades later, with one of the world's highest per capita incomes and percentages of resident millionaires, the gamble on gardening has paid off.This Victorian view of landscaping as crucial to draw in the crowds (and\u00a0their money) is in stark contrast to the UK today, where landscaping is often sidelined as a\u00a0drain on project resources.The 21st century brought a\u00a0shift in\u00a0vision for Singapore's town planning: it was no longer to be a\u00a0garden city, but a city in a garden. Horticulture became part of standard planning laws, with developers of skyscrapers obliged to\u00a0shroud large sections of their buildings in living walls and to top\u00a0them with public-access \"sky\u00a0parks\".Lifted from ideas pioneered by British designers in London and New York nearly three-quarters of\u00a0a\u00a0century earlier, including the Kensington Roof Gardens, these are\u00a0re-envisioned pleasure gardens. Key\u00a0among them is the iconic Marina Bay Sands resort, three glittering towers set aloft an enormous park on a platform. Mature palms shade deck chairs that\u00a0overlook an infinity pool, which appears to spill over the building's edge. An architectural ha-ha, an idea first employed on Britain's country estates, prevents water cascading on\u00a0to the traffic below.Across town at the Park Royal on\u00a0Pickering hotel, a multistorey rainforest clings to the side of a glass building suspended high above the street. Palms, plumerias and tree ferns shade the interior of the building, keeping it cool, and curtains of jungle climbers drape down to connect the gardens on each floor.The newly reclaimed harbourfront has been turned into a botanic garden. The $1bn Gardens by the Bay contains dozens of themed gardens, many designed by British architects.

Cosy as our Victorian model of rustic idyll may be, I can't help but wonder: is this a good thing for gardening? Is it even very Victorian?Meanwhile, over on the other side\u00a0of the planet, there is a place where horticulture is all about cutting-edge\u00a0innovation. The island\u00a0state of\u00a0Singapore is less than\u00a0half the size of London, but in terms of garden design it punches far above its weight, with some of the most ambitious gardens of the\u00a021st century.It was the brainchild of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew. When he swept to power in 1959, Cambridge-educated Lee rejected calls to patch up the densely packed slums and demanded a fresh start. In his garden city, modelled on the 19th-century ideals of Letchworth Garden City, plants were central. Five decades later, with one of the world's highest per capita incomes and percentages of resident millionaires, the gamble on gardening has paid off.This Victorian view of landscaping as crucial to draw in the crowds (and\u00a0their money) is in stark contrast to the UK today, where landscaping is often sidelined as a\u00a0drain on project resources.The 21st century brought a\u00a0shift in\u00a0vision for Singapore's town planning: it was no longer to be a\u00a0garden city, but a city in a garden. Horticulture became part of standard planning laws, with developers of skyscrapers obliged to\u00a0shroud large sections of their buildings in living walls and to top\u00a0them with public-access \"sky\u00a0parks\".Lifted from ideas pioneered by British designers in London and New York nearly three-quarters of\u00a0a\u00a0century earlier, including the Kensington Roof Gardens, these are\u00a0re-envisioned pleasure gardens. Key\u00a0among them is the iconic Marina Bay Sands resort, three glittering towers set aloft an enormous park on a platform. Mature palms shade deck chairs that\u00a0overlook an infinity pool, which appears to spill over the building's edge. An architectural ha-ha, an idea first employed on Britain's country estates, prevents water cascading on\u00a0to the traffic below.Across town at the Park Royal on\u00a0Pickering hotel, a multistorey rainforest clings to the side of a glass building suspended high above the street. Palms, plumerias and tree ferns shade the interior of the building, keeping it cool, and curtains of jungle climbers drape down to connect the gardens on each floor.The newly reclaimed harbourfront has been turned into a botanic garden. The $1bn Gardens by the Bay contains dozens of themed gardens, many designed by British architects. In true Victorian fashion,\u00a0the 101-hectare park is centred on two conservatories \u2013 albeit with the interiors chilled to mimic Mediterranean and cloud forest habitats. The Flower Dome, the world's largest columnless greenhouse, houses an olive grove, a\u00a0recreation of the South African fynbos, Australian outback and an elevated baobab garden.

The island nation, which currently relies on neighboring Malaysia for its water, is aiming for water self-sufficiency by 2060, with 55% of its water needs met via recycled water and 25% from seawater desalination. Moreover, its Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, which the government released in 2009, sets a target of certifying 80% of its buildings as green by 2030. And the sustainability push extends beyond buildings and civic services: Singapore's Nanyang Technological University is shooting for greenest eco-campus in the world, with a 35% reduction in energy, water and waste by 2020. Chee Kiong Goh, executive director for cleantech and infrastructure at the Singapore Economic Development Board, said Singapore's national targets demonstrate its push towards environmental sustainability. \"Overcrowding is a big problem here and throughout Asia \u2013 Asian cities are growing at a rate of 37 million (residents) a year. Singapore's lack of land and natural resources also means the country must focus on sustainability,\" Goh said.He already sees progress. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Asian Green City Index (pdf) ranks Singapore at the top of its list. Meanwhile, global corporations \u2013 including Panasonic, Bosch, EDF and Veolia \u2013 are investing in helping Singapore reach its goals with innovative tech solutions. \"We are ahead at demonstrating new, urban solutions, therefore we want to attract and work with the world's best companies in the space,\" Goh said. Singapore's corporate-driven sustainability projects extend to almost every aspect of society. In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline and Singapore's EDB formed a 10-year, $33m partnership for advancing green manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. Meanwhile, EDF and Veolia are helping Singapore's Housing & Development Board, the country's largest urban housing developer, to build out an urban modeling IT tool. Using 3-D visualization and simulation techniques, planners can simulate complex scenarios to determine which planning strategies to pursue. The tool, which is currently being used in the Jurong East residential district, assesses buildings' energy efficiency, air-conditioning systems, domestic waste collection and solar panel integration. On the transportation front, Bosch Software Innovations recently concluded the first phase of its investigation into the technical and commercial viability of electric vehicles in Singapore. The island already has 111 charging stations, and Bosch hopes to expand into car sharing and commercial fleets, said Thomas Jakob, Bosch's managing director for the Asia Pacific region. Singapore makes a sensible test bed for new products and ideas, many of which could be applied to other countries, experts say.\"The companies can move more quickly and try more radical approaches than they could in less resource-constrained markets, while also being ready when the market begins to demand these solutions,\" said Daniel Vermeer, founder and director of Duke University's Center for Energy, Development and the Global Environment.Manoj Singh, global chief operating officer of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, added that the lessons corporations learn from sustainability initiatives in Singapore will be highly transferrable elsewhere in Asia: \"The Singapore experience allows corporations to cut their teeth, test and actually implement the projects elsewhere, avoiding the same startup costs.\"Vermeer cautioned, however, that companies innovating in Singapore might only be buying an \"option on the future\". To ultimately succeed in emerging markets, they will still need to diversify their bets and learn the right lessons from their experiments. And they face the risk that the generally glacial pace of change in many of the big markets may not be sufficient to meet their needs. \"The global picture is mixed,\" Vermeer said. \"Water solutions are growing in importance to address situations like California's profound drought, while Europe is rolling back their carbon reduction and renewable energy commitments due to a changing economic and energy natural gas landscape.\"Meanwhile, environmental challenges prevail in Singapore and throughout Asia. China and Malaysia, among other Asian countries, have recently recorded dangerous levels of air pollution.Population trends also place a strain on sustainability. A Siemens Report, cited by the Economist Intelligence Unit (pdf), estimates that Asian populations living in cities will exceed 50% by 2026. Many of these urban areas are already strained by economic growth and migration.Asia's environmental challenges are acute, Singh said, adding that solving those problems will require formidable change. \"But change is a necessity and public-private partnerships will be an increasing focus and a corner suite agenda in the next 10 years \u2013 not just in Singapore, but [also in] other Asia centers where sustainability is a heavy focus,\" he said. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Singapore aims to achieve water self-sufficiency by 2050. It has been corrected to 2060.Debbi McCullough is a writer, PR specialist and owner of Hanging Rock Media in Cary, North Carolina", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Technology", "Emerging markets", "Smart cities", "Transport", "Environment", "Business", "Corporate social responsibility", "Ethical business"], "title": "Why Bosch, EDF and others are investing in Singapore"},{"date": "2014-01-03T15:09:12Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Watch the Activate Singapore TV ad which has been appearing on Channel News Asia in advance of the event on 16 and 17 January.Activate is the Guardian's platform for leaders working across a range of sectors who are using the internet to change the world.

Is it even very Victorian?Meanwhile, over on the other side\u00a0of the planet, there is a place where horticulture is all about cutting-edge\u00a0innovation. The island\u00a0state of\u00a0Singapore is less than\u00a0half the size of London, but in terms of garden design it punches far above its weight, with some of the most ambitious gardens of the\u00a021st century.It was the brainchild of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew. When he swept to power in 1959, Cambridge-educated Lee rejected calls to patch up the densely packed slums and demanded a fresh start. In his garden city, modelled on the 19th-century ideals of Letchworth Garden City, plants were central. Five decades later, with one of the world's highest per capita incomes and percentages of resident millionaires, the gamble on gardening has paid off.This Victorian view of landscaping as crucial to draw in the crowds (and\u00a0their money) is in stark contrast to the UK today, where landscaping is often sidelined as a\u00a0drain on project resources.The 21st century brought a\u00a0shift in\u00a0vision for Singapore's town planning: it was no longer to be a\u00a0garden city, but a city in a garden. Horticulture became part of standard planning laws, with developers of skyscrapers obliged to\u00a0shroud large sections of their buildings in living walls and to top\u00a0them with public-access \"sky\u00a0parks\".Lifted from ideas pioneered by British designers in London and New York nearly three-quarters of\u00a0a\u00a0century earlier, including the Kensington Roof Gardens, these are\u00a0re-envisioned pleasure gardens. Key\u00a0among them is the iconic Marina Bay Sands resort, three glittering towers set aloft an enormous park on a platform. Mature palms shade deck chairs that\u00a0overlook an infinity pool, which appears to spill over the building's edge. An architectural ha-ha, an idea first employed on Britain's country estates, prevents water cascading on\u00a0to the traffic below.Across town at the Park Royal on\u00a0Pickering hotel, a multistorey rainforest clings to the side of a glass building suspended high above the street. Palms, plumerias and tree ferns shade the interior of the building, keeping it cool, and curtains of jungle climbers drape down to connect the gardens on each floor.The newly reclaimed harbourfront has been turned into a botanic garden. The $1bn Gardens by the Bay contains dozens of themed gardens, many designed by British architects. In true Victorian fashion,\u00a0the 101-hectare park is centred on two conservatories \u2013 albeit with the interiors chilled to mimic Mediterranean and cloud forest habitats. The Flower Dome, the world's largest columnless greenhouse, houses an olive grove, a\u00a0recreation of the South African fynbos, Australian outback and an elevated baobab garden. In the Cloud Forest Dome, lifts transport visitors 140ft up the central hollow of a \"cloud mountain\" to suspended walkways over treetops.Even Singapore's Changi airport houses six indoor and outdoor gardens, which are managed using skills picked up from Chelsea Flower show \u2013 plants are whipped out the second their blooms fade in the air conditioning and replaced from a\u00a0nursery sited along the runway.Singapore's glossy, thematic approach to horticulture may seem theatrical and gimmicky, but in many ways it is more faithful to the\u00a0pioneering spirit\u00a0of the British Victorian gardeners we often try to\u00a0emulate than our own obsession for rehashing the\u00a0past.", "tags": ["Gardens", "Life and style", "Singapore"], "title": "Gardens: look east for Eden, Singapore-style"},{"date": "2014-03-19T21:53:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "When it comes to sustainability ambitions, Singapore might take the prize. The island nation, which currently relies on neighboring Malaysia for its water, is aiming for water self-sufficiency by 2060, with 55% of its water needs met via recycled water and 25% from seawater desalination. Moreover, its Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, which the government released in 2009, sets a target of certifying 80% of its buildings as green by 2030. And the sustainability push extends beyond buildings and civic services: Singapore's Nanyang Technological University is shooting for greenest eco-campus in the world, with a 35% reduction in energy, water and waste by 2020. Chee Kiong Goh, executive director for cleantech and infrastructure at the Singapore Economic Development Board, said Singapore's national targets demonstrate its push towards environmental sustainability. \"Overcrowding is a big problem here and throughout Asia \u2013 Asian cities are growing at a rate of 37 million (residents) a year. Singapore's lack of land and natural resources also means the country must focus on sustainability,\" Goh said.He already sees progress. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Asian Green City Index (pdf) ranks Singapore at the top of its list. Meanwhile, global corporations \u2013 including Panasonic, Bosch, EDF and Veolia \u2013 are investing in helping Singapore reach its goals with innovative tech solutions. \"We are ahead at demonstrating new, urban solutions, therefore we want to attract and work with the world's best companies in the space,\" Goh said. Singapore's corporate-driven sustainability projects extend to almost every aspect of society. In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline and Singapore's EDB formed a 10-year, $33m partnership for advancing green manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. Meanwhile, EDF and Veolia are helping Singapore's Housing & Development Board, the country's largest urban housing developer, to build out an urban modeling IT tool. Using 3-D visualization and simulation techniques, planners can simulate complex scenarios to determine which planning strategies to pursue. The tool, which is currently being used in the Jurong East residential district, assesses buildings' energy efficiency, air-conditioning systems, domestic waste collection and solar panel integration. On the transportation front, Bosch Software Innovations recently concluded the first phase of its investigation into the technical and commercial viability of electric vehicles in Singapore. The island already has 111 charging stations, and Bosch hopes to expand into car sharing and commercial fleets, said Thomas Jakob, Bosch's managing director for the Asia Pacific region. Singapore makes a sensible test bed for new products and ideas, many of which could be applied to other countries, experts say.\"The companies can move more quickly and try more radical approaches than they could in less resource-constrained markets, while also being ready when the market begins to demand these solutions,\" said Daniel Vermeer, founder and director of Duke University's Center for Energy, Development and the Global Environment.Manoj Singh, global chief operating officer of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, added that the lessons corporations learn from sustainability initiatives in Singapore will be highly transferrable elsewhere in Asia: \"The Singapore experience allows corporations to cut their teeth, test and actually implement the projects elsewhere, avoiding the same startup costs.\"Vermeer cautioned, however, that companies innovating in Singapore might only be buying an \"option on the future\". To ultimately succeed in emerging markets, they will still need to diversify their bets and learn the right lessons from their experiments. And they face the risk that the generally glacial pace of change in many of the big markets may not be sufficient to meet their needs. \"The global picture is mixed,\" Vermeer said. \"Water solutions are growing in importance to address situations like California's profound drought, while Europe is rolling back their carbon reduction and renewable energy commitments due to a changing economic and energy natural gas landscape.\"Meanwhile, environmental challenges prevail in Singapore and throughout Asia. China and Malaysia, among other Asian countries, have recently recorded dangerous levels of air pollution.Population trends also place a strain on sustainability. A Siemens Report, cited by the Economist Intelligence Unit (pdf), estimates that Asian populations living in cities will exceed 50% by 2026. Many of these urban areas are already strained by economic growth and migration.Asia's environmental challenges are acute, Singh said, adding that solving those problems will require formidable change. \"But change is a necessity and public-private partnerships will be an increasing focus and a corner suite agenda in the next 10 years \u2013 not just in Singapore, but [also in] other Asia centers where sustainability is a heavy focus,\" he said.

But beyond the bling are a number of original boutique-style hotels offering rooms at around \u00a3100 a night, making a stopover in this foodie capital worth it for travellers on a budget too. Be prepared for small, compact rooms, as most of these hotels are renovated heritage buildings, and when checking prices, many hotels quote rates without the compulsory \"plus plus\", which adds on 10% government tax and 7% service charge.

All that is missing in this faux-English public school world is the Tuck Shop, so it is not surprising that free ice-cream and help-yourself jars of crisps, smarties and chocolate creams are available in the lobby. The entry-rate rooms are all on the top floor, and although they are roomier than much of the competition, be prepared for attic spaces with no windows: the owners were not allowed to add skylights because of the heritage-protected status of the building.\u2022 55 Keong Saik Road, naumiliora.com, +65 6403 6000, doubles from S$216 (\u00a3102), breakfast extraThis historic building at the edge of colourful Little India started life in the 1920s as a school, became the headquarters of a Chinese Clan Association, and then was abandoned for many years before Loh Lik Ping, a leading name in Singapore's hotel and restaurant industry, transformed it into the hip Wanderlust Hotel. Each of the three guestroom floors was given over to a different design agency, with carte blanche to create eye-catching decor. So choose between the bright colours of the Pantone floor, the minimalist Mono or the quirky Whimsical. Pantone provides the lowest-price rooms: they're compact spaces with lots of extras, including a free soft-drink minibar, local calls, espresso machine and smart TV.

Taking up three floors of an apartment block in the lively Kampong Glam quarter, it is sleek, smart and a very good deal. That said, you have to be locked into the capsule-mentality if you want to stay here, as although it's in a different league from grimy backpacker hostels, there's only a certain amount of privacy. The dorms are either mixed or female-only, while six pods are doubles, catering for couples. The pods are comfortable, with a fold-down writing table, wooden dividing walls, and a locker underneath. At night, you can draw down a discrete blind, and each dorm has a curtained-off corner for changing.

The lobby is where breakfast is served, and it also transforms into a bar every evening from 5pm to 7pm, when guests are offered a complimentary cocktail, which could include a Singapore Sling.

Rooms are spacious, bright and with great views, while the bathrooms have rain showers and Molton Brown products, plus a limited free minibar. Room rates are a little above the norm, but worth the expense.

On the right is the elegant Amber restaurant, where breakfast is also served, though remember that a table for dinner at Amber tends to have a couple of weeks' waiting list. There is also a tropical open-air patio on the second floor, where free ice-cream is served. Each room is individually decorated, a mix of modern hi-tech, colourful mosaics and vintage furniture, and for around \u00a326 extra, it is worth thinking of splashing out on one of the roomy corner suites, which have a terrace and an outdoor claw-foot bath tub.\u2022 50 Keong Saik Road, + 65 6347 1929, hotel1929.com, doubles with breakfast from \u00a393The locally run Clover group runs businesses and vintage-themed properties in Singapore, and in mid-March 2014, Hotel Clover the Arts will open its doors.

But I won't get a seat to rest in the train and moreover, when I'm in my nursing uniform, people expect me to give up my seat. Don't nurses have the right to sit down, too, or are we supposed to stand throughout our journey?\"Patricia's situation stands starkly against the case of Anton Casey, a British wealth manager who ignited the wrath of Singaporeans when he referred to public transport commuters as \"poor people\". He also posted a status update about washing \"the stench of public transport off me\" once he had gotten his Porsche back from the workshop. Despite apologising publicly, Casey and his family (he's married to a former Miss Singapore) were forced to leave the country and he was also fired.In 2001, Singapore was ranked 97th in the list of world's most expensive cities. Ten years later, it was ranked sixth. Ongoing inflation means that basic amenities such as food continue to rise without an equivalent match in real wages.According to Hui Weng Tat, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy: \"We have a large number of households who are earning income in the lower end and not having enough to cover their household expenditure, especially at the lower 20%.\"This hits home hard for Patricia and Sham, who have to eke out a living on Patricia's salary alone. Singapore does not have a minimum wage, and Sham felt this most acutely when she was forced to work for S$900 a month doing essentially the same job (dog handling) that she used to get S$2,500 for at a different company.This was a precipitating factor in causing Sham to seek employment elsewhere. But it seemed companies didn't take too kindly to a gay Indian girl with a penchant for dressing boyishly. She was rejected from numerous job interviews even before being seen. She says, not without irony, \"Dogs don't discriminate against you\".A study by the National University of Singapore's (NUS) social-work department stated that \"the working poor in Singapore \u2026 is defined as someone earning less than half of the average monthly income of a Singaporean, which now stands at S$3,000\". The World Bank's poverty line is set at 50% of the country's mean income.But Singapore's minister for social and family development, Chan Chun Sing, has said the government doesn't want to define a poverty line in Singapore. The reason is to avoid a cliff effect, where families narrowly above the poverty line will not be privy to the subsidies and benefits offered to families below the line. \"We don't feel poor because we have each other,\" says Patricia, looking at Sham, \"but knowing how rich some people are in Singapore, I think we are poor\".\u00a0In contrast, it's coming up roses for a growing upper class \u2013 17% of Singapore's population has a net worth of over S$1m and more rich individuals are flocking here, drawn by the low corporate tax rate, no capital gains or estate tax, and a personal income tax capped at 20%.Jim Rogers, the famed American investor, now resides in Singapore. He has said \"Singapore is the most successful country of the past 40 years. We've gone from half a million people living in poverty to 5 million people living prosperous lives.\"When Patricia is asked what she would desire if money were no object, however, she replies immediately: \"A flat of my own, a diploma, and for someone to give Sham a chance at a job.\" Simple things, yet indicative of a growing gap between a wealthy minority and the rest of the country.", "tags": ["Cities", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Unaffordable cities: Singapore workers tread water on millionaires' island"},{"date": "2014-05-13T09:39:00Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "The National University of Singapore (NUS) has topped the QS Asian university rankings for the first time, rising from second place in last year's table.Singapore's other large public university, the Nanyang Technologucal University, joins the NUS in the top ten, rising three places to be ranked seventh.

Last year, a fierce riot broke out in the suburb of Little India, after an Indian worker died in a road accident. The riot was as violent as it was rare (the last riot took place in 1969) and provoked intense scrutiny into how migrant workers are treated in the country.Although Singapore's prime minister Lee Hsien Loong dismissed the riot as an \"isolated incident arising from unlawful actions of an unruly mob\", others saw it as an expression of long-simmering discontent. An editorial in The New York Times argued that migrant workers were \"underappreciated and underpaid\", and attributed the riot to systematic problems with migrant living conditions.The riot was not caused solely by migrant working conditions. Other factors included alcohol and anger at the way the police responded in the early stages.According to Jolovan Wham of Home, an organisation that supports migrant workers in Singapore, \"it has been observable, particularly over the past couple of years, that riots tend to occur among marginalised groups. This is a characteristic for many large-scale riots around the world.\"\"Regardless of the causes of the riot\", Wham adds, \"it is a good opportunity for us to reflect and re-think our attitudes, policies, and laws which affect migrant workers.\"\u00a0Singapore offers no minimum wage for its migrant population, and little in the way of legislative protection. Union representation is extremely limited, and organised public demonstrations \u2013 unless you are a Singaporean citizen \u2013 are banned.And if you get injured on the job, chances are you'll need to fight for compensation, battling recalcitrant employers who delay payouts beyond reasonable waiting times or resist altogether \u2013 by denying that accidents took place on site, by taking you to a \"company\" doctor who downgrades the seriousness of injuries, or by forcibly repatriating you.According to Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), most cases take between three and six months to be resolved, while other cases have been stalled for over a year. Some workers have been waiting more than two years for compensation \u2013 and are still waiting.Moreover, workers receive no economic support from the government while their cases are being assessed, and although they are entitled to medical leave, their employers don't always pay up.Debbie Fordyce, an executive committee member of TWC2, says most cases she sees are salary disputes, compensation claims and medical problems. The organisation registers between 180 to 200 new cases each month, and at any one time is helping to resolve around 500 cases.Fordyce points out, however, that there is no way of knowing the number of individuals who who suffer similar problems but do not complain.According to Wham, \"The employer's unilateral right to cancel their work permits is a disincentive to file complaints. As a result the number of complaints lodged is not really indicative of the volume of issues being faced out there by workers.\"Fordyce adds that this also makes workers vulnerable to long-term exploitation. \"Recently I met four men from a landscaping company who told me how pleased they were with their job, their boss, their living arrangements \u2026 only to later admit that they hadn't been paid for 15 months. They didn't want to complain, afraid that if they did, they'd lose everything.\"Migrant workers often arrive in Singapore with serious debts, from training and recruitment fees incurred in their own countries. First-time Bangladeshi migrants accumulate an average debt of $7,256 (\u00a34,316) according to a 2012 report by TWC2. With a starting wage of $18 (\u00a311) a day, it takes nearly a year and a half just to recover their initial costs.These debts compel migrants to work long hours and to accept conditions that would otherwise be insupportable. John Gee, a prominent human rights activist in Singapore, says: \"Most migrants welcome overtime work, and it is very normal for men in the construction sector to work a lot of overtime. The legal maximum is an extra four hours a day, but we see many signs of this being exceeded.\"He adds: \"One accident on a building site in January was reported in the early hours of the morning: what were men doing working so late into the night?\"Such questions require urgent attention, and cannot go unanswered in a country of Singapore's wealth. The country has the world's highest proportion of millionaires per capita. According to WealthInsight, nearly one in 20 Singaporeans will be millionaires by 2017. But these first world indicators \u2013 although it is an open question whether a society of elite millionaires is a sign of progress \u2013 continue to exist alongside third world conditions.As Gee says: \"When assessing educational standards or economic performance, Singapore compares itself to the best countries in the world.

He omits to mention another vibrant group of idealists among the Indian diaspora. Their enthusiasm about the newly formed Aam Adami party, helping (in Jack's words) \"to root out the corruption of politicians and public officials and clarify the country's purpose\", is so strong that a significant number of them have resigned their well-paid jobs and gone to India to campaign for its victory. Only they are taking on the corruption in all political parties, including Modi's BJP. In the recent Delhi assembly elections the contribution of Aap supporters from UK, the US and Singapore was a game-changer.Jack's claim that \"an investigation by India's supreme court cleared Modi of deliberately permitting the violence\" on Gudjarat is a misinterpretation. The supreme court ordered an investigation by the special investigative team and also appointed an amicus curiae to independently assess the team's findings. The amicus disagreed with the team's conclusion that there was not enough prosecutable evidence. Two supreme-court-ordered investigations with opposite conclusions. How does that clear Modi? Only a trial can prove his guilt or innocence.Emeritus professor Gautam AppaLondon School of Economics\u2022 Ian Jack writes of Narendra Modi that \"a comparison of the likely loser and winner in the election should gladden the heart of anyone who believes in upward social mobility\", pointing out that Modi was once a tea-seller. Yet surely candidates' values and policies are more important than their social backgrounds? Mussolini was of humble origin, the son of a blacksmith. Idi Amin, too, came from a poor background, beginning as an assistant cook in the army. Violent extremism is unacceptable, regardless of the early life of those who espouse it.To Mr Jack it may appear that shopkeepers in north London who support the far-right candidate represent the ordinary people of India. The numerous people left destitute by Mr Modi's actions (or failures to act) in Gujarat \u2013 from slum-dwelling Muslims whose homes were destroyed in 2002, to those Hindu peasants whose land has been seized for the benefit of big business \u2013 may disagree.Savitri HensmanLondon\u2022 Returning from India last week, I thought it was clear that ordinary Indians feel a change is necessary after decades of Congress party rule. The social inequalities are stark; everyday corruption is rife and frustrations evident in hardworking people. Resentment towards the massive investment benefiting Delhi at the expense of poorer regions is openly expressed. Indians deserve better government and Modi offers a promise of a better future. Hopefully western governments will give him a fair hearing and establish a productive working relationship. The necessary changes will not be easy and will require time to embed.

As a result the number of complaints lodged is not really indicative of the volume of issues being faced out there by workers.\"Fordyce adds that this also makes workers vulnerable to long-term exploitation. \"Recently I met four men from a landscaping company who told me how pleased they were with their job, their boss, their living arrangements \u2026 only to later admit that they hadn't been paid for 15 months. They didn't want to complain, afraid that if they did, they'd lose everything.\"Migrant workers often arrive in Singapore with serious debts, from training and recruitment fees incurred in their own countries. First-time Bangladeshi migrants accumulate an average debt of $7,256 (\u00a34,316) according to a 2012 report by TWC2. With a starting wage of $18 (\u00a311) a day, it takes nearly a year and a half just to recover their initial costs.These debts compel migrants to work long hours and to accept conditions that would otherwise be insupportable. John Gee, a prominent human rights activist in Singapore, says: \"Most migrants welcome overtime work, and it is very normal for men in the construction sector to work a lot of overtime. The legal maximum is an extra four hours a day, but we see many signs of this being exceeded.\"He adds: \"One accident on a building site in January was reported in the early hours of the morning: what were men doing working so late into the night?\"Such questions require urgent attention, and cannot go unanswered in a country of Singapore's wealth. The country has the world's highest proportion of millionaires per capita. According to WealthInsight, nearly one in 20 Singaporeans will be millionaires by 2017. But these first world indicators \u2013 although it is an open question whether a society of elite millionaires is a sign of progress \u2013 continue to exist alongside third world conditions.As Gee says: \"When assessing educational standards or economic performance, Singapore compares itself to the best countries in the world. So why does it change its standards when it comes to human rights?\"Join the community of global development professionals and experts.

He omits to mention another vibrant group of idealists among the Indian diaspora. Their enthusiasm about the newly formed Aam Adami party, helping (in Jack's words) \"to root out the corruption of politicians and public officials and clarify the country's purpose\", is so strong that a significant number of them have resigned their well-paid jobs and gone to India to campaign for its victory. Only they are taking on the corruption in all political parties, including Modi's BJP. In the recent Delhi assembly elections the contribution of Aap supporters from UK, the US and Singapore was a game-changer.Jack's claim that \"an investigation by India's supreme court cleared Modi of deliberately permitting the violence\" on Gudjarat is a misinterpretation. The supreme court ordered an investigation by the special investigative team and also appointed an amicus curiae to independently assess the team's findings. The amicus disagreed with the team's conclusion that there was not enough prosecutable evidence. Two supreme-court-ordered investigations with opposite conclusions. How does that clear Modi? Only a trial can prove his guilt or innocence.Emeritus professor Gautam AppaLondon School of Economics\u2022 Ian Jack writes of Narendra Modi that \"a comparison of the likely loser and winner in the election should gladden the heart of anyone who believes in upward social mobility\", pointing out that Modi was once a tea-seller. Yet surely candidates' values and policies are more important than their social backgrounds? Mussolini was of humble origin, the son of a blacksmith. Idi Amin, too, came from a poor background, beginning as an assistant cook in the army. Violent extremism is unacceptable, regardless of the early life of those who espouse it.To Mr Jack it may appear that shopkeepers in north London who support the far-right candidate represent the ordinary people of India. The numerous people left destitute by Mr Modi's actions (or failures to act) in Gujarat \u2013 from slum-dwelling Muslims whose homes were destroyed in 2002, to those Hindu peasants whose land has been seized for the benefit of big business \u2013 may disagree.Savitri HensmanLondon\u2022 Returning from India last week, I thought it was clear that ordinary Indians feel a change is necessary after decades of Congress party rule. The social inequalities are stark; everyday corruption is rife and frustrations evident in hardworking people. Resentment towards the massive investment benefiting Delhi at the expense of poorer regions is openly expressed. Indians deserve better government and Modi offers a promise of a better future. Hopefully western governments will give him a fair hearing and establish a productive working relationship. The necessary changes will not be easy and will require time to embed. Caution and compromise coupled with effective leadership could result in a fairer, more prosperous outcome for the youth of this great country.Sally BatesCotgrave, Nottinghamshire", "tags": ["Narendra Modi", "India elections 2014", "World news", "India"], "title": "Modi cannot count on all the ordinary people of India  | @guardianletters"},{"date": "2014-05-01T16:34:01Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "When Anthony Chen was a child in Singapore, his parents employed a Filipina nanny. Generally speaking, he says, the relationship between such maids and employers is \"quite brutal. You invite a stranger into your home and have them form a relationship with your children over a number of years. Then when you decide you don't need help any more, you send them home, and that sense of family is very brutally erased.\"Instead of erasing his own nanny, Chen made a film about her. And it isn't brutal at all. Ilo Ilo, which won the Camera D'Or award [for best debut feature] at last year's Cannes film festival, is a sensitive, observant study of a Singaporean family under pressure, and their new Filpina domestic help, who's under even more pressure. It is set in 1997, around the time Chen was just saying goodbye to his nanny, who had been part of the family for eight years. The character in the film has the same name: Teresa, or \"Aunty Terry\", as Chen called her, and Ilo Ilo is the province of the Philippines where she came from and returned to. In the film, Aunty Terry's treatment is somewhat harsher than in reality, Chen stresses. She sleeps on a roll-out bed in the same room as the vindictive little brat of a boy she's charged with looking after. And when she's not being stitched up by him, there are the domestic chores, the cold, imperious mother, the father pushed to the brink by the Asian economic crisis, and her guilt over her own son, growing up without a mother back in the Philippines. Mary Poppins it ain't.This type of domestic arrangement has been the accepted norm in Singapore and affluent parts of east Asia for decades now \u2013 to the extent that few film-makers have examined it. Probably half of all Singaporean families have a live-in domestic helper, Chen estimates, though most of them are now from Indonesia: \"Filipinos have become too expensive.\" \"It's not like the western bourgeois idea of having a servant to show you're of a certain class,\" he says. \"Eighty per cent of Singapore is middle class, but both parents have to work to bring in the bread, and they need someone to help with the children. So it's not so much a luxury, more a necessity. It's simple economic pragmatism.\" That cliched \"Asian work ethic\" cuts both ways, though. \"You could argue that a lot of the maids have forsaken their own children in the same way these working parents have, in pursuit of a better life. There's a lot of irony there.\"The traditional Chinese parenting style has been boosted by Amy Chua and her \"Tiger Mom\" philosophy, and notoriously rule-bound Singapore could be seen as the embodiment of those cliched \"Asian\" values: self-discipline, respect for authority, hard work, corporal punishment. Ilo Ilo doesn't indict or defend the situation, it simply observes. It is marvellously even-handed and empathetic towards all its characters, even the brattish son, which makes it feel like the work of a veteran auteur. Chinese families around the world have told Chen they recognise so much in it, he says. Like the family banquet scene, where beneath the respectful niceties, relatives subtly jostle to impart their status, keeping a lid on their problems and making a show of generosity so as not to lose face. \"My films always revolve around human relations and the delicate emotions between people,\" he says. \"I'm very wary of making a sort of activist film or a huge socio-political statement. The last thing I wanted was to make a film that's didactic \u2013 what's right, what's wrong \u2013 life is too complex for that.\"One of the things that helped Chen portray his country so clearly was the fact that he didn't live there when he wrote Ilo Ilo. He came to London to study at the National Film and Television School in 2007 (where Pawel Pawlikowski was one of his tutors) and has been here ever since. He had already made 10 short films in Singapore, some of which won awards at Cannes and other festivals, but he felt he had more to learn before making a feature. \"I'd heard horror stories about American film schools,\" he says. Directing had been an ambition since he was 15. While other kids were watching Jackie Chan films and Hong Kong crime thrillers, Chen was drawn to the work of Taiwanese auteurs such as Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Ang Lee and especially Edward Yang, to whom he's often been compared (Yang's A Brighter Summer Day is his all-time favourite film). He also discovered the French New Wave and China's \"fifth generation\" film-makers like Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou. \"I probably didn't understand what was going on in those films, but growing up in a concrete jungle, I took an interest in the beauty of the countryside,\" he says. He was also smitten by Zhang's regular leading lady, Gong Li, it seems. Predictably, Chen's film-making ambitions didn't go down a storm with his own \"tiger parents\", he says, though his younger brothers are in banking and business, so he's off the hook.He's practically a national hero back hom now. Ilo Ilo was the first Singaporean film to win an award at Cannes, and it has accumulated dozens more across the world since, including the Sutherland Trophy at last year's London Film Festival (Edward Yang won the same award back in 1987). He's met the president and the prime minister, and the film has been a commercial hit domestically \u2013 usually the Cannes laurels are the box-office kiss of death in arthouse-resistant Singapore, he jokes. He still can't believe it all. \"Being selected for Cannes is every film-maker's dream, but to be really, really honest, I was quite worried as well, because it's a very humble piece of work. It's a delicate film. I made it for \u00a3300,000. A film like that could go unnoticed and undiscovered among all the heavyweight auteurs and big stars there.\"After a year promoting Ilo Ilo around the world, he's now \"itching to make another film\", he says \"I feel so useless when I'm not working.\" It could be an English-language film (he's talking to British producers), or he has some ideas set in Singapore. Before that, he has another project to complete, he says. His wife is studying for a PhD in London, and they hope to have a child soon, he says. Their conversations about childcare should be interesting.The success of Ilo Ilo also had one unexpected repercussion: Chen found his Aunty Terry. His family had lost contact with her when she moved back to the Philippines, when Chen was 12 years old. Finding her was all but impossible, he thought. \"How do you look for someone with no address? The Philippines is huge: 90 million people! The only thing I knew was that she came from Ilo Ilo province. I didn't even know her last name, she was just Aunty Terry.\" But the film caught the attention of the Filipino media, which launched a campaign to track down Aunty Terry. Two weeks later, a niece of hers living overseas heard about the hunt on the radio. It turned out Aunty Terry, AKA Teresita Sajonia, was living in a wooden hut in a small village, raising ducks and chickens. Chen and his brother went to see her and had an emotional reunion, he says. She had tried to write to the family but they'd moved house. \"She kept such strong memories of us because she didn't have children. In fact, she had a blue pouch she wears everywhere she goes, and she told us that my mum gave it to her, like, 17 years ago. When she opened it, inside were photographs of me and my brothers. That really moved us to tears.\"", "tags": ["Ilo Ilo", "Film", "Culture"], "title": "Ilo Ilo director Anthony Chen: 'A lot of maids have forsaken their own children'"},{"date": "2014-08-28T13:47:46Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "The city-state of Singapore may be very small in absolute terms, but commercially there\u2019s no question it punches above its weight.

Today, while its street food is still widely known, most locals agree that the same dishes are done much better (and more affordably) across the Straits in Malaysia. The big news in the tiny nation\u2019s culinary scene hasn\u2019t come from its hawkers but from its chefs \u2013 toqued, jacketed, some starred, some hatted, and many of whom have come from distant lands. Singapore, in the last 10 years, has become a nexus for great young chefs, eager to make a name for themselves and find well-heeled patrons who will not just spend freely in their restaurants but back them and their concepts financially. Chefs such as Andr\u00e9 Chiang and Ryan Clift, both foreign and both with impeccable kitchen credentials, have opened successful flagships in Singapore and have been embraced, by the country and its people, as national culinary icons.More recently, the dining scene has become even more diversified. Chefs who have slogged it out at big-name establishments have started to branch out, opening tiny, trendy places that cater to a range of audiences. Young locals who have travelled have started emulating niche concepts, finding that Singapore\u2019s population is ready to seek out the extraordinary culinary offerings.

Not only does it now look sleeker and more upmarket, his food is noticeably more sophisticated. The best addition is the dining bar, over which Low serves his new eight-course degustation menu. His salted egg crab ball, the pomelo salad with tiger prawns, the frozen coconut ice-cream, and the constantly evolving dish he calls \u201cSingapore noodles\u201d are must-haves.\u2022 Eight-course tasting menu $118, most mains $30-$40.

Riding on the trend of shared plates, good affordable wine and craft cocktails, Ding Dong offers its customers an exciting menu made of Asian-inspired small plates and a wide range of drinks, including some exceptional draught wines. As you would expect from Clift \u2013 well known for using modern science to enhance food and flavours, many of the dishes here are surprising and novel. My personal favourite is the Malacca chendol 2013, a fun dessert as well as an incredibly delicious concoction.

One, it is in the Freemason\u2019s clubhouse, a place many of us knew about but never expected to be able to step inside. And two, the restaurant\u2019s head chef is Ivan Brehm, former head of Heston Blumenthal\u2019s R&D kitchen in the UK, who also brought along two friends from The Fat Duck. That said, Bacchanalia\u2019s menu is nothing like the Duck\u2019s. It\u2019s surprisingly affordable, it offers a wide variety of dishes, many of them designed to be shared. What Brehm\u2019s cooking does share with Blumenthal\u2019s is wit and technique. My favourite dishes are the cauliflower gratin, the vegetable \u201csalad\u201d, the Norweigian scallops served with borlotti beans, kalix caviar and cocoa, and Brehm\u2019s satay sauce marinated foie gras.

He said the weather in the area was cloudy. The Singapore statement said search and rescue operations had been activated by the Indonesian authorities. It said the Singapore air force and the navy also were searching with two C-130 planes.

Today, while its street food is still widely known, most locals agree that the same dishes are done much better (and more affordably) across the Straits in Malaysia. The big news in the tiny nation\u2019s culinary scene hasn\u2019t come from its hawkers but from its chefs \u2013 toqued, jacketed, some starred, some hatted, and many of whom have come from distant lands. Singapore, in the last 10 years, has become a nexus for great young chefs, eager to make a name for themselves and find well-heeled patrons who will not just spend freely in their restaurants but back them and their concepts financially. Chefs such as Andr\u00e9 Chiang and Ryan Clift, both foreign and both with impeccable kitchen credentials, have opened successful flagships in Singapore and have been embraced, by the country and its people, as national culinary icons.More recently, the dining scene has become even more diversified. Chefs who have slogged it out at big-name establishments have started to branch out, opening tiny, trendy places that cater to a range of audiences. Young locals who have travelled have started emulating niche concepts, finding that Singapore\u2019s population is ready to seek out the extraordinary culinary offerings.

Not only does it now look sleeker and more upmarket, his food is noticeably more sophisticated. The best addition is the dining bar, over which Low serves his new eight-course degustation menu. His salted egg crab ball, the pomelo salad with tiger prawns, the frozen coconut ice-cream, and the constantly evolving dish he calls \u201cSingapore noodles\u201d are must-haves.\u2022 Eight-course tasting menu $118, most mains $30-$40.

Riding on the trend of shared plates, good affordable wine and craft cocktails, Ding Dong offers its customers an exciting menu made of Asian-inspired small plates and a wide range of drinks, including some exceptional draught wines. As you would expect from Clift \u2013 well known for using modern science to enhance food and flavours, many of the dishes here are surprising and novel. My personal favourite is the Malacca chendol 2013, a fun dessert as well as an incredibly delicious concoction.

One, it is in the Freemason\u2019s clubhouse, a place many of us knew about but never expected to be able to step inside. And two, the restaurant\u2019s head chef is Ivan Brehm, former head of Heston Blumenthal\u2019s R&D kitchen in the UK, who also brought along two friends from The Fat Duck. That said, Bacchanalia\u2019s menu is nothing like the Duck\u2019s. It\u2019s surprisingly affordable, it offers a wide variety of dishes, many of them designed to be shared. What Brehm\u2019s cooking does share with Blumenthal\u2019s is wit and technique. My favourite dishes are the cauliflower gratin, the vegetable \u201csalad\u201d, the Norweigian scallops served with borlotti beans, kalix caviar and cocoa, and Brehm\u2019s satay sauce marinated foie gras.

It never arrived.It had lost contact with air traffic controllers in Jakarta not long after taking off from Surabaya in East Java, and vanished somewhere between Pontianak in West Kalimantan and Tanjung Pandan in Belitung Island. 162 people were on board; 155 passengers and seven crew members. As night falls over Singapore, the QZ8501 listing has finally been removed from arrival boards in Singapore\u2019s bustling Changi airport. Earlier it had read \u201cgo to info counter\u201d, in sharp contrast to all the other flights that were upgraded from \u201cconfirmed\u201d to \u201clanded\u201d.Airport staff quickly established a private \u201crelatives holding area\u201d (RHA) for family and friends of the missing passengers. The entrance is cordoned off, and guarded by security officers to protect the anxious relatives from prying eyes. Just beyond the cordon the press corps wait, eager for news and updates. Without any press conferences or media briefings, reporters are desperate for any tidbit that they can find. Any next-of-kin found outside the private area is swiftly surrounded by a media scrum, microphones and cameras shoved in their faces. This was how Louise Sidharta found herself surrounded by journalists, eager to hear her story. The 25-year-old Indonesian\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was on the flight, along with his parents and other relatives: a fact that she had found out over the radio this morning. \u201cThey say we just need to wait until we have more updates,\u201d she told the press shortly before being ushered into the holding area. According to a press statement by the Changi Airport Group (CAG), 47 family and friends of 57 passengers are waiting for news behind the cordon and screens.Beyond the impatient journalists lined up against the walls texting their editors and updating live blogs, the rest of Changi Airport carries on business as usual. Families take photos before the elaborate Christmas decorations, and travellers continue to queue at the check-in counters, including AirAsia\u2019s.Travellers speak of sadness and sympathy for the tragedy, but none I spoke to said they would reconsider travelling with AirAsia. Just before 9pm a CAG spokesman informed the press that all next-of-kin had been moved from the holding area, leaving from another exit away from the press. 16 people took up the offer to fly to Surabaya to join the many other waiting relatives there, he said. The rest chose either to return home or stay in a hotel.With the search and rescue operations \u2013 and by extension, the media briefings \u2013 spearheaded by Indonesia, information is sparse in Changi airport. We know that Singapore has offered help to Indonesia: one C130 aircraft has since been launched, with two more planes to set off tomorrow morning.An officer from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will also send an officer to assist in the coordination of search and locate efforts, said a statement from CAAS.Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Transport\u2019s Air Accident Investigation Bureau also offered two teams of specialists and two sets of underwater locator beacon detectors to assist in the search, said CAAS.Among the missing passengers is also one British national, travelling with his two-year-old Singaporean daughter.

That\u2019s why a pilot will routinely ask to divert around them. The plane could not still be airborne - it was a short-haul flight, there would be no fuel for staying in the air for quite as long as this.\u201d Learmount, who is a pilot, also ruled out the likelihood of passengers surviving a sea landing. \u201cThe pilots were talking to air traffic control right until the last minute. Something distracted their attention so they were no longer able to keep talking. We don\u2019t know what happened at the moment, and it doesn\u2019t appear to be a deliberate act. We can speculate ad infinitum when the only thing we can go on is that it is missing.

Lua is the founder of Archiwalks, a set of \u201cstorytelling\u201d walks through arty pockets of the city centre, such as Bugis, Kampong Glam and Bras Basah.\u201cFor a long time Singapore has been such a practical society, but the way I\u2019m seeing change right now is that there are more and more people doing impractical things. People are leaving finance and similar careers, and setting up printing studios, galleries and magazines \u2013 things not driven by a focus on money but by creativity and self-fulfilment.\u201dLua, a design obsessive, counts himself among them. He left a job as a pricing analyst at Singapore Airlines to become the general manager of Peatix Singapore, an independent ticketing platform, and also led art walks around Singapore\u2019s Tiong Bahru and Marina areas for OH! Open House, a project placing artworks in people\u2019s homes and opening them up to the public. Here, he lists 10 spots to find the best of independent design in the Lion City.Last year, Singapore\u2019s government announced an ambitious plan to position the city state as one of Asia\u2019s biggest cultural and artistic \u201cecosystems\u201d, injecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants, scholarships, festivals and infrastructure for the arts community. More than 50 contemporary galleries, including the acclaimed Singapore Art Museum, are thriving, while the success of the Singapore Biennale and Art Stage Singapore have bolstered this vision. In March, the National Design Centre opened its doors in the former St Anthony\u2019s Convent, a 120-year-old white art-deco gem, with a clutch of studios featuring exhibitions ranging from Japanese design to designing \u201cfood experiences\u201d. The centre also houses DesignSingapore Council and the airy boutique and cafe Kapok. One quarter of the 100 niche brands on sale at this emporium are Singaporean, from Biro\u2019s menswear to the silky, draped dresses of Stolen and Saught\u2019s sleek scrap metal jewellery. \u201cThis could have been a standard museum but the point is you can explore local design in a more accessible form. The coffee is excellent here, and you\u2019re sitting on works of art,\u201d says Lua.\u2022 Admission free, designsingapore.org/NDC. Open daily 9am-9pmLua spent much of his formative years sequestered away in the graphic-novel bookstores of this kitsch concrete complex \u2013 a labyrinth of art supply stores, printing shops, small galleries and bookstores. \u201cI always stumble across the most unusual objects here \u2013 if you\u2019re a design obsessive, this a great place to check out. The building itself is unattractive but was historically important as a haven for bookworms and Chinese literature fans.\u201dThe area is within walking distance of many of Singapore\u2019s art schools and the complex has evolved to reflect their needs, Lua says. Part of his design education, he adds, was traipsing four floors up to Basheer Graphic Books, a favourite haunt of Singapore\u2019s designers, illustrators, animators and architects, with a dizzying range of hard-to-find art and design literature, magazines and journals. Also inside the maze is Art Commune studio and gallery, set up in 2009 by Ho Sou Ping, who left an aerospace engineering career to become an artist and curator. Swing by quirky boutique Cat Socrates, just across from the gallery, for pretty stationery, badges, toys, printed dresses \u2013 much of it designed and made in Singapore.\u2022 bras-basah-complex.com.sgOverlooking bustling Middle Road, this leafy hilltop was once home to Singapore\u2019s blue-blooded. Many of their grand mansions along Upper Wilkie Road have been torn down and replaced by slick condos, but in 2007 a committee of creatives formed to save and restore this colonial building into an arts hub. Lua lists Kult 3D \u2013 an \u201curban\u201d street art gallery, shop and studio here \u2013 as one of the edgier design spots on the island. \u201cThese guys do really creative things in terms of illustration and graphic design and are champions of street art \u2013 which is not common in Singapore.\u201d Kult also publishes a cool quarterly magazine under the same name. Along with exhibitions, Kult sells fun \u201cLast Tango in Pasir Ris\u201d calico tote bags and framed illustrations.

With an incongruous yet commanding locale, the pop-up has become a creative hub in the city; there are also workshops, designer Q&As and exhibitions that offer a glimpse into the creative process, along with pop-up restaurants, food trucks and more. \u201cIn terms of design stores and retail, I\u2019m excited to see so much experimentation in Singapore. It\u2019s too much of a gamble for emerging designers and artists to invest in a year\u2019s rental in a [real estate] climate like Singapore\u2019s.

She told reporters she was hoping for the best and urged everyone to \u201cthink positive thoughts\u201d. \u201cThis was supposed to be his last trip with his family before we got married,\u201d she added.You can read her story in full here.Updated\nat 3.12pm GMT\n\n\n2.57pm GMT\n14:57\n\nKirsten Han (@kixes), a Singaporean journalist, describes the scene at Changi airport, where relatives of the missing passengers are anxiously awaiting news.AirAsia flight QZ8501 was meant to land in Singapore at 8:30 in the morning on 28 December. It never arrived.It had lost contact with air traffic controllers in Jakarta not long after taking off from Surabaya in East Java, and vanished somewhere between Pontianak in West Kalimantan and Tanjung Pandan in Belitung Island. 162 people were on board; 155 passengers and seven crew members. As night falls over Singapore, the QZ8501 listing has finally been removed from arrival boards in Singapore\u2019s bustling Changi airport. Earlier it had read \u201cgo to info counter\u201d, in sharp contrast to all the other flights that were upgraded from \u201cconfirmed\u201d to \u201clanded\u201d.Airport staff quickly established a private \u201crelatives holding area\u201d (RHA) for family and friends of the missing passengers. The entrance is cordoned off, and guarded by security officers to protect the anxious relatives from prying eyes. Just beyond the cordon the press corps wait, eager for news and updates. Without any press conferences or media briefings, reporters are desperate for any tidbit that they can find. Any next-of-kin found outside the private area is swiftly surrounded by a media scrum, microphones and cameras shoved in their faces. This was how Louise Sidharta found herself surrounded by journalists, eager to hear her story. The 25-year-old Indonesian\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was on the flight, along with his parents and other relatives: a fact that she had found out over the radio this morning. \u201cThey say we just need to wait until we have more updates,\u201d she told the press shortly before being ushered into the holding area. According to a press statement by the Changi Airport Group (CAG), 47 family and friends of 57 passengers are waiting for news behind the cordon and screens.Beyond the impatient journalists lined up against the walls texting their editors and updating live blogs, the rest of Changi Airport carries on business as usual. Families take photos before the elaborate Christmas decorations, and travellers continue to queue at the check-in counters, including AirAsia\u2019s.Travellers speak of sadness and sympathy for the tragedy, but none I spoke to said they would reconsider travelling with AirAsia. Just before 9pm a CAG spokesman informed the press that all next-of-kin had been moved from the holding area, leaving from another exit away from the press. 16 people took up the offer to fly to Surabaya to join the many other waiting relatives there, he said. The rest chose either to return home or stay in a hotel.With the search and rescue operations \u2013 and by extension, the media briefings \u2013 spearheaded by Indonesia, information is sparse in Changi airport. We know that Singapore has offered help to Indonesia: one C130 aircraft has since been launched, with two more planes to set off tomorrow morning.An officer from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will also send an officer to assist in the coordination of search and locate efforts, said a statement from CAAS.Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Transport\u2019s Air Accident Investigation Bureau also offered two teams of specialists and two sets of underwater locator beacon detectors to assist in the search, said CAAS.Among the missing passengers is also one British national, travelling with his two-year-old Singaporean daughter.

That\u2019s why a pilot will routinely ask to divert around them. The plane could not still be airborne - it was a short-haul flight, there would be no fuel for staying in the air for quite as long as this.\u201d Learmount, who is a pilot, also ruled out the likelihood of passengers surviving a sea landing. \u201cThe pilots were talking to air traffic control right until the last minute. Something distracted their attention so they were no longer able to keep talking. We don\u2019t know what happened at the moment, and it doesn\u2019t appear to be a deliberate act. We can speculate ad infinitum when the only thing we can go on is that it is missing.

He had no experience of running an airline, but this did not deter him and he set about transforming the carrier into a short-haul low cost airline in the mould of those recently established in the West.In 2002, AirAsia had only two aircraft in the air, but under Mr Fernandes the company expanded rapidly and by the end of the decade it was flying 30 million passengers around the world on 86 planes.But the 50-year-old businessman did not stop at airlines.

They typically get issued by football chairmen just before they stab their manager in the back, but things get done slightly differently in north London \u2013 and maybe at the struggling international bank too.Sands, along with chairman Sir John Peace, got the official vote of confidence in July, and then again at the end of October. Peace was out trying to rally the troops last Wednesday, insisting to 300 of the bank\u2019s senior managers in Singapore that the business was not \u201cbroken\u201d, while the company also issued the itinerary of an investor trip to Hong Kong this week, in what looks like the latest attempt to help the embattled Sands stay in his job.Still, it\u2019s funny how Peace\u2019s views seem to have altered on this topic. Some 14 years ago, just after he\u2019d ousted Lord Wolfson as boss of Great Universal Stores, Peace rationalised that change thus: \u201cI think if anything happened in that period it was that we issued a profits warning. That tells you that you have to instigate changes instantly. You need to take action.\u201dIn the past year, Standard Chartered has issued three profit warnings.Nottingham had the highest proportion of households where there were no adults in work in the UK last year, figures showed last week. Still, one city-focused household with plenty of jobs belongs to John Peace, Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire, plus the chairman of Standard Chartered (see above) and Burberry. Apart from swanning around Asia, Peace\u2019s eye will also be on the luxury goods group this week, where interim results will be fronted by chief executive Christopher Bailey, now six months (and one pay revolt) into the job.Despite Bailey\u2019s well-known talents, the company has been telling City analysts not to expect too much, with profits predicted to be down following a \u201cpunishing\u201d period with foreign exchange. There are also concerns about China (a recurrent Peace theme) and Burberry has already admitted to some \u201csoftening in growth from Chinese consumers\u201d.Still, the good news is that everybody seems to love celebrity offspring Romeo Beckham, who\u2019s appearing in Burberry\u2019s new Christmas ad. It lasts a full four minutes, and this time shareholders have definitely got their money\u2019s worth. It seems longer.\u201cLonmin is pleased to announce that it has achieved a full calendar year without a fatality. This important safety milestone was reached on Monday 27 October 2014 ...

Today, while its street food is still widely known, most locals agree that the same dishes are done much better (and more affordably) across the Straits in Malaysia. The big news in the tiny nation\u2019s culinary scene hasn\u2019t come from its hawkers but from its chefs \u2013 toqued, jacketed, some starred, some hatted, and many of whom have come from distant lands. Singapore, in the last 10 years, has become a nexus for great young chefs, eager to make a name for themselves and find well-heeled patrons who will not just spend freely in their restaurants but back them and their concepts financially. Chefs such as Andr\u00e9 Chiang and Ryan Clift, both foreign and both with impeccable kitchen credentials, have opened successful flagships in Singapore and have been embraced, by the country and its people, as national culinary icons.More recently, the dining scene has become even more diversified. Chefs who have slogged it out at big-name establishments have started to branch out, opening tiny, trendy places that cater to a range of audiences. Young locals who have travelled have started emulating niche concepts, finding that Singapore\u2019s population is ready to seek out the extraordinary culinary offerings. And smart entrepreneurs, recognising the global virality of food trends are quick to open concepts that are bang on trend.Here are just a few of the places that represent, to me, what\u2019s great and \u201chappening\u201d in Singapore\u2019s dining scene.

It has an interesting mix of comfort foods across different cultures such as Japanese, Italian, Spanish and even Canadian.

Riding on the trend of shared plates, good affordable wine and craft cocktails, Ding Dong offers its customers an exciting menu made of Asian-inspired small plates and a wide range of drinks, including some exceptional draught wines. As you would expect from Clift \u2013 well known for using modern science to enhance food and flavours, many of the dishes here are surprising and novel. My personal favourite is the Malacca chendol 2013, a fun dessert as well as an incredibly delicious concoction.

One, it is in the Freemason\u2019s clubhouse, a place many of us knew about but never expected to be able to step inside. And two, the restaurant\u2019s head chef is Ivan Brehm, former head of Heston Blumenthal\u2019s R&D kitchen in the UK, who also brought along two friends from The Fat Duck. That said, Bacchanalia\u2019s menu is nothing like the Duck\u2019s. It\u2019s surprisingly affordable, it offers a wide variety of dishes, many of them designed to be shared. What Brehm\u2019s cooking does share with Blumenthal\u2019s is wit and technique. My favourite dishes are the cauliflower gratin, the vegetable \u201csalad\u201d, the Norweigian scallops served with borlotti beans, kalix caviar and cocoa, and Brehm\u2019s satay sauce marinated foie gras.

The flight lost communication with Jakarta\u2019s air traffic control at 7.24am Singapore time (2324 GMT Saturday) about an hour before it was scheduled to land in Singapore, the Singapore Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement. The contact was lost about 42 minutes after the single-aisle jetliner took off from Indonesia\u2019s Surabaya airport, Hadi Mustofa, an official of the transportation ministry told Indonesia\u2019s MetroTV. The plane had six crew and 155 passengers, including 16 children and one infant, according to the general manager of Surabaya\u2019s Juanda airport, Trikora Raharjo. He said there were six foreigners: three South Koreans including an infant and one each from Singapore, Britain and Malaysia. The rest were Indonesians, he said.AirAsia, on the other hand, said in a statement there were seven crew and that there were no Britons on board.The plane lost contact when it was believed to be over the Java Sea between Kalimantan and Java islands, Mustofa said. He said the weather in the area was cloudy. The Singapore statement said search and rescue operations had been activated by the Indonesian authorities. It said the Singapore air force and the navy also were searching with two C-130 planes. Flightradar24, a flight tracking website, said the plane was delivered in September 2008, which would make it six years old.

People are leaving finance and similar careers, and setting up printing studios, galleries and magazines \u2013 things not driven by a focus on money but by creativity and self-fulfilment.\u201dLua, a design obsessive, counts himself among them.

More than 50 contemporary galleries, including the acclaimed Singapore Art Museum, are thriving, while the success of the Singapore Biennale and Art Stage Singapore have bolstered this vision. In March, the National Design Centre opened its doors in the former St Anthony\u2019s Convent, a 120-year-old white art-deco gem, with a clutch of studios featuring exhibitions ranging from Japanese design to designing \u201cfood experiences\u201d.

The entrance is cordoned off, and guarded by security officers to protect the anxious relatives from prying eyes. Just beyond the cordon the press corps wait, eager for news and updates. Without any press conferences or media briefings, reporters are desperate for any tidbit that they can find. Any next-of-kin found outside the private area is swiftly surrounded by a media scrum, microphones and cameras shoved in their faces. This was how Louise Sidharta found herself surrounded by journalists, eager to hear her story. The 25-year-old Indonesian\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was on the flight, along with his parents and other relatives: a fact that she had found out over the radio this morning. \u201cThey say we just need to wait until we have more updates,\u201d she told the press shortly before being ushered into the holding area. According to a press statement by the Changi Airport Group (CAG), 47 family and friends of 57 passengers are waiting for news behind the cordon and screens.Beyond the impatient journalists lined up against the walls texting their editors and updating live blogs, the rest of Changi Airport carries on business as usual. Families take photos before the elaborate Christmas decorations, and travellers continue to queue at the check-in counters, including AirAsia\u2019s.Travellers speak of sadness and sympathy for the tragedy, but none I spoke to said they would reconsider travelling with AirAsia. Just before 9pm a CAG spokesman informed the press that all next-of-kin had been moved from the holding area, leaving from another exit away from the press. 16 people took up the offer to fly to Surabaya to join the many other waiting relatives there, he said. The rest chose either to return home or stay in a hotel.With the search and rescue operations \u2013 and by extension, the media briefings \u2013 spearheaded by Indonesia, information is sparse in Changi airport. We know that Singapore has offered help to Indonesia: one C130 aircraft has since been launched, with two more planes to set off tomorrow morning.An officer from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will also send an officer to assist in the coordination of search and locate efforts, said a statement from CAAS.Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Transport\u2019s Air Accident Investigation Bureau also offered two teams of specialists and two sets of underwater locator beacon detectors to assist in the search, said CAAS.Among the missing passengers is also one British national, travelling with his two-year-old Singaporean daughter. Their family were contacted earlier and present at the RHA.Updated\nat 3.03pm GMT\n\n\n1.44pm GMT\n13:44\n\nFrom our graphics team.\n\n1.17pm GMT\n13:17\n\n\n\n1.06pm GMT\n13:06\n\nDavid Learmount, Flight Global\u2019s operations and safety editor, tells the Press Association that the chance of finding survivors is slim.He said it was \u201croutine\u201d for pilots to request diversions when approaching stormy conditions, as was the case with the Airbus A320-200. \u201cWe\u2019re not just talking about thunder and lightning here,\u201d he said. \u201cStorms can be very, very powerful indeed and rip a medium-sized aeroplane completely apart. That\u2019s why a pilot will routinely ask to divert around them. The plane could not still be airborne - it was a short-haul flight, there would be no fuel for staying in the air for quite as long as this.\u201d Learmount, who is a pilot, also ruled out the likelihood of passengers surviving a sea landing. \u201cThe pilots were talking to air traffic control right until the last minute. Something distracted their attention so they were no longer able to keep talking. We don\u2019t know what happened at the moment, and it doesn\u2019t appear to be a deliberate act. We can speculate ad infinitum when the only thing we can go on is that it is missing. But I think the prognosis is not good.\u201dUpdated\nat 1.28pm GMT\n\n\n1.00pm GMT\n13:00\n\nLouise Sidharta, 25, told reporters that her fiance, Alain, was on the plane with five family members. \u201cThis was supposed to be his last trip with his family before we got married.\u201d The video is from Channel NewsAsia.\n\n12.42pm GMT\n12:42\n\nAP reports that the disappearance of an AirAsia jet is the latest air incident for Indonesia as it struggles to provide enough qualified pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers and updated airport technology to ensure safety.

Parts of the tail and other debris are found several days later, but it would take nearly nine months for the flight-data and cockpit recorders to be recovered. The fuselage is still on the ocean floor.September 2005: A flight from Indonesia\u2019s now-defunct Mandala Airlines is headed from Medan in north Sumatra to Bali when the plane crashes into a heavily populated residential area seconds after taking off, killing 149 people. The fatalities included 100 people aboard the plane and 49 on the ground. Seventeen people on the plane survived.December 1997: All 104 people onboard are killed when a plane operated by Singapore-based SilkAir crashes into the Musi River in southern Sumatra en route from Jakarta to Singapore. U.S. investigators said that the pilot probably crashed on purpose, but an Indonesian investigation was inconclusive.September 1997: An Airbus A300 operated by national carrier Garuda Indonesia crashes while approaching Medan Airport, killing all 234 people aboard.

But there is no stopping.\n\n11.19am GMT\n11:19\n\nThe Telegraph has this profile of Tony Fernandes, who bought the heavily indebted AirAsia from a company owned by the Malaysian government for just 25p in 2001. He had no experience of running an airline, but this did not deter him and he set about transforming the carrier into a short-haul low cost airline in the mould of those recently established in the West.In 2002, AirAsia had only two aircraft in the air, but under Mr Fernandes the company expanded rapidly and by the end of the decade it was flying 30 million passengers around the world on 86 planes.But the 50-year-old businessman did not stop at airlines.

They typically get issued by football chairmen just before they stab their manager in the back, but things get done slightly differently in north London \u2013 and maybe at the struggling international bank too.Sands, along with chairman Sir John Peace, got the official vote of confidence in July, and then again at the end of October. Peace was out trying to rally the troops last Wednesday, insisting to 300 of the bank\u2019s senior managers in Singapore that the business was not \u201cbroken\u201d, while the company also issued the itinerary of an investor trip to Hong Kong this week, in what looks like the latest attempt to help the embattled Sands stay in his job.Still, it\u2019s funny how Peace\u2019s views seem to have altered on this topic. Some 14 years ago, just after he\u2019d ousted Lord Wolfson as boss of Great Universal Stores, Peace rationalised that change thus: \u201cI think if anything happened in that period it was that we issued a profits warning. That tells you that you have to instigate changes instantly. You need to take action.\u201dIn the past year, Standard Chartered has issued three profit warnings.Nottingham had the highest proportion of households where there were no adults in work in the UK last year, figures showed last week. Still, one city-focused household with plenty of jobs belongs to John Peace, Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire, plus the chairman of Standard Chartered (see above) and Burberry. Apart from swanning around Asia, Peace\u2019s eye will also be on the luxury goods group this week, where interim results will be fronted by chief executive Christopher Bailey, now six months (and one pay revolt) into the job.Despite Bailey\u2019s well-known talents, the company has been telling City analysts not to expect too much, with profits predicted to be down following a \u201cpunishing\u201d period with foreign exchange. There are also concerns about China (a recurrent Peace theme) and Burberry has already admitted to some \u201csoftening in growth from Chinese consumers\u201d.Still, the good news is that everybody seems to love celebrity offspring Romeo Beckham, who\u2019s appearing in Burberry\u2019s new Christmas ad.

However one wonders, before its results this week, if Lonmin might now moderate the crowing.Eight days after unveiling that positive news, it emerged that a South African judicial commission of inquiry will hear arguments from Nelson Mandela\u2019s former lawyer about how Lonmin execs should be investigated as accomplices to murder for their role in a 2012 police massacre of 34 striking mine workers. Oddly, the group seems less keen on press releases about that.\u201cLonmin has consistently said that it would not publicly comment on evidence as it is given [to the commission],\u201d it blocks. \u201cThis stance, whilst the right thing to do, has occasionally meant the company has been unable to deal with false or misleading allegations as they have emerged.\u201d\u200b Who\u2019d have thought it?", "tags": ["Standard Chartered", "Lonmin", "Burberry", "Business", "Banking"], "title": "Standard Chartered\u2019s far eastern charm offensive may not save Sands"},{"date": "2014-12-07T13:47:05Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "With 5.6 million people living in an area of 270 sq miles (700 sq km), the authorities in Singapore have invested heavily in public transport in an effort to reduce the numbers on the roads. But, like other metropolitan hubs, they faced the inevitable problem of heavy congestion at peak time between 8am and 8.45am.Part of the solution has come in the form of an incentive for passengers: if they registered their smart travel cards and commuted in the hour after these peak times, they would earn points which can be used in a raffle to win cash.The scheme was the result of work by California-based Urban Engines, which uses data from travel cards, like the Oyster card in London, along with GPS data from trains and buses to draw up a detailed model of how the residents of a city move through their transport system. The results in turn show where problems lay. Drawing up this living profile in Singapore and the subsequent incentives resulted in a drop of peak hour travel of between 7% and 13%, according to the company.\u201cAll these things are piecemeal and siloed at this point but it is really a jigsaw puzzle. If you actually put together the information that is coming from smart cards and from GPSs, then you can start figuring out what are the true traffic patterns in a city,\u201d said Shiva Shivakumar, a co-founder and chief executive of the company. \u201cEvery single bus, every single train, every single road segment, every single time. You can start seeing the patterns emerge from that. What happens when there is a big event going on? What happens if it rains? What happens when there is fog?\u201d added Shivakumar, who spent 10 years at Google working on Gmail and Google Maps among other projects.Another of the company\u2019s founders, Balaji Prabhakar, specialises in keeping internet sites running when they are getting heavy traffic. When he was stuck in heavy car traffic in Bangalore in 2007, he pondered whether the two problems could be solved in a similar way. Separately, Shivakumar was questioning whether his work in Google in making the email system faster could also be put to use in urban traffic situations. The pair came together in Stanford, California, to work on the problem and apply large amounts of data to make cities move more fluidly.\u201cHow do we use some of the ideas that we had on the web \u2026 in terms of the real world and make the mobility experience a lot faster and better?\u201d said Shivakumar. \u201cThere is a fundamental growing problem around the world.\u201dTransport authorities give Urban Engines the commuter fare card information and GPS details of train and bus systems. Fare card information from when commuters tap in and out allows the company to gauge the commuting pattern \u2013 how long people are waiting, the number of trains which passed which were too full to get on \u2013 and concludes how a system is working at any one time.\u201cWe take all that information with our data sets which have information about the entire city \u2013 all the roads, all the buses, all the trains. We take all that with the online city information which is open. There is a lot of open data \u2013 for example for roads, where are the bus stops? Where are the train stations, how long does it take to get from one train station to the next bus stop? We have processed that already, very similar to Google maps or Apple maps. We take all of that information and build up an analytical platform for all of that information,\u201d said Shivakumar.In practice, the information which is fed back to the transport authority is shown on a screen with a copy of the grid of the railway or bus system. It shows each individual train or bus snaking around their route with meters above them showing how full each one is. Figures illustrate how many commuters are in each station and the waiting times.By analysing this information, it can be decided where more trains and buses are needed or, if that is not possible, how commuters can be incentivised to travel outside of peak times in order to lessen the loads, as in Singapore, or else encourage commuters to move to an underused station as opposed to one which is over capacity.The pilot study for the system was conducted in Bangalore where incentives such as lottery tickets were used to switch an estimated 17% of commuters from their regular pattern. Another study took place in Stanford. The system is now being used in Sao Paulo in Brazil to help manage the 17,000-strong bus fleet while it is in its early stages in Washington DC.\u201cThey [transport authorities] have had average data until now which has been working well for them for a while but now the commuter patterns are changing quite a bit more,\u201d said Shivakumar.\u201cIn the US they have a 45mph speed limit on certain roads. That is an optimal speed that you want to go, and the reason that came about is because there was a research study a few years back where they looked at what is happening on average.\u201cAnd so a lot of the decisions have been made from average data as opposed to, in some cases, you want to go at a much higher speed or a much lower speed depending on the weather conditions. That is what is now possible because of the data. You can make much more nuanced decisions about how to optimise your networks.\u201dAttempting to tackle congestion, which is estimated to cost economies multiple billions every year, has attracted the attention of some heavyweight investors to Urban Engines. So far, Google chairman, Eric Schmidt, and Google Ventures are among those who have put money into the early-stage company, although how much or a valuation for the firm has not yet been released.If transport managers want to understand and locate congestion hotspots, conventional methods have been to send human surveyors to watch and analyse their results, or else use video cameras to assess the information across a range of different stations, according to Shivakumar. Another method is to use weighing scales for trains and work out the number on board by dividing by the average weight. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have weighing scales for platforms for example if you want to know how many people are waiting at each station,\u201d he said.", "tags": ["GPS", "Technology", "Road transport", "World news", "Business", "Cities", "Rail transport", "Singapore", "Brazil"], "title": "How GPS and smart card data is used to reduce city transport congestion"},{"date": "2014-12-19T06:00:09Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Go back a few decades in Singapore\u2019s culinary history and the only praiseworthy things were its well-known street food, a handful of upmarket hotel restaurants and Les Amis, the city-state\u2019s first independent, high-quality French restaurant.

The contact was lost about 42 minutes after the single-aisle jetliner took off from Indonesia\u2019s Surabaya airport, Hadi Mustofa, an official of the transportation ministry told Indonesia\u2019s MetroTV. The plane had six crew and 155 passengers, including 16 children and one infant, according to the general manager of Surabaya\u2019s Juanda airport, Trikora Raharjo. He said there were six foreigners: three South Koreans including an infant and one each from Singapore, Britain and Malaysia. The rest were Indonesians, he said.AirAsia, on the other hand, said in a statement there were seven crew and that there were no Britons on board.The plane lost contact when it was believed to be over the Java Sea between Kalimantan and Java islands, Mustofa said. He said the weather in the area was cloudy. The Singapore statement said search and rescue operations had been activated by the Indonesian authorities. It said the Singapore air force and the navy also were searching with two C-130 planes. Flightradar24, a flight tracking website, said the plane was delivered in September 2008, which would make it six years old. It said the plane was flying at 32,000ft (9,700 meters), the regular cruising altitude for most jetliners, when the signal from the plane was lost.The Malaysia-based AirAsia, which has dominated cheap travel in the region for years, has never lost a plane before. This is the third major air incident for south-east Asia this year. On 8 March, Malaysia Airlines flight 370, a wide-bodied Boeing 777, went missing soon after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing. It remains missing until this day with 239 people in one of the biggest aviation mysteries.

Lua is the founder of Archiwalks, a set of \u201cstorytelling\u201d walks through arty pockets of the city centre, such as Bugis, Kampong Glam and Bras Basah.\u201cFor a long time Singapore has been such a practical society, but the way I\u2019m seeing change right now is that there are more and more people doing impractical things. People are leaving finance and similar careers, and setting up printing studios, galleries and magazines \u2013 things not driven by a focus on money but by creativity and self-fulfilment.\u201dLua, a design obsessive, counts himself among them. He left a job as a pricing analyst at Singapore Airlines to become the general manager of Peatix Singapore, an independent ticketing platform, and also led art walks around Singapore\u2019s Tiong Bahru and Marina areas for OH!

More than 50 contemporary galleries, including the acclaimed Singapore Art Museum, are thriving, while the success of the Singapore Biennale and Art Stage Singapore have bolstered this vision. In March, the National Design Centre opened its doors in the former St Anthony\u2019s Convent, a 120-year-old white art-deco gem, with a clutch of studios featuring exhibitions ranging from Japanese design to designing \u201cfood experiences\u201d.

The building itself is unattractive but was historically important as a haven for bookworms and Chinese literature fans.\u201dThe area is within walking distance of many of Singapore\u2019s art schools and the complex has evolved to reflect their needs, Lua says. Part of his design education, he adds, was traipsing four floors up to Basheer Graphic Books, a favourite haunt of Singapore\u2019s designers, illustrators, animators and architects, with a dizzying range of hard-to-find art and design literature, magazines and journals. Also inside the maze is Art Commune studio and gallery, set up in 2009 by Ho Sou Ping, who left an aerospace engineering career to become an artist and curator.

It never arrived.It had lost contact with air traffic controllers in Jakarta not long after taking off from Surabaya in East Java, and vanished somewhere between Pontianak in West Kalimantan and Tanjung Pandan in Belitung Island. 162 people were on board; 155 passengers and seven crew members. As night falls over Singapore, the QZ8501 listing has finally been removed from arrival boards in Singapore\u2019s bustling Changi airport. Earlier it had read \u201cgo to info counter\u201d, in sharp contrast to all the other flights that were upgraded from \u201cconfirmed\u201d to \u201clanded\u201d.Airport staff quickly established a private \u201crelatives holding area\u201d (RHA) for family and friends of the missing passengers. The entrance is cordoned off, and guarded by security officers to protect the anxious relatives from prying eyes. Just beyond the cordon the press corps wait, eager for news and updates. Without any press conferences or media briefings, reporters are desperate for any tidbit that they can find. Any next-of-kin found outside the private area is swiftly surrounded by a media scrum, microphones and cameras shoved in their faces. This was how Louise Sidharta found herself surrounded by journalists, eager to hear her story. The 25-year-old Indonesian\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was on the flight, along with his parents and other relatives: a fact that she had found out over the radio this morning. \u201cThey say we just need to wait until we have more updates,\u201d she told the press shortly before being ushered into the holding area. According to a press statement by the Changi Airport Group (CAG), 47 family and friends of 57 passengers are waiting for news behind the cordon and screens.Beyond the impatient journalists lined up against the walls texting their editors and updating live blogs, the rest of Changi Airport carries on business as usual. Families take photos before the elaborate Christmas decorations, and travellers continue to queue at the check-in counters, including AirAsia\u2019s.Travellers speak of sadness and sympathy for the tragedy, but none I spoke to said they would reconsider travelling with AirAsia. Just before 9pm a CAG spokesman informed the press that all next-of-kin had been moved from the holding area, leaving from another exit away from the press. 16 people took up the offer to fly to Surabaya to join the many other waiting relatives there, he said. The rest chose either to return home or stay in a hotel.With the search and rescue operations \u2013 and by extension, the media briefings \u2013 spearheaded by Indonesia, information is sparse in Changi airport. We know that Singapore has offered help to Indonesia: one C130 aircraft has since been launched, with two more planes to set off tomorrow morning.An officer from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will also send an officer to assist in the coordination of search and locate efforts, said a statement from CAAS.Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Transport\u2019s Air Accident Investigation Bureau also offered two teams of specialists and two sets of underwater locator beacon detectors to assist in the search, said CAAS.Among the missing passengers is also one British national, travelling with his two-year-old Singaporean daughter.

That\u2019s why a pilot will routinely ask to divert around them. The plane could not still be airborne - it was a short-haul flight, there would be no fuel for staying in the air for quite as long as this.\u201d Learmount, who is a pilot, also ruled out the likelihood of passengers surviving a sea landing. \u201cThe pilots were talking to air traffic control right until the last minute. Something distracted their attention so they were no longer able to keep talking. We don\u2019t know what happened at the moment, and it doesn\u2019t appear to be a deliberate act.

They typically get issued by football chairmen just before they stab their manager in the back, but things get done slightly differently in north London \u2013 and maybe at the struggling international bank too.Sands, along with chairman Sir John Peace, got the official vote of confidence in July, and then again at the end of October. Peace was out trying to rally the troops last Wednesday, insisting to 300 of the bank\u2019s senior managers in Singapore that the business was not \u201cbroken\u201d, while the company also issued the itinerary of an investor trip to Hong Kong this week, in what looks like the latest attempt to help the embattled Sands stay in his job.Still, it\u2019s funny how Peace\u2019s views seem to have altered on this topic. Some 14 years ago, just after he\u2019d ousted Lord Wolfson as boss of Great Universal Stores, Peace rationalised that change thus: \u201cI think if anything happened in that period it was that we issued a profits warning. That tells you that you have to instigate changes instantly. You need to take action.\u201dIn the past year, Standard Chartered has issued three profit warnings.Nottingham had the highest proportion of households where there were no adults in work in the UK last year, figures showed last week. Still, one city-focused household with plenty of jobs belongs to John Peace, Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire, plus the chairman of Standard Chartered (see above) and Burberry. Apart from swanning around Asia, Peace\u2019s eye will also be on the luxury goods group this week, where interim results will be fronted by chief executive Christopher Bailey, now six months (and one pay revolt) into the job.Despite Bailey\u2019s well-known talents, the company has been telling City analysts not to expect too much, with profits predicted to be down following a \u201cpunishing\u201d period with foreign exchange. There are also concerns about China (a recurrent Peace theme) and Burberry has already admitted to some \u201csoftening in growth from Chinese consumers\u201d.Still, the good news is that everybody seems to love celebrity offspring Romeo Beckham, who\u2019s appearing in Burberry\u2019s new Christmas ad. It lasts a full four minutes, and this time shareholders have definitely got their money\u2019s worth. It seems longer.\u201cLonmin is pleased to announce that it has achieved a full calendar year without a fatality. This important safety milestone was reached on Monday 27 October 2014 ... The last fatal accident was on 26 October 2013 when Mr Siyabonga Sibango succumbed to his injuries after an underground vehicle accident.\u201dObviously, the announcement that nobody has been killed at its operations for a year represents decent news for the group\u2019s employees and their families. However one wonders, before its results this week, if Lonmin might now moderate the crowing.Eight days after unveiling that positive news, it emerged that a South African judicial commission of inquiry will hear arguments from Nelson Mandela\u2019s former lawyer about how Lonmin execs should be investigated as accomplices to murder for their role in a 2012 police massacre of 34 striking mine workers. Oddly, the group seems less keen on press releases about that.\u201cLonmin has consistently said that it would not publicly comment on evidence as it is given [to the commission],\u201d it blocks. \u201cThis stance, whilst the right thing to do, has occasionally meant the company has been unable to deal with false or misleading allegations as they have emerged.\u201d\u200b Who\u2019d have thought it?", "tags": ["Standard Chartered", "Lonmin", "Burberry", "Business", "Banking"], "title": "Standard Chartered\u2019s far eastern charm offensive may not save Sands"},{"date": "2014-12-07T13:47:05Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "With 5.6 million people living in an area of 270 sq miles (700 sq km), the authorities in Singapore have invested heavily in public transport in an effort to reduce the numbers on the roads. But, like other metropolitan hubs, they faced the inevitable problem of heavy congestion at peak time between 8am and 8.45am.Part of the solution has come in the form of an incentive for passengers: if they registered their smart travel cards and commuted in the hour after these peak times, they would earn points which can be used in a raffle to win cash.The scheme was the result of work by California-based Urban Engines, which uses data from travel cards, like the Oyster card in London, along with GPS data from trains and buses to draw up a detailed model of how the residents of a city move through their transport system. The results in turn show where problems lay. Drawing up this living profile in Singapore and the subsequent incentives resulted in a drop of peak hour travel of between 7% and 13%, according to the company.\u201cAll these things are piecemeal and siloed at this point but it is really a jigsaw puzzle. If you actually put together the information that is coming from smart cards and from GPSs, then you can start figuring out what are the true traffic patterns in a city,\u201d said Shiva Shivakumar, a co-founder and chief executive of the company. \u201cEvery single bus, every single train, every single road segment, every single time. You can start seeing the patterns emerge from that. What happens when there is a big event going on? What happens if it rains? What happens when there is fog?\u201d added Shivakumar, who spent 10 years at Google working on Gmail and Google Maps among other projects.Another of the company\u2019s founders, Balaji Prabhakar, specialises in keeping internet sites running when they are getting heavy traffic. When he was stuck in heavy car traffic in Bangalore in 2007, he pondered whether the two problems could be solved in a similar way. Separately, Shivakumar was questioning whether his work in Google in making the email system faster could also be put to use in urban traffic situations. The pair came together in Stanford, California, to work on the problem and apply large amounts of data to make cities move more fluidly.\u201cHow do we use some of the ideas that we had on the web \u2026 in terms of the real world and make the mobility experience a lot faster and better?\u201d said Shivakumar. \u201cThere is a fundamental growing problem around the world.\u201dTransport authorities give Urban Engines the commuter fare card information and GPS details of train and bus systems. Fare card information from when commuters tap in and out allows the company to gauge the commuting pattern \u2013 how long people are waiting, the number of trains which passed which were too full to get on \u2013 and concludes how a system is working at any one time.\u201cWe take all that information with our data sets which have information about the entire city \u2013 all the roads, all the buses, all the trains. We take all that with the online city information which is open. There is a lot of open data \u2013 for example for roads, where are the bus stops? Where are the train stations, how long does it take to get from one train station to the next bus stop? We have processed that already, very similar to Google maps or Apple maps. We take all of that information and build up an analytical platform for all of that information,\u201d said Shivakumar.In practice, the information which is fed back to the transport authority is shown on a screen with a copy of the grid of the railway or bus system. It shows each individual train or bus snaking around their route with meters above them showing how full each one is. Figures illustrate how many commuters are in each station and the waiting times.By analysing this information, it can be decided where more trains and buses are needed or, if that is not possible, how commuters can be incentivised to travel outside of peak times in order to lessen the loads, as in Singapore, or else encourage commuters to move to an underused station as opposed to one which is over capacity.The pilot study for the system was conducted in Bangalore where incentives such as lottery tickets were used to switch an estimated 17% of commuters from their regular pattern. Another study took place in Stanford. The system is now being used in Sao Paulo in Brazil to help manage the 17,000-strong bus fleet while it is in its early stages in Washington DC.\u201cThey [transport authorities] have had average data until now which has been working well for them for a while but now the commuter patterns are changing quite a bit more,\u201d said Shivakumar.\u201cIn the US they have a 45mph speed limit on certain roads. That is an optimal speed that you want to go, and the reason that came about is because there was a research study a few years back where they looked at what is happening on average.\u201cAnd so a lot of the decisions have been made from average data as opposed to, in some cases, you want to go at a much higher speed or a much lower speed depending on the weather conditions. That is what is now possible because of the data. You can make much more nuanced decisions about how to optimise your networks.\u201dAttempting to tackle congestion, which is estimated to cost economies multiple billions every year, has attracted the attention of some heavyweight investors to Urban Engines. So far, Google chairman, Eric Schmidt, and Google Ventures are among those who have put money into the early-stage company, although how much or a valuation for the firm has not yet been released.If transport managers want to understand and locate congestion hotspots, conventional methods have been to send human surveyors to watch and analyse their results, or else use video cameras to assess the information across a range of different stations, according to Shivakumar. Another method is to use weighing scales for trains and work out the number on board by dividing by the average weight. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have weighing scales for platforms for example if you want to know how many people are waiting at each station,\u201d he said.", "tags": ["GPS", "Technology", "Road transport", "World news", "Business", "Cities", "Rail transport", "Singapore", "Brazil"], "title": "How GPS and smart card data is used to reduce city transport congestion"},{"date": "2014-10-28T13:59:04Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Prevented from playing at home since 2009 due to security concerns and shorn of star spinner Saeed Ajmal, who was suspended for an illegal bowling action last month, Pakistan\u2019s cricketers nevertheless continue to defy the odds.

Well, they may as well make the best of it, as they had no say in the matter. Politics has not been kind enough to the few who inherited dictatorships and turned them into democracies (most obviously, Gorbachev and Juan Carlos), and far too kind to the larger number, mostly dating from the de-colonisations of the 60s, who inherited democracies and turned them into dictatorships. Lee Kwan Yew \u2013 known for his liking for hangings and floggings \u2013 is egregious among these, if only for being so long lasting. Under his successor (who \u2013 by pure coincidence, obviously \u2013 happens to be his son), there is no sign of liberalisation, and we can only hope for the longer-term future.There is room for genuine argument about the development of Asia. But spare us eulogies for this unpleasant character.Roger SchafirLondon\u2022 I was fascinated to read your long obituary of Lee Kuan Yew. You concentrated on his formidable intelligence, his tight control of politics and his belief in the role of the state \u2013 all of which have resulted in the clean, prosperous city you can visit today. His commitment to the \u201cgreening\u201d of the city has led to avenues of trees, lots of green islands for solar power, all estates surrounded by parks, tower blocks with green walls and plans for the conservation of water. I learned about these things on a trip to the botanical gardens on a couple of visits there. It seems there is much to be used as an example to other urban conurbations, even though the cleanliness and absence of litter and the orderly layout of municipal flower beds might be accompanied by fines and repression of individual freedom. It was a long-sighted plan by LKW in 1968.Christine ColeNorthampton\u2022 I think Philip Bowring almost completely misses the point in his obituary of Lee Kuan Yew. Never mind the civil-liberty issues \u2013 for the vast majority of Singaporeans, Lee made their country a beacon of prosperity, civil order, safety, world-leading, easily affordable healthcare and free education, good housing for all and full employment. Which leader of this country, past or present, can match that record? And Lee may have created a new royal family, but at least they work \u2013 unlike another family I can think of.Tony HartFormby, Merseyside\u2022 The letter above from Roger Schafir was amended on 31 March 2015.

Love him or hate him, none of us had a choice; the force of his personality made itself felt in almost every aspect of Singaporean life.I remember a day in high school, in our social studies class, when the teacher asked us who the senior minister was. \u201cLee Kuan Yew,\u201d we replied with confidence. \u201cWell, who\u2019s the health minister?\u201dSilence. Not many of us kept up with national or current affairs in those days \u2013 we were 15, convinced that politics had little to do with us.\u201cLee Kuan Yew?\u201d one girl said. It wasn\u2019t totally clear if she was joking.\u201cThe education minister, then,\u201d the teacher asked despairingly.\u201cLee Kuan Yew!\u201d Related: Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, 'a true giant of history', dies aged 91 We were just cheeky girls messing with a longsuffering teacher, but the truth was we didn\u2019t really know who the ministers or members of parliament were. Lee Kuan Yew was the only name we knew with certainty; the only politician, it seemed, who mattered.While current ministers seem more approachable \u2013 almost sweet, with their Facebook posts and Instagram selfies \u2013 Lee Kuan Yew loomed over Singaporean politics; stern, fierce and ruthless. \u201cBetween being loved and being feared, I have always believed Machiavelli was right. If nobody is afraid of me, I\u2019m meaningless,\u201d he said in 1997.It feels odd now that he\u2019s gone. For better or worse, his actions have shaped Singapore like no one else\u2019s. It will take a long time to truly be able to disentangle the man from the country, and to see the impact one had on the other.As expected, the outpouring of grief has been intense. Many people are, truly and sincerely, upset. The plaudits have also been pouring in. With every effusive tribute to the man, the lionisation of Lee Kuan Yew grows. In death, his reputation, choices and contributions are amplified even more than they already were, making it harder to see the man behind the icon.I spent my childhood years learning about how much he had done for the country. \u201cFounding father of Singapore\u201d was a phrase drilled into my head, as if our nation would have been cut adrift, lost and helpless, without him. \u201cHe did what needed to be done for us to succeed,\u201d I was told. Gratefulness was an emotion we felt obliged to show \u2013 many, rightly or wrongly, still feel it today.It wasn\u2019t until I was in my 20s that I began to learn what those vague things that \u201cneeded to be done\u201d were \u2013 arrests and detentions without trials. Defamation suits, expensive court cases and bankruptcy (for his opponents). Opposition politicians such as Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam and Chee Soon Juan, brought low for daring to disagree. My teenage years were spent getting to know our champion; I am now learning more and more about the man with the hatchet.It\u2019s hard to say where Singapore would be if it hadn\u2019t been for Lee Kuan Yew. I\u2019m not convinced that we would definitely have been worse off. I\u2019m not even persuaded that the arrests and detentions were wise, much less vital to our survival. Knowing what I know now, I feel uncomfortable calling him the \u201cfounding father of Singapore\u201d. I believe Singaporeans would have been capable of finding ourselves even without him.The idea of Lee Kuan Yew is intertwined with so many of my thoughts about my country that I often find myself getting mixed up between the two.The whole \u201cfather of Singapore\u201d image has often been taken far too literally, but Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s governing style was nothing if not paternalistic. And through that paternalism Singaporeans were tamed \u2013 the early vibrancy of activism in the 1950s through to the 1980s curbed and domesticated till Singaporeans saw politics as a danger best left to the clever elite. We are only now, 50 years after independence, beginning to emerge from the political passivity a \u201cfather knows best\u201d government urged us into.Was that what Singapore needed at the time? Would we have been worse off if Lee Kuan Yew had not done what he did? There is no way to know for sure.I never knew Lee Kuan Yew intimately enough to be able to say that he was a good man, but I think I can say that he was a great politician \u2013 the likes of which Singapore is unlikely to see for a long time. One cannot dismiss his contribution to Singapore: there were many, and we have seen progress that has been the envy of our neighbours in the region.What\u2019s left for us now is to find the answer to this question: where should we go now?", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Lee Kuan Yew is gone.

Lee Kuan Yew was the only name we knew with certainty; the only politician, it seemed, who mattered.While current ministers seem more approachable \u2013 almost sweet, with their Facebook posts and Instagram selfies \u2013 Lee Kuan Yew loomed over Singaporean politics; stern, fierce and ruthless. \u201cBetween being loved and being feared, I have always believed Machiavelli was right. If nobody is afraid of me, I\u2019m meaningless,\u201d he said in 1997.It feels odd now that he\u2019s gone. For better or worse, his actions have shaped Singapore like no one else\u2019s. It will take a long time to truly be able to disentangle the man from the country, and to see the impact one had on the other.As expected, the outpouring of grief has been intense. Many people are, truly and sincerely, upset. The plaudits have also been pouring in. With every effusive tribute to the man, the lionisation of Lee Kuan Yew grows. In death, his reputation, choices and contributions are amplified even more than they already were, making it harder to see the man behind the icon.I spent my childhood years learning about how much he had done for the country. \u201cFounding father of Singapore\u201d was a phrase drilled into my head, as if our nation would have been cut adrift, lost and helpless, without him. \u201cHe did what needed to be done for us to succeed,\u201d I was told. Gratefulness was an emotion we felt obliged to show \u2013 many, rightly or wrongly, still feel it today.It wasn\u2019t until I was in my 20s that I began to learn what those vague things that \u201cneeded to be done\u201d were \u2013 arrests and detentions without trials. Defamation suits, expensive court cases and bankruptcy (for his opponents). Opposition politicians such as Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam and Chee Soon Juan, brought low for daring to disagree. My teenage years were spent getting to know our champion; I am now learning more and more about the man with the hatchet.It\u2019s hard to say where Singapore would be if it hadn\u2019t been for Lee Kuan Yew. I\u2019m not convinced that we would definitely have been worse off. I\u2019m not even persuaded that the arrests and detentions were wise, much less vital to our survival. Knowing what I know now, I feel uncomfortable calling him the \u201cfounding father of Singapore\u201d. I believe Singaporeans would have been capable of finding ourselves even without him.The idea of Lee Kuan Yew is intertwined with so many of my thoughts about my country that I often find myself getting mixed up between the two.The whole \u201cfather of Singapore\u201d image has often been taken far too literally, but Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s governing style was nothing if not paternalistic. And through that paternalism Singaporeans were tamed \u2013 the early vibrancy of activism in the 1950s through to the 1980s curbed and domesticated till Singaporeans saw politics as a danger best left to the clever elite. We are only now, 50 years after independence, beginning to emerge from the political passivity a \u201cfather knows best\u201d government urged us into.Was that what Singapore needed at the time? Would we have been worse off if Lee Kuan Yew had not done what he did? There is no way to know for sure.I never knew Lee Kuan Yew intimately enough to be able to say that he was a good man, but I think I can say that he was a great politician \u2013 the likes of which Singapore is unlikely to see for a long time. One cannot dismiss his contribution to Singapore: there were many, and we have seen progress that has been the envy of our neighbours in the region.What\u2019s left for us now is to find the answer to this question: where should we go now?", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Lee Kuan Yew is gone.

He was placed on mechanical ventilation in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit.Lee served as Singapore\u2019s first prime minister from 1959, when Singapore won self-rule, until 1990 when he stepped down.He led Singapore\u2019s six-year transition from British colonial outpost, through self-administration, merger with and then separation from Malaysia, to independent statehood, and Singapore declaration as a republic, in 1965.Lee was a founding member of the governing People\u2019s Action party and is credited with transforming Singapore from a sleepy Asian entrepot into a bustling and wealthy financial hub.He encouraged economic growth with easy regulation and low taxes for business, and by employing a large government apparatus to look after citizens.But progress came at the expense of civil liberties. Critics and human rights groups condemned his iron-fisted rule of his country which saw his political opponents jailed, exiled, or driven to financial ruin through costly libel suits.Only 12 opposition politicians have ever been elected to parliament in Singapore.From 1965 to 1981, the ruling party won every seat in every election. Parliament was formed with no elected opposition MPs for almost two decades.Media freedoms were also stifled, and political dissent was not tolerated.Lee retained cabinet-level advisory posts - such as \u2018minister mentor\u2019 after handing over the premiership to Goh Chok Tong in 1990.He resigned from the cabinet in May 2011 after his party won its 14th consecutive general election.The People\u2019s Action party\u2019s 2011 election win was by its slimmest ever margin, though the party still commands a dominant parliamentary majority.Lee was re-elected to his seat unopposed.Earlier on Thursday, a website closely resembling the prime minister\u2019s website announced that Lee had died.

But with water demand among Singapore\u2019s 5 million residents set to double by 2060, the island-state\u2019s challenge remains far from over.So what\u2019s being done to meet that challenge?

Singapore\u2019s answer to Evian or Volvic heralds from insalubrious origins: the city-state\u2019s drains and sewers. It is \u201cultra-safe\u201d, insists PUB, Singapore\u2019s national water agency, which says the reclaimed water surpasses World Health Organisation standards. The reclaimed water is treated conventionally first, then subjected to three additional purification processes: microfiltration, which provides a basic filter to weed out disease-causing bacteria and other nasties; \u201creverse osmosis\u201d (common in desalination), which uses a semi-permeable membrane to eradicate further viruses, metals and the like; exposure to ultraviolet light, making doubly sure any remaining organisms are \u201cinactivated\u201d. Introduced in 2003, NEWater isn\u2019t used primarily as drinking water, although it is potable, but more in industrial and cooling applications. During dry months, it is also used to top up public reservoirs. Currently, the city-state boasts four NEWater plants, which have a combined capacity to meet nearly 30% of overall water demand. PUB believes that figure can be nearly doubled to 55% over coming decades.Farming is a water- and land-intensive activity, and Singapore, with only 710 square kilometres to play with, is short of both. Currently a dismal 7% of vegetables are locally grown.Enter Sky Greens Farm, the world\u2019s first commercial vertical farm and the brainchild of local entrepreneur Jack Ng. Designed for the urban jungle, this greenhouse skyscraper minimises the inputs of both land and water by suspending plants in vertical racks rather than growing them in soil on the flat. The growing happens in modular, A-shaped towers (120 to date, and counting) that measure 9 metres tall and contain up to 32 tiers of growing troughs each. The latter rotate slowly to ensure the vegetables in this tropical urban farm get the requisite distribution of sunlight, airflow and irrigation.A gravity-aided water-pulley system powers the rotation system using just one litre of water, which is collected in a rainwater-fed overhead reservoir. The \u201cfarmscraper\u201d system also uses a low-volume flooding method for irrigation, with the water then recycled and reused. The organic waste from the farm is also recycled as compost, avoiding the potential pollution of local watercourses.  Related: Making rain: can technology drought-proof the Caribbean? Water loss, or \u201cnon-revenue water\u201d, is a problem across the world. It\u2019s not uncommon for countries to see a third of their treated water supply disappear in leaks and burst pipes. With a loss rate of one-fifth (20.7%), the UK performs relatively well. But it\u2019s not a patch on Singapore, where non-revenue rates run at a mere 4.6%, one of the lowest levels in the world.Helping the water-scarce city-state reduce losses even further is a new smart monitoring system, which uses multi-functional water sensors known as data sondes, developed by US-based water tech firm Xylem. The sensors feed data about pressure irregularities and other key factors into analytics software provided by local water monitoring firm Visenti, and this information is then sent to a central command centre by text message and apps.Xylem and Visenti are currently co-developing a cloud-based service that will enable alerts to be sent via the internet to any device, even in remote areas. PUB uses the updates to adjust water flow and pressure in the water network, which cuts water losses due to leaks and clogged pipes.Singapore may be making strides on supply side, but its long-term water security will require water users to reduce their daily consumption too, which currently stands at 151 litres per resident. To this end, the national water utility is busy pushing water efficiency messages to the public. Among its more inventive ideas is the invitation to adopt a reservoir, canal or even a drain under the Friends of Water scheme, or to take the kids to PUB\u2019s state-of-the-art water museum.

Well, they may as well make the best of it, as they had no say in the matter. Politics has not been kind enough to the few who inherited dictatorships and turned them into democracies (most obviously, Gorbachev and Juan Carlos), and far too kind to the larger number, mostly dating from the de-colonisations of the 60s, who inherited democracies and turned them into dictatorships. Lee Kwan Yew \u2013 known for his liking for hangings and floggings \u2013 is egregious among these, if only for being so long lasting. Under his successor (who \u2013 by pure coincidence, obviously \u2013 happens to be his son), there is no sign of liberalisation, and we can only hope for the longer-term future.There is room for genuine argument about the development of Asia. But spare us eulogies for this unpleasant character.Roger SchafirLondon\u2022 I was fascinated to read your long obituary of Lee Kuan Yew. You concentrated on his formidable intelligence, his tight control of politics and his belief in the role of the state \u2013 all of which have resulted in the clean, prosperous city you can visit today. His commitment to the \u201cgreening\u201d of the city has led to avenues of trees, lots of green islands for solar power, all estates surrounded by parks, tower blocks with green walls and plans for the conservation of water. I learned about these things on a trip to the botanical gardens on a couple of visits there. It seems there is much to be used as an example to other urban conurbations, even though the cleanliness and absence of litter and the orderly layout of municipal flower beds might be accompanied by fines and repression of individual freedom. It was a long-sighted plan by LKW in 1968.Christine ColeNorthampton\u2022 I think Philip Bowring almost completely misses the point in his obituary of Lee Kuan Yew. Never mind the civil-liberty issues \u2013 for the vast majority of Singaporeans, Lee made their country a beacon of prosperity, civil order, safety, world-leading, easily affordable healthcare and free education, good housing for all and full employment. Which leader of this country, past or present, can match that record? And Lee may have created a new royal family, but at least they work \u2013 unlike another family I can think of.Tony HartFormby, Merseyside\u2022 The letter above from Roger Schafir was amended on 31 March 2015.

During dry months, it is also used to top up public reservoirs. Currently, the city-state boasts four NEWater plants, which have a combined capacity to meet nearly 30% of overall water demand. PUB believes that figure can be nearly doubled to 55% over coming decades.Farming is a water- and land-intensive activity, and Singapore, with only 710 square kilometres to play with, is short of both. Currently a dismal 7% of vegetables are locally grown.Enter Sky Greens Farm, the world\u2019s first commercial vertical farm and the brainchild of local entrepreneur Jack Ng. Designed for the urban jungle, this greenhouse skyscraper minimises the inputs of both land and water by suspending plants in vertical racks rather than growing them in soil on the flat. The growing happens in modular, A-shaped towers (120 to date, and counting) that measure 9 metres tall and contain up to 32 tiers of growing troughs each. The latter rotate slowly to ensure the vegetables in this tropical urban farm get the requisite distribution of sunlight, airflow and irrigation.A gravity-aided water-pulley system powers the rotation system using just one litre of water, which is collected in a rainwater-fed overhead reservoir. The \u201cfarmscraper\u201d system also uses a low-volume flooding method for irrigation, with the water then recycled and reused. The organic waste from the farm is also recycled as compost, avoiding the potential pollution of local watercourses.  Related: Making rain: can technology drought-proof the Caribbean? Water loss, or \u201cnon-revenue water\u201d, is a problem across the world. It\u2019s not uncommon for countries to see a third of their treated water supply disappear in leaks and burst pipes. With a loss rate of one-fifth (20.7%), the UK performs relatively well. But it\u2019s not a patch on Singapore, where non-revenue rates run at a mere 4.6%, one of the lowest levels in the world.Helping the water-scarce city-state reduce losses even further is a new smart monitoring system, which uses multi-functional water sensors known as data sondes, developed by US-based water tech firm Xylem. The sensors feed data about pressure irregularities and other key factors into analytics software provided by local water monitoring firm Visenti, and this information is then sent to a central command centre by text message and apps.Xylem and Visenti are currently co-developing a cloud-based service that will enable alerts to be sent via the internet to any device, even in remote areas. PUB uses the updates to adjust water flow and pressure in the water network, which cuts water losses due to leaks and clogged pipes.Singapore may be making strides on supply side, but its long-term water security will require water users to reduce their daily consumption too, which currently stands at 151 litres per resident. To this end, the national water utility is busy pushing water efficiency messages to the public. Among its more inventive ideas is the invitation to adopt a reservoir, canal or even a drain under the Friends of Water scheme, or to take the kids to PUB\u2019s state-of-the-art water museum.

You concentrated on his formidable intelligence, his tight control of politics and his belief in the role of the state \u2013 all of which have resulted in the clean, prosperous city you can visit today. His commitment to the \u201cgreening\u201d of the city has led to avenues of trees, lots of green islands for solar power, all estates surrounded by parks, tower blocks with green walls and plans for the conservation of water. I learned about these things on a trip to the botanical gardens on a couple of visits there. It seems there is much to be used as an example to other urban conurbations, even though the cleanliness and absence of litter and the orderly layout of municipal flower beds might be accompanied by fines and repression of individual freedom. It was a long-sighted plan by LKW in 1968.Christine ColeNorthampton\u2022 I think Philip Bowring almost completely misses the point in his obituary of Lee Kuan Yew. Never mind the civil-liberty issues \u2013 for the vast majority of Singaporeans, Lee made their country a beacon of prosperity, civil order, safety, world-leading, easily affordable healthcare and free education, good housing for all and full employment. Which leader of this country, past or present, can match that record? And Lee may have created a new royal family, but at least they work \u2013 unlike another family I can think of.Tony HartFormby, Merseyside\u2022 The letter above from Roger Schafir was amended on 31 March 2015.

Love him or hate him, none of us had a choice; the force of his personality made itself felt in almost every aspect of Singaporean life.I remember a day in high school, in our social studies class, when the teacher asked us who the senior minister was. \u201cLee Kuan Yew,\u201d we replied with confidence. \u201cWell, who\u2019s the health minister?\u201dSilence. Not many of us kept up with national or current affairs in those days \u2013 we were 15, convinced that politics had little to do with us.\u201cLee Kuan Yew?\u201d one girl said. It wasn\u2019t totally clear if she was joking.\u201cThe education minister, then,\u201d the teacher asked despairingly.\u201cLee Kuan Yew!\u201d Related: Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, 'a true giant of history', dies aged 91 We were just cheeky girls messing with a longsuffering teacher, but the truth was we didn\u2019t really know who the ministers or members of parliament were. Lee Kuan Yew was the only name we knew with certainty; the only politician, it seemed, who mattered.While current ministers seem more approachable \u2013 almost sweet, with their Facebook posts and Instagram selfies \u2013 Lee Kuan Yew loomed over Singaporean politics; stern, fierce and ruthless. \u201cBetween being loved and being feared, I have always believed Machiavelli was right. If nobody is afraid of me, I\u2019m meaningless,\u201d he said in 1997.It feels odd now that he\u2019s gone. For better or worse, his actions have shaped Singapore like no one else\u2019s. It will take a long time to truly be able to disentangle the man from the country, and to see the impact one had on the other.As expected, the outpouring of grief has been intense. Many people are, truly and sincerely, upset. The plaudits have also been pouring in. With every effusive tribute to the man, the lionisation of Lee Kuan Yew grows. In death, his reputation, choices and contributions are amplified even more than they already were, making it harder to see the man behind the icon.I spent my childhood years learning about how much he had done for the country. \u201cFounding father of Singapore\u201d was a phrase drilled into my head, as if our nation would have been cut adrift, lost and helpless, without him. \u201cHe did what needed to be done for us to succeed,\u201d I was told. Gratefulness was an emotion we felt obliged to show \u2013 many, rightly or wrongly, still feel it today.It wasn\u2019t until I was in my 20s that I began to learn what those vague things that \u201cneeded to be done\u201d were \u2013 arrests and detentions without trials. Defamation suits, expensive court cases and bankruptcy (for his opponents). Opposition politicians such as Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam and Chee Soon Juan, brought low for daring to disagree. My teenage years were spent getting to know our champion; I am now learning more and more about the man with the hatchet.It\u2019s hard to say where Singapore would be if it hadn\u2019t been for Lee Kuan Yew. I\u2019m not convinced that we would definitely have been worse off. I\u2019m not even persuaded that the arrests and detentions were wise, much less vital to our survival. Knowing what I know now, I feel uncomfortable calling him the \u201cfounding father of Singapore\u201d. I believe Singaporeans would have been capable of finding ourselves even without him.The idea of Lee Kuan Yew is intertwined with so many of my thoughts about my country that I often find myself getting mixed up between the two.The whole \u201cfather of Singapore\u201d image has often been taken far too literally, but Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s governing style was nothing if not paternalistic. And through that paternalism Singaporeans were tamed \u2013 the early vibrancy of activism in the 1950s through to the 1980s curbed and domesticated till Singaporeans saw politics as a danger best left to the clever elite. We are only now, 50 years after independence, beginning to emerge from the political passivity a \u201cfather knows best\u201d government urged us into.Was that what Singapore needed at the time? Would we have been worse off if Lee Kuan Yew had not done what he did? There is no way to know for sure.I never knew Lee Kuan Yew intimately enough to be able to say that he was a good man, but I think I can say that he was a great politician \u2013 the likes of which Singapore is unlikely to see for a long time. One cannot dismiss his contribution to Singapore: there were many, and we have seen progress that has been the envy of our neighbours in the region.What\u2019s left for us now is to find the answer to this question: where should we go now?", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Lee Kuan Yew is gone.

You concentrated on his formidable intelligence, his tight control of politics and his belief in the role of the state \u2013 all of which have resulted in the clean, prosperous city you can visit today. His commitment to the \u201cgreening\u201d of the city has led to avenues of trees, lots of green islands for solar power, all estates surrounded by parks, tower blocks with green walls and plans for the conservation of water. I learned about these things on a trip to the botanical gardens on a couple of visits there. It seems there is much to be used as an example to other urban conurbations, even though the cleanliness and absence of litter and the orderly layout of municipal flower beds might be accompanied by fines and repression of individual freedom. It was a long-sighted plan by LKW in 1968.Christine ColeNorthampton\u2022 I think Philip Bowring almost completely misses the point in his obituary of Lee Kuan Yew. Never mind the civil-liberty issues \u2013 for the vast majority of Singaporeans, Lee made their country a beacon of prosperity, civil order, safety, world-leading, easily affordable healthcare and free education, good housing for all and full employment. Which leader of this country, past or present, can match that record? And Lee may have created a new royal family, but at least they work \u2013 unlike another family I can think of.Tony HartFormby, Merseyside\u2022 The letter above from Roger Schafir was amended on 31 March 2015.

Love him or hate him, none of us had a choice; the force of his personality made itself felt in almost every aspect of Singaporean life.I remember a day in high school, in our social studies class, when the teacher asked us who the senior minister was. \u201cLee Kuan Yew,\u201d we replied with confidence. \u201cWell, who\u2019s the health minister?\u201dSilence. Not many of us kept up with national or current affairs in those days \u2013 we were 15, convinced that politics had little to do with us.\u201cLee Kuan Yew?\u201d one girl said. It wasn\u2019t totally clear if she was joking.\u201cThe education minister, then,\u201d the teacher asked despairingly.\u201cLee Kuan Yew!\u201d Related: Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, 'a true giant of history', dies aged 91 We were just cheeky girls messing with a longsuffering teacher, but the truth was we didn\u2019t really know who the ministers or members of parliament were. Lee Kuan Yew was the only name we knew with certainty; the only politician, it seemed, who mattered.While current ministers seem more approachable \u2013 almost sweet, with their Facebook posts and Instagram selfies \u2013 Lee Kuan Yew loomed over Singaporean politics; stern, fierce and ruthless. \u201cBetween being loved and being feared, I have always believed Machiavelli was right. If nobody is afraid of me, I\u2019m meaningless,\u201d he said in 1997.It feels odd now that he\u2019s gone. For better or worse, his actions have shaped Singapore like no one else\u2019s. It will take a long time to truly be able to disentangle the man from the country, and to see the impact one had on the other.As expected, the outpouring of grief has been intense. Many people are, truly and sincerely, upset. The plaudits have also been pouring in. With every effusive tribute to the man, the lionisation of Lee Kuan Yew grows. In death, his reputation, choices and contributions are amplified even more than they already were, making it harder to see the man behind the icon.I spent my childhood years learning about how much he had done for the country. \u201cFounding father of Singapore\u201d was a phrase drilled into my head, as if our nation would have been cut adrift, lost and helpless, without him. \u201cHe did what needed to be done for us to succeed,\u201d I was told. Gratefulness was an emotion we felt obliged to show \u2013 many, rightly or wrongly, still feel it today.It wasn\u2019t until I was in my 20s that I began to learn what those vague things that \u201cneeded to be done\u201d were \u2013 arrests and detentions without trials. Defamation suits, expensive court cases and bankruptcy (for his opponents). Opposition politicians such as Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam and Chee Soon Juan, brought low for daring to disagree. My teenage years were spent getting to know our champion; I am now learning more and more about the man with the hatchet.It\u2019s hard to say where Singapore would be if it hadn\u2019t been for Lee Kuan Yew. I\u2019m not convinced that we would definitely have been worse off. I\u2019m not even persuaded that the arrests and detentions were wise, much less vital to our survival. Knowing what I know now, I feel uncomfortable calling him the \u201cfounding father of Singapore\u201d. I believe Singaporeans would have been capable of finding ourselves even without him.The idea of Lee Kuan Yew is intertwined with so many of my thoughts about my country that I often find myself getting mixed up between the two.The whole \u201cfather of Singapore\u201d image has often been taken far too literally, but Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s governing style was nothing if not paternalistic. And through that paternalism Singaporeans were tamed \u2013 the early vibrancy of activism in the 1950s through to the 1980s curbed and domesticated till Singaporeans saw politics as a danger best left to the clever elite. We are only now, 50 years after independence, beginning to emerge from the political passivity a \u201cfather knows best\u201d government urged us into.Was that what Singapore needed at the time? Would we have been worse off if Lee Kuan Yew had not done what he did? There is no way to know for sure.I never knew Lee Kuan Yew intimately enough to be able to say that he was a good man, but I think I can say that he was a great politician \u2013 the likes of which Singapore is unlikely to see for a long time. One cannot dismiss his contribution to Singapore: there were many, and we have seen progress that has been the envy of our neighbours in the region.What\u2019s left for us now is to find the answer to this question: where should we go now?", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Lee Kuan Yew is gone.

In the first half of the group\u2019s financial year, bumper profits at its department stores were offset by a fall at the Waitrose supermarket chain.

But with water demand among Singapore\u2019s 5 million residents set to double by 2060, the island-state\u2019s challenge remains far from over.So what\u2019s being done to meet that challenge? Related: The Pacific Islands: tomorrow's climate refugees struggle to access water today Most bottled water comes with a picture of a mountain spring or glacial aquifer on the label. Not NEWater. Singapore\u2019s answer to Evian or Volvic heralds from insalubrious origins: the city-state\u2019s drains and sewers. It is \u201cultra-safe\u201d, insists PUB, Singapore\u2019s national water agency, which says the reclaimed water surpasses World Health Organisation standards. The reclaimed water is treated conventionally first, then subjected to three additional purification processes: microfiltration, which provides a basic filter to weed out disease-causing bacteria and other nasties; \u201creverse osmosis\u201d (common in desalination), which uses a semi-permeable membrane to eradicate further viruses, metals and the like; exposure to ultraviolet light, making doubly sure any remaining organisms are \u201cinactivated\u201d. Introduced in 2003, NEWater isn\u2019t used primarily as drinking water, although it is potable, but more in industrial and cooling applications. During dry months, it is also used to top up public reservoirs. Currently, the city-state boasts four NEWater plants, which have a combined capacity to meet nearly 30% of overall water demand. PUB believes that figure can be nearly doubled to 55% over coming decades.Farming is a water- and land-intensive activity, and Singapore, with only 710 square kilometres to play with, is short of both. Currently a dismal 7% of vegetables are locally grown.Enter Sky Greens Farm, the world\u2019s first commercial vertical farm and the brainchild of local entrepreneur Jack Ng. Designed for the urban jungle, this greenhouse skyscraper minimises the inputs of both land and water by suspending plants in vertical racks rather than growing them in soil on the flat. The growing happens in modular, A-shaped towers (120 to date, and counting) that measure 9 metres tall and contain up to 32 tiers of growing troughs each. The latter rotate slowly to ensure the vegetables in this tropical urban farm get the requisite distribution of sunlight, airflow and irrigation.A gravity-aided water-pulley system powers the rotation system using just one litre of water, which is collected in a rainwater-fed overhead reservoir. The \u201cfarmscraper\u201d system also uses a low-volume flooding method for irrigation, with the water then recycled and reused. The organic waste from the farm is also recycled as compost, avoiding the potential pollution of local watercourses.  Related: Making rain: can technology drought-proof the Caribbean? Water loss, or \u201cnon-revenue water\u201d, is a problem across the world. It\u2019s not uncommon for countries to see a third of their treated water supply disappear in leaks and burst pipes. With a loss rate of one-fifth (20.7%), the UK performs relatively well. But it\u2019s not a patch on Singapore, where non-revenue rates run at a mere 4.6%, one of the lowest levels in the world.Helping the water-scarce city-state reduce losses even further is a new smart monitoring system, which uses multi-functional water sensors known as data sondes, developed by US-based water tech firm Xylem. The sensors feed data about pressure irregularities and other key factors into analytics software provided by local water monitoring firm Visenti, and this information is then sent to a central command centre by text message and apps.Xylem and Visenti are currently co-developing a cloud-based service that will enable alerts to be sent via the internet to any device, even in remote areas. PUB uses the updates to adjust water flow and pressure in the water network, which cuts water losses due to leaks and clogged pipes.Singapore may be making strides on supply side, but its long-term water security will require water users to reduce their daily consumption too, which currently stands at 151 litres per resident. To this end, the national water utility is busy pushing water efficiency messages to the public. Among its more inventive ideas is the invitation to adopt a reservoir, canal or even a drain under the Friends of Water scheme, or to take the kids to PUB\u2019s state-of-the-art water museum.

His commitment to the \u201cgreening\u201d of the city has led to avenues of trees, lots of green islands for solar power, all estates surrounded by parks, tower blocks with green walls and plans for the conservation of water. I learned about these things on a trip to the botanical gardens on a couple of visits there. It seems there is much to be used as an example to other urban conurbations, even though the cleanliness and absence of litter and the orderly layout of municipal flower beds might be accompanied by fines and repression of individual freedom. It was a long-sighted plan by LKW in 1968.Christine ColeNorthampton\u2022 I think Philip Bowring almost completely misses the point in his obituary of Lee Kuan Yew.

Love him or hate him, none of us had a choice; the force of his personality made itself felt in almost every aspect of Singaporean life.I remember a day in high school, in our social studies class, when the teacher asked us who the senior minister was. \u201cLee Kuan Yew,\u201d we replied with confidence. \u201cWell, who\u2019s the health minister?\u201dSilence. Not many of us kept up with national or current affairs in those days \u2013 we were 15, convinced that politics had little to do with us.\u201cLee Kuan Yew?\u201d one girl said. It wasn\u2019t totally clear if she was joking.\u201cThe education minister, then,\u201d the teacher asked despairingly.\u201cLee Kuan Yew!\u201d Related: Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, 'a true giant of history', dies aged 91 We were just cheeky girls messing with a longsuffering teacher, but the truth was we didn\u2019t really know who the ministers or members of parliament were. Lee Kuan Yew was the only name we knew with certainty; the only politician, it seemed, who mattered.While current ministers seem more approachable \u2013 almost sweet, with their Facebook posts and Instagram selfies \u2013 Lee Kuan Yew loomed over Singaporean politics; stern, fierce and ruthless. \u201cBetween being loved and being feared, I have always believed Machiavelli was right. If nobody is afraid of me, I\u2019m meaningless,\u201d he said in 1997.It feels odd now that he\u2019s gone. For better or worse, his actions have shaped Singapore like no one else\u2019s. It will take a long time to truly be able to disentangle the man from the country, and to see the impact one had on the other.As expected, the outpouring of grief has been intense. Many people are, truly and sincerely, upset. The plaudits have also been pouring in. With every effusive tribute to the man, the lionisation of Lee Kuan Yew grows. In death, his reputation, choices and contributions are amplified even more than they already were, making it harder to see the man behind the icon.I spent my childhood years learning about how much he had done for the country. \u201cFounding father of Singapore\u201d was a phrase drilled into my head, as if our nation would have been cut adrift, lost and helpless, without him. \u201cHe did what needed to be done for us to succeed,\u201d I was told. Gratefulness was an emotion we felt obliged to show \u2013 many, rightly or wrongly, still feel it today.It wasn\u2019t until I was in my 20s that I began to learn what those vague things that \u201cneeded to be done\u201d were \u2013 arrests and detentions without trials. Defamation suits, expensive court cases and bankruptcy (for his opponents). Opposition politicians such as Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam and Chee Soon Juan, brought low for daring to disagree. My teenage years were spent getting to know our champion; I am now learning more and more about the man with the hatchet.It\u2019s hard to say where Singapore would be if it hadn\u2019t been for Lee Kuan Yew. I\u2019m not convinced that we would definitely have been worse off. I\u2019m not even persuaded that the arrests and detentions were wise, much less vital to our survival. Knowing what I know now, I feel uncomfortable calling him the \u201cfounding father of Singapore\u201d. I believe Singaporeans would have been capable of finding ourselves even without him.The idea of Lee Kuan Yew is intertwined with so many of my thoughts about my country that I often find myself getting mixed up between the two.The whole \u201cfather of Singapore\u201d image has often been taken far too literally, but Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s governing style was nothing if not paternalistic. And through that paternalism Singaporeans were tamed \u2013 the early vibrancy of activism in the 1950s through to the 1980s curbed and domesticated till Singaporeans saw politics as a danger best left to the clever elite. We are only now, 50 years after independence, beginning to emerge from the political passivity a \u201cfather knows best\u201d government urged us into.Was that what Singapore needed at the time? Would we have been worse off if Lee Kuan Yew had not done what he did? There is no way to know for sure.I never knew Lee Kuan Yew intimately enough to be able to say that he was a good man, but I think I can say that he was a great politician \u2013 the likes of which Singapore is unlikely to see for a long time. One cannot dismiss his contribution to Singapore: there were many, and we have seen progress that has been the envy of our neighbours in the region.What\u2019s left for us now is to find the answer to this question: where should we go now?", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Lee Kuan Yew is gone.

He was placed on mechanical ventilation in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit.Lee served as Singapore\u2019s first prime minister from 1959, when Singapore won self-rule, until 1990 when he stepped down.He led Singapore\u2019s six-year transition from British colonial outpost, through self-administration, merger with and then separation from Malaysia, to independent statehood, and Singapore declaration as a republic, in 1965.Lee was a founding member of the governing People\u2019s Action party and is credited with transforming Singapore from a sleepy Asian entrepot into a bustling and wealthy financial hub.He encouraged economic growth with easy regulation and low taxes for business, and by employing a large government apparatus to look after citizens.But progress came at the expense of civil liberties. Critics and human rights groups condemned his iron-fisted rule of his country which saw his political opponents jailed, exiled, or driven to financial ruin through costly libel suits.Only 12 opposition politicians have ever been elected to parliament in Singapore.From 1965 to 1981, the ruling party won every seat in every election. Parliament was formed with no elected opposition MPs for almost two decades.Media freedoms were also stifled, and political dissent was not tolerated.Lee retained cabinet-level advisory posts - such as \u2018minister mentor\u2019 after handing over the premiership to Goh Chok Tong in 1990.He resigned from the cabinet in May 2011 after his party won its 14th consecutive general election.The People\u2019s Action party\u2019s 2011 election win was by its slimmest ever margin, though the party still commands a dominant parliamentary majority.Lee was re-elected to his seat unopposed.Earlier on Thursday, a website closely resembling the prime minister\u2019s website announced that Lee had died. This was reported as fact by some media outlets, but it was later retracted as wrong.Singapore police have announced an inquiry into the hoax.\u201cPolice confirm a report has been lodged and we are looking into the matter,\u201d Assistant Commissioner of Police Melvin Yong said in a statement.\u201cWe take a very stern view against anyone who doctors a government website to spread false information to deceive the public.

But I\u2019m not afraid.\u201dHe also likened Lee to Jesus Christ, saying that they \u201care both power-hungry and malicious but deceive others into thinking they are both compassionate and kind\u201d.Police confirmed on Monday to the Guardian that a 17-year-old male Singaporean had been arrested.Lawyer Chia Boon Teck, who lodged one of the police reports against Yee, said: \u201cThe individual had said many things against Mr Lee and the government that are defamatory under the penal code as well as in violation of the sedition act. His utterances against Christians also amounted to a \u2018deliberate intent to wound religious feelings\u2019 under the penal code\u201cThere is a limit to freedom of speech.

They will be run by Robinsons staff and mostly sell homewares under the John Lewis brand.Andy Street, chief executive of the British department store, said he expected to announce deals in up to five other countries this year. It follows a successful trial in South Korea with the Shinsegae department store, begun in 2012. John Lewis filled bedding, cushions and blinds made at the groups\u2019 Herbert Parkinson factory in Lancashire as well as other home accessories such as candles and picture frames are now sold in seven Shinsegae stores.Street said: \u201cWe have been very successful in Korea. We are really pleased and surprised that, in a market where the John Lewis brand isn\u2019t really known, it has cut through.\u201dThe retailer recently invited representatives of international department stores to a showcase at its Peter Jones outlet in Sloane Square, London, in the hope of attracting new partners. Street said he hoped to be shipping John Lewis products wholesale to 15 countries \u201cin the not too distant future\u201d.Street said the push overseas was not a response to a tough UK market but an attempt to \u201cseed\u201d the John Lewis brand abroad for the long term. \u201cAnybody taking their eye off the domestic ball at the moment would really regret it. We are not opening shops overseas and diverting management time. This is the icing on the cake,\u201d he said.\u201cOur fundamental strategy is developing bricks and clicks in the UK. We have just got to put a chip or two down on the table with a view on how the world is going to be in 10 years\u2019 time.\u201dThe department store\u2019s parent group, the John Lewis Partnership, is expected to announce fall in annual profits of about 8% on 12 March despite benefiting from fast-growing online sales. In the first half of the group\u2019s financial year, bumper profits at its department stores were offset by a fall at the Waitrose supermarket chain. Profits will also be affected by an extra holiday pay bill and increased pension contributions after an employment tribunal forced a change in the way all British companies calculate holiday pay.The group hands a share of its profits to staff. Last year, they were awarded a 15% bonus, equivalent to almost eight weeks\u2019 pay but that was a drop on the 2013 payout of 17%. This year\u2019s payout is expected to be smaller again.John Lewis remains on the expansion trail in the UK even as other major retailers, including Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Topshop owner Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group have been closing stores. Street said John Lewis still had relatively few outlets and the city centres it was targeting would not die away as shopping destinations.A homewares store is set to open in Horsham, West Sussex this autumn and a large department store in Birmingham later this year as part of the redevelopment of the city\u2019s New Street station. Further outlets in Leeds, Westfield\u2019s White City shopping centre in west London, Chelmsford and Oxford are also planned.\u2022 This article was amended on 11 March 2015.

No one pushing or talking loudly on the efficiently run public transport system; no rubbish or sticky gum to be trodden underfoot on the well-kept, clean streets. And virtually no crime.Such a city would, probably, resemble Singapore, one of the wealthiest per capita metropolises on the planet \u2013 a city-state that gleams with abundant material goods. \u201cNothing goes wrong here,\u201d says Eric, a German expat. \u201cWhich sort of means that nothing really happens here.\u201dSingapore, once swampland, is now a multicultural hub of commerce. The old colonial facades remain \u2013 such as Raffles, the hotel where you gulp Singapore Slings in a nutshell-strewn bar among superannuated cruise ship tourists \u2013 but it\u2019s the glitz that catches the eye.The huge Prada store on Orchard Road is capitalism in steel and electric form, while the Marina Bay Sands hotel dominates the skyline, looking like a boat has been carefully dropped upon it. There is colour and bustle in Chinatown, with its handsome temples and excellent food, but otherwise Singapore feels like it\u2019s been scrubbed to within an inch of its life.Day-to-day life is famously governed by a series of rules that maintain this clean, well-ordered city. The import of chewing gum is banned, therefore globs of the stuff aren\u2019t found on the street. There are fines for irritating people with a musical instrument or your own drunkenness. Uttering an obscene song lyric or obstructing someone as they walk carries the threat of jail. The result is a low-crime, scrupulously run city \u2013 with none of the incomprehensible, exciting chaos of cities found in neighbouring Indonesia or Malaysia. Aspects such as Singapore\u2019s \u201cintelligent\u201d congestion charge system are held up as triumphs of urban thinking \u2013 but such achievements are made altogether easier by the authoritarianism that is evident as soon as you scratch the surface of life here.\u201cIf you grow up in a first world country, you make the automatic assumption that economic development and basic freedoms go together,\u201d says Alex Au, a Singapore-based writer. \u201cBut as you can also see in China, they are two separate things. Singapore likes to pull the wool over people\u2019s eyes. It likes to say, \u2018Oh, don\u2019t we look like the west, with our glass and our skyscrapers, how developed we are.\u2019 But it just serves as a mask.\u201dSingapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, launched legal action against Au last year for comments made about the government\u2019s integrity on Au\u2019s blog, called Yawning Bread. Despite making a retraction, Au is still being pursued through the courts. It\u2019s a fate that also befell Leslie Chew last year, who was arrested and charged with \u201csedition\u201d over the content of his cartoon strip, called Demon-cratic Singapore. Yet another man, Roy Ngerng, is being sued by the prime minister for defamation over a blog. Ngerng was recently fired from his job at a local hospital, a dismissal he claims is politically motivated.The effect of all this is a kind of semi-freedom. According to the Freedom House watchdog, Singapore, ruled by the same party since 1959, is only \u201cpartly free\u201d. The government doesn\u2019t drag people off the streets, but the populace acts as if it could be a possibility.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t criticise all the rules in Singapore,\u201d Au says. \u201cIf you step on dog poo on the pavement, you\u2019d appreciate a rule against that. If anything, we should ignore the little things and talk about the censorship of the media and the arts. That creates a climate of self-censorship that wouldn\u2019t be obvious to a tourist.\u201dThere are other rules that may surprise the outsider. It\u2019s difficult to buy public-adminstered housing in Singapore unless you\u2019re married or over 35, which presents a further barrier on top of the high cost of dwellings in the city. Car ownership is also banned, unless you purchase one of a set number of expensive permits first.\u201cYou can\u2019t buy a flat if you\u2019re single, which my generation isn\u2019t too happy about,\u201d says Samantha de Silva, a 31-year-old entrepreneur. \u201cYou feel you have to get married to get a flat, which is a strange economic transaction.\u201dDe Silva said she felt quite oppressed when growing up, never quite sure how far she could push seemingly arbitrary authority before it pushed back. Things are changing now, however.\u201cSocial media has changed a lot; it\u2019s changed everything really,\u201d she says. \u201cKids now see things differently; they don\u2019t have the fear of the older generations. They are used to expressing themselves \u2013 there are quite a few poets and fiction writers now. People have a real passion for creative things.\u201cA friend of mine teaches in a polytechnic and he said these kids dream big. He asked them what they want to be when they grow up and they say \u2018a Korean pop star\u2019. The other kids don\u2019t laugh at that. They don\u2019t feel any limitations.\u201dSome do feel the heavy weight of state sanction, however. Chew, the Demon-cratic cartoonist who was charged with sedition, had his computers seized, his passport frozen and spent three months in detention.\u201cI have long suspected that the ruling party was a bunch of power-abusing hypocrites, and that encounter merely confirms the notion,\u201d Chew says. He likens the control of the media as similar to that of North Korea. The wealth gap is getting worse, Chew says, fuelled by an \u201copen door\u201d approach to immigration.\u201cDay-to-day life gets harder and harder,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are now one of the most expensive countries in the world with the highest cost of living, and no minimum wage to ensure that a person who puts in a honest day work can afford even the basic sustenance. \u201cWe have elderly scavenging cardboard to sell for 10 cents a kilogram to make their next meal. The woes faced by the common folks are endless. There are just too many examples. Life is a horror if one does not belong to the rich.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all about the money,\u201d says De Silva.\u201cI think we are way too materialistic as a nation. If you are a barista or waitress, you could be proud in other places for being the best in your job. Here it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a waitress.\u2019 I\u2019d like to see a Singapore where you aren\u2019t judged by how much money you make.\u201dOthers would like to see further changes. Au, who is gay, would like to see homosexuality decriminalised and the government remove itself from the ownership of the media, for starters. But he accepts that a Hong Kong-style uprising isn\u2019t imminent.\u201cIt depends on your horizons,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you keep to yourself, life is very comfortable here. But if self-expression is important, you will be stymied at every turn.\u201cIncreasingly, young Singaporeans are finding that the comfortable life is not enough, and they are rubbing up against those structures. It\u2019s a Faustian deal. Some citizens are prepared to make that deal. Some are not.\u201d\u2022 This article was amended on 6 January 2015 to correct a statement that it is \u201cforbidden to buy property in Singapore unless you\u2019re married\u201d.

And how is it that house building in the UK has regularly fallen short, leaving it with a housing shortage of one million and falling home ownership? Related: The UK can learn a lot from Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore While the UK\u2019s housing crisis may not quite have reached the lows of 1950s Singapore, there\u2019s a lot we can learn from the strength of the Asian city-state\u2019s response. Following independence, Singapore needed an effective housing policy to solve the housing shortage and accelerate economic development. Government bodies were set up, and equipped with the legal powers to implement policies. Expenditure on housing was about 8% of GDP in the 1970s and rose to as much as 15% in the 1980s and 1990s.In his book, the late Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, gives insight into how the country\u2019s housing policy has been developed and implemented. In the 1960s, the government ensured it had enough land to build homes by enforcing compulsory purchase orders and capping land purchase prices which prevented landowners profiteering from sales. By the end of 1965 Singapore had exceeded its target for housebuilding. It tried two approaches to encourage home ownership. The first, low interest rates, didn\u2019t work because borrowers could not afford the 20% deposit \u2013 but a compulsory pension scheme for workers forced everyone to save money that the government decided should be used for a down-payment on a new home. Four years after purchase, homeowners could sell their property at the open market price. And for those who still cannot afford a home, there are subsidised rents and grants.

Meanwhile, in 21st-century Britain, all major national political parties have identified housing as a key issue for the 2015 election. Labour and the Conservatives promise to deliver 200,000 new homes a year by 2020 and the Liberal Democrats pledge 300,000 homes. The party manifestos contain some good ideas for reaching these targets, the best being Labour\u2019s pledge to give local authorities \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d powers to encourage developers to build. Also good are the Conservatives\u2019 subsidised deposits and the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Ukip focus on freeing up brownfield and public sector sites.But none go far enough. While the various levers proposed should help towards their objectives, the mechanisms that can ensure delivery are lacking. These manifesto housebuilding targets are merely aspirational, and there is little evidence to suggest they will be delivered.

Following independence, Singapore needed an effective housing policy to solve the housing shortage and accelerate economic development. Government bodies were set up, and equipped with the legal powers to implement policies. Expenditure on housing was about 8% of GDP in the 1970s and rose to as much as 15% in the 1980s and 1990s.In his book, the late Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, gives insight into how the country\u2019s housing policy has been developed and implemented. In the 1960s, the government ensured it had enough land to build homes by enforcing compulsory purchase orders and capping land purchase prices which prevented landowners profiteering from sales. By the end of 1965 Singapore had exceeded its target for housebuilding. It tried two approaches to encourage home ownership. The first, low interest rates, didn\u2019t work because borrowers could not afford the 20% deposit \u2013 but a compulsory pension scheme for workers forced everyone to save money that the government decided should be used for a down-payment on a new home. Four years after purchase, homeowners could sell their property at the open market price. And for those who still cannot afford a home, there are subsidised rents and grants.

Against the grain, it featured just one European act among the 456 shows, which include seven world and 13 Australian premieres.Instead, Berthold has centred his program around two clusters of work from and about the Congo and Singapore, inspired by a local Brisbane performer Future D Fidel, who has written the festival\u2019s headline homegrown show, Prize Fighter.A young African Australian, Fidel spent much of his childhood in refugee camps after fleeing the Congolese militia in the civil war. La Boite began working with him, and the result is this semi-autobiographical show about a talented boxer preparing for the biggest fight of his career.Over the course of three weeks in September, festivalgoers will also see Les Ballets C de la B\u2019s Coup Fatal featuring Congolese counter-tenor Serge Kakudji; Macbeth, reframed by South African director Brett Bailey as a story of Congolese warlords; and Le Cargo, by dancer and choreographer Faustin Linyekula.\u201cThe west clearly has a blind spot when it comes to the Congo and Africa in general,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cMy eyes were completely opened by what I\u2019ve read and seen in these works \u2026 but this is also about talking to the city. It\u2019s been fabulous to meet African leaders and the community in Brisbane. There\u2019s all sorts of layers.\u201dSingapore is the flipside of the same story, says the director, whose secondary interest was sparked by a series of trips to a country where plays must still be presented to the government for approval before they are produced in public.\u201cNot many people know that about Singapore,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cIt\u2019s a near neighbour of Australia. We know Changi airport, we go shopping there, we do business. But its cultural history and complexity, the way it has dealt with colonialism, is almost the complete opposite to the Congo.\u201dIn the 50th year of the country\u2019s independence, Berthold has programmed five shows from Singapore, including an all-male version of The Importance of Being Earnest by Wild Rice theatre company. His hope is that seeing a range of shows from both countries will get Australian audiences thinking about their own.\u201cThe Congo is one of the largest nations in the world and one of the poorest; Singapore, one of the smallest and richest. The Congo is flooded with natural resources. If it harnessed its water, it could power all of Africa. Singapore doesn\u2019t have its own fresh water supply. It has to get it from Malaysia. Singapore has a charismatic leader who, through the notion of free trade but at some cost of free press, has made Singapore a world powerhouse in less than 50 years. The Congo, well, they\u2019ve had not any leadership ever, and that\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d Another festival highlight, Flexn, a dynamic dance work from the US that tackles black incarceration, is likely to feel close to home for audiences in the wake of protests at the G20. So too One Beautiful Day, by Ilbijerri theatre, which looks at the death of Mulrunji Doomadgee in police custody on Palm Island. It will premiere on Palm Island before coming to Brisbane and features Doomadgee\u2019s niece.\u201cIn Australia we have conversations about censorship. We have conversations about marriage equality. We have conversations about resources and taxes and race. But to put them in another context gives them another layer entirely,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cThere is a circuit of festival works and it\u2019s very easy to cherry-pick those works.

It has been used in the past and I and everyone involved in the website have always known there is a risk in doing what we do.\u201dHer family in Brisbane had told her \u201cgood luck and be careful\u201d, Takagi said.Police investigators had indicated the website\u2019s \u201cmisreporting had caused local Singaporeans to be angry at the foreign nationals who complained and caused the incident\u201d at the festival, Takagi said.This was enough to trigger the Sedition Act, police told Takagi.Meanwhile, the Real Singapore, one of a number of emerging citizen or crowdsourced journalist websites in Singapore, plans to keep publishing.\u201cThe mainstream media for itself is heavily censored by the government and then you won\u2019t find dissenting voices and everything \u2026 looks very happy in the mainstream media,\u201d Takagi said.\u201cThat\u2019s one of the main reasons websites like the Real Singapore exist \u2013 because people feel that their voices are not actually being heard, which is why so many people are willing to send their opinions and complaints in because there isn\u2019t the space for that in the mainstream media.\u201dMany of the contributions to the Real Singapore related to \u201ccomplaints about how certain policies have affected people\u2019s lives.

He continued to wield great political influence until 2011.Around 50 years ago, Singapore was little more than an impoverished swampy island with 1.6 million inhabitants and virtually no natural resources. Now, with a population of 5.5 million, it has been transformed into the envy of the world.The statistics speak for themselves. Unemployment is just 2%, Singapore is third in the global education league, possibly the world\u2019s healthiest nation and 90% of Singaporeans own their own homes, which are mostly government built. Crime levels are almost the lowest in the world, it is one of the least corrupt nations and its streets, public transport and public places are clean. Related: Lee Kuan Yew funeral: pictures and reflections from Singaporeans Singapore is also the top country in which to do business. It has an almost perpetual government budget surplus of between 0 and 20% of gross domestic product and the 6th highest purchasing power [pdf] in the world, twice that of the UK.What a legacy for Lee Kuan Yew. He describes the factors underpinning Singapore\u2019s success in his book, From Third World to First, as wealth creation, huge investment in infrastructure, environment and leisure facilities, building quality homes instead of paying benefits and nurturing talent \u2013 as well as the Confucian principle that the family should take responsibility for its members.Wealth creation has focused on attracting investment and supporting local businesses. It keeps business taxation low, half that of the UK, and gives generous allowances to startups. Unlike the UK, employment laws favour the employer rather than the employee. Unlike the proliferation of bodies in the UK, one agency, International Enterprise, actively supports the establishment and development of new businesses and helps them become global. This was deliberate policy in the 1980s to turn Singapore into a financial centre.With the increasingly booming economies of south-east Asia and China on its doorstep, Singapore is well placed to make itself attractive to investors and it is seizing the opportunity to take advantage of those markets. Pharma group GlaxoSmithKline is the latest major business to decide to invest in a regional hub and Ila Technologies has just opened the world\u2019s largest diamond greenhouse.In 2013, Singapore spent 30 times more per head of population on infrastructure than the UK. Recent investment in leisure and tourism have seen the building of the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and the two largest climate-controlled greenhouses in the world. It has just announced plans to spend S$740m (\u00a3365m) in sprucing up Singapore\u2019s museums and galleries. Singapore is criticised for its tight controls on media and freedom of speech. Political and social stability in a diverse nation has been seen as vital to economic success and after some turmoil in the early 1960s and in neighbouring countries in the 1990s, Lee Kuan Yew decided that the western model of press freedom was potentially divisive.Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, has stated recently that the country is investing in the future for its children and grandchildren while older economies in the west are creating massive debt for them. As the son of Lee Kuan Yew, he must be a proud guardian of his father\u2019s legacy. Singapore is increasingly visited by UK politicians seeking inspiration.

Singapore seems to have come up with one solution, in the form of a vertical urban farm doubling as a retirement home. It\u2019s called Home Farm, and it\u2019s a place where elderly residents grow their own vegetables \u2013 through vertical aquaponic farming and rooftop soil plantings \u2013 in the pursuit not only of more active, sociable lifestyles but also of income. In turn, as Christa Avampato writes in Seedstock, the project aims to strengthen Singapore\u2019s food security. Still, the architects have pre-empted potential criticism. \u201cHome Farm is not a forced seniors\u2019 labour camp,\u201d explains Stephen Pimbley of SPARK Architects, \u201cwe are simply presenting the opportunity for part-time work.\u201d Well, we\u2019re glad that\u2019s cleared up.For decades, industry in the Palestinian city of Hebron was dominated by one thing: shoes. In a photo gallery feature, Al Jazeera takes a look at the now-declining shoe industry in the city, meeting those who still work in it. \u201cIn the \u2018golden days\u2019, at least 35,000 people were working in more than 1,000 workshops across the city,\u201d writes Tareq Abu Felat. There are now only 300 workshops, open part-time, thanks to the mass importation of Chinese goods.Across South Africa, cities are still decorated with statues and monuments that stand as symbols of apartheid and colonialism. This week, however, saw the fall of one in Cape Town, as the statue of Cecil Rhodes was removed amid cheers and celebrations. Writing in Cape Town Partnership, Sibusiso Tshabalala and Nadine Botha present eight creative things to do with other remnants of the past. Their suggestions range from shrink-wrapping statues in neon pink \u2013 as took place last year in Bloemfontein \u2013 to projecting transformative animations or using paint to turn them into comic book characters. Poor Brussels. Its urban design is so ridiculed that the term \u201cBrusselisation\u201d is used to describe messy city planning around the world. But how did this happen? CityMetric looks into the city\u2019s poor planning past, characterised by its postwar tendency to demolish historic buildings, replace them with \u201cugly\u201d ones and add a whole lot of roads to the mix. As Frances Robinson explains, the chaotic nature of the city creates strong reactions among its citizens \u2013 but the results often form a humorous, valuable and illuminating commentary on life in Brussels.Over the last few years, Athens\u2019 city centre has fallen into decline, resulting in shut-up shops and buildings in disrepair. But a new regeneration plan is hoping to turn things around. As Feargus O\u2019Sullivan writes in CityLab, the \u201cReturn to Athens 2015-2020\u201d programme plans to refurbish 1,800 older buildings, replace cracked pavements and install better lighting in order to attract more tourists and locals back into the area. But is the programme ignoring the value of life in the city centre as it is? \u201cMuch of the area to be renovated already throbs, retaining exactly the sort of vibrancy residents of other cities look back to with longing.\u201dIs a retirement home urban farm a good idea?

Singapore seems to have come up with one solution, in the form of a vertical urban farm doubling as a retirement home. It\u2019s called Home Farm, and it\u2019s a place where elderly residents grow their own vegetables \u2013 through vertical aquaponic farming and rooftop soil plantings \u2013 in the pursuit not only of more active, sociable lifestyles but also of income. In turn, as Christa Avampato writes in Seedstock, the project aims to strengthen Singapore\u2019s food security. Still, the architects have pre-empted potential criticism. \u201cHome Farm is not a forced seniors\u2019 labour camp,\u201d explains Stephen Pimbley of SPARK Architects, \u201cwe are simply presenting the opportunity for part-time work.\u201d Well, we\u2019re glad that\u2019s cleared up.For decades, industry in the Palestinian city of Hebron was dominated by one thing: shoes. In a photo gallery feature, Al Jazeera takes a look at the now-declining shoe industry in the city, meeting those who still work in it. \u201cIn the \u2018golden days\u2019, at least 35,000 people were working in more than 1,000 workshops across the city,\u201d writes Tareq Abu Felat. There are now only 300 workshops, open part-time, thanks to the mass importation of Chinese goods.Across South Africa, cities are still decorated with statues and monuments that stand as symbols of apartheid and colonialism. This week, however, saw the fall of one in Cape Town, as the statue of Cecil Rhodes was removed amid cheers and celebrations. Writing in Cape Town Partnership, Sibusiso Tshabalala and Nadine Botha present eight creative things to do with other remnants of the past. Their suggestions range from shrink-wrapping statues in neon pink \u2013 as took place last year in Bloemfontein \u2013 to projecting transformative animations or using paint to turn them into comic book characters. Poor Brussels. Its urban design is so ridiculed that the term \u201cBrusselisation\u201d is used to describe messy city planning around the world. But how did this happen? CityMetric looks into the city\u2019s poor planning past, characterised by its postwar tendency to demolish historic buildings, replace them with \u201cugly\u201d ones and add a whole lot of roads to the mix. As Frances Robinson explains, the chaotic nature of the city creates strong reactions among its citizens \u2013 but the results often form a humorous, valuable and illuminating commentary on life in Brussels.Over the last few years, Athens\u2019 city centre has fallen into decline, resulting in shut-up shops and buildings in disrepair. But a new regeneration plan is hoping to turn things around. As Feargus O\u2019Sullivan writes in CityLab, the \u201cReturn to Athens 2015-2020\u201d programme plans to refurbish 1,800 older buildings, replace cracked pavements and install better lighting in order to attract more tourists and locals back into the area.

Announcing the launch of the new range, she said: \u201cWe want to create a collection that not only appeals to modern ladies who prefer to dress modestly, but also an international audience who desire clothes that fit comfortably and look contemporary.

Against the grain, it featured just one European act among the 456 shows, which include seven world and 13 Australian premieres.Instead, Berthold has centred his program around two clusters of work from and about the Congo and Singapore, inspired by a local Brisbane performer Future D Fidel, who has written the festival\u2019s headline homegrown show, Prize Fighter.A young African Australian, Fidel spent much of his childhood in refugee camps after fleeing the Congolese militia in the civil war. La Boite began working with him, and the result is this semi-autobiographical show about a talented boxer preparing for the biggest fight of his career.Over the course of three weeks in September, festivalgoers will also see Les Ballets C de la B\u2019s Coup Fatal featuring Congolese counter-tenor Serge Kakudji; Macbeth, reframed by South African director Brett Bailey as a story of Congolese warlords; and Le Cargo, by dancer and choreographer Faustin Linyekula.\u201cThe west clearly has a blind spot when it comes to the Congo and Africa in general,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cMy eyes were completely opened by what I\u2019ve read and seen in these works \u2026 but this is also about talking to the city. It\u2019s been fabulous to meet African leaders and the community in Brisbane. There\u2019s all sorts of layers.\u201dSingapore is the flipside of the same story, says the director, whose secondary interest was sparked by a series of trips to a country where plays must still be presented to the government for approval before they are produced in public.\u201cNot many people know that about Singapore,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cIt\u2019s a near neighbour of Australia. We know Changi airport, we go shopping there, we do business. But its cultural history and complexity, the way it has dealt with colonialism, is almost the complete opposite to the Congo.\u201dIn the 50th year of the country\u2019s independence, Berthold has programmed five shows from Singapore, including an all-male version of The Importance of Being Earnest by Wild Rice theatre company. His hope is that seeing a range of shows from both countries will get Australian audiences thinking about their own.\u201cThe Congo is one of the largest nations in the world and one of the poorest; Singapore, one of the smallest and richest. The Congo is flooded with natural resources. If it harnessed its water, it could power all of Africa. Singapore doesn\u2019t have its own fresh water supply. It has to get it from Malaysia. Singapore has a charismatic leader who, through the notion of free trade but at some cost of free press, has made Singapore a world powerhouse in less than 50 years. The Congo, well, they\u2019ve had not any leadership ever, and that\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d Another festival highlight, Flexn, a dynamic dance work from the US that tackles black incarceration, is likely to feel close to home for audiences in the wake of protests at the G20. So too One Beautiful Day, by Ilbijerri theatre, which looks at the death of Mulrunji Doomadgee in police custody on Palm Island. It will premiere on Palm Island before coming to Brisbane and features Doomadgee\u2019s niece.\u201cIn Australia we have conversations about censorship. We have conversations about marriage equality. We have conversations about resources and taxes and race. But to put them in another context gives them another layer entirely,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cThere is a circuit of festival works and it\u2019s very easy to cherry-pick those works. To me, that is not a creative act, just to assemble the same old things. A festival is very well placed to be at the nexus of heart and community and participation \u2013 a great hotspot for the arts at the moment.\u201dWith Berthold at the helm of Brisbane festival, Wesley Enoch newly announced in Sydney, Neil Armfield in Adelaide (with Rachel Healy) and Jonathan Holloway in Melbourne, the majority of major city arts festivals in Australia will soon be run by practising theatre directors \u2013 a plea made by Ralph Myers at Belvoir theatre in December 2014.  \u201cSuddenly that speech feels like another century ago,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cSuddenly we have all these theatre directors running festivals. How it manifests I don\u2019t know. \u201cBut if you can have both things \u2013 do the great art but also have the great eye-opening conversations \u2013 then for me, that\u2019s a festival experience.\u201d\u2022 Brisbane festival 2015 runs from 5 to 26 September at venues citywide", "tags": ["Brisbane festival 2015", "Brisbane festival", "Festivals", "Australian theatre", "Culture", "Brisbane", "Queensland", "Australia news", "Stage", "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Singapore", "Dance", "Theatre"], "title": "From Singapore to Congo, Brisbane festival takes a world view in 2015"},{"date": "2015-04-30T09:50:15Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "\u201cThe rapacity of the landlords surely cannot be exceeded anywhere in the world. Some dilapidated buildings resembled human warrens.\u201d This is what politician and writer Edith Sommerskill said of her 1954 trip to Singapore in her memoirs \u2013 but it is not a description visitors would recognise today.How did Singapore go from one of the worst housing crises in the world to a country where 90% of its citizens own their own home and homelessness is virtually eliminated \u2013 despite its population tripling in that time? And how is it that house building in the UK has regularly fallen short, leaving it with a housing shortage of one million and falling home ownership? Related: The UK can learn a lot from Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore While the UK\u2019s housing crisis may not quite have reached the lows of 1950s Singapore, there\u2019s a lot we can learn from the strength of the Asian city-state\u2019s response. Following independence, Singapore needed an effective housing policy to solve the housing shortage and accelerate economic development. Government bodies were set up, and equipped with the legal powers to implement policies. Expenditure on housing was about 8% of GDP in the 1970s and rose to as much as 15% in the 1980s and 1990s.In his book, the late Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, gives insight into how the country\u2019s housing policy has been developed and implemented. In the 1960s, the government ensured it had enough land to build homes by enforcing compulsory purchase orders and capping land purchase prices which prevented landowners profiteering from sales. By the end of 1965 Singapore had exceeded its target for housebuilding. It tried two approaches to encourage home ownership. The first, low interest rates, didn\u2019t work because borrowers could not afford the 20% deposit \u2013 but a compulsory pension scheme for workers forced everyone to save money that the government decided should be used for a down-payment on a new home. Four years after purchase, homeowners could sell their property at the open market price. And for those who still cannot afford a home, there are subsidised rents and grants. Related: Renters, first-time buyers and owners \u2013 how will the election affect you? Meanwhile, in 21st-century Britain, all major national political parties have identified housing as a key issue for the 2015 election. Labour and the Conservatives promise to deliver 200,000 new homes a year by 2020 and the Liberal Democrats pledge 300,000 homes. The party manifestos contain some good ideas for reaching these targets, the best being Labour\u2019s pledge to give local authorities \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d powers to encourage developers to build. Also good are the Conservatives\u2019 subsidised deposits and the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Ukip focus on freeing up brownfield and public sector sites.But none go far enough. While the various levers proposed should help towards their objectives, the mechanisms that can ensure delivery are lacking. These manifesto housebuilding targets are merely aspirational, and there is little evidence to suggest they will be delivered. UK politicians, if they are serious about solving the shortage of good quality homes, should adopt the forceful approach of Singapore.Sign up for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.

Singapore seems to have come up with one solution, in the form of a vertical urban farm doubling as a retirement home. It\u2019s called Home Farm, and it\u2019s a place where elderly residents grow their own vegetables \u2013 through vertical aquaponic farming and rooftop soil plantings \u2013 in the pursuit not only of more active, sociable lifestyles but also of income. In turn, as Christa Avampato writes in Seedstock, the project aims to strengthen Singapore\u2019s food security. Still, the architects have pre-empted potential criticism. \u201cHome Farm is not a forced seniors\u2019 labour camp,\u201d explains Stephen Pimbley of SPARK Architects, \u201cwe are simply presenting the opportunity for part-time work.\u201d Well, we\u2019re glad that\u2019s cleared up.For decades, industry in the Palestinian city of Hebron was dominated by one thing: shoes. In a photo gallery feature, Al Jazeera takes a look at the now-declining shoe industry in the city, meeting those who still work in it. \u201cIn the \u2018golden days\u2019, at least 35,000 people were working in more than 1,000 workshops across the city,\u201d writes Tareq Abu Felat. There are now only 300 workshops, open part-time, thanks to the mass importation of Chinese goods.Across South Africa, cities are still decorated with statues and monuments that stand as symbols of apartheid and colonialism. This week, however, saw the fall of one in Cape Town, as the statue of Cecil Rhodes was removed amid cheers and celebrations. Writing in Cape Town Partnership, Sibusiso Tshabalala and Nadine Botha present eight creative things to do with other remnants of the past. Their suggestions range from shrink-wrapping statues in neon pink \u2013 as took place last year in Bloemfontein \u2013 to projecting transformative animations or using paint to turn them into comic book characters. Poor Brussels. Its urban design is so ridiculed that the term \u201cBrusselisation\u201d is used to describe messy city planning around the world. But how did this happen? CityMetric looks into the city\u2019s poor planning past, characterised by its postwar tendency to demolish historic buildings, replace them with \u201cugly\u201d ones and add a whole lot of roads to the mix. As Frances Robinson explains, the chaotic nature of the city creates strong reactions among its citizens \u2013 but the results often form a humorous, valuable and illuminating commentary on life in Brussels.Over the last few years, Athens\u2019 city centre has fallen into decline, resulting in shut-up shops and buildings in disrepair. But a new regeneration plan is hoping to turn things around. As Feargus O\u2019Sullivan writes in CityLab, the \u201cReturn to Athens 2015-2020\u201d programme plans to refurbish 1,800 older buildings, replace cracked pavements and install better lighting in order to attract more tourists and locals back into the area.

Against the grain, it featured just one European act among the 456 shows, which include seven world and 13 Australian premieres.Instead, Berthold has centred his program around two clusters of work from and about the Congo and Singapore, inspired by a local Brisbane performer Future D Fidel, who has written the festival\u2019s headline homegrown show, Prize Fighter.A young African Australian, Fidel spent much of his childhood in refugee camps after fleeing the Congolese militia in the civil war. La Boite began working with him, and the result is this semi-autobiographical show about a talented boxer preparing for the biggest fight of his career.Over the course of three weeks in September, festivalgoers will also see Les Ballets C de la B\u2019s Coup Fatal featuring Congolese counter-tenor Serge Kakudji; Macbeth, reframed by South African director Brett Bailey as a story of Congolese warlords; and Le Cargo, by dancer and choreographer Faustin Linyekula.\u201cThe west clearly has a blind spot when it comes to the Congo and Africa in general,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cMy eyes were completely opened by what I\u2019ve read and seen in these works \u2026 but this is also about talking to the city. It\u2019s been fabulous to meet African leaders and the community in Brisbane. There\u2019s all sorts of layers.\u201dSingapore is the flipside of the same story, says the director, whose secondary interest was sparked by a series of trips to a country where plays must still be presented to the government for approval before they are produced in public.\u201cNot many people know that about Singapore,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cIt\u2019s a near neighbour of Australia. We know Changi airport, we go shopping there, we do business. But its cultural history and complexity, the way it has dealt with colonialism, is almost the complete opposite to the Congo.\u201dIn the 50th year of the country\u2019s independence, Berthold has programmed five shows from Singapore, including an all-male version of The Importance of Being Earnest by Wild Rice theatre company. His hope is that seeing a range of shows from both countries will get Australian audiences thinking about their own.\u201cThe Congo is one of the largest nations in the world and one of the poorest; Singapore, one of the smallest and richest. The Congo is flooded with natural resources. If it harnessed its water, it could power all of Africa. Singapore doesn\u2019t have its own fresh water supply. It has to get it from Malaysia. Singapore has a charismatic leader who, through the notion of free trade but at some cost of free press, has made Singapore a world powerhouse in less than 50 years. The Congo, well, they\u2019ve had not any leadership ever, and that\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d Another festival highlight, Flexn, a dynamic dance work from the US that tackles black incarceration, is likely to feel close to home for audiences in the wake of protests at the G20. So too One Beautiful Day, by Ilbijerri theatre, which looks at the death of Mulrunji Doomadgee in police custody on Palm Island. It will premiere on Palm Island before coming to Brisbane and features Doomadgee\u2019s niece.\u201cIn Australia we have conversations about censorship. We have conversations about marriage equality. We have conversations about resources and taxes and race. But to put them in another context gives them another layer entirely,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cThere is a circuit of festival works and it\u2019s very easy to cherry-pick those works. To me, that is not a creative act, just to assemble the same old things. A festival is very well placed to be at the nexus of heart and community and participation \u2013 a great hotspot for the arts at the moment.\u201dWith Berthold at the helm of Brisbane festival, Wesley Enoch newly announced in Sydney, Neil Armfield in Adelaide (with Rachel Healy) and Jonathan Holloway in Melbourne, the majority of major city arts festivals in Australia will soon be run by practising theatre directors \u2013 a plea made by Ralph Myers at Belvoir theatre in December 2014.  \u201cSuddenly that speech feels like another century ago,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cSuddenly we have all these theatre directors running festivals. How it manifests I don\u2019t know. \u201cBut if you can have both things \u2013 do the great art but also have the great eye-opening conversations \u2013 then for me, that\u2019s a festival experience.\u201d\u2022 Brisbane festival 2015 runs from 5 to 26 September at venues citywide", "tags": ["Brisbane festival 2015", "Brisbane festival", "Festivals", "Australian theatre", "Culture", "Brisbane", "Queensland", "Australia news", "Stage", "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Singapore", "Dance", "Theatre"], "title": "From Singapore to Congo, Brisbane festival takes a world view in 2015"},{"date": "2015-04-30T09:50:15Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "\u201cThe rapacity of the landlords surely cannot be exceeded anywhere in the world. Some dilapidated buildings resembled human warrens.\u201d This is what politician and writer Edith Sommerskill said of her 1954 trip to Singapore in her memoirs \u2013 but it is not a description visitors would recognise today.How did Singapore go from one of the worst housing crises in the world to a country where 90% of its citizens own their own home and homelessness is virtually eliminated \u2013 despite its population tripling in that time? And how is it that house building in the UK has regularly fallen short, leaving it with a housing shortage of one million and falling home ownership? Related: The UK can learn a lot from Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore While the UK\u2019s housing crisis may not quite have reached the lows of 1950s Singapore, there\u2019s a lot we can learn from the strength of the Asian city-state\u2019s response. Following independence, Singapore needed an effective housing policy to solve the housing shortage and accelerate economic development. Government bodies were set up, and equipped with the legal powers to implement policies. Expenditure on housing was about 8% of GDP in the 1970s and rose to as much as 15% in the 1980s and 1990s.In his book, the late Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, gives insight into how the country\u2019s housing policy has been developed and implemented. In the 1960s, the government ensured it had enough land to build homes by enforcing compulsory purchase orders and capping land purchase prices which prevented landowners profiteering from sales. By the end of 1965 Singapore had exceeded its target for housebuilding. It tried two approaches to encourage home ownership. The first, low interest rates, didn\u2019t work because borrowers could not afford the 20% deposit \u2013 but a compulsory pension scheme for workers forced everyone to save money that the government decided should be used for a down-payment on a new home. Four years after purchase, homeowners could sell their property at the open market price. And for those who still cannot afford a home, there are subsidised rents and grants. Related: Renters, first-time buyers and owners \u2013 how will the election affect you? Meanwhile, in 21st-century Britain, all major national political parties have identified housing as a key issue for the 2015 election. Labour and the Conservatives promise to deliver 200,000 new homes a year by 2020 and the Liberal Democrats pledge 300,000 homes. The party manifestos contain some good ideas for reaching these targets, the best being Labour\u2019s pledge to give local authorities \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d powers to encourage developers to build. Also good are the Conservatives\u2019 subsidised deposits and the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Ukip focus on freeing up brownfield and public sector sites.But none go far enough. While the various levers proposed should help towards their objectives, the mechanisms that can ensure delivery are lacking. These manifesto housebuilding targets are merely aspirational, and there is little evidence to suggest they will be delivered. UK politicians, if they are serious about solving the shortage of good quality homes, should adopt the forceful approach of Singapore.Sign up for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.

He continued to wield great political influence until 2011.Around 50 years ago, Singapore was little more than an impoverished swampy island with 1.6 million inhabitants and virtually no natural resources. Now, with a population of 5.5 million, it has been transformed into the envy of the world.The statistics speak for themselves. Unemployment is just 2%, Singapore is third in the global education league, possibly the world\u2019s healthiest nation and 90% of Singaporeans own their own homes, which are mostly government built. Crime levels are almost the lowest in the world, it is one of the least corrupt nations and its streets, public transport and public places are clean. Related: Lee Kuan Yew funeral: pictures and reflections from Singaporeans Singapore is also the top country in which to do business. It has an almost perpetual government budget surplus of between 0 and 20% of gross domestic product and the 6th highest purchasing power [pdf] in the world, twice that of the UK.What a legacy for Lee Kuan Yew. He describes the factors underpinning Singapore\u2019s success in his book, From Third World to First, as wealth creation, huge investment in infrastructure, environment and leisure facilities, building quality homes instead of paying benefits and nurturing talent \u2013 as well as the Confucian principle that the family should take responsibility for its members.Wealth creation has focused on attracting investment and supporting local businesses. It keeps business taxation low, half that of the UK, and gives generous allowances to startups. Unlike the UK, employment laws favour the employer rather than the employee. Unlike the proliferation of bodies in the UK, one agency, International Enterprise, actively supports the establishment and development of new businesses and helps them become global. This was deliberate policy in the 1980s to turn Singapore into a financial centre.With the increasingly booming economies of south-east Asia and China on its doorstep, Singapore is well placed to make itself attractive to investors and it is seizing the opportunity to take advantage of those markets. Pharma group GlaxoSmithKline is the latest major business to decide to invest in a regional hub and Ila Technologies has just opened the world\u2019s largest diamond greenhouse.In 2013, Singapore spent 30 times more per head of population on infrastructure than the UK. Recent investment in leisure and tourism have seen the building of the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and the two largest climate-controlled greenhouses in the world. It has just announced plans to spend S$740m (\u00a3365m) in sprucing up Singapore\u2019s museums and galleries. Singapore is criticised for its tight controls on media and freedom of speech. Political and social stability in a diverse nation has been seen as vital to economic success and after some turmoil in the early 1960s and in neighbouring countries in the 1990s, Lee Kuan Yew decided that the western model of press freedom was potentially divisive.Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, has stated recently that the country is investing in the future for its children and grandchildren while older economies in the west are creating massive debt for them.

More than half of them are thought to have been detained in China; four known cases involve smuggling methamphetamine, commonly known in Australia as ice. In 2014, China Daily reported that of 63 foreign drug-smuggling suspects detained by officials in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, 11 were Australian.Rao Jiyong, a deputy director at the city\u2019s anti-smuggling customs bureau, told the newspaper that drug-smuggling cases involving Australian suspects had rapidly increased over the past two years and cooperation had been strengthened with Australian federal police and customs officials.In 2013-14, more than a third of Australians in prison overseas were there because of drug offences. Countries which apply the death penalty on those convicted of using, dealing or trafficking drugs include Indonesia, Thailand, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.A dual New Zealand/Australian citizen, Gardner was arrested at Guangzhou airport, China, on 8 November 2014 after customs officials allegedly found 30kg of methamphetamine in his bags. Gardner\u2019s lawyer, Craig Tuck, confirmed with Guardian Australia his trial would begin on 7 May in Guangzhou\u2019s municipal intermediate court. \u201cThis is considerably earlier than expected,\u201d Tuck said. It is expected to last no more than two days.Sherrif and Jalloh were arrested by Chinese authorities at Guangzhou airport in June 2014, the ABC reported. Sherrif was sentenced to a suspended death penalty for attempting to smuggle methamphetamine from China to Australia, which could be commuted to life in prison after two years of good behaviour. Jalloh is awaiting trial.Australian jockey Bannister was arrested for drug smuggling in Guangzhou on 11 March 2014, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. More than 3kg of crystal methamphetamine were found in envelopes stuffed into eight handbags in his luggage. \u201cI do believe that I have been set up ... in this drug-smuggling scheme,\u201d Bannister told the court at his October trial. \u201cThey\u2019ve used me as a mule.\u201dHenry Chhin (China)Chhin, then 35 from Sydney, was detained by police in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on 10 May 2004 for attempting to mail 270g of methamphetamine to Australia, the Shenzhen Daily reported. The box, which allegedly contained the drugs and computer software, was intercepted by Shanghai police two days before. Local police said another 700g of the same drug was found in kitchen cabinets and the sitting room of Chhin\u2019s residence. He was given the death penalty with a two-year suspension in March 2005.A small group of foreign nationals have been executed in China, but none have been Australian. According to China.org.cn these include five Japanese, four South Koreans and a Pakistani-British businessman.Exposto, from Melbourne, was arrested on 7 December 2014 after arriving at Kuala Lumpur airport, en route from Shanghai to Melbourne, with a bag authorities said contained 1.5kg of crystal methamphetamine. Exposto\u2019s lawyer, Tania Scivetti, confirmed to Guardian Australia that a chemical analysis of the substance would be submitted to court on Thursday, after which the case would probably move to the high court for a May hearing.

Against the grain, it featured just one European act among the 456 shows, which include seven world and 13 Australian premieres.Instead, Berthold has centred his program around two clusters of work from and about the Congo and Singapore, inspired by a local Brisbane performer Future D Fidel, who has written the festival\u2019s headline homegrown show, Prize Fighter.A young African Australian, Fidel spent much of his childhood in refugee camps after fleeing the Congolese militia in the civil war. La Boite began working with him, and the result is this semi-autobiographical show about a talented boxer preparing for the biggest fight of his career.Over the course of three weeks in September, festivalgoers will also see Les Ballets C de la B\u2019s Coup Fatal featuring Congolese counter-tenor Serge Kakudji; Macbeth, reframed by South African director Brett Bailey as a story of Congolese warlords; and Le Cargo, by dancer and choreographer Faustin Linyekula.\u201cThe west clearly has a blind spot when it comes to the Congo and Africa in general,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cMy eyes were completely opened by what I\u2019ve read and seen in these works \u2026 but this is also about talking to the city. It\u2019s been fabulous to meet African leaders and the community in Brisbane. There\u2019s all sorts of layers.\u201dSingapore is the flipside of the same story, says the director, whose secondary interest was sparked by a series of trips to a country where plays must still be presented to the government for approval before they are produced in public.\u201cNot many people know that about Singapore,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cIt\u2019s a near neighbour of Australia. We know Changi airport, we go shopping there, we do business. But its cultural history and complexity, the way it has dealt with colonialism, is almost the complete opposite to the Congo.\u201dIn the 50th year of the country\u2019s independence, Berthold has programmed five shows from Singapore, including an all-male version of The Importance of Being Earnest by Wild Rice theatre company. His hope is that seeing a range of shows from both countries will get Australian audiences thinking about their own.\u201cThe Congo is one of the largest nations in the world and one of the poorest; Singapore, one of the smallest and richest. The Congo is flooded with natural resources. If it harnessed its water, it could power all of Africa. Singapore doesn\u2019t have its own fresh water supply. It has to get it from Malaysia. Singapore has a charismatic leader who, through the notion of free trade but at some cost of free press, has made Singapore a world powerhouse in less than 50 years. The Congo, well, they\u2019ve had not any leadership ever, and that\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d Another festival highlight, Flexn, a dynamic dance work from the US that tackles black incarceration, is likely to feel close to home for audiences in the wake of protests at the G20. So too One Beautiful Day, by Ilbijerri theatre, which looks at the death of Mulrunji Doomadgee in police custody on Palm Island. It will premiere on Palm Island before coming to Brisbane and features Doomadgee\u2019s niece.\u201cIn Australia we have conversations about censorship. We have conversations about marriage equality. We have conversations about resources and taxes and race. But to put them in another context gives them another layer entirely,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cThere is a circuit of festival works and it\u2019s very easy to cherry-pick those works. To me, that is not a creative act, just to assemble the same old things. A festival is very well placed to be at the nexus of heart and community and participation \u2013 a great hotspot for the arts at the moment.\u201dWith Berthold at the helm of Brisbane festival, Wesley Enoch newly announced in Sydney, Neil Armfield in Adelaide (with Rachel Healy) and Jonathan Holloway in Melbourne, the majority of major city arts festivals in Australia will soon be run by practising theatre directors \u2013 a plea made by Ralph Myers at Belvoir theatre in December 2014.  \u201cSuddenly that speech feels like another century ago,\u201d says Berthold. \u201cSuddenly we have all these theatre directors running festivals. How it manifests I don\u2019t know. \u201cBut if you can have both things \u2013 do the great art but also have the great eye-opening conversations \u2013 then for me, that\u2019s a festival experience.\u201d\u2022 Brisbane festival 2015 runs from 5 to 26 September at venues citywide", "tags": ["Brisbane festival 2015", "Brisbane festival", "Festivals", "Australian theatre", "Culture", "Brisbane", "Queensland", "Australia news", "Stage", "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "Singapore", "Dance", "Theatre"], "title": "From Singapore to Congo, Brisbane festival takes a world view in 2015"},{"date": "2015-04-30T09:50:15Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "\u201cThe rapacity of the landlords surely cannot be exceeded anywhere in the world. Some dilapidated buildings resembled human warrens.\u201d This is what politician and writer Edith Sommerskill said of her 1954 trip to Singapore in her memoirs \u2013 but it is not a description visitors would recognise today.How did Singapore go from one of the worst housing crises in the world to a country where 90% of its citizens own their own home and homelessness is virtually eliminated \u2013 despite its population tripling in that time? And how is it that house building in the UK has regularly fallen short, leaving it with a housing shortage of one million and falling home ownership? Related: The UK can learn a lot from Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore While the UK\u2019s housing crisis may not quite have reached the lows of 1950s Singapore, there\u2019s a lot we can learn from the strength of the Asian city-state\u2019s response. Following independence, Singapore needed an effective housing policy to solve the housing shortage and accelerate economic development. Government bodies were set up, and equipped with the legal powers to implement policies. Expenditure on housing was about 8% of GDP in the 1970s and rose to as much as 15% in the 1980s and 1990s.In his book, the late Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, gives insight into how the country\u2019s housing policy has been developed and implemented. In the 1960s, the government ensured it had enough land to build homes by enforcing compulsory purchase orders and capping land purchase prices which prevented landowners profiteering from sales. By the end of 1965 Singapore had exceeded its target for housebuilding. It tried two approaches to encourage home ownership. The first, low interest rates, didn\u2019t work because borrowers could not afford the 20% deposit \u2013 but a compulsory pension scheme for workers forced everyone to save money that the government decided should be used for a down-payment on a new home. Four years after purchase, homeowners could sell their property at the open market price. And for those who still cannot afford a home, there are subsidised rents and grants. Related: Renters, first-time buyers and owners \u2013 how will the election affect you? Meanwhile, in 21st-century Britain, all major national political parties have identified housing as a key issue for the 2015 election. Labour and the Conservatives promise to deliver 200,000 new homes a year by 2020 and the Liberal Democrats pledge 300,000 homes. The party manifestos contain some good ideas for reaching these targets, the best being Labour\u2019s pledge to give local authorities \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d powers to encourage developers to build. Also good are the Conservatives\u2019 subsidised deposits and the Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Ukip focus on freeing up brownfield and public sector sites.But none go far enough. While the various levers proposed should help towards their objectives, the mechanisms that can ensure delivery are lacking. These manifesto housebuilding targets are merely aspirational, and there is little evidence to suggest they will be delivered. UK politicians, if they are serious about solving the shortage of good quality homes, should adopt the forceful approach of Singapore.Sign up for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.

He continued to wield great political influence until 2011.Around 50 years ago, Singapore was little more than an impoverished swampy island with 1.6 million inhabitants and virtually no natural resources. Now, with a population of 5.5 million, it has been transformed into the envy of the world.The statistics speak for themselves. Unemployment is just 2%, Singapore is third in the global education league, possibly the world\u2019s healthiest nation and 90% of Singaporeans own their own homes, which are mostly government built. Crime levels are almost the lowest in the world, it is one of the least corrupt nations and its streets, public transport and public places are clean. Related: Lee Kuan Yew funeral: pictures and reflections from Singaporeans Singapore is also the top country in which to do business. It has an almost perpetual government budget surplus of between 0 and 20% of gross domestic product and the 6th highest purchasing power [pdf] in the world, twice that of the UK.What a legacy for Lee Kuan Yew. He describes the factors underpinning Singapore\u2019s success in his book, From Third World to First, as wealth creation, huge investment in infrastructure, environment and leisure facilities, building quality homes instead of paying benefits and nurturing talent \u2013 as well as the Confucian principle that the family should take responsibility for its members.Wealth creation has focused on attracting investment and supporting local businesses. It keeps business taxation low, half that of the UK, and gives generous allowances to startups. Unlike the UK, employment laws favour the employer rather than the employee. Unlike the proliferation of bodies in the UK, one agency, International Enterprise, actively supports the establishment and development of new businesses and helps them become global. This was deliberate policy in the 1980s to turn Singapore into a financial centre.With the increasingly booming economies of south-east Asia and China on its doorstep, Singapore is well placed to make itself attractive to investors and it is seizing the opportunity to take advantage of those markets. Pharma group GlaxoSmithKline is the latest major business to decide to invest in a regional hub and Ila Technologies has just opened the world\u2019s largest diamond greenhouse.In 2013, Singapore spent 30 times more per head of population on infrastructure than the UK. Recent investment in leisure and tourism have seen the building of the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and the two largest climate-controlled greenhouses in the world. It has just announced plans to spend S$740m (\u00a3365m) in sprucing up Singapore\u2019s museums and galleries. Singapore is criticised for its tight controls on media and freedom of speech. Political and social stability in a diverse nation has been seen as vital to economic success and after some turmoil in the early 1960s and in neighbouring countries in the 1990s, Lee Kuan Yew decided that the western model of press freedom was potentially divisive.Singapore\u2019s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, has stated recently that the country is investing in the future for its children and grandchildren while older economies in the west are creating massive debt for them. As the son of Lee Kuan Yew, he must be a proud guardian of his father\u2019s legacy. Singapore is increasingly visited by UK politicians seeking inspiration.

It\u2019s called Home Farm, and it\u2019s a place where elderly residents grow their own vegetables \u2013 through vertical aquaponic farming and rooftop soil plantings \u2013 in the pursuit not only of more active, sociable lifestyles but also of income. In turn, as Christa Avampato writes in Seedstock, the project aims to strengthen Singapore\u2019s food security. Still, the architects have pre-empted potential criticism. \u201cHome Farm is not a forced seniors\u2019 labour camp,\u201d explains Stephen Pimbley of SPARK Architects, \u201cwe are simply presenting the opportunity for part-time work.\u201d Well, we\u2019re glad that\u2019s cleared up.For decades, industry in the Palestinian city of Hebron was dominated by one thing: shoes. In a photo gallery feature, Al Jazeera takes a look at the now-declining shoe industry in the city, meeting those who still work in it. \u201cIn the \u2018golden days\u2019, at least 35,000 people were working in more than 1,000 workshops across the city,\u201d writes Tareq Abu Felat. There are now only 300 workshops, open part-time, thanks to the mass importation of Chinese goods.Across South Africa, cities are still decorated with statues and monuments that stand as symbols of apartheid and colonialism. This week, however, saw the fall of one in Cape Town, as the statue of Cecil Rhodes was removed amid cheers and celebrations. Writing in Cape Town Partnership, Sibusiso Tshabalala and Nadine Botha present eight creative things to do with other remnants of the past. Their suggestions range from shrink-wrapping statues in neon pink \u2013 as took place last year in Bloemfontein \u2013 to projecting transformative animations or using paint to turn them into comic book characters. Poor Brussels. Its urban design is so ridiculed that the term \u201cBrusselisation\u201d is used to describe messy city planning around the world. But how did this happen? CityMetric looks into the city\u2019s poor planning past, characterised by its postwar tendency to demolish historic buildings, replace them with \u201cugly\u201d ones and add a whole lot of roads to the mix. As Frances Robinson explains, the chaotic nature of the city creates strong reactions among its citizens \u2013 but the results often form a humorous, valuable and illuminating commentary on life in Brussels.Over the last few years, Athens\u2019 city centre has fallen into decline, resulting in shut-up shops and buildings in disrepair. But a new regeneration plan is hoping to turn things around. As Feargus O\u2019Sullivan writes in CityLab, the \u201cReturn to Athens 2015-2020\u201d programme plans to refurbish 1,800 older buildings, replace cracked pavements and install better lighting in order to attract more tourists and locals back into the area. But is the programme ignoring the value of life in the city centre as it is? \u201cMuch of the area to be renovated already throbs, retaining exactly the sort of vibrancy residents of other cities look back to with longing.\u201dIs a retirement home urban farm a good idea?

The items will go on sale on Friday from the store\u2019s website and outlet in Singapore.Uniqlo says that the collection takes inspiration from an appreciation of diverse cultures and styles, with the headscarves made from thin, breathable material ideal for tropical climates.Tajima is a prolific British fashion blogger as well as being a designer and visual artist who converted to Islam aged 17 and went on to start her own label which specialised in stylish modest wear. Announcing the launch of the new range, she said: \u201cWe want to create a collection that not only appeals to modern ladies who prefer to dress modestly, but also an international audience who desire clothes that fit comfortably and look contemporary. My collection is specially designed to allow effortless mix and match for today\u2019s women to express their own style.\u201d Taku Morikawa, chief executive of Uniqlo Singapore, said: \u201cWe worked with Hana to determine what would be internationally appealing while keeping to the concept of modest wear.

It exploded across the internet last month, becoming the most discussed logic puzzle of recent years.The puzzle was written by Joseph Yeo Boon Wooi of Singapore\u2019s National Institute of Education, originally for a test paper in the Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad.Well, Dr Yeo has written a sequel and I\u2019m thrilled that he has given it to me for the launch of this series. A new character joins logic\u2019s most famous threesome. Enjoy!Albert, Bernard and Cheryl became friends with Denise, and they wanted to know when her birthday is.

He has also hidden a fun little nugget - what he calls an \u201cEaster egg\u201d - in this one. It is something purely mathematical.

More than half of them are thought to have been detained in China; four known cases involve smuggling methamphetamine, commonly known in Australia as ice. In 2014, China Daily reported that of 63 foreign drug-smuggling suspects detained by officials in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, 11 were Australian.Rao Jiyong, a deputy director at the city\u2019s anti-smuggling customs bureau, told the newspaper that drug-smuggling cases involving Australian suspects had rapidly increased over the past two years and cooperation had been strengthened with Australian federal police and customs officials.In 2013-14, more than a third of Australians in prison overseas were there because of drug offences. Countries which apply the death penalty on those convicted of using, dealing or trafficking drugs include Indonesia, Thailand, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.A dual New Zealand/Australian citizen, Gardner was arrested at Guangzhou airport, China, on 8 November 2014 after customs officials allegedly found 30kg of methamphetamine in his bags. Gardner\u2019s lawyer, Craig Tuck, confirmed with Guardian Australia his trial would begin on 7 May in Guangzhou\u2019s municipal intermediate court. \u201cThis is considerably earlier than expected,\u201d Tuck said. It is expected to last no more than two days.Sherrif and Jalloh were arrested by Chinese authorities at Guangzhou airport in June 2014, the ABC reported. Sherrif was sentenced to a suspended death penalty for attempting to smuggle methamphetamine from China to Australia, which could be commuted to life in prison after two years of good behaviour. Jalloh is awaiting trial.Australian jockey Bannister was arrested for drug smuggling in Guangzhou on 11 March 2014, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. More than 3kg of crystal methamphetamine were found in envelopes stuffed into eight handbags in his luggage. \u201cI do believe that I have been set up ... in this drug-smuggling scheme,\u201d Bannister told the court at his October trial. \u201cThey\u2019ve used me as a mule.\u201dHenry Chhin (China)Chhin, then 35 from Sydney, was detained by police in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on 10 May 2004 for attempting to mail 270g of methamphetamine to Australia, the Shenzhen Daily reported. The box, which allegedly contained the drugs and computer software, was intercepted by Shanghai police two days before. Local police said another 700g of the same drug was found in kitchen cabinets and the sitting room of Chhin\u2019s residence. He was given the death penalty with a two-year suspension in March 2005.A small group of foreign nationals have been executed in China, but none have been Australian. According to China.org.cn these include five Japanese, four South Koreans and a Pakistani-British businessman.Exposto, from Melbourne, was arrested on 7 December 2014 after arriving at Kuala Lumpur airport, en route from Shanghai to Melbourne, with a bag authorities said contained 1.5kg of crystal methamphetamine. Exposto\u2019s lawyer, Tania Scivetti, confirmed to Guardian Australia that a chemical analysis of the substance would be submitted to court on Thursday, after which the case would probably move to the high court for a May hearing. Malaysian law carries a mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking. Three Australian nationals have been executed by the state: Michael McAuliffe in 1993, and Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers in 1986.Pham Trung Dung, 37 (Vietnam)Dung was arrested in May 2013, when custom officials reportedly found heroin in his luggage as he boarded a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Australia, the Associated Press reported.

Continued refusal could ultimately result in the company being held to be in contempt of the Senate.Labor, Coalition and Greens members of the committee inquiring into corporate tax avoidance unanimously agreed that the company be forced to answer the questions \u2013 and denied BHP\u2019s claim that the information was commercial in confidence.The committee\u2019s chairman, Labor senator Sam Dastyari, said the unanimous view of the committee was that \u201cBHP\u2019s failure to give answers and basic information was far from satisfactory \u2026 and their arguments about it being commercial in confidence were undermined by Rio Tinto sitting beside them at the hearing and being prepared to give the same information\u201d.\u201cIt is completely unacceptable they are refusing to say how much the ATO has asked them to pay. No one will accept this. It beggars belief,\u201d said the Greens leader, Christine Milne.The independent senator Nick Xenophon said: \u201c \u2018The Big Australian\u2019 has now been revealed as the big chicken when it comes to being upfront with Australian taxpayers. How could this information about a possible tax liability not be relevant to BHP\u2019s continuous disclosure obligations to shareholders?\u201dThe president of corporate affairs for BHP Billiton, Tony Cudmore, confirmed that the operations of the company\u2019s Singapore-based marketing hub were being audited by theATO, but the company refused to say whether the ATO had given it an estimate of the tax it believed was owing, or how much the estimated bill might be.BHP\u2019s head of group tax, Jane Michie, said the company was in talks with the ATO about \u201cthe correct transfer pricing methodology regarding the sale of commodities to the Singapore hub \u2026 It comes down to pricing \u2026 have we priced the commodities we sell to Singapore correctly,\u201d she said.Asked whether the tax office had issued BHP with a position paper \u2013 in effect an assessment of the tax the ATO believes should be paid \u2013 Michie said: \u201cWe would prefer not to provide a running commentary regards where we are at ... we would prefer not to answer that question, thank you.\u201cWe firmly believe in the position we have adopted. The tax office can state what their position is, but we firmly believe in our position, so in that sense the tax office numbers are not really relevant to us,\u201d she said. Cudmore said: \u201cWe believe this is a competitively sensitive matter.\u201dRio Tinto revealed it had in the past been asked to pay extra tax in relation to its Singapore marketing operations and also declined to reveal how much, on commercial grounds.\u201cWe received a relatively modest assessment in relation to an early period \u2026 we approached the Australian tax office to ask for agreement in relation to our pricing \u2026 once we reached an agreement there was a small amount that needed to be paid and we have now paid that,\u201d said Rio Tinto\u2019s general manager of taxation, Ann-Maree Wolff.Rio\u2019s Australian managing director, Phil Edmands, also acknowledged his company\u2019s Singapore hub was being audited by the ATO, but said no \u201cposition paper\u201d had been received. Edmands told the inquiry the miner\u2019s Singapore hub made a $790m profit and paid a 5% tax rate in 2014.BHP refused to say how much profit it generated in Singapore or the tax rate it paid there, again citing commercial sensitivity.The Australian Financial Review has reported both companies were being pursued by the ATO over tax allegedly owed because they reported billions of dollars of profit in their Singapore \u201cmarketing hubs\u201d upon which they paid very low tax rates.Michie said BHP did not do \u201caggressive tax planning.

Yet a weakening economy and the fact that, for the first time, all the city-state\u2019s voters will be given a choice of who they want in power provides the greatest electoral test yet for the prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong.Also worrying for the 63-year-old leader is the fact that he will be facing the polls for the first time without his father, the first prime minister of Singapore, who transferred much legitimacy to his son after three decades as premier.Having transformed the impoverished island into an economic powerhouse, Lee Kuan Yew died in March aged 91. The younger Lee will be hoping his father\u2019s wide support base did not die with him.On Friday all of the 2.5 million registered voters in the south-east Asian country will be able to decide if they still support Lee\u2019s People\u2019s Action party (PAP), as opposition groups will contest all 89 seats. In 2006, only residents in 47 of 84 seats had a choice. Later, in the 2011 polls, resentment over housing prices, the cost of living and high immigration left the PAP \u2013 in power since independence 50 years ago \u2013 with a drop in votes. It still won 81 of 87 seats but secured only 60.1% of the overall vote, the lowest percentage in its history.With that in mind, Lee called a snap election last month, more than a year before the deadline for the next polls. Observers say he hoped to ride the ruling party\u2019s popularity boost after the country\u2019s birthday celebrations on 9 August.\u201cI called this general election to seek your mandate to take Singapore beyond SG50, into its next half-century,\u201d Lee, who has been premier since 2004, posted on Facebook. \u201cMore than that, you will be choosing the team to work with you for the next 15-20 years, and setting the direction for Singapore for the next 50 years.\u201dThe election department allowed only nine days of campaigning, the shortest legally allowed period. But the feelgood, national pride factor may be overshadowed by sagging economic growth. The government revised August GDP forecasts from 2-4% to 2-2.5%.The country of 5.5 million people has no natural resources and has relied on open immigration policies to provide cheap labour to support its global fame as a financial services hub and electronics manufacturer.Lee has had to balance public demands to reduce immigration into the cramped city-state. Tighter immigration policies have been partly blamed for the drop in growth forecasts.Andrew Wood, the Singapore-based head of Asia country risk analysis at BMI Research, said he expected \u201cthe PAP to achieve approximately the same share of the popular vote that it garnered in 2011, or around 60%\u201d.The PAP has been \u201cvery transparent about the fact that a slowdown in immigration inflows would blunt economic growth, and this is exactly what has transpired\u201d, he said. In Wood\u2019s view, the party has struck a good balance between answering the public calls to reduce the inflow while maintaining a healthy economy.\u201cHowever, conversing with many people on the ground, it is clear that not everyone is satisfied with the pace of the immigration cutbacks, and many will still prefer to pressure the PAP to tighten its immigration policies even further,\u201d Woods said.Another major issue, perhaps an indication of Singapore success, is a spate of public transport disruptions. Local research firm Blackbox found that overall satisfaction with the government declined 4% between April and July after train delays and shutdowns.Although both Lees have been criticised for hampering political opposition and independent media, Blackbox found that satisfaction for government accountability stood at 89%, with civil rights and free speech also high at 79%, suggesting these issues will not be top of the electorate\u2019s agenda.Still, social inequality is cited as a major issue for the 2015 polls and this is where the main opposition, the Workers\u2019 party, will want to grab seats \u2013 its candidates wear blue shirts to symbolise the party\u2019s connection to blue-collar workers.The group\u2019s leader, Low Thia Khiang, claims voters back the opposition to create an alternative to the PAP and has likened the ruling party to a sinking ship. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the cruise ship is over capacity limit. It used to be a luxury cruise ship. The designer claimed that it\u2019s not sinkable,\u201d he told reporters this month. \u201cThe name is Titanic.\u201dBut with only a handful of seats currently filled in parliament, the opposition\u2019s driving public strategy \u2013 despite its leader\u2019s vocal attacks \u2013 seems not to be an attempt to secure executive office but that Singapore needs a stronger opposing voice.Leon Perera, a Workers\u2019 party parliamentary candidate, told supporters at the weekend that the PAP expected the \u201cblind faith\u201d of voters. He said the Workers\u2019 party\u2019s vision was to lobby for a \u201cstrong responsible opposition\u201d.\u201cThis shows the danger of relying on one crushingly dominant party to steer this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is another model, my friends.

When W!ld Rice brought the play to Brisbane festival last week for three performances, it was warmly received by local audiences, and 120 years after it was first staged, Wilde\u2019s famous wit still sparkled like champagne.In an audience discussion after the show\u2019s Saturday matinee, director Glen Goei talked about the production\u2019s genesis. In 2007, Goei and the company\u2019s artistic director Ivan Heng (who also played Lady Bracknell) began a campaign with several friends to repeal section 377A of Singapore\u2019s penal code, which criminalises \u201cany act of gross indecency\u201d between consenting adult males.When they lost that battle, Goei was \u201cvery, very upset\u201d.

The Importance of Being Earnest was one of the last plays the British humorist completed before entering prison in 1897. He later died in Paris, destitute, following several years of poor health.Goei says homosexuality remains a taboo in Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for a young lesbian or homosexual teenager to come out because it\u2019s already been institutionalised as a crime,\u201d he says.Teen suicide rates in the LGBT community remain high, he adds , and without proper safe sex education, so do rates of HIV infection.\u201cWe live in Victorian times,\u201d says Heng. \u201cThe more and more we progress the more Victorian we come. We\u2019ve become so moralistic, so judgmental, so serious, so earnest, so boring, so hard-working.\u201dWith nationalism at fever pitch and Singapore recently celebrating 50 years since independence, Heng compares the ruling government to the character of Napoleon in George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm, telling the people every year \u201cwork, you must work harder\u201d and to \u201cserve your country, do this for the nation\u201d.\u201cAs a society gets wealthier and more affluent as Singapore has over the past few years, it becomes more conservative.

Apparently it\u2019s harder to recruit when the country comes out of recession, since the profession loses its risk-takers. It doesn\u2019t help one bit when the population insists on continuing to produce more children. Related: Shortage of teachers set to spark new schools crisis Yet those explanations are flimsy: the recession line is rather speculative, and relies on a conception of teaching as a cosy, stable, low-risk job for losers. This is a relatively recent caricature of the job, which was once more accurately understood as something people did if they cared about the future, other people\u2019s children and the life of the mind.The baby boom is real, yet doesn\u2019t explain why recruitment continues to fall \u2013 according to new figures, numbers starting training courses are 14% down on 2010 \u2013 and turnover continues to rise. There are far more obvious reasons for people to leave this profession or shun it in the first place \u2013 the work is too hard and the treatment is too unpleasant.It feels passe to listen to teachers\u2019 unions these days: the Department for Education wrote them off as dinosaurs, \u201cthe blob\u201d. Yet the unions have an inconvenient habit of making predictions that come to pass and delivering findings that are observable in the real world. In 2014, a survey by the National Union of Teachers found that 96.5% of teachers said the hours damaged their family life, and 90% had considered leaving in the previous two years.The teachers didn\u2019t see this as the unfortunate but necessary consequence of ambitious, muscular, take-no-prisoners education reforms: but rather, as the needless and iatrogenic effect of political meddling, in which amateurs with very little pedagogic experience blundered in with more and more targets, more and more stringently measured. Get a teacher on the subject of double-marking, and you will hear a near-perfect description of a job whose purpose has been completely subsumed by the bureaucratic structures made necessary by the assumption that everyone doing it is incompetent or lazy.The process of knowledge sharing is at the root of innovation in education and beyondWhen results are good, that is billed as \u201cparent power\u201d; when they\u2019re bad, that\u2019s because the school is \u201ccoasting\u201d. When a teacher is experienced and/or opinionated, the technical DfE term for that is \u201cburnt out\u201d. When the targets aren\u2019t met, that is definitely the fault of the school, and can in no way be put down to the fact the objective changed and the children didn\u2019t. An unrealistic goal is never named as such; rather, it\u2019s a \u201cchallenge\u201d, or it\u2019s \u201cmodern\u201d, or it\u2019s the way they do it in Singapore.\u201cGood\u201d doesn\u2019t mean good, it means, \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you outstanding?\u201d. There is no tolerance for the average and a constant striving for everyone to be above average \u2013 signalling, above all, a misunderstanding of what \u201caverage\u201d means. Parents are encouraged to think of their relationship to teachers as adversarial, with the sharp-elbowed monitoring results for signs of slippage; which signs are, of course, nothing to do with home life and only to do with the school. All of this is well-known, and I only recap it out of solidarity with teachers, who must sometimes read the coverage of their profession, the casual denigration of their skills, the way they are weighed and measured like meat and their motives and dedication constantly questioned, and think the world has gone mad.What would a nourishing system look like, beyond the obvious shift that it would start from an assumption of trust in and respect for the people working in it? Ofsted inspections, besides being often statistically nonsensical (it would take 60 hours of observation to get a reliable reading on the quality of a teacher) have, in the process of observation and quantification, laid waste to the far more valuable process of knowledge sharing that is at the root of innovation in education and beyond.Teachers who remember the pre-Ofsted days talk of more experienced staff from within the local authority coming to observe lessons \u2013 not to judge them, but to show them what they would do. A genuinely porous process in which both teachers would learn from one another, the children were tacitly understood to be part of it rather than \u201cservice users\u201d and the local authority operated not as the enforcer of standards \u2013 competent or otherwise \u2013 but as the broker of networks that improved understanding for everyone. Related: How London Challenge turned capital's schools around | Mike Tomlinson Teachers remain extremely good at building networks, even while all their incentives (even their pay in some cases is now related to results) are towards competing with colleagues and neighbouring schools, rather than collaborating with them. The success of the London Challenge, which transformed the performance of the capital\u2019s schools after its launch in 2003, was not a story about super-heads and troubleshooting and measurement, but one of skill-sharing and cooperation in the primary and secondary sector.Community schools continue to form\u00a0mutually supportive clusters. They\u00a0do this not because they\u2019re dinosaurs, or inherently left-wing, but because some people \u2013 especially the ones who think deeply and critically, who may be over-represented in this profession \u2013 understand instinctively that networks of trusting experts, working together towards the same goals, drive up standards.This has been noted repeatedly in the private sector; it was Silicon Valley\u2019s porousness, the cooperation between Xerox and Apple, the sharing of information and standardisation of connectivity, which drove excellence. The contrast is Boston\u2019s Route 128, which until the 80s was the other technology cluster: it was dominated by large corporations who jealously held on to staff, privileged loyalty over cross-pollination, put competition at the centre of their strategy and thereby consigned themselves to the stasis that was their undoing. By the end of the 80s the Massachusetts Miracle was over.Self-sufficiency is so often considered a precondition for competition, and competition itself held up as the driver of useful human endeavour; but in fact, this autarky drives nothing but the needless protection of one\u2019s own advantage, whether that\u2019s in the raw material of a skilled workforce, or the intellectual property of a graphical user interface; all these things will catch on faster, and become more useful to more people, if they are allowed to circulate.The analogy with schools is pretty clear: teachers, like any other bold professional innovators, will work best if they\u2019re allowed to work together. League tables, Ofsteds, all the artificial ways in which schools are pitted against each other, militate against this cooperation.Teachers mostly understand the grades for what they are, essentially measures of pupil affluence, unrelated to teaching quality; and yet they are still ground down by the relentless quantification. Teachers and parents would work much better in tandem, given that their ends are identical. The assumption of teaching as a network, rather than a bear pit of competing institutions, would obviate much of the measuring and marking that consumes a lot of their time and introduces so much tedium into what recently was a rewarding career. It wouldn\u2019t just be better for the teachers\u00a0themselves, it would be better for everyone.", "tags": ["Teaching", "Education", "Education policy", "Politics", "Ofsted", "UK news"], "title": "Our schools should be less like Singapore and more like Silicon Valley | Zoe Williams"},{"date": "2015-11-30T14:37:28Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Whether you have visited or not, there are plenty of images that come to mind when thinking of Singapore: soaring skyscrapers overlooking a magnificent harbour; charming colonial boulevards; colourful local cuisine and the rush of crowds filling its buzzing streets.

Set among the Southern Ridges, a 6 mile stretch of open green space on the tip of Singapore harbour, Hort Park offers visitors fantastic array of recreational and educational gardening activities, as well as a world-class garden retail centre.

Anyone can join free guided walks on weekends.Gardens by the BayFor those who like their nature a little more controlled, Gardens by the Bay makes for a fascinating day out. Don\u2019t expect untouched nature here, this is very much an attraction, with guided tours, audio tours and even an app. Be sure to visit the flower dome \u2013 the world\u2019s largest glass greenhouse is impressive on its own and the flora\u2019s pretty good too.Green CorridorA fascinating combination of nature and history, the Green Corridor was a railway retained by Malaysia on Singapore\u2019s independence in 1965. Returned to Singapore in 2010, residents campaigned to preserve it as a green space for the community and, once the rails were torn up and returned to Malaysia, the government allowed nature to take over.

Chinese and Japanese GardensCollectively known as Jurong Lake Gardens, the Chinese portion is modelled on the northern imperial style. The seven-storey pagoda is particularly striking, as is the Bridge of Double Beauty that links the garden to its Japanese neighbour. The Japanese side is designed to be more calming and, with fewer features, it stays true to the style of the Muromachi period (1336-1573) it is based on.Pulau Ubin islandOften called the last kampong (village) in Singapore, nature lovers could spend days on this beguiling island.

After, drop into Harry\u2019s Bar , or try one of Singapore\u2019s hip hideaways such as Bar Stories, Hopscotch, The Library or 28 Hong Kong Street, where world-famous mixologist Peter Chua mans the bar.

Most enclosures have hidden barriers or moats to keep their residents in, so you really do get the chance to feel close to the animals.Singapore Botanic GardensThese Unesco world heritage gardens are a treat for nature lovers. Check out more than 1,000 species of orchid in the National Orchid Garden, before tracking down the 47 heritage trees, not missing the giant Jelawai Jaha along Liane Road, which stands over 50 metres tall. A whole day is easily spent here.MacRitchie Nature Trail and Reservoir ParkImmerse yourself in nature at this underrated park, hiking the peaceful well-signposted trails and heading into the trees on the impressive canopy walk, which features a lofty suspension bridge. You\u2019ll see plenty of locals jogging or taking group classes and you can hire a kayak to get out on the water. Look out for monkeys \u2013 and don\u2019t feed them.

Set among the Southern Ridges, a 6 mile stretch of open green space on the tip of Singapore harbour, Hort Park offers visitors fantastic array of recreational and educational gardening activities, as well as a world-class garden retail centre.

As well as being home to a host of species year-round, from the vulnerable lesser adjutant to the blue-crowned hanging parrot, there are some 230 visiting species. The best time to catch the migratory birds refuelling on the mudflats is from September to March. Anyone can join free guided walks on weekends.Gardens by the BayFor those who like their nature a little more controlled, Gardens by the Bay makes for a fascinating day out. Don\u2019t expect untouched nature here, this is very much an attraction, with guided tours, audio tours and even an app. Be sure to visit the flower dome \u2013 the world\u2019s largest glass greenhouse is impressive on its own and the flora\u2019s pretty good too.Green CorridorA fascinating combination of nature and history, the Green Corridor was a railway retained by Malaysia on Singapore\u2019s independence in 1965. Returned to Singapore in 2010, residents campaigned to preserve it as a green space for the community and, once the rails were torn up and returned to Malaysia, the government allowed nature to take over. Today it\u2019s a unique place for a walk, and an unbeatably interesting route across the island. Night SafariThe world\u2019s first safari park for nocturnal animals will appeal not only to humans of a nocturnal persuasion, but to wildlife lovers of all stripes. This is home to more than 130 species, of which 38% are threatened. The 40-minute tram tour through the park\u2019s seven geographical zones is the perfect introduction before you strike off on one of the four walking trails. Chinese and Japanese GardensCollectively known as Jurong Lake Gardens, the Chinese portion is modelled on the northern imperial style. The seven-storey pagoda is particularly striking, as is the Bridge of Double Beauty that links the garden to its Japanese neighbour. The Japanese side is designed to be more calming and, with fewer features, it stays true to the style of the Muromachi period (1336-1573) it is based on.Pulau Ubin islandOften called the last kampong (village) in Singapore, nature lovers could spend days on this beguiling island.

Little more than a timber and attap (thatch) structure back in 1825, it gained its distinctive shape some 13 years later and has been a national monument since 1973. Come for a lively lunch or visit in the evening when local friends and families gather along \u2018satay street\u2019 to enjoy the variety of flavours of satay and local beer. Singapore food festivalFor 10 days in early July, Singapore gathers to celebrate all things edible. Events take place around the city and offer the chance to try everything from traditional staples and revivals of forgotten dishes to 21st-century takes on the classics and totally new concepts from young local chefs. You may even find yourself involved in a world record \u2013 in 2015, chefs at Suvai, an Indian food event, used an 11-metre curry pot to set the record for largest cooking vessel.Sunday brunch at the Landing PointWant to get fancy? Singapore loves Sunday brunch and you\u2019ll find plenty of brunch buffets offering free-flowing champagne. Head to the legendary Fullerton Bay hotel for a sumptuous high tea at the Landing Point Lounge. Feast on dainty sandwiches, freshly made cakes and, naturally, scones with cream and jam. The views of the waterfront panorama will keep you occupied as you while away a relaxing afternoon and staff will replenish your platter as often as you clear it \u2013 so come hungry.Durian fruit in GeylangDurian fruit \u2018s pungent smell means that it\u2019s not permitted on the local MRT (Singapore\u2019s tube) and most hotels won\u2019t allow them within sniffing distance. Descriptions of the flavour range from chives, custard and garlic to caramel poured into whipped cream. Make up your own mind on a visit to one of the many durian fruit stalls in the area of Geylang. You will also be able to try other juicy fruit such as rambutans, longans and mangosteens with the people who truly love it.Fish head curryFish head curry is a Singaporean staple and if you ask locals where serves the best, you\u2019ll rarely find two people who agree. It mixes the spices of a typical South Indian curry with the head of a red snapper, while some mix in tamarind paste for a tinge of sourness, others add coconut milk for a creamier texture. Washed down with a glass of ice-cold lime juice, it\u2019s hard to beat. Join the crowds enjoying it at perennial favourite Muthu\u2019s Curry or try a curry that blends Indian and Eurasian flavours at Casa Bom Vento.Chinatown night marketAs darkness descends, Smith Street lurches into life in a whirlwind of woks, spices and noodles. The market\u2019s true extent takes in Pagoda Street, Trengganu Street and Sago Street as well as Smith Street and includes some 200 stalls. Many serve the classic Singapore dish of Hainanese chicken or be adventurous and order what looks and smells good. Makansutra at Gluttons by the BayNext door to the Esplanade Concert Hall, this is the perfect spot for a pre- or post-performance meal and there are stonking views across to the skyscrapers that make up Singapore\u2019s business district, winking their lights at you from across the bay. Try the nasi goreng (a dish with stir-fried rice) or a classic char kway teow (chicken noodles). Breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya ToastIf you like your kopi (coffee) strong, head here to kick off your day. The place is a favourite with locals, seen tucking into kaya toast; a buttery, coconut jam toast dipped into runny eggs topped up with soy sauce. It can be an acquired taste, but there\u2019s always the kopi to combat it.Spice challenge at Lagnaa Barefoot DiningLove Indian food? Don\u2019t miss Singapore\u2019s \u201cspice challenge\u201d. Pick your level from 1 (\u201cNot hot \u2013 anyone can\u201d) to \u201cSay your prayers\u201d (level 8) or even \u201cWe declare you king\u201d (level 10).

Level 3 (\u201cHotter \u2013 chef can\u2019t, can you?\u201d) was hot enough for me.Local food heroesFood in Singapore is always evolving so after sampling the best of its street food head to one of its many new and fashionable restaurants. Night owls with a sweet tooth should make a visit to the 2am Dessert Bar where you can enjoy a drink and eat sweet treats until late into the night.

Built by the British colonial government and completed in 1869, this palatial building makes for a fascinating tour.

For three weeks leading up to the actual day (8 February in 2016), the city is swathed in lucky red lanterns and you may well be stopped in your tracks by a lion dance.The Esplanade \u2013 Theatres on the BayThe locals may refer to them as \u201cthe big durians\u201d or the \u2018two microphones\u2019, which describes the world renowned performances at these theatres. Cameron Mackintosh\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables will run for a month from 29 May 2016 and, with a host of local and international artists playing throughout the year, there\u2019s bound to be a performance to excite your inner thespian.Ballet under the Stars (BUTS)BUTS takes place every year in July, and is intensely popular among locals. Tickets are usually released two months ahead of the performances and sell out fast, so keep an eye on the Singapore Dance Theatre Facebook page. You might want to take extra care when using the event hashtag: #iloveBUTS.National GallerySome 10 years in the making, Singapore\u2019s National Gallery finally opened its doors in November 2015. Housed in the former supreme court building and city hall, it hosts a whopping 8,000 artworks, making it the world\u2019s largest collection of Singaporean and south-east Asian art. The gallery also hosts international travelling exhibitions, so check the website for what\u2019s on. ARTStage SingaporeRun by former Art Basel director Lorenzo Rudolf, ARTStage Singapore is arguably the leading art fair in Asia, attracting many of the world\u2019s top gallerists, curators and private collectors.

There is the show, where fantasies are created and characters live larger than life. But when the curtains come down, another reality takes over backstage. Performers remove their make up and revert to a life more ordinary but no less significant. A day in my life in Singapore involves moving between the backstage and onstage personas of the country.I begin my day with a roti prata (Indian dough pancake) or runny soft boiled eggs and toast with kaya (coconut jam). These breakfast staples are quintessentially Singaporean. Taste these local delights at hawker centres where you can tuck in not only to the scrumptuous chow, but also the garrulous cacophony of the people. Hawker centres are not just about food, they are a microcosm of Singaporean society. Beside the endearing auntie or uncle will sit the over achieving graduate wolfing down his breakfast before heading off to work. After a long day, people find solace in these fluorescent illuminated eateries with a cup of teh tarik (pulled tea). The experience does not get more local than this. A quick train ride whisks me away from the familiar energy of the heartlands into the bustle of downtown Singapore. Here, the landmarks of our British colonial past sit beside gleaming office towers and have become the visual representation of Singapore\u2019s onstage persona \u2013 proud, shiny, aspirational. Visit the newest public museum to be opened, National Gallery Singapore, which is housed in newly restored buildings, formerly the City Hall and Supreme Court. Nearby are the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Victoria Concert Hall. Further down the river is the Esplanade Theatres By The Bay. The venue, with it iconic spiky roofs, is where many go to engage with the performing arts at all levels, from chilling out at free concerts at the outdoor theatre, to dressing up to the nines to watch the English National Ballet at the plush 2000-seat main theatre. Apart from these more widely publicised art and cultural institutions, there is also the local independent creative scene. It is a small scene but thanks to social media there is an increased momentum in the industry. A lot of these shops, collectives and galleries are found in quaint cultural districts such as my personal favourite, Little India. From poetry collection launches in quaint bookshops to dance parties organised in abandoned country clubs, the creatives based in Singapore offer up alternative view points to the more visible grand narrative of this young country.Encountering this much art in a day requires me to reflect on the things I have seen. Fortunately, this small island nation has numerous pockets of green sanctuaries all over theplace. Relatively untouched by urban development, these tranquil green spaces provide not only physical but also much needed emotional and psychological space, a stark contrast to the sensory onslaught of a restless country always on the move.As the setting sun casts its orange glow over the island, I make my way back into the sprawling urban landscape and prepare myself for a fun night out. Heading down to the adjacent districts of Ann Siang Hill, Club Street and Tanjong Pagar dressed in my hippest threads, I meet up with old friends over good food in some of the trendiest joints in town. These places serve the latest nosh in chic settings. As the evening wears on, the energy of the crowds spilling on to the streets becomes palpable. If my feet get itchy, I usually head down to Kyo, a basement club that cranks up the volume on the more progressive aspects of techno and house music, providing an electrifying end to my day.", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "24 hours in Singapore: culture, nightlife and green spaces"},{"date": "2015-11-30T14:37:28Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Whether you have visited or not, there are plenty of images that come to mind when thinking of Singapore: soaring skyscrapers overlooking a magnificent harbour; charming colonial boulevards; colourful local cuisine and the rush of crowds filling its buzzing streets.

Most enclosures have hidden barriers or moats to keep their residents in, so you really do get the chance to feel close to the animals.Singapore Botanic GardensThese Unesco world heritage gardens are a treat for nature lovers. Check out more than 1,000 species of orchid in the National Orchid Garden, before tracking down the 47 heritage trees, not missing the giant Jelawai Jaha along Liane Road, which stands over 50 metres tall. A whole day is easily spent here.MacRitchie Nature Trail and Reservoir ParkImmerse yourself in nature at this underrated park, hiking the peaceful well-signposted trails and heading into the trees on the impressive canopy walk, which features a lofty suspension bridge. You\u2019ll see plenty of locals jogging or taking group classes and you can hire a kayak to get out on the water. Look out for monkeys \u2013 and don\u2019t feed them.

As well as being home to a host of species year-round, from the vulnerable lesser adjutant to the blue-crowned hanging parrot, there are some 230 visiting species. The best time to catch the migratory birds refuelling on the mudflats is from September to March. Anyone can join free guided walks on weekends.Gardens by the BayFor those who like their nature a little more controlled, Gardens by the Bay makes for a fascinating day out. Don\u2019t expect untouched nature here, this is very much an attraction, with guided tours, audio tours and even an app. Be sure to visit the flower dome \u2013 the world\u2019s largest glass greenhouse is impressive on its own and the flora\u2019s pretty good too.Green CorridorA fascinating combination of nature and history, the Green Corridor was a railway retained by Malaysia on Singapore\u2019s independence in 1965. Returned to Singapore in 2010, residents campaigned to preserve it as a green space for the community and, once the rails were torn up and returned to Malaysia, the government allowed nature to take over. Today it\u2019s a unique place for a walk, and an unbeatably interesting route across the island. Night SafariThe world\u2019s first safari park for nocturnal animals will appeal not only to humans of a nocturnal persuasion, but to wildlife lovers of all stripes. This is home to more than 130 species, of which 38% are threatened. The 40-minute tram tour through the park\u2019s seven geographical zones is the perfect introduction before you strike off on one of the four walking trails. Chinese and Japanese GardensCollectively known as Jurong Lake Gardens, the Chinese portion is modelled on the northern imperial style. The seven-storey pagoda is particularly striking, as is the Bridge of Double Beauty that links the garden to its Japanese neighbour. The Japanese side is designed to be more calming and, with fewer features, it stays true to the style of the Muromachi period (1336-1573) it is based on.Pulau Ubin islandOften called the last kampong (village) in Singapore, nature lovers could spend days on this beguiling island. The Chek Jawa wetlands are a major draw, with the largest intertidal flat in northern Singapore surrounded by coastal forest and mangroves.

Little more than a timber and attap (thatch) structure back in 1825, it gained its distinctive shape some 13 years later and has been a national monument since 1973. Come for a lively lunch or visit in the evening when local friends and families gather along \u2018satay street\u2019 to enjoy the variety of flavours of satay and local beer. Singapore food festivalFor 10 days in early July, Singapore gathers to celebrate all things edible. Events take place around the city and offer the chance to try everything from traditional staples and revivals of forgotten dishes to 21st-century takes on the classics and totally new concepts from young local chefs. You may even find yourself involved in a world record \u2013 in 2015, chefs at Suvai, an Indian food event, used an 11-metre curry pot to set the record for largest cooking vessel.Sunday brunch at the Landing PointWant to get fancy? Singapore loves Sunday brunch and you\u2019ll find plenty of brunch buffets offering free-flowing champagne. Head to the legendary Fullerton Bay hotel for a sumptuous high tea at the Landing Point Lounge. Feast on dainty sandwiches, freshly made cakes and, naturally, scones with cream and jam. The views of the waterfront panorama will keep you occupied as you while away a relaxing afternoon and staff will replenish your platter as often as you clear it \u2013 so come hungry.Durian fruit in GeylangDurian fruit \u2018s pungent smell means that it\u2019s not permitted on the local MRT (Singapore\u2019s tube) and most hotels won\u2019t allow them within sniffing distance. Descriptions of the flavour range from chives, custard and garlic to caramel poured into whipped cream. Make up your own mind on a visit to one of the many durian fruit stalls in the area of Geylang. You will also be able to try other juicy fruit such as rambutans, longans and mangosteens with the people who truly love it.Fish head curryFish head curry is a Singaporean staple and if you ask locals where serves the best, you\u2019ll rarely find two people who agree. It mixes the spices of a typical South Indian curry with the head of a red snapper, while some mix in tamarind paste for a tinge of sourness, others add coconut milk for a creamier texture. Washed down with a glass of ice-cold lime juice, it\u2019s hard to beat. Join the crowds enjoying it at perennial favourite Muthu\u2019s Curry or try a curry that blends Indian and Eurasian flavours at Casa Bom Vento.Chinatown night marketAs darkness descends, Smith Street lurches into life in a whirlwind of woks, spices and noodles. The market\u2019s true extent takes in Pagoda Street, Trengganu Street and Sago Street as well as Smith Street and includes some 200 stalls. Many serve the classic Singapore dish of Hainanese chicken or be adventurous and order what looks and smells good. Makansutra at Gluttons by the BayNext door to the Esplanade Concert Hall, this is the perfect spot for a pre- or post-performance meal and there are stonking views across to the skyscrapers that make up Singapore\u2019s business district, winking their lights at you from across the bay. Try the nasi goreng (a dish with stir-fried rice) or a classic char kway teow (chicken noodles). Breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya ToastIf you like your kopi (coffee) strong, head here to kick off your day. The place is a favourite with locals, seen tucking into kaya toast; a buttery, coconut jam toast dipped into runny eggs topped up with soy sauce. It can be an acquired taste, but there\u2019s always the kopi to combat it.Spice challenge at Lagnaa Barefoot DiningLove Indian food? Don\u2019t miss Singapore\u2019s \u201cspice challenge\u201d. Pick your level from 1 (\u201cNot hot \u2013 anyone can\u201d) to \u201cSay your prayers\u201d (level 8) or even \u201cWe declare you king\u201d (level 10).

Level 3 (\u201cHotter \u2013 chef can\u2019t, can you?\u201d) was hot enough for me.Local food heroesFood in Singapore is always evolving so after sampling the best of its street food head to one of its many new and fashionable restaurants. Night owls with a sweet tooth should make a visit to the 2am Dessert Bar where you can enjoy a drink and eat sweet treats until late into the night.

Singapore international festival of arts (SIFA)Whatever kind of art you have a passion for SIFA is sure to have it in spades, with over a month of activities (during August and September) from theatre and dance to music and visual arts. Now running for three decades, SIFA is one of the most significant arts events in Asia and worth planning your trip around.The IstanaOn five days of the year, the Istana (the president\u2019s official residence) is open to visitors. Built by the British colonial government and completed in 1869, this palatial building makes for a fascinating tour. Open days fall in February, May, July, August and November but the Sunday before National Day (in August) is the best option as you\u2019ll be able to watch the spectacular National Day fireworks in the evening too. Singapore FlyerFancy dinner at 165 metres up \u2013 and served by your own butler? The Premium Sky Dining package aboard the world\u2019s second tallest observation wheel gives you a 360\u00b0 view of Singapore\u2019s landmarks while you tuck into a four-course menu.

For three weeks leading up to the actual day (8 February in 2016), the city is swathed in lucky red lanterns and you may well be stopped in your tracks by a lion dance.The Esplanade \u2013 Theatres on the BayThe locals may refer to them as \u201cthe big durians\u201d or the \u2018two microphones\u2019, which describes the world renowned performances at these theatres. Cameron Mackintosh\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables will run for a month from 29 May 2016 and, with a host of local and international artists playing throughout the year, there\u2019s bound to be a performance to excite your inner thespian.Ballet under the Stars (BUTS)BUTS takes place every year in July, and is intensely popular among locals. Tickets are usually released two months ahead of the performances and sell out fast, so keep an eye on the Singapore Dance Theatre Facebook page. You might want to take extra care when using the event hashtag: #iloveBUTS.National GallerySome 10 years in the making, Singapore\u2019s National Gallery finally opened its doors in November 2015. Housed in the former supreme court building and city hall, it hosts a whopping 8,000 artworks, making it the world\u2019s largest collection of Singaporean and south-east Asian art.

There is the show, where fantasies are created and characters live larger than life. But when the curtains come down, another reality takes over backstage. Performers remove their make up and revert to a life more ordinary but no less significant. A day in my life in Singapore involves moving between the backstage and onstage personas of the country.I begin my day with a roti prata (Indian dough pancake) or runny soft boiled eggs and toast with kaya (coconut jam). These breakfast staples are quintessentially Singaporean. Taste these local delights at hawker centres where you can tuck in not only to the scrumptuous chow, but also the garrulous cacophony of the people. Hawker centres are not just about food, they are a microcosm of Singaporean society. Beside the endearing auntie or uncle will sit the over achieving graduate wolfing down his breakfast before heading off to work. After a long day, people find solace in these fluorescent illuminated eateries with a cup of teh tarik (pulled tea). The experience does not get more local than this. A quick train ride whisks me away from the familiar energy of the heartlands into the bustle of downtown Singapore. Here, the landmarks of our British colonial past sit beside gleaming office towers and have become the visual representation of Singapore\u2019s onstage persona \u2013 proud, shiny, aspirational. Visit the newest public museum to be opened, National Gallery Singapore, which is housed in newly restored buildings, formerly the City Hall and Supreme Court. Nearby are the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Victoria Concert Hall. Further down the river is the Esplanade Theatres By The Bay. The venue, with it iconic spiky roofs, is where many go to engage with the performing arts at all levels, from chilling out at free concerts at the outdoor theatre, to dressing up to the nines to watch the English National Ballet at the plush 2000-seat main theatre. Apart from these more widely publicised art and cultural institutions, there is also the local independent creative scene. It is a small scene but thanks to social media there is an increased momentum in the industry. A lot of these shops, collectives and galleries are found in quaint cultural districts such as my personal favourite, Little India. From poetry collection launches in quaint bookshops to dance parties organised in abandoned country clubs, the creatives based in Singapore offer up alternative view points to the more visible grand narrative of this young country.Encountering this much art in a day requires me to reflect on the things I have seen. Fortunately, this small island nation has numerous pockets of green sanctuaries all over theplace. Relatively untouched by urban development, these tranquil green spaces provide not only physical but also much needed emotional and psychological space, a stark contrast to the sensory onslaught of a restless country always on the move.As the setting sun casts its orange glow over the island, I make my way back into the sprawling urban landscape and prepare myself for a fun night out. Heading down to the adjacent districts of Ann Siang Hill, Club Street and Tanjong Pagar dressed in my hippest threads, I meet up with old friends over good food in some of the trendiest joints in town. These places serve the latest nosh in chic settings. As the evening wears on, the energy of the crowds spilling on to the streets becomes palpable. If my feet get itchy, I usually head down to Kyo, a basement club that cranks up the volume on the more progressive aspects of techno and house music, providing an electrifying end to my day.", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "24 hours in Singapore: culture, nightlife and green spaces"},{"date": "2015-12-07T16:06:40Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "\u201cThe best start to a day in Singapore is enjoying breakfast at Chin Mei Chin, an old school bakery on the famous East Coast Road. Walking in feels like going back to the 1950s. It is steeped in tradition; my parents took me there as a child. My favourite breakfast is coconut kaya toast and butter with a steaming cup of traditional Singaporean coffee, brewed through cloth to infuse the intensity and aroma. Although Singapore is small, it constantly surprises me. There are new experiences \u2013 and foods \u2013 to try every day. It\u2019s cheaper to eat out than cook at home and we work long hours, so everyone goes out in the evening. One of the best places to eat is at a hawker centre. There are more than 300 hawker centres (or food courts) in Singapore. They\u2019re all different, but affordable, with a variety of dishes. One of my favourites is black carrot cake, a savoury dish made with radish and eggs, then fried with dark soya sauce.All aboard the steamboatAnother favourite dish is the steamboat; families gather round a hot pot in the centre of the table and add their favourite raw ingredients to it. I love Nan Hwa Chong Fish Head Steamboat Corner on North Bridge Road. Or try sambal stingray for supper at a stall in Serangoon, a buzzy neighbourhood northeast of downtown. Sambal is a spicy chilli sauce homemade by the vendors and it tastes delicious with the soft stingray \u2013 a drizzle of lime and a bowl of white rice completes the meal.If you want to get off the beaten track, Singapore is easy, safe and affordable to travel around using the bus network, or you can explore on foot. English is spoken everywhere and all the signs are in four languages, including English. I\u2019d recommend taking a break from the busy city and visiting the farms in Lim Chu Kang. I enjoy eating a healthy lunch at Bollywood Veggies, packed with produce grown on the farm. You are surrounded by so much greenery, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re in another world.The cuisine in Singapore is international and Tamashii, a new Japanese restaurant, was recommended to me by a friend. It\u2019s a little hard to find, down a little alley and on the top floor, but it\u2019s well worth discovering. There is a huge display of ingredients imported directly from Japan. You choose your favourites and the chef cooks them in front of you - or you can tell the chef what your budget is and he will create a dish of the finest ingredients within that range.If you like to shop, head to Bugis, where you can pick up cheap clothes and accessories from the street market; or the Mustafa shopping centre in Little India is open 24 hours a day and sells everything you could imagine. Culture fans will appreciate the Singapore Art Museum and National Gallery Singapore, and Shuffle at Clarke Quay is my favourite place to listen to a mix of English and Chinese music by local bands.I always take visitors to Chinatown, which has intriguing pockets of history and some of the oldest temples in Singapore. You can sip tea whilst listening to Chinese opera and, in the pharmacies, pick up fresh Chinese herbs to help with any ailment. Another of my favourite places to take visitors is Katong. A residential area in the east, this is the home of the Peranakans. The Peranakans were early Chinese immigrants to the Malay Peninsula and they fused Chinese and Malaysian customs to create a rich and colourful culture. In Katong, you can visit traditional Peranakan shops and houses and eat the delicious fusion food; no visit to Katong is complete without trying a bowl of laksa. If you\u2019re planning a trip to Singapore, the summer is a great time to visit. The food festival takes place in July, with special events, menus and cooking classes. And August is very special as we celebrate our national day, with musical performances, a huge parade, special restaurant events and spectacular fireworks along the east coast.\u201d", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "24 hours in Singapore: food, shopping and culture"},{"date": "2015-11-30T14:37:28Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Whether you have visited or not, there are plenty of images that come to mind when thinking of Singapore: soaring skyscrapers overlooking a magnificent harbour; charming colonial boulevards; colourful local cuisine and the rush of crowds filling its buzzing streets.

With all that said, the important thing is to get down to detail and discover what Singapore really has to offer. Well, first up, it has plenty to offer your stomach. Head to Chinatown\u2019s night market or Gluttons Bay for spicy sambal stingray, coconut-based rendang curries and simple-looking chicken rice that always turns out to be more delicious than any you\u2019ve tasted before. Appetite sated (for now), dive into the city\u2019s Colonial Quarter, exploring Singapore\u2019s history through displays at the National Museum. Don\u2019t forget to stop by at the Long Bar at the Raffles Hotel. Here, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy a Singapore Sling at the place it was invented exactly 100 years ago by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon.Although it could be said that the British founded Singapore, the city\u2019s character is today thoroughly international. See this for yourself by walking through the town from Little India \u2013 with its Hindu and Buddhist temples \u2013 to Chinatown, where you\u2019ll find streets hung with red lanterns, locals playing Chinese checkers and having tea the traditional way. We dare you not to think in travel clich\u00e9s here \u2013 melting pot, city of contrasts, these hackneyed terms seem suddenly to make sense on this walk. Everybody knows that Singapore is great for shopping, so if you really want to flex those credit cards, try KEEPERS, a local designers\u2019 collective on Orchard Green for jewellers, bag-makers, perfumers and much more. Alternatively, head to the buzzy Haji Lane in the old Arab quarter for hip independent shops selling fashion and homewares.You\u2019re sure to be ready for more food by now, so why not dine on a true taste of Singapore - a fish-head curry? Bursting with flavours from the city\u2019s Chinese, Malaysian and Indian cuisines, this dish combines red snapper and a curry sauce, with the addition of coconut milk for creaminess and tamarind for a sweet-sour kick. As night falls, Singapore sheds its inhibitions and comes out to play. Rooftop drinking is the best way to start, with cocktails at 1-Altitude, the world\u2019s highest al fresco bar. After, drop into Harry\u2019s Bar , or try one of Singapore\u2019s hip hideaways such as Bar Stories, Hopscotch, The Library or 28 Hong Kong Street, where world-famous mixologist Peter Chua mans the bar. Try Chua\u2019s favourite cocktail, the Negroni \u2013 a heady mix of gin, vermouth and Gran Classico bitter. It\u2019s the perfect way to celebrate Singapore\u2019s 50th birthday.

The Mustafa Centre is home to numerous Indian shops and you\u2019ll find great restaurants nearby.Civic DistrictThis stately colonial quarter is where Singapore\u2019s British history is most apparent.

Chinese and Japanese GardensCollectively known as Jurong Lake Gardens, the Chinese portion is modelled on the northern imperial style. The seven-storey pagoda is particularly striking, as is the Bridge of Double Beauty that links the garden to its Japanese neighbour. The Japanese side is designed to be more calming and, with fewer features, it stays true to the style of the Muromachi period (1336-1573) it is based on.Pulau Ubin islandOften called the last kampong (village) in Singapore, nature lovers could spend days on this beguiling island. The Chek Jawa wetlands are a major draw, with the largest intertidal flat in northern Singapore surrounded by coastal forest and mangroves.

Little more than a timber and attap (thatch) structure back in 1825, it gained its distinctive shape some 13 years later and has been a national monument since 1973. Come for a lively lunch or visit in the evening when local friends and families gather along \u2018satay street\u2019 to enjoy the variety of flavours of satay and local beer. Singapore food festivalFor 10 days in early July, Singapore gathers to celebrate all things edible. Events take place around the city and offer the chance to try everything from traditional staples and revivals of forgotten dishes to 21st-century takes on the classics and totally new concepts from young local chefs. You may even find yourself involved in a world record \u2013 in 2015, chefs at Suvai, an Indian food event, used an 11-metre curry pot to set the record for largest cooking vessel.Sunday brunch at the Landing PointWant to get fancy? Singapore loves Sunday brunch and you\u2019ll find plenty of brunch buffets offering free-flowing champagne. Head to the legendary Fullerton Bay hotel for a sumptuous high tea at the Landing Point Lounge. Feast on dainty sandwiches, freshly made cakes and, naturally, scones with cream and jam. The views of the waterfront panorama will keep you occupied as you while away a relaxing afternoon and staff will replenish your platter as often as you clear it \u2013 so come hungry.Durian fruit in GeylangDurian fruit \u2018s pungent smell means that it\u2019s not permitted on the local MRT (Singapore\u2019s tube) and most hotels won\u2019t allow them within sniffing distance. Descriptions of the flavour range from chives, custard and garlic to caramel poured into whipped cream. Make up your own mind on a visit to one of the many durian fruit stalls in the area of Geylang. You will also be able to try other juicy fruit such as rambutans, longans and mangosteens with the people who truly love it.Fish head curryFish head curry is a Singaporean staple and if you ask locals where serves the best, you\u2019ll rarely find two people who agree. It mixes the spices of a typical South Indian curry with the head of a red snapper, while some mix in tamarind paste for a tinge of sourness, others add coconut milk for a creamier texture. Washed down with a glass of ice-cold lime juice, it\u2019s hard to beat. Join the crowds enjoying it at perennial favourite Muthu\u2019s Curry or try a curry that blends Indian and Eurasian flavours at Casa Bom Vento.Chinatown night marketAs darkness descends, Smith Street lurches into life in a whirlwind of woks, spices and noodles. The market\u2019s true extent takes in Pagoda Street, Trengganu Street and Sago Street as well as Smith Street and includes some 200 stalls. Many serve the classic Singapore dish of Hainanese chicken or be adventurous and order what looks and smells good. Makansutra at Gluttons by the BayNext door to the Esplanade Concert Hall, this is the perfect spot for a pre- or post-performance meal and there are stonking views across to the skyscrapers that make up Singapore\u2019s business district, winking their lights at you from across the bay. Try the nasi goreng (a dish with stir-fried rice) or a classic char kway teow (chicken noodles). Breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya ToastIf you like your kopi (coffee) strong, head here to kick off your day. The place is a favourite with locals, seen tucking into kaya toast; a buttery, coconut jam toast dipped into runny eggs topped up with soy sauce. It can be an acquired taste, but there\u2019s always the kopi to combat it.Spice challenge at Lagnaa Barefoot DiningLove Indian food? Don\u2019t miss Singapore\u2019s \u201cspice challenge\u201d. Pick your level from 1 (\u201cNot hot \u2013 anyone can\u201d) to \u201cSay your prayers\u201d (level 8) or even \u201cWe declare you king\u201d (level 10). Be sure to check out the wall of wooden clothes pegs on which diners write their names and levels to see if you can find anyone who took it to level 10. Level 3 (\u201cHotter \u2013 chef can\u2019t, can you?\u201d) was hot enough for me.Local food heroesFood in Singapore is always evolving so after sampling the best of its street food head to one of its many new and fashionable restaurants. Night owls with a sweet tooth should make a visit to the 2am Dessert Bar where you can enjoy a drink and eat sweet treats until late into the night. Alternatively head to the Mount Emily hotel to eat at Wild Rocket for Mod Sin (modern Singaporean) fusion cooking or go to Keng Eng Kee for hearty seafood dishes.", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "Top 10 foodie experiences in Singapore"},{"date": "2015-12-01T17:28:49Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Singapore Laneway festivalReturning to Singapore on 30 January 2016, this festival brings a heady mix of left-field electronica, punk, intelligent pop and boundary-pushing R&B.

Singapore international festival of arts (SIFA)Whatever kind of art you have a passion for SIFA is sure to have it in spades, with over a month of activities (during August and September) from theatre and dance to music and visual arts. Now running for three decades, SIFA is one of the most significant arts events in Asia and worth planning your trip around.The IstanaOn five days of the year, the Istana (the president\u2019s official residence) is open to visitors. Built by the British colonial government and completed in 1869, this palatial building makes for a fascinating tour. Open days fall in February, May, July, August and November but the Sunday before National Day (in August) is the best option as you\u2019ll be able to watch the spectacular National Day fireworks in the evening too. Singapore FlyerFancy dinner at 165 metres up \u2013 and served by your own butler? The Premium Sky Dining package aboard the world\u2019s second tallest observation wheel gives you a 360\u00b0 view of Singapore\u2019s landmarks while you tuck into a four-course menu. Alternatively, drink in the views along with the country\u2019s most famous cocktail in the Singapore Sling package.Chinese new yearSingapore is the only country outside of greater China where ethnic Chinese make up the majority of the population (76% in 2014) \u2013 so Chinese new year is a big deal here. For three weeks leading up to the actual day (8 February in 2016), the city is swathed in lucky red lanterns and you may well be stopped in your tracks by a lion dance.The Esplanade \u2013 Theatres on the BayThe locals may refer to them as \u201cthe big durians\u201d or the \u2018two microphones\u2019, which describes the world renowned performances at these theatres. Cameron Mackintosh\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables will run for a month from 29 May 2016 and, with a host of local and international artists playing throughout the year, there\u2019s bound to be a performance to excite your inner thespian.Ballet under the Stars (BUTS)BUTS takes place every year in July, and is intensely popular among locals. Tickets are usually released two months ahead of the performances and sell out fast, so keep an eye on the Singapore Dance Theatre Facebook page. You might want to take extra care when using the event hashtag: #iloveBUTS.National GallerySome 10 years in the making, Singapore\u2019s National Gallery finally opened its doors in November 2015. Housed in the former supreme court building and city hall, it hosts a whopping 8,000 artworks, making it the world\u2019s largest collection of Singaporean and south-east Asian art. The gallery also hosts international travelling exhibitions, so check the website for what\u2019s on. ARTStage SingaporeRun by former Art Basel director Lorenzo Rudolf, ARTStage Singapore is arguably the leading art fair in Asia, attracting many of the world\u2019s top gallerists, curators and private collectors.

There is the show, where fantasies are created and characters live larger than life. But when the curtains come down, another reality takes over backstage. Performers remove their make up and revert to a life more ordinary but no less significant. A day in my life in Singapore involves moving between the backstage and onstage personas of the country.I begin my day with a roti prata (Indian dough pancake) or runny soft boiled eggs and toast with kaya (coconut jam). These breakfast staples are quintessentially Singaporean. Taste these local delights at hawker centres where you can tuck in not only to the scrumptuous chow, but also the garrulous cacophony of the people. Hawker centres are not just about food, they are a microcosm of Singaporean society. Beside the endearing auntie or uncle will sit the over achieving graduate wolfing down his breakfast before heading off to work. After a long day, people find solace in these fluorescent illuminated eateries with a cup of teh tarik (pulled tea). The experience does not get more local than this. A quick train ride whisks me away from the familiar energy of the heartlands into the bustle of downtown Singapore. Here, the landmarks of our British colonial past sit beside gleaming office towers and have become the visual representation of Singapore\u2019s onstage persona \u2013 proud, shiny, aspirational. Visit the newest public museum to be opened, National Gallery Singapore, which is housed in newly restored buildings, formerly the City Hall and Supreme Court. Nearby are the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Victoria Concert Hall. Further down the river is the Esplanade Theatres By The Bay. The venue, with it iconic spiky roofs, is where many go to engage with the performing arts at all levels, from chilling out at free concerts at the outdoor theatre, to dressing up to the nines to watch the English National Ballet at the plush 2000-seat main theatre. Apart from these more widely publicised art and cultural institutions, there is also the local independent creative scene. It is a small scene but thanks to social media there is an increased momentum in the industry. A lot of these shops, collectives and galleries are found in quaint cultural districts such as my personal favourite, Little India. From poetry collection launches in quaint bookshops to dance parties organised in abandoned country clubs, the creatives based in Singapore offer up alternative view points to the more visible grand narrative of this young country.Encountering this much art in a day requires me to reflect on the things I have seen. Fortunately, this small island nation has numerous pockets of green sanctuaries all over theplace. Relatively untouched by urban development, these tranquil green spaces provide not only physical but also much needed emotional and psychological space, a stark contrast to the sensory onslaught of a restless country always on the move.As the setting sun casts its orange glow over the island, I make my way back into the sprawling urban landscape and prepare myself for a fun night out. Heading down to the adjacent districts of Ann Siang Hill, Club Street and Tanjong Pagar dressed in my hippest threads, I meet up with old friends over good food in some of the trendiest joints in town. These places serve the latest nosh in chic settings. As the evening wears on, the energy of the crowds spilling on to the streets becomes palpable. If my feet get itchy, I usually head down to Kyo, a basement club that cranks up the volume on the more progressive aspects of techno and house music, providing an electrifying end to my day.", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "24 hours in Singapore: culture, nightlife and green spaces"},{"date": "2015-12-07T16:06:40Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "\u201cThe best start to a day in Singapore is enjoying breakfast at Chin Mei Chin, an old school bakery on the famous East Coast Road. Walking in feels like going back to the 1950s. It is steeped in tradition; my parents took me there as a child. My favourite breakfast is coconut kaya toast and butter with a steaming cup of traditional Singaporean coffee, brewed through cloth to infuse the intensity and aroma. Although Singapore is small, it constantly surprises me. There are new experiences \u2013 and foods \u2013 to try every day. It\u2019s cheaper to eat out than cook at home and we work long hours, so everyone goes out in the evening. One of the best places to eat is at a hawker centre. There are more than 300 hawker centres (or food courts) in Singapore. They\u2019re all different, but affordable, with a variety of dishes. One of my favourites is black carrot cake, a savoury dish made with radish and eggs, then fried with dark soya sauce.All aboard the steamboatAnother favourite dish is the steamboat; families gather round a hot pot in the centre of the table and add their favourite raw ingredients to it. I love Nan Hwa Chong Fish Head Steamboat Corner on North Bridge Road. Or try sambal stingray for supper at a stall in Serangoon, a buzzy neighbourhood northeast of downtown. Sambal is a spicy chilli sauce homemade by the vendors and it tastes delicious with the soft stingray \u2013 a drizzle of lime and a bowl of white rice completes the meal.If you want to get off the beaten track, Singapore is easy, safe and affordable to travel around using the bus network, or you can explore on foot. English is spoken everywhere and all the signs are in four languages, including English. I\u2019d recommend taking a break from the busy city and visiting the farms in Lim Chu Kang. I enjoy eating a healthy lunch at Bollywood Veggies, packed with produce grown on the farm. You are surrounded by so much greenery, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re in another world.The cuisine in Singapore is international and Tamashii, a new Japanese restaurant, was recommended to me by a friend. It\u2019s a little hard to find, down a little alley and on the top floor, but it\u2019s well worth discovering. There is a huge display of ingredients imported directly from Japan. You choose your favourites and the chef cooks them in front of you - or you can tell the chef what your budget is and he will create a dish of the finest ingredients within that range.If you like to shop, head to Bugis, where you can pick up cheap clothes and accessories from the street market; or the Mustafa shopping centre in Little India is open 24 hours a day and sells everything you could imagine. Culture fans will appreciate the Singapore Art Museum and National Gallery Singapore, and Shuffle at Clarke Quay is my favourite place to listen to a mix of English and Chinese music by local bands.I always take visitors to Chinatown, which has intriguing pockets of history and some of the oldest temples in Singapore. You can sip tea whilst listening to Chinese opera and, in the pharmacies, pick up fresh Chinese herbs to help with any ailment. Another of my favourite places to take visitors is Katong. A residential area in the east, this is the home of the Peranakans. The Peranakans were early Chinese immigrants to the Malay Peninsula and they fused Chinese and Malaysian customs to create a rich and colourful culture. In Katong, you can visit traditional Peranakan shops and houses and eat the delicious fusion food; no visit to Katong is complete without trying a bowl of laksa. If you\u2019re planning a trip to Singapore, the summer is a great time to visit. The food festival takes place in July, with special events, menus and cooking classes. And August is very special as we celebrate our national day, with musical performances, a huge parade, special restaurant events and spectacular fireworks along the east coast.\u201d", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "24 hours in Singapore: food, shopping and culture"},{"date": "2015-12-01T17:28:04Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Singapore Art Museum (SAM)Singapore\u2019s first art museum houses a wide-ranging collection of contemporary and pop-art pieces from Singapore and south-east Asia.

The exhibition covering 50 great Peranakans who have shaped Singapore over the last two centuries is particularly enlightening.National Museum of SingaporeThe oldest museum in Singapore is housed in a Renaissance-style building dating back to 1849. Enter this treasure trove of Singaporean artefacts to learn the story of the city-state through its recently revamped permanent galleries. Numerous temporary exhibitions and events also take place here, including exhibitions in partnership with the British Museum.Thian Hock Keng templeOne of the oldest temples in Singapore, the brilliant green and bright red Thian Hock Keng is also one of the most important for the Hokkien (or Han Chinese) clan. Having completed the often-dangerous voyage to Singapore, Chinese immigrants would come to give thanks to Mazu (Goddess of the Sea) for their safe passage. Today, visitors wonder at how such an ornate structure was built without a single nail.Labrador ParkWandering through this tranquil park, serenaded by the Black-naped Oriole, it\u2019s hard to imagine the bristling gun-emplacements that were to defend southern Singapore from Japanese attack. Unfortunately for the British, the Japanese came from the north, so the \u201cimpenetrable\u201d Fort Pasir Panjang saw little action. Today artillery pieces and machine gun posts can still be seen waiting for the enemy that came round the back.Changi MuseumThis emotive museum looks at the second world war through the lens of those incarcerated in the Changi area from 1942, when Singapore fell to the Japanese, to 1945, when the war ended. The murals painted by Bombardier Stanley Warren during the war are particularly interesting \u2013 he even returned after the war to restore his work.Haw Par Villa Haw Par Villa is not your average theme park. Built in 1937 by the brothers behind Tiger Balm ointment, the free-to-enter park is home to over vivid 1,000 statues and 150 giant dioramas depicting Chinese folklore, history and Confucianism, making it the perfect place to immerse yourself in Chinese culture and morality.Sri Veeramakaliamman templeDedicated to the Hindu goddess Sri Veeramakaliamman (or Kali), this fabulously ornate Hindu temple is a jaw-dropping example of traditional Indian carving. Kali is the destroyer of evil and is depicted in this temple wearing a garland of skulls and ripping out the insides of her victims. There are four puja (prayer) sessions each day, when the temple is busiest.Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM)Pleasantly situated on the Singapore river, the ACM is dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage of Asia, especially the ancestral cultures of Singaporeans. The permanent collection includes hundreds of ancient artefacts, from ancient silks to 4th-century sculpture, while in November 2015 the new Kwek Hong Png wing opened to expand display space for Chinese art from Fujian province.Raffles hotelNo visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to Raffles. The very epitome of colonial grandeur, this grande dame hosts a small museum dedicated to her history, as well as the Tiffin room for opulent high teas. Top reason to come though is the beautiful Long Bar where the Singapore Sling was created one hundred years ago. And if the Sling ain\u2019t your thing, try the potent Million Dollar cocktail instead.

Don\u2019t forget to stop by at the Long Bar at the Raffles Hotel. Here, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy a Singapore Sling at the place it was invented exactly 100 years ago by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon.Although it could be said that the British founded Singapore, the city\u2019s character is today thoroughly international. See this for yourself by walking through the town from Little India \u2013 with its Hindu and Buddhist temples \u2013 to Chinatown, where you\u2019ll find streets hung with red lanterns, locals playing Chinese checkers and having tea the traditional way. We dare you not to think in travel clich\u00e9s here \u2013 melting pot, city of contrasts, these hackneyed terms seem suddenly to make sense on this walk. Everybody knows that Singapore is great for shopping, so if you really want to flex those credit cards, try KEEPERS, a local designers\u2019 collective on Orchard Green for jewellers, bag-makers, perfumers and much more. Alternatively, head to the buzzy Haji Lane in the old Arab quarter for hip independent shops selling fashion and homewares.You\u2019re sure to be ready for more food by now, so why not dine on a true taste of Singapore - a fish-head curry? Bursting with flavours from the city\u2019s Chinese, Malaysian and Indian cuisines, this dish combines red snapper and a curry sauce, with the addition of coconut milk for creaminess and tamarind for a sweet-sour kick. As night falls, Singapore sheds its inhibitions and comes out to play. Rooftop drinking is the best way to start, with cocktails at 1-Altitude, the world\u2019s highest al fresco bar. After, drop into Harry\u2019s Bar , or try one of Singapore\u2019s hip hideaways such as Bar Stories, Hopscotch, The Library or 28 Hong Kong Street, where world-famous mixologist Peter Chua mans the bar. Try Chua\u2019s favourite cocktail, the Negroni \u2013 a heady mix of gin, vermouth and Gran Classico bitter. It\u2019s the perfect way to celebrate Singapore\u2019s 50th birthday.

Temples and mosques abound, with the Abdul Gafoor mosque a particularly interesting mix of Islamic and European architecture. The Mustafa Centre is home to numerous Indian shops and you\u2019ll find great restaurants nearby.Civic DistrictThis stately colonial quarter is where Singapore\u2019s British history is most apparent. In buildings that once housed City Hall and the Supreme Court you can now see the world\u2019s leading public collection of modern art from Singapore and south-east Asia in the newly opened National Gallery Singapore. Take a look at the nearby neo-gothic chapel of St Andrew\u2019s Cathedral, the Victorian town hall and the creamy stone of Old Parliament House before strolling along Stamford Road to the Esplanade Theatres and Gardens by the Bay.

The Japanese side is designed to be more calming and, with fewer features, it stays true to the style of the Muromachi period (1336-1573) it is based on.Pulau Ubin islandOften called the last kampong (village) in Singapore, nature lovers could spend days on this beguiling island. The Chek Jawa wetlands are a major draw, with the largest intertidal flat in northern Singapore surrounded by coastal forest and mangroves.

Little more than a timber and attap (thatch) structure back in 1825, it gained its distinctive shape some 13 years later and has been a national monument since 1973. Come for a lively lunch or visit in the evening when local friends and families gather along \u2018satay street\u2019 to enjoy the variety of flavours of satay and local beer. Singapore food festivalFor 10 days in early July, Singapore gathers to celebrate all things edible. Events take place around the city and offer the chance to try everything from traditional staples and revivals of forgotten dishes to 21st-century takes on the classics and totally new concepts from young local chefs. You may even find yourself involved in a world record \u2013 in 2015, chefs at Suvai, an Indian food event, used an 11-metre curry pot to set the record for largest cooking vessel.Sunday brunch at the Landing PointWant to get fancy? Singapore loves Sunday brunch and you\u2019ll find plenty of brunch buffets offering free-flowing champagne. Head to the legendary Fullerton Bay hotel for a sumptuous high tea at the Landing Point Lounge. Feast on dainty sandwiches, freshly made cakes and, naturally, scones with cream and jam. The views of the waterfront panorama will keep you occupied as you while away a relaxing afternoon and staff will replenish your platter as often as you clear it \u2013 so come hungry.Durian fruit in GeylangDurian fruit \u2018s pungent smell means that it\u2019s not permitted on the local MRT (Singapore\u2019s tube) and most hotels won\u2019t allow them within sniffing distance. Descriptions of the flavour range from chives, custard and garlic to caramel poured into whipped cream. Make up your own mind on a visit to one of the many durian fruit stalls in the area of Geylang. You will also be able to try other juicy fruit such as rambutans, longans and mangosteens with the people who truly love it.Fish head curryFish head curry is a Singaporean staple and if you ask locals where serves the best, you\u2019ll rarely find two people who agree. It mixes the spices of a typical South Indian curry with the head of a red snapper, while some mix in tamarind paste for a tinge of sourness, others add coconut milk for a creamier texture. Washed down with a glass of ice-cold lime juice, it\u2019s hard to beat. Join the crowds enjoying it at perennial favourite Muthu\u2019s Curry or try a curry that blends Indian and Eurasian flavours at Casa Bom Vento.Chinatown night marketAs darkness descends, Smith Street lurches into life in a whirlwind of woks, spices and noodles. The market\u2019s true extent takes in Pagoda Street, Trengganu Street and Sago Street as well as Smith Street and includes some 200 stalls. Many serve the classic Singapore dish of Hainanese chicken or be adventurous and order what looks and smells good. Makansutra at Gluttons by the BayNext door to the Esplanade Concert Hall, this is the perfect spot for a pre- or post-performance meal and there are stonking views across to the skyscrapers that make up Singapore\u2019s business district, winking their lights at you from across the bay. Try the nasi goreng (a dish with stir-fried rice) or a classic char kway teow (chicken noodles). Breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya ToastIf you like your kopi (coffee) strong, head here to kick off your day. The place is a favourite with locals, seen tucking into kaya toast; a buttery, coconut jam toast dipped into runny eggs topped up with soy sauce. It can be an acquired taste, but there\u2019s always the kopi to combat it.Spice challenge at Lagnaa Barefoot DiningLove Indian food? Don\u2019t miss Singapore\u2019s \u201cspice challenge\u201d. Pick your level from 1 (\u201cNot hot \u2013 anyone can\u201d) to \u201cSay your prayers\u201d (level 8) or even \u201cWe declare you king\u201d (level 10).

Night owls with a sweet tooth should make a visit to the 2am Dessert Bar where you can enjoy a drink and eat sweet treats until late into the night.

Singapore international festival of arts (SIFA)Whatever kind of art you have a passion for SIFA is sure to have it in spades, with over a month of activities (during August and September) from theatre and dance to music and visual arts. Now running for three decades, SIFA is one of the most significant arts events in Asia and worth planning your trip around.The IstanaOn five days of the year, the Istana (the president\u2019s official residence) is open to visitors. Built by the British colonial government and completed in 1869, this palatial building makes for a fascinating tour. Open days fall in February, May, July, August and November but the Sunday before National Day (in August) is the best option as you\u2019ll be able to watch the spectacular National Day fireworks in the evening too. Singapore FlyerFancy dinner at 165 metres up \u2013 and served by your own butler? The Premium Sky Dining package aboard the world\u2019s second tallest observation wheel gives you a 360\u00b0 view of Singapore\u2019s landmarks while you tuck into a four-course menu.

For three weeks leading up to the actual day (8 February in 2016), the city is swathed in lucky red lanterns and you may well be stopped in your tracks by a lion dance.The Esplanade \u2013 Theatres on the BayThe locals may refer to them as \u201cthe big durians\u201d or the \u2018two microphones\u2019, which describes the world renowned performances at these theatres. Cameron Mackintosh\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables will run for a month from 29 May 2016 and, with a host of local and international artists playing throughout the year, there\u2019s bound to be a performance to excite your inner thespian.Ballet under the Stars (BUTS)BUTS takes place every year in July, and is intensely popular among locals. Tickets are usually released two months ahead of the performances and sell out fast, so keep an eye on the Singapore Dance Theatre Facebook page. You might want to take extra care when using the event hashtag: #iloveBUTS.National GallerySome 10 years in the making, Singapore\u2019s National Gallery finally opened its doors in November 2015. Housed in the former supreme court building and city hall, it hosts a whopping 8,000 artworks, making it the world\u2019s largest collection of Singaporean and south-east Asian art. The gallery also hosts international travelling exhibitions, so check the website for what\u2019s on. ARTStage SingaporeRun by former Art Basel director Lorenzo Rudolf, ARTStage Singapore is arguably the leading art fair in Asia, attracting many of the world\u2019s top gallerists, curators and private collectors.

There is the show, where fantasies are created and characters live larger than life. But when the curtains come down, another reality takes over backstage. Performers remove their make up and revert to a life more ordinary but no less significant. A day in my life in Singapore involves moving between the backstage and onstage personas of the country.I begin my day with a roti prata (Indian dough pancake) or runny soft boiled eggs and toast with kaya (coconut jam). These breakfast staples are quintessentially Singaporean. Taste these local delights at hawker centres where you can tuck in not only to the scrumptuous chow, but also the garrulous cacophony of the people. Hawker centres are not just about food, they are a microcosm of Singaporean society. Beside the endearing auntie or uncle will sit the over achieving graduate wolfing down his breakfast before heading off to work. After a long day, people find solace in these fluorescent illuminated eateries with a cup of teh tarik (pulled tea). The experience does not get more local than this. A quick train ride whisks me away from the familiar energy of the heartlands into the bustle of downtown Singapore. Here, the landmarks of our British colonial past sit beside gleaming office towers and have become the visual representation of Singapore\u2019s onstage persona \u2013 proud, shiny, aspirational. Visit the newest public museum to be opened, National Gallery Singapore, which is housed in newly restored buildings, formerly the City Hall and Supreme Court. Nearby are the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Victoria Concert Hall. Further down the river is the Esplanade Theatres By The Bay. The venue, with it iconic spiky roofs, is where many go to engage with the performing arts at all levels, from chilling out at free concerts at the outdoor theatre, to dressing up to the nines to watch the English National Ballet at the plush 2000-seat main theatre. Apart from these more widely publicised art and cultural institutions, there is also the local independent creative scene. It is a small scene but thanks to social media there is an increased momentum in the industry. A lot of these shops, collectives and galleries are found in quaint cultural districts such as my personal favourite, Little India. From poetry collection launches in quaint bookshops to dance parties organised in abandoned country clubs, the creatives based in Singapore offer up alternative view points to the more visible grand narrative of this young country.Encountering this much art in a day requires me to reflect on the things I have seen. Fortunately, this small island nation has numerous pockets of green sanctuaries all over theplace. Relatively untouched by urban development, these tranquil green spaces provide not only physical but also much needed emotional and psychological space, a stark contrast to the sensory onslaught of a restless country always on the move.As the setting sun casts its orange glow over the island, I make my way back into the sprawling urban landscape and prepare myself for a fun night out. Heading down to the adjacent districts of Ann Siang Hill, Club Street and Tanjong Pagar dressed in my hippest threads, I meet up with old friends over good food in some of the trendiest joints in town. These places serve the latest nosh in chic settings. As the evening wears on, the energy of the crowds spilling on to the streets becomes palpable. If my feet get itchy, I usually head down to Kyo, a basement club that cranks up the volume on the more progressive aspects of techno and house music, providing an electrifying end to my day.", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "24 hours in Singapore: culture, nightlife and green spaces"},{"date": "2015-12-07T16:06:40Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "\u201cThe best start to a day in Singapore is enjoying breakfast at Chin Mei Chin, an old school bakery on the famous East Coast Road. Walking in feels like going back to the 1950s. It is steeped in tradition; my parents took me there as a child. My favourite breakfast is coconut kaya toast and butter with a steaming cup of traditional Singaporean coffee, brewed through cloth to infuse the intensity and aroma. Although Singapore is small, it constantly surprises me. There are new experiences \u2013 and foods \u2013 to try every day. It\u2019s cheaper to eat out than cook at home and we work long hours, so everyone goes out in the evening. One of the best places to eat is at a hawker centre. There are more than 300 hawker centres (or food courts) in Singapore. They\u2019re all different, but affordable, with a variety of dishes. One of my favourites is black carrot cake, a savoury dish made with radish and eggs, then fried with dark soya sauce.All aboard the steamboatAnother favourite dish is the steamboat; families gather round a hot pot in the centre of the table and add their favourite raw ingredients to it. I love Nan Hwa Chong Fish Head Steamboat Corner on North Bridge Road. Or try sambal stingray for supper at a stall in Serangoon, a buzzy neighbourhood northeast of downtown. Sambal is a spicy chilli sauce homemade by the vendors and it tastes delicious with the soft stingray \u2013 a drizzle of lime and a bowl of white rice completes the meal.If you want to get off the beaten track, Singapore is easy, safe and affordable to travel around using the bus network, or you can explore on foot. English is spoken everywhere and all the signs are in four languages, including English. I\u2019d recommend taking a break from the busy city and visiting the farms in Lim Chu Kang. I enjoy eating a healthy lunch at Bollywood Veggies, packed with produce grown on the farm. You are surrounded by so much greenery, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re in another world.The cuisine in Singapore is international and Tamashii, a new Japanese restaurant, was recommended to me by a friend. It\u2019s a little hard to find, down a little alley and on the top floor, but it\u2019s well worth discovering. There is a huge display of ingredients imported directly from Japan. You choose your favourites and the chef cooks them in front of you - or you can tell the chef what your budget is and he will create a dish of the finest ingredients within that range.If you like to shop, head to Bugis, where you can pick up cheap clothes and accessories from the street market; or the Mustafa shopping centre in Little India is open 24 hours a day and sells everything you could imagine. Culture fans will appreciate the Singapore Art Museum and National Gallery Singapore, and Shuffle at Clarke Quay is my favourite place to listen to a mix of English and Chinese music by local bands.I always take visitors to Chinatown, which has intriguing pockets of history and some of the oldest temples in Singapore. You can sip tea whilst listening to Chinese opera and, in the pharmacies, pick up fresh Chinese herbs to help with any ailment. Another of my favourite places to take visitors is Katong. A residential area in the east, this is the home of the Peranakans. The Peranakans were early Chinese immigrants to the Malay Peninsula and they fused Chinese and Malaysian customs to create a rich and colourful culture. In Katong, you can visit traditional Peranakan shops and houses and eat the delicious fusion food; no visit to Katong is complete without trying a bowl of laksa. If you\u2019re planning a trip to Singapore, the summer is a great time to visit. The food festival takes place in July, with special events, menus and cooking classes. And August is very special as we celebrate our national day, with musical performances, a huge parade, special restaurant events and spectacular fireworks along the east coast.\u201d", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "24 hours in Singapore: food, shopping and culture"},{"date": "2015-12-01T17:28:04Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Singapore Art Museum (SAM)Singapore\u2019s first art museum houses a wide-ranging collection of contemporary and pop-art pieces from Singapore and south-east Asia.

The exhibition covering 50 great Peranakans who have shaped Singapore over the last two centuries is particularly enlightening.National Museum of SingaporeThe oldest museum in Singapore is housed in a Renaissance-style building dating back to 1849. Enter this treasure trove of Singaporean artefacts to learn the story of the city-state through its recently revamped permanent galleries. Numerous temporary exhibitions and events also take place here, including exhibitions in partnership with the British Museum.Thian Hock Keng templeOne of the oldest temples in Singapore, the brilliant green and bright red Thian Hock Keng is also one of the most important for the Hokkien (or Han Chinese) clan. Having completed the often-dangerous voyage to Singapore, Chinese immigrants would come to give thanks to Mazu (Goddess of the Sea) for their safe passage. Today, visitors wonder at how such an ornate structure was built without a single nail.Labrador ParkWandering through this tranquil park, serenaded by the Black-naped Oriole, it\u2019s hard to imagine the bristling gun-emplacements that were to defend southern Singapore from Japanese attack. Unfortunately for the British, the Japanese came from the north, so the \u201cimpenetrable\u201d Fort Pasir Panjang saw little action. Today artillery pieces and machine gun posts can still be seen waiting for the enemy that came round the back.Changi MuseumThis emotive museum looks at the second world war through the lens of those incarcerated in the Changi area from 1942, when Singapore fell to the Japanese, to 1945, when the war ended. The murals painted by Bombardier Stanley Warren during the war are particularly interesting \u2013 he even returned after the war to restore his work.Haw Par Villa Haw Par Villa is not your average theme park. Built in 1937 by the brothers behind Tiger Balm ointment, the free-to-enter park is home to over vivid 1,000 statues and 150 giant dioramas depicting Chinese folklore, history and Confucianism, making it the perfect place to immerse yourself in Chinese culture and morality.Sri Veeramakaliamman templeDedicated to the Hindu goddess Sri Veeramakaliamman (or Kali), this fabulously ornate Hindu temple is a jaw-dropping example of traditional Indian carving. Kali is the destroyer of evil and is depicted in this temple wearing a garland of skulls and ripping out the insides of her victims. There are four puja (prayer) sessions each day, when the temple is busiest.Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM)Pleasantly situated on the Singapore river, the ACM is dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage of Asia, especially the ancestral cultures of Singaporeans. The permanent collection includes hundreds of ancient artefacts, from ancient silks to 4th-century sculpture, while in November 2015 the new Kwek Hong Png wing opened to expand display space for Chinese art from Fujian province.Raffles hotelNo visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to Raffles. The very epitome of colonial grandeur, this grande dame hosts a small museum dedicated to her history, as well as the Tiffin room for opulent high teas. Top reason to come though is the beautiful Long Bar where the Singapore Sling was created one hundred years ago. And if the Sling ain\u2019t your thing, try the potent Million Dollar cocktail instead.

The winner is due to be announced by the end of the year. Jefferies said:Go-Ahead has submitted the lowest priced bid at S$498m (around \u00a3232m) for the 5-year contract (with possible two-year extension). That appears to be 6.5% below the low end of the range of competing bids (S$533m-S$631m or around \u00a3248m-\u00a3294m). Other bidders include Keolis, a joint venture of RATP Dev and Transdev and local competition.Earlier this year, Tower Transit (UK subsidiary of Australia\u2019s Transit Systems Group) won the Bulim contract (the first package of bus routes tendered in Singapore). Its bid was a close third lowest on price, but was assessed to rank best on the combination of quality and price. Singapore\u2019s Land Transport Authority said greater weight had been given to quality. Go-Ahead was the highest bidder in the Bulim process and we assume learnt from the experience. As a group that emphasises quality of product, we assume that with the lowest pitched bid for this second package, it must now be well placed in this contest. The contract being tendered is to operate 25 bus routes from the Loyang bus depot. The government will retain ownership of the buses, infrastructure and fare revenue and the winning operator will be paid to operate the services to specified standards. The contract will begin in the second half of calendar 2016. Crudely assume up to a 10% London margin (Singapore\u2019s bus model is similar), and the Go-Ahead bid may represent up to around \u00a34.6m per annum EBIT opportunity. That compares to [our estimated] group pretax profit at \u00a3112m for Go-Ahead in 2016 - so a helpful business to win. But Jefferies said the greater significance of winning the contract would be as a credible start to extending the group beyond its established UK bus and rail activities.Go-Ahead is currently down 14p at \u00a324.56.", "tags": ["Business", "Stock markets", "Go-Ahead"], "title": "Go-Ahead reportedly well placed to win Singapore bus deal"},{"date": "2015-11-30T14:37:28Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Whether you have visited or not, there are plenty of images that come to mind when thinking of Singapore: soaring skyscrapers overlooking a magnificent harbour; charming colonial boulevards; colourful local cuisine and the rush of crowds filling its buzzing streets.

See this for yourself by walking through the town from Little India \u2013 with its Hindu and Buddhist temples \u2013 to Chinatown, where you\u2019ll find streets hung with red lanterns, locals playing Chinese checkers and having tea the traditional way. We dare you not to think in travel clich\u00e9s here \u2013 melting pot, city of contrasts, these hackneyed terms seem suddenly to make sense on this walk. Everybody knows that Singapore is great for shopping, so if you really want to flex those credit cards, try KEEPERS, a local designers\u2019 collective on Orchard Green for jewellers, bag-makers, perfumers and much more. Alternatively, head to the buzzy Haji Lane in the old Arab quarter for hip independent shops selling fashion and homewares.You\u2019re sure to be ready for more food by now, so why not dine on a true taste of Singapore - a fish-head curry? Bursting with flavours from the city\u2019s Chinese, Malaysian and Indian cuisines, this dish combines red snapper and a curry sauce, with the addition of coconut milk for creaminess and tamarind for a sweet-sour kick. As night falls, Singapore sheds its inhibitions and comes out to play. Rooftop drinking is the best way to start, with cocktails at 1-Altitude, the world\u2019s highest al fresco bar. After, drop into Harry\u2019s Bar , or try one of Singapore\u2019s hip hideaways such as Bar Stories, Hopscotch, The Library or 28 Hong Kong Street, where world-famous mixologist Peter Chua mans the bar. Try Chua\u2019s favourite cocktail, the Negroni \u2013 a heady mix of gin, vermouth and Gran Classico bitter. It\u2019s the perfect way to celebrate Singapore\u2019s 50th birthday.

You\u2019ll see plenty of locals jogging or taking group classes and you can hire a kayak to get out on the water. Look out for monkeys \u2013 and don\u2019t feed them. Hort ParkHort Park is Singapore\u2019s top drawcard for gardeners and gardening enthusiasts. Set among the Southern Ridges, a 6 mile stretch of open green space on the tip of Singapore harbour, Hort Park offers visitors fantastic array of recreational and educational gardening activities, as well as a world-class garden retail centre. While you\u2019re at it, be sure to check out Henderson Waves, the spectacularly designed pedestrian bridge affording brilliant views of the Southern Ridges and the city. Sungei Buloh Wetland ReserveThis pristine wetland is a must for bird lovers. As well as being home to a host of species year-round, from the vulnerable lesser adjutant to the blue-crowned hanging parrot, there are some 230 visiting species. The best time to catch the migratory birds refuelling on the mudflats is from September to March. Anyone can join free guided walks on weekends.Gardens by the BayFor those who like their nature a little more controlled, Gardens by the Bay makes for a fascinating day out. Don\u2019t expect untouched nature here, this is very much an attraction, with guided tours, audio tours and even an app. Be sure to visit the flower dome \u2013 the world\u2019s largest glass greenhouse is impressive on its own and the flora\u2019s pretty good too.Green CorridorA fascinating combination of nature and history, the Green Corridor was a railway retained by Malaysia on Singapore\u2019s independence in 1965. Returned to Singapore in 2010, residents campaigned to preserve it as a green space for the community and, once the rails were torn up and returned to Malaysia, the government allowed nature to take over. Today it\u2019s a unique place for a walk, and an unbeatably interesting route across the island. Night SafariThe world\u2019s first safari park for nocturnal animals will appeal not only to humans of a nocturnal persuasion, but to wildlife lovers of all stripes. This is home to more than 130 species, of which 38% are threatened. The 40-minute tram tour through the park\u2019s seven geographical zones is the perfect introduction before you strike off on one of the four walking trails. Chinese and Japanese GardensCollectively known as Jurong Lake Gardens, the Chinese portion is modelled on the northern imperial style. The seven-storey pagoda is particularly striking, as is the Bridge of Double Beauty that links the garden to its Japanese neighbour. The Japanese side is designed to be more calming and, with fewer features, it stays true to the style of the Muromachi period (1336-1573) it is based on.Pulau Ubin islandOften called the last kampong (village) in Singapore, nature lovers could spend days on this beguiling island. The Chek Jawa wetlands are a major draw, with the largest intertidal flat in northern Singapore surrounded by coastal forest and mangroves. There\u2019s a visitor centre, boardwalk and tower for bird-watching \u2013 all best accessed on a rented bike.", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "Top 10 nature experiences in Singapore"},{"date": "2015-12-01T17:29:30Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Lau Pa Sat festival marketLau Pa Sat is the grande dame of Singapore\u2019s food markets, combining great local food and colonial Victorian architecture under one, octagonal roof. Little more than a timber and attap (thatch) structure back in 1825, it gained its distinctive shape some 13 years later and has been a national monument since 1973. Come for a lively lunch or visit in the evening when local friends and families gather along \u2018satay street\u2019 to enjoy the variety of flavours of satay and local beer. Singapore food festivalFor 10 days in early July, Singapore gathers to celebrate all things edible. Events take place around the city and offer the chance to try everything from traditional staples and revivals of forgotten dishes to 21st-century takes on the classics and totally new concepts from young local chefs. You may even find yourself involved in a world record \u2013 in 2015, chefs at Suvai, an Indian food event, used an 11-metre curry pot to set the record for largest cooking vessel.Sunday brunch at the Landing PointWant to get fancy? Singapore loves Sunday brunch and you\u2019ll find plenty of brunch buffets offering free-flowing champagne. Head to the legendary Fullerton Bay hotel for a sumptuous high tea at the Landing Point Lounge. Feast on dainty sandwiches, freshly made cakes and, naturally, scones with cream and jam. The views of the waterfront panorama will keep you occupied as you while away a relaxing afternoon and staff will replenish your platter as often as you clear it \u2013 so come hungry.Durian fruit in GeylangDurian fruit \u2018s pungent smell means that it\u2019s not permitted on the local MRT (Singapore\u2019s tube) and most hotels won\u2019t allow them within sniffing distance. Descriptions of the flavour range from chives, custard and garlic to caramel poured into whipped cream. Make up your own mind on a visit to one of the many durian fruit stalls in the area of Geylang. You will also be able to try other juicy fruit such as rambutans, longans and mangosteens with the people who truly love it.Fish head curryFish head curry is a Singaporean staple and if you ask locals where serves the best, you\u2019ll rarely find two people who agree. It mixes the spices of a typical South Indian curry with the head of a red snapper, while some mix in tamarind paste for a tinge of sourness, others add coconut milk for a creamier texture. Washed down with a glass of ice-cold lime juice, it\u2019s hard to beat. Join the crowds enjoying it at perennial favourite Muthu\u2019s Curry or try a curry that blends Indian and Eurasian flavours at Casa Bom Vento.Chinatown night marketAs darkness descends, Smith Street lurches into life in a whirlwind of woks, spices and noodles. The market\u2019s true extent takes in Pagoda Street, Trengganu Street and Sago Street as well as Smith Street and includes some 200 stalls. Many serve the classic Singapore dish of Hainanese chicken or be adventurous and order what looks and smells good. Makansutra at Gluttons by the BayNext door to the Esplanade Concert Hall, this is the perfect spot for a pre- or post-performance meal and there are stonking views across to the skyscrapers that make up Singapore\u2019s business district, winking their lights at you from across the bay. Try the nasi goreng (a dish with stir-fried rice) or a classic char kway teow (chicken noodles). Breakfast at Ya Kun Kaya ToastIf you like your kopi (coffee) strong, head here to kick off your day. The place is a favourite with locals, seen tucking into kaya toast; a buttery, coconut jam toast dipped into runny eggs topped up with soy sauce. It can be an acquired taste, but there\u2019s always the kopi to combat it.Spice challenge at Lagnaa Barefoot DiningLove Indian food? Don\u2019t miss Singapore\u2019s \u201cspice challenge\u201d. Pick your level from 1 (\u201cNot hot \u2013 anyone can\u201d) to \u201cSay your prayers\u201d (level 8) or even \u201cWe declare you king\u201d (level 10).

Level 3 (\u201cHotter \u2013 chef can\u2019t, can you?\u201d) was hot enough for me.Local food heroesFood in Singapore is always evolving so after sampling the best of its street food head to one of its many new and fashionable restaurants. Night owls with a sweet tooth should make a visit to the 2am Dessert Bar where you can enjoy a drink and eat sweet treats until late into the night.

Singapore international festival of arts (SIFA)Whatever kind of art you have a passion for SIFA is sure to have it in spades, with over a month of activities (during August and September) from theatre and dance to music and visual arts. Now running for three decades, SIFA is one of the most significant arts events in Asia and worth planning your trip around.The IstanaOn five days of the year, the Istana (the president\u2019s official residence) is open to visitors. Built by the British colonial government and completed in 1869, this palatial building makes for a fascinating tour. Open days fall in February, May, July, August and November but the Sunday before National Day (in August) is the best option as you\u2019ll be able to watch the spectacular National Day fireworks in the evening too. Singapore FlyerFancy dinner at 165 metres up \u2013 and served by your own butler? The Premium Sky Dining package aboard the world\u2019s second tallest observation wheel gives you a 360\u00b0 view of Singapore\u2019s landmarks while you tuck into a four-course menu. Alternatively, drink in the views along with the country\u2019s most famous cocktail in the Singapore Sling package.Chinese new yearSingapore is the only country outside of greater China where ethnic Chinese make up the majority of the population (76% in 2014) \u2013 so Chinese new year is a big deal here. For three weeks leading up to the actual day (8 February in 2016), the city is swathed in lucky red lanterns and you may well be stopped in your tracks by a lion dance.The Esplanade \u2013 Theatres on the BayThe locals may refer to them as \u201cthe big durians\u201d or the \u2018two microphones\u2019, which describes the world renowned performances at these theatres. Cameron Mackintosh\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables will run for a month from 29 May 2016 and, with a host of local and international artists playing throughout the year, there\u2019s bound to be a performance to excite your inner thespian.Ballet under the Stars (BUTS)BUTS takes place every year in July, and is intensely popular among locals. Tickets are usually released two months ahead of the performances and sell out fast, so keep an eye on the Singapore Dance Theatre Facebook page. You might want to take extra care when using the event hashtag: #iloveBUTS.National GallerySome 10 years in the making, Singapore\u2019s National Gallery finally opened its doors in November 2015. Housed in the former supreme court building and city hall, it hosts a whopping 8,000 artworks, making it the world\u2019s largest collection of Singaporean and south-east Asian art. The gallery also hosts international travelling exhibitions, so check the website for what\u2019s on. ARTStage SingaporeRun by former Art Basel director Lorenzo Rudolf, ARTStage Singapore is arguably the leading art fair in Asia, attracting many of the world\u2019s top gallerists, curators and private collectors. Run as a five day event this year, ARTStage Singapore pulled 51,000 visitors with its extensive showcase of Asian contemporary art alongside global luminaries such as Damien Hirst. ARTStage 2016 will run between 21-24 January.Chingay ParadeSingapore\u2019s Chingay Parade is the largest street performance and float parade in Asia. The parade includes dancing dragons, prancing lions, stilt walkers, masters of the martial art wushu and performers in traditional costume.

There is the show, where fantasies are created and characters live larger than life. But when the curtains come down, another reality takes over backstage. Performers remove their make up and revert to a life more ordinary but no less significant. A day in my life in Singapore involves moving between the backstage and onstage personas of the country.I begin my day with a roti prata (Indian dough pancake) or runny soft boiled eggs and toast with kaya (coconut jam). These breakfast staples are quintessentially Singaporean. Taste these local delights at hawker centres where you can tuck in not only to the scrumptuous chow, but also the garrulous cacophony of the people. Hawker centres are not just about food, they are a microcosm of Singaporean society. Beside the endearing auntie or uncle will sit the over achieving graduate wolfing down his breakfast before heading off to work. After a long day, people find solace in these fluorescent illuminated eateries with a cup of teh tarik (pulled tea). The experience does not get more local than this. A quick train ride whisks me away from the familiar energy of the heartlands into the bustle of downtown Singapore. Here, the landmarks of our British colonial past sit beside gleaming office towers and have become the visual representation of Singapore\u2019s onstage persona \u2013 proud, shiny, aspirational. Visit the newest public museum to be opened, National Gallery Singapore, which is housed in newly restored buildings, formerly the City Hall and Supreme Court. Nearby are the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Victoria Concert Hall. Further down the river is the Esplanade Theatres By The Bay. The venue, with it iconic spiky roofs, is where many go to engage with the performing arts at all levels, from chilling out at free concerts at the outdoor theatre, to dressing up to the nines to watch the English National Ballet at the plush 2000-seat main theatre. Apart from these more widely publicised art and cultural institutions, there is also the local independent creative scene. It is a small scene but thanks to social media there is an increased momentum in the industry. A lot of these shops, collectives and galleries are found in quaint cultural districts such as my personal favourite, Little India. From poetry collection launches in quaint bookshops to dance parties organised in abandoned country clubs, the creatives based in Singapore offer up alternative view points to the more visible grand narrative of this young country.Encountering this much art in a day requires me to reflect on the things I have seen. Fortunately, this small island nation has numerous pockets of green sanctuaries all over theplace. Relatively untouched by urban development, these tranquil green spaces provide not only physical but also much needed emotional and psychological space, a stark contrast to the sensory onslaught of a restless country always on the move.As the setting sun casts its orange glow over the island, I make my way back into the sprawling urban landscape and prepare myself for a fun night out. Heading down to the adjacent districts of Ann Siang Hill, Club Street and Tanjong Pagar dressed in my hippest threads, I meet up with old friends over good food in some of the trendiest joints in town. These places serve the latest nosh in chic settings. As the evening wears on, the energy of the crowds spilling on to the streets becomes palpable. If my feet get itchy, I usually head down to Kyo, a basement club that cranks up the volume on the more progressive aspects of techno and house music, providing an electrifying end to my day.", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "24 hours in Singapore: culture, nightlife and green spaces"},{"date": "2015-12-07T16:06:40Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "\u201cThe best start to a day in Singapore is enjoying breakfast at Chin Mei Chin, an old school bakery on the famous East Coast Road. Walking in feels like going back to the 1950s. It is steeped in tradition; my parents took me there as a child. My favourite breakfast is coconut kaya toast and butter with a steaming cup of traditional Singaporean coffee, brewed through cloth to infuse the intensity and aroma. Although Singapore is small, it constantly surprises me. There are new experiences \u2013 and foods \u2013 to try every day. It\u2019s cheaper to eat out than cook at home and we work long hours, so everyone goes out in the evening. One of the best places to eat is at a hawker centre. There are more than 300 hawker centres (or food courts) in Singapore. They\u2019re all different, but affordable, with a variety of dishes. One of my favourites is black carrot cake, a savoury dish made with radish and eggs, then fried with dark soya sauce.All aboard the steamboatAnother favourite dish is the steamboat; families gather round a hot pot in the centre of the table and add their favourite raw ingredients to it. I love Nan Hwa Chong Fish Head Steamboat Corner on North Bridge Road. Or try sambal stingray for supper at a stall in Serangoon, a buzzy neighbourhood northeast of downtown. Sambal is a spicy chilli sauce homemade by the vendors and it tastes delicious with the soft stingray \u2013 a drizzle of lime and a bowl of white rice completes the meal.If you want to get off the beaten track, Singapore is easy, safe and affordable to travel around using the bus network, or you can explore on foot. English is spoken everywhere and all the signs are in four languages, including English. I\u2019d recommend taking a break from the busy city and visiting the farms in Lim Chu Kang. I enjoy eating a healthy lunch at Bollywood Veggies, packed with produce grown on the farm. You are surrounded by so much greenery, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re in another world.The cuisine in Singapore is international and Tamashii, a new Japanese restaurant, was recommended to me by a friend. It\u2019s a little hard to find, down a little alley and on the top floor, but it\u2019s well worth discovering. There is a huge display of ingredients imported directly from Japan. You choose your favourites and the chef cooks them in front of you - or you can tell the chef what your budget is and he will create a dish of the finest ingredients within that range.If you like to shop, head to Bugis, where you can pick up cheap clothes and accessories from the street market; or the Mustafa shopping centre in Little India is open 24 hours a day and sells everything you could imagine. Culture fans will appreciate the Singapore Art Museum and National Gallery Singapore, and Shuffle at Clarke Quay is my favourite place to listen to a mix of English and Chinese music by local bands.I always take visitors to Chinatown, which has intriguing pockets of history and some of the oldest temples in Singapore. You can sip tea whilst listening to Chinese opera and, in the pharmacies, pick up fresh Chinese herbs to help with any ailment. Another of my favourite places to take visitors is Katong. A residential area in the east, this is the home of the Peranakans. The Peranakans were early Chinese immigrants to the Malay Peninsula and they fused Chinese and Malaysian customs to create a rich and colourful culture. In Katong, you can visit traditional Peranakan shops and houses and eat the delicious fusion food; no visit to Katong is complete without trying a bowl of laksa. If you\u2019re planning a trip to Singapore, the summer is a great time to visit. The food festival takes place in July, with special events, menus and cooking classes. And August is very special as we celebrate our national day, with musical performances, a huge parade, special restaurant events and spectacular fireworks along the east coast.\u201d", "tags": ["Singapore Invites"], "title": "24 hours in Singapore: food, shopping and culture"},{"date": "2015-12-01T17:28:04Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "Singapore Art Museum (SAM)Singapore\u2019s first art museum houses a wide-ranging collection of contemporary and pop-art pieces from Singapore and south-east Asia.

The exhibition covering 50 great Peranakans who have shaped Singapore over the last two centuries is particularly enlightening.National Museum of SingaporeThe oldest museum in Singapore is housed in a Renaissance-style building dating back to 1849. Enter this treasure trove of Singaporean artefacts to learn the story of the city-state through its recently revamped permanent galleries. Numerous temporary exhibitions and events also take place here, including exhibitions in partnership with the British Museum.Thian Hock Keng templeOne of the oldest temples in Singapore, the brilliant green and bright red Thian Hock Keng is also one of the most important for the Hokkien (or Han Chinese) clan. Having completed the often-dangerous voyage to Singapore, Chinese immigrants would come to give thanks to Mazu (Goddess of the Sea) for their safe passage. Today, visitors wonder at how such an ornate structure was built without a single nail.Labrador ParkWandering through this tranquil park, serenaded by the Black-naped Oriole, it\u2019s hard to imagine the bristling gun-emplacements that were to defend southern Singapore from Japanese attack. Unfortunately for the British, the Japanese came from the north, so the \u201cimpenetrable\u201d Fort Pasir Panjang saw little action. Today artillery pieces and machine gun posts can still be seen waiting for the enemy that came round the back.Changi MuseumThis emotive museum looks at the second world war through the lens of those incarcerated in the Changi area from 1942, when Singapore fell to the Japanese, to 1945, when the war ended. The murals painted by Bombardier Stanley Warren during the war are particularly interesting \u2013 he even returned after the war to restore his work.Haw Par Villa Haw Par Villa is not your average theme park. Built in 1937 by the brothers behind Tiger Balm ointment, the free-to-enter park is home to over vivid 1,000 statues and 150 giant dioramas depicting Chinese folklore, history and Confucianism, making it the perfect place to immerse yourself in Chinese culture and morality.Sri Veeramakaliamman templeDedicated to the Hindu goddess Sri Veeramakaliamman (or Kali), this fabulously ornate Hindu temple is a jaw-dropping example of traditional Indian carving. Kali is the destroyer of evil and is depicted in this temple wearing a garland of skulls and ripping out the insides of her victims. There are four puja (prayer) sessions each day, when the temple is busiest.Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM)Pleasantly situated on the Singapore river, the ACM is dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage of Asia, especially the ancestral cultures of Singaporeans. The permanent collection includes hundreds of ancient artefacts, from ancient silks to 4th-century sculpture, while in November 2015 the new Kwek Hong Png wing opened to expand display space for Chinese art from Fujian province.Raffles hotelNo visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to Raffles. The very epitome of colonial grandeur, this grande dame hosts a small museum dedicated to her history, as well as the Tiffin room for opulent high teas. Top reason to come though is the beautiful Long Bar where the Singapore Sling was created one hundred years ago. And if the Sling ain\u2019t your thing, try the potent Million Dollar cocktail instead.

The winner is due to be announced by the end of the year. Jefferies said:Go-Ahead has submitted the lowest priced bid at S$498m (around \u00a3232m) for the 5-year contract (with possible two-year extension). That appears to be 6.5% below the low end of the range of competing bids (S$533m-S$631m or around \u00a3248m-\u00a3294m). Other bidders include Keolis, a joint venture of RATP Dev and Transdev and local competition.Earlier this year, Tower Transit (UK subsidiary of Australia\u2019s Transit Systems Group) won the Bulim contract (the first package of bus routes tendered in Singapore). Its bid was a close third lowest on price, but was assessed to rank best on the combination of quality and price. Singapore\u2019s Land Transport Authority said greater weight had been given to quality. Go-Ahead was the highest bidder in the Bulim process and we assume learnt from the experience. As a group that emphasises quality of product, we assume that with the lowest pitched bid for this second package, it must now be well placed in this contest. The contract being tendered is to operate 25 bus routes from the Loyang bus depot. The government will retain ownership of the buses, infrastructure and fare revenue and the winning operator will be paid to operate the services to specified standards. The contract will begin in the second half of calendar 2016. Crudely assume up to a 10% London margin (Singapore\u2019s bus model is similar), and the Go-Ahead bid may represent up to around \u00a34.6m per annum EBIT opportunity. That compares to [our estimated] group pretax profit at \u00a3112m for Go-Ahead in 2016 - so a helpful business to win. But Jefferies said the greater significance of winning the contract would be as a credible start to extending the group beyond its established UK bus and rail activities.Go-Ahead is currently down 14p at \u00a324.56.", "tags": ["Business", "Stock markets", "Go-Ahead"], "title": "Go-Ahead reportedly well placed to win Singapore bus deal"},{"date": "2015-10-14T04:49:39Z", "country": "singapore", "content": "It can\u2019t fight crime or act as a butler but Robocoach is working with Singapore\u2019s older citizens to help them stay healthy with regular exercise.The android with metal arms and a screen for a face is already leading sessions and will roll out its services to five \u201csenior activity centres\u201d across the city-state this year, according to Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), a government body that supports the country\u2019s tech industry.
