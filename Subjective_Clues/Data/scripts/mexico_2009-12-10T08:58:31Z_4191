A plan for the ousted Honduran president, Manuel Zelaya, to leave the country for Mexico has stalled over his refusal to accept political asylum. Mexico's foreign relations department said it asked the post-coup regime to guarantee Zelaya's safe passage out of the country without being arrested on treason and abuse of power charges.Honduran officials said the regime agreed to let Zelaya go if he was willing to accept political asylum but Zelaya said he would not accept a departure under those terms."I want to leave as a distinguished guest, not as a political refugee like the interim government wants," Zelaya told Radio Globo late last night from the Brazilian embassy, where he has spent nearly three months after a failed effort to get his office back and prevent the election of his successor.The regime had been insistent Zelaya would be arrested on the charges that led to his overthrow on 28 June for ignoring a supreme court order against holding a referendum on changing the constitution. But recently it began hinting Zelaya could leave for exile or political asylum in another country.Zelaya said he was leaving to seek out a neutral site for talks with the Honduran president-elect, Porfirio Lobo.Zelaya said he wanted a negotiated solution for his departure – one "that respected the law, and respected my office" as president.He suggested he wanted a status that would "allow me to continue my (political) actions abroad". After being ousted he tried to operate a government-in-exile from other Latin American nations."I will not accept any political asylum," Zelaya said. That status might hinder his campaign to drum up opposition to the forces that removed him from the presidency.Oscar Raul Matute, the interim interior minister, said Mexico had filed paperwork asking for safe passage for Zelaya but had failed to include whether Zelaya would be recognised by Mexico as the Honduran president or as a citizen being given refuge."If the government of Mexico wishes to give him asylum we will consider that petition as long as it fulfills all the requirements," Matute told CNN en Español.Honduras's Congress, which is dominated by Zelaya's own political party, voted 111 to 14 last week month against restoring him to office to serve out his term, which ends on 27 January.The interim regime's foreign minister, Carlos Lopez, told Channel 5 television that a Mexican plane had approached Honduras late last night to fly Zelaya out of the country but that had it diverted to El Salvador. "Honduras will only offer a safe conduct pass to Zelaya to travel to another country as a political refugee and not in any other way," Lopez said.A Mexican government official told the Associated Press a plane had apparently been sent or would be sent to Honduras. The official said negotiations were focused on exactly what title Zelaya would be given.On Tuesday, Porfirio Lobo, the man who won the 29 November election to replace Zelaya, said he supported amnesty for Zelaya and for all of those involved in the coup that deposed him.Although Zelaya has refused to recognise the election, Lobo has said he hopes to open dialogue with the deposed leader and start a national reconciliation process after taking office.But Lobo's options are limited. Even once he takes office, he cannot grant Zelaya amnesty from prosecution. That power belongs to the same Congress that overwhelmingly rejected reinstating Zelaya.Western hemisphere countries united to condemn Zelaya's ouster but are divided on whether to recognise Lobo's election. The US, which cut off some aid over the coup, and a few countries in Latin America have said Hondurans had the right to choose a new leader in regular elections that had been scheduled before Zelaya's overthrow.Other nations including Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela have rejected the election, saying they will not legitimise Central America's first coup in two decades.
