Employment was creeping up, property prices had stopped falling and the Nikkei 225 had broken through 16,200.

There are fewer people and they are earning less money. Just where is consumer demand going to come from? You do wonder how they are ever going to solve the problem,\" says Taylor. Of course, it is not all doom and gloom. One of his preferred stocks is Nintendo. It has been just about everybody's favourite stock in Japan since it brought out the top-selling Wii games console and is still struggling to cope with demand from stores worldwide. \"The Wii is the only games product that has won customers outside of the traditional gaming categories. It's a big hit in nursing homes. When it's freely available maybe I'll sell out,\" he says.\"One of the attractions of Nintendo is that they don't just make money from selling consoles. They make so much more from selling the games software, and unlike the others they write most of it themselves.\"There are other bright spots on the Japanese corporate landscape. Taylor's favourite stock is Unicharm Petcare. The Japanese may not be having any children, but they do have lots of dogs. And Unicharm has a new wonder product: doggy diapers. They're big in Japan, and about to launch globally. But the country has suffered a double whammy: the bursting of the asset price bubble of the 1980s and the hollowing out of the economy by Chinese competition. Yes, there are still world-class manufacturers such as Toyota and Sony. But the \"mom and pop\" smaller companies that for decades provided the nuts and bolts for the giant companies, are crumbling. \"Around two-thirds of the Japanese economy is made up of companies with fewer than 10 workers.

The last corporate results season showed mid-cap profits declining by 12% and smaller company profits by 40%. At large cap companies, earnings rose, albeit by a miserable 1.3%.

This has to be the strangest apr\u00e8s ski ritual I have ever experienced but it's the perfect interlude between skiing and hitting the karaoke bar.I had an image in my head of what skiing in Niseko was going to be like. Located 500 miles north of Tokyo, Niseko is the largest resort on Hokkaido, Japan's second largest island. It's at the fat end of Japan's 600 plus resorts, with 60 runs, although it can't compete with Shiga Kogen on Honshu with 179. I'd imagined state-of-the-art lifts packed with skiers squeezed in by those guys you get on Japanese commuter trains, whisking you off to the top of the mountain in seconds. Actually the lifts are quite basic. Some we christen \"danglers\" are just a single half-wooden seat with no safety barrier swinging you up to the summit, like kittens by the scruff of their necks. Niseko village is small, arranged around one set of traffic lights. Everything is covered in metres-thick drifts, and the windows of the wooden guesthouses and bar doorways peek out from under their huge snow hats. The feel is traditional, yet touches of technology remind you you're in Japan. For instance, there's no ATM, yet the main road is heated. These contrasts are everywhere: young Japanese boarders plugged into their i-Pods, while 1940s-style loudspeakers blare across the pistes. The Higashiyama Prince Hotel rising up like a moon base, dwarfs our small green wooden backpacker's hostel, Shizenkan. Fish-tail flouro-painted boards on the slopes set against the hire shop board we were offered that Rolf Harris could have got a tune out of. Another reminder of where we are is the karaoke bar. We are greeted at the door by a \"song-pusher\", who thrusts paper and pencils in our hands and does a little jig to encourage us to sing. It doesn't work. There is a woman singing an intimidatingly pitch-perfect version of Christina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\". Then a bloke growls his way through something unrecognisable, threatening to set off several small avalanches.  Skiing attracts people that love barging you out of the way in a queue. In Niseko, it's more relaxed and friendly. There are always people on hand to help you on the gondolas or to brush the snow off the chairs before you sit down. They give it a brush even if there isn't any snow, suggesting this is a matter of courtesy. Admittedly there are hardly any queues to barge. As Hokkaido has a relatively small population, it means the slopes are often empty. More than 50% of the skiers who visit are Australian. Skiing in Japan is popular among Australians because of its accessibility compared to Europe and North America. As an Aussie guest at our hostel said, \"This was going to be a trip to Europe, until I looked at the price and realised I could come here for half the cost\". The Australian contingent fuels another contrast: the small but lively bars, like Splash and Wild Bill's, which have a completely different atmosphere to the restaurants which feel more Japanese. Lying back on cushions in our socks at low tables eating yakitori (grilled meats) off a skewer feels like the more authentic Japanese apr\u00e8s ski experience. Reliable snow has to be weighed against the lack of gradient and scale compared to the big North American or European ski areas, however. The runs tend to be short with few steep sections and not all are groomed. However, it keeps us interested not least because of the night skiing. Niseko has the best in the world. We ski every night apart from one when the temperature drops so low our nostrils start to freeze. My friends have invested in Hannibal Lector-style face masks, but I only have a thin scarf and my face nearly freezes off. But blasting down an empty run three abreast, in the dark, is the most snow-derived fun I've had in years.There's also a huge amount of off-piste available. The risks of skiing the back country are relatively high given there's no avalanche bombing and the weather sets in quickly. We found this out when we started an off-piste itinerary in bright sunshine which soon became a white-out as the weather closed in. Accompanying the snow showers was a dramatic fall in temperature, and when one of the lads hadn't arrived at the lift after an hour, we decided to contact the ski patrol. We were just pinpointing where we'd last seen him, when he rang. He'd got lost but luckily spotted a couple of boarders who were being guided back to the resort. He followed them and ended up walking out through chest deep powder. He dried his sweat-soaked clothing over the log stove in our favourite lunch spot - the 1,000m Hut. The 1000m Hut is what Niseko does best. A small traditional restaurant where the atmosphere is warm and friendly and the food reasonably-priced (750 yen for pork soup and rice). In fact, all the food on the hill is better value than in town where the portions are small and expensive. At one restaurant we were served one shrimp in a glass as a starter. Over lunch, Rocky Osaki, who works at the hut, tells us that Hokkaido is still mainly a rural island. He says a lot of the farming villages are disappearing as young Japanese are moving to the cities to find work and not returning. He manages a fishing centre and it is his dream that skiing will attract more foreign tourists who might also be keen to visit the more remote parts of the island where a foreign face is still a novelty. Outside the hut is an old bell which is rung by passing skiers. On the wall of the hut is the explanation: \"The bell of Mr Kosukegawa. His age was over 100 years. He loved to ski in Niseko. He built the bell to pray for the safety of the skiers. Now, he listens to the bell in heaven. Please ring the bell for Mr Kosukegawa\". The trick will be to deliver further proposed development without losing these traditional touches that give Niseko its charm.Tom Collinson is the writer of radio 4's Self Storage, which begins its second series in the autumn.Shizenkan offers backpacker private rooms for 14 nights (based on triple share) and a 13-day all mountain pass, plus airport transfers for \u00a3536 per person.Ski Independence offers 10 nights in Niseko from \u00a31,199 per person, including return flights from London Heathrow, return transfers and accommodation in the Niseko Apartments (4 star), based on two people sharing a one bedroom apartment.

Today's loss was the biggest percentage decline since October 8, 1998, when shares plummeted 5.78%.The broader Topix index fell 5.7%, its biggest one-day loss since the September 11 terrorist attacks.Today's fall wiped out about $225bn (\u00a3115bn) in market value - about equivalent to the size of the Irish economy.The Nikkei has now fallen almost 18% this year - and more than 9% this week - as Japan wrestles with the bigger-than-expected effects of the US sub-prime mortgage crisis. A stimulus package announced by George Bush last week failed to raise confidence among investors from Wall Street to London.In Tokyo they offloaded shares amid fears that a US economic slowdown will weaken demand for exports, damaging Japan's attempts to keep its own economic recovery on track.Financial stocks were battered for a second day, with Mizuho Financial falling 8.2% and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial by 7.8%.\"It's like a funeral in here,\" Ken Masuda, a senior equities dealer at Shinko Securities, told Reuters.\"No one knows what is going to happen tonight in New York. It's like we've gone blind - you don't know what's coming. Until we see New York, all we can do is sell.\"With the government insisting it had no immediate plans to take action, the pace of this week's falls appear to have wrong-footed officials.\"Stock markets across the world are falling and it basically stems from the US,\" the economy minister, Hiroko Ota, said. \"It is difficult at the moment to consider Japan taking action alone. Instead we need to cooperate globally.\"The yen's recent strength against the dollar, meanwhile, is hitting exporters' overseas earnings and damaging sentiment. Shares in Toyota, Japan's biggest carmaker, fell 7.2% to 4,880 yen (\u00a323) today; Sony, meanwhile, lost 6.9% to close at 5,110 yen.The Bank of Japan governor, Toshihiko Fukui, warned that the impact on Japan of the US slowdown was turning out to be worse than expected.The central bank, which today left interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, said Japan's economic recovery remained on track but that the pace of expansion would slow.\"All in all, it remains likely that the Japanese economy will sustain its growth with stable prices, while a favourable cycle of output, income and spending remains in place,\" he told reporters.\"While the global economy continues to expand with areas in growth spreading, we are paying attention especially to the US economy. Private consumption and capital investment remain on a moderate rising trend there, but there are prolonged adjustments in the housing market.\"The unemployment rate is also rising somewhat recently. A slowdown in the US economy is intensifying. We need to continue to watch developments in the sub-prime problems and their impact.\"Some analysts said Fukui's remarks hinted at an underlying caution that could reveal itself in the coming weeks.\"Fukui is not acting hawkish,\" said Seiji Shiraishi of HSBC Securities Japan. \"His comments about uncertainty over the outlook in the economy suggest that he is toning down his view in accordance with market moves.\"If upcoming hard data turn out weak, Fukui could revise his view on the underlying economy downward.\"", "tags": ["Business", "Japan", "Nikkei", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan meltdown continues"},{"date": "2008-03-29T00:15:42Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Which funds are the biggest losers from the credit crunch?

One of the two Japan funds which is in positive territory over the past year is Neptune Japan Opportunities, run by Chris Taylor. But even he is deeply pessimistic about the outlook. In one anecdote after another, he tells me what a basket case Japan is. And it all comes down to demographics. \"This is a country where there are more funerals than weddings. Japan is in a demographic hole. Every year there are more people retiring than are entering the workforce. The people who are joining the workforce are on lower earnings than those who are retiring, and a lot of them are now in temporary or casual employment.\"Back in 2005, the belief was that the decade-long stranglehold of deflation and stagnation was now over. Employment was creeping up, property prices had stopped falling and the Nikkei 225 had broken through 16,200. But three years on it is trading below 12,000, as the hoped-for 'broadening out' of the recovery and the return of the consumer failed to materialise. \"The amount of yen being earned by those in employment is in year-on-year decline. There are fewer people and they are earning less money. Just where is consumer demand going to come from? You do wonder how they are ever going to solve the problem,\" says Taylor. Of course, it is not all doom and gloom. One of his preferred stocks is Nintendo. It has been just about everybody's favourite stock in Japan since it brought out the top-selling Wii games console and is still struggling to cope with demand from stores worldwide. \"The Wii is the only games product that has won customers outside of the traditional gaming categories. It's a big hit in nursing homes. When it's freely available maybe I'll sell out,\" he says.\"One of the attractions of Nintendo is that they don't just make money from selling consoles. They make so much more from selling the games software, and unlike the others they write most of it themselves.\"There are other bright spots on the Japanese corporate landscape. Taylor's favourite stock is Unicharm Petcare. The Japanese may not be having any children, but they do have lots of dogs. And Unicharm has a new wonder product: doggy diapers. They're big in Japan, and about to launch globally. But the country has suffered a double whammy: the bursting of the asset price bubble of the 1980s and the hollowing out of the economy by Chinese competition. Yes, there are still world-class manufacturers such as Toyota and Sony. But the \"mom and pop\" smaller companies that for decades provided the nuts and bolts for the giant companies, are crumbling. \"Around two-thirds of the Japanese economy is made up of companies with fewer than 10 workers. But a hollowing out of the economy is going on, and big companies are using China as the source of cheap, low-tech components,\" says Taylor.\"Effectively there are two economies; the global exporting companies which lead their sectors, and the smaller companies hooked into a shrinking domestic economy.\" As a fund manager, it means you want to be firmly invested in big-cap stocks. The last corporate results season showed mid-cap profits declining by 12% and smaller company profits by 40%. At large cap companies, earnings rose, albeit by a miserable 1.3%. Does Japan's experience in handling an asset price implosion and illiquidity in the banks in the early 1990s provide any lessons in how to handle a credit crunch? Taylor is not so sure. Between 1987 and 2002 he was at Fuji Bank, and saw first-hand an inability by senior management to face up to problems. Corporately, he says, they have a habit of brushing things under the carpet. Even when the banks were quasi-nationalised in the early 1990s, it failed to solve the problem. \"Cutting rates and pumping in liquidity was like pushing on a piece of string,\" he says. \"Every time they got some capital, they wrote off some loans. But even today they have got non-performing assets. They don't seem to have a mentality in which you 'fess up to mistakes and get on with it.\" Japanese politics remains gridlocked and desperately unable to achieve fundamental structural reform. Last September, Yasuo Fukuda became the 91st prime minister. Though Taylor rates him an \"experienced political operator\", he says \"he is unlikely to come up with any great political initiatives, so the policy paralysis will remain\".As for Unicharm's dog diapers, let's hope they're not a pile of poo.", "tags": ["Investment funds", "Investments", "Shares", "Money"], "title": "Japan in the doghouse"},{"date": "2008-02-18T14:54:35Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I am sitting in an onsen, an open-air hot volcanic pool, looking at a Japanese guy meditating with an inch of fresh powder on his head. This has to be the strangest apr\u00e8s ski ritual I have ever experienced but it's the perfect interlude between skiing and hitting the karaoke bar.I had an image in my head of what skiing in Niseko was going to be like. Located 500 miles north of Tokyo, Niseko is the largest resort on Hokkaido, Japan's second largest island. It's at the fat end of Japan's 600 plus resorts, with 60 runs, although it can't compete with Shiga Kogen on Honshu with 179. I'd imagined state-of-the-art lifts packed with skiers squeezed in by those guys you get on Japanese commuter trains, whisking you off to the top of the mountain in seconds. Actually the lifts are quite basic. Some we christen \"danglers\" are just a single half-wooden seat with no safety barrier swinging you up to the summit, like kittens by the scruff of their necks. Niseko village is small, arranged around one set of traffic lights. Everything is covered in metres-thick drifts, and the windows of the wooden guesthouses and bar doorways peek out from under their huge snow hats. The feel is traditional, yet touches of technology remind you you're in Japan. For instance, there's no ATM, yet the main road is heated. These contrasts are everywhere: young Japanese boarders plugged into their i-Pods, while 1940s-style loudspeakers blare across the pistes. The Higashiyama Prince Hotel rising up like a moon base, dwarfs our small green wooden backpacker's hostel, Shizenkan. Fish-tail flouro-painted boards on the slopes set against the hire shop board we were offered that Rolf Harris could have got a tune out of. Another reminder of where we are is the karaoke bar. We are greeted at the door by a \"song-pusher\", who thrusts paper and pencils in our hands and does a little jig to encourage us to sing. It doesn't work. There is a woman singing an intimidatingly pitch-perfect version of Christina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\". Then a bloke growls his way through something unrecognisable, threatening to set off several small avalanches.  Skiing attracts people that love barging you out of the way in a queue. In Niseko, it's more relaxed and friendly. There are always people on hand to help you on the gondolas or to brush the snow off the chairs before you sit down. They give it a brush even if there isn't any snow, suggesting this is a matter of courtesy. Admittedly there are hardly any queues to barge. As Hokkaido has a relatively small population, it means the slopes are often empty. More than 50% of the skiers who visit are Australian. Skiing in Japan is popular among Australians because of its accessibility compared to Europe and North America. As an Aussie guest at our hostel said, \"This was going to be a trip to Europe, until I looked at the price and realised I could come here for half the cost\". The Australian contingent fuels another contrast: the small but lively bars, like Splash and Wild Bill's, which have a completely different atmosphere to the restaurants which feel more Japanese. Lying back on cushions in our socks at low tables eating yakitori (grilled meats) off a skewer feels like the more authentic Japanese apr\u00e8s ski experience. Reliable snow has to be weighed against the lack of gradient and scale compared to the big North American or European ski areas, however. The runs tend to be short with few steep sections and not all are groomed. However, it keeps us interested not least because of the night skiing. Niseko has the best in the world. We ski every night apart from one when the temperature drops so low our nostrils start to freeze. My friends have invested in Hannibal Lector-style face masks, but I only have a thin scarf and my face nearly freezes off. But blasting down an empty run three abreast, in the dark, is the most snow-derived fun I've had in years.There's also a huge amount of off-piste available. The risks of skiing the back country are relatively high given there's no avalanche bombing and the weather sets in quickly. We found this out when we started an off-piste itinerary in bright sunshine which soon became a white-out as the weather closed in. Accompanying the snow showers was a dramatic fall in temperature, and when one of the lads hadn't arrived at the lift after an hour, we decided to contact the ski patrol. We were just pinpointing where we'd last seen him, when he rang. He'd got lost but luckily spotted a couple of boarders who were being guided back to the resort. He followed them and ended up walking out through chest deep powder. He dried his sweat-soaked clothing over the log stove in our favourite lunch spot - the 1,000m Hut. The 1000m Hut is what Niseko does best. A small traditional restaurant where the atmosphere is warm and friendly and the food reasonably-priced (750 yen for pork soup and rice). In fact, all the food on the hill is better value than in town where the portions are small and expensive. At one restaurant we were served one shrimp in a glass as a starter. Over lunch, Rocky Osaki, who works at the hut, tells us that Hokkaido is still mainly a rural island. He says a lot of the farming villages are disappearing as young Japanese are moving to the cities to find work and not returning. He manages a fishing centre and it is his dream that skiing will attract more foreign tourists who might also be keen to visit the more remote parts of the island where a foreign face is still a novelty. Outside the hut is an old bell which is rung by passing skiers. On the wall of the hut is the explanation: \"The bell of Mr Kosukegawa. His age was over 100 years. He loved to ski in Niseko. He built the bell to pray for the safety of the skiers. Now, he listens to the bell in heaven. Please ring the bell for Mr Kosukegawa\". The trick will be to deliver further proposed development without losing these traditional touches that give Niseko its charm.Tom Collinson is the writer of radio 4's Self Storage, which begins its second series in the autumn.Shizenkan offers backpacker private rooms for 14 nights (based on triple share) and a 13-day all mountain pass, plus airport transfers for \u00a3536 per person.Ski Independence offers 10 nights in Niseko from \u00a31,199 per person, including return flights from London Heathrow, return transfers and accommodation in the Niseko Apartments (4 star), based on two people sharing a one bedroom apartment.

This has to be the strangest apr\u00e8s ski ritual I have ever experienced but it's the perfect interlude between skiing and hitting the karaoke bar.I had an image in my head of what skiing in Niseko was going to be like. Located 500 miles north of Tokyo, Niseko is the largest resort on Hokkaido, Japan's second largest island. It's at the fat end of Japan's 600 plus resorts, with 60 runs, although it can't compete with Shiga Kogen on Honshu with 179. I'd imagined state-of-the-art lifts packed with skiers squeezed in by those guys you get on Japanese commuter trains, whisking you off to the top of the mountain in seconds. Actually the lifts are quite basic. Some we christen \"danglers\" are just a single half-wooden seat with no safety barrier swinging you up to the summit, like kittens by the scruff of their necks. Niseko village is small, arranged around one set of traffic lights. Everything is covered in metres-thick drifts, and the windows of the wooden guesthouses and bar doorways peek out from under their huge snow hats. The feel is traditional, yet touches of technology remind you you're in Japan. For instance, there's no ATM, yet the main road is heated. These contrasts are everywhere: young Japanese boarders plugged into their i-Pods, while 1940s-style loudspeakers blare across the pistes. The Higashiyama Prince Hotel rising up like a moon base, dwarfs our small green wooden backpacker's hostel, Shizenkan. Fish-tail flouro-painted boards on the slopes set against the hire shop board we were offered that Rolf Harris could have got a tune out of. Another reminder of where we are is the karaoke bar. We are greeted at the door by a \"song-pusher\", who thrusts paper and pencils in our hands and does a little jig to encourage us to sing. It doesn't work. There is a woman singing an intimidatingly pitch-perfect version of Christina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\". Then a bloke growls his way through something unrecognisable, threatening to set off several small avalanches.  Skiing attracts people that love barging you out of the way in a queue. In Niseko, it's more relaxed and friendly. There are always people on hand to help you on the gondolas or to brush the snow off the chairs before you sit down. They give it a brush even if there isn't any snow, suggesting this is a matter of courtesy. Admittedly there are hardly any queues to barge. As Hokkaido has a relatively small population, it means the slopes are often empty. More than 50% of the skiers who visit are Australian. Skiing in Japan is popular among Australians because of its accessibility compared to Europe and North America. As an Aussie guest at our hostel said, \"This was going to be a trip to Europe, until I looked at the price and realised I could come here for half the cost\". The Australian contingent fuels another contrast: the small but lively bars, like Splash and Wild Bill's, which have a completely different atmosphere to the restaurants which feel more Japanese. Lying back on cushions in our socks at low tables eating yakitori (grilled meats) off a skewer feels like the more authentic Japanese apr\u00e8s ski experience. Reliable snow has to be weighed against the lack of gradient and scale compared to the big North American or European ski areas, however. The runs tend to be short with few steep sections and not all are groomed. However, it keeps us interested not least because of the night skiing. Niseko has the best in the world. We ski every night apart from one when the temperature drops so low our nostrils start to freeze. My friends have invested in Hannibal Lector-style face masks, but I only have a thin scarf and my face nearly freezes off. But blasting down an empty run three abreast, in the dark, is the most snow-derived fun I've had in years.There's also a huge amount of off-piste available. The risks of skiing the back country are relatively high given there's no avalanche bombing and the weather sets in quickly. We found this out when we started an off-piste itinerary in bright sunshine which soon became a white-out as the weather closed in. Accompanying the snow showers was a dramatic fall in temperature, and when one of the lads hadn't arrived at the lift after an hour, we decided to contact the ski patrol. We were just pinpointing where we'd last seen him, when he rang. He'd got lost but luckily spotted a couple of boarders who were being guided back to the resort. He followed them and ended up walking out through chest deep powder. He dried his sweat-soaked clothing over the log stove in our favourite lunch spot - the 1,000m Hut. The 1000m Hut is what Niseko does best. A small traditional restaurant where the atmosphere is warm and friendly and the food reasonably-priced (750 yen for pork soup and rice). In fact, all the food on the hill is better value than in town where the portions are small and expensive. At one restaurant we were served one shrimp in a glass as a starter. Over lunch, Rocky Osaki, who works at the hut, tells us that Hokkaido is still mainly a rural island. He says a lot of the farming villages are disappearing as young Japanese are moving to the cities to find work and not returning. He manages a fishing centre and it is his dream that skiing will attract more foreign tourists who might also be keen to visit the more remote parts of the island where a foreign face is still a novelty. Outside the hut is an old bell which is rung by passing skiers. On the wall of the hut is the explanation: \"The bell of Mr Kosukegawa. His age was over 100 years. He loved to ski in Niseko. He built the bell to pray for the safety of the skiers. Now, he listens to the bell in heaven. Please ring the bell for Mr Kosukegawa\". The trick will be to deliver further proposed development without losing these traditional touches that give Niseko its charm.Tom Collinson is the writer of radio 4's Self Storage, which begins its second series in the autumn.Shizenkan offers backpacker private rooms for 14 nights (based on triple share) and a 13-day all mountain pass, plus airport transfers for \u00a3536 per person.Ski Independence offers 10 nights in Niseko from \u00a31,199 per person, including return flights from London Heathrow, return transfers and accommodation in the Niseko Apartments (4 star), based on two people sharing a one bedroom apartment.

Niseko village is small, arranged around one set of traffic lights. Everything is covered in metres-thick drifts, and the windows of the wooden guesthouses and bar doorways peek out from under their huge snow hats. The feel is traditional, yet touches of technology remind you you're in Japan. For instance, there's no ATM, yet the main road is heated. These contrasts are everywhere: young Japanese boarders plugged into their i-Pods, while 1940s-style loudspeakers blare across the pistes. The Higashiyama Prince Hotel rising up like a moon base, dwarfs our small green wooden backpacker's hostel, Shizenkan. Fish-tail flouro-painted boards on the slopes set against the hire shop board we were offered that Rolf Harris could have got a tune out of. Another reminder of where we are is the karaoke bar. We are greeted at the door by a \"song-pusher\", who thrusts paper and pencils in our hands and does a little jig to encourage us to sing. It doesn't work. There is a woman singing an intimidatingly pitch-perfect version of Christina Aguilera's \"Beautiful\". Then a bloke growls his way through something unrecognisable, threatening to set off several small avalanches.  Skiing attracts people that love barging you out of the way in a queue. In Niseko, it's more relaxed and friendly. There are always people on hand to help you on the gondolas or to brush the snow off the chairs before you sit down. They give it a brush even if there isn't any snow, suggesting this is a matter of courtesy. Admittedly there are hardly any queues to barge. As Hokkaido has a relatively small population, it means the slopes are often empty. More than 50% of the skiers who visit are Australian. Skiing in Japan is popular among Australians because of its accessibility compared to Europe and North America. As an Aussie guest at our hostel said, \"This was going to be a trip to Europe, until I looked at the price and realised I could come here for half the cost\". The Australian contingent fuels another contrast: the small but lively bars, like Splash and Wild Bill's, which have a completely different atmosphere to the restaurants which feel more Japanese. Lying back on cushions in our socks at low tables eating yakitori (grilled meats) off a skewer feels like the more authentic Japanese apr\u00e8s ski experience. Reliable snow has to be weighed against the lack of gradient and scale compared to the big North American or European ski areas, however. The runs tend to be short with few steep sections and not all are groomed. However, it keeps us interested not least because of the night skiing. Niseko has the best in the world. We ski every night apart from one when the temperature drops so low our nostrils start to freeze. My friends have invested in Hannibal Lector-style face masks, but I only have a thin scarf and my face nearly freezes off. But blasting down an empty run three abreast, in the dark, is the most snow-derived fun I've had in years.There's also a huge amount of off-piste available. The risks of skiing the back country are relatively high given there's no avalanche bombing and the weather sets in quickly. We found this out when we started an off-piste itinerary in bright sunshine which soon became a white-out as the weather closed in. Accompanying the snow showers was a dramatic fall in temperature, and when one of the lads hadn't arrived at the lift after an hour, we decided to contact the ski patrol. We were just pinpointing where we'd last seen him, when he rang. He'd got lost but luckily spotted a couple of boarders who were being guided back to the resort. He followed them and ended up walking out through chest deep powder. He dried his sweat-soaked clothing over the log stove in our favourite lunch spot - the 1,000m Hut. The 1000m Hut is what Niseko does best. A small traditional restaurant where the atmosphere is warm and friendly and the food reasonably-priced (750 yen for pork soup and rice). In fact, all the food on the hill is better value than in town where the portions are small and expensive. At one restaurant we were served one shrimp in a glass as a starter. Over lunch, Rocky Osaki, who works at the hut, tells us that Hokkaido is still mainly a rural island. He says a lot of the farming villages are disappearing as young Japanese are moving to the cities to find work and not returning. He manages a fishing centre and it is his dream that skiing will attract more foreign tourists who might also be keen to visit the more remote parts of the island where a foreign face is still a novelty. Outside the hut is an old bell which is rung by passing skiers. On the wall of the hut is the explanation: \"The bell of Mr Kosukegawa. His age was over 100 years. He loved to ski in Niseko. He built the bell to pray for the safety of the skiers. Now, he listens to the bell in heaven. Please ring the bell for Mr Kosukegawa\". The trick will be to deliver further proposed development without losing these traditional touches that give Niseko its charm.Tom Collinson is the writer of radio 4's Self Storage, which begins its second series in the autumn.Shizenkan offers backpacker private rooms for 14 nights (based on triple share) and a 13-day all mountain pass, plus airport transfers for \u00a3536 per person.Ski Independence offers 10 nights in Niseko from \u00a31,199 per person, including return flights from London Heathrow, return transfers and accommodation in the Niseko Apartments (4 star), based on two people sharing a one bedroom apartment.

By passing this legislation, Japan has demonstrated its willingness to stand with those who are trying to create a safer, more tolerant world.\"In an attempt to boost public support for the mission, the measures passed today will limit Japanese ships to refuelling vessels that are not directly involved in the conflict in Afghanistan.The Liberal Democratic party and its junior coalition partner, New Komeito, took the unusual step of using their huge majority in the more powerful lower house to push through the extension, just hours after it had been rejected by the upper house.It was the first time for more than half a century that a Japanese administration had used its constitutional right to override an upper house decision by a minimum two-thirds majority.The defence minister, Shigeru Ishiba, ordered the immediate mobilisation of the refuelling fleet, which is expected to leave port by the end of the month. Over the past six years Japanese ships have supplied about 132m gallons of fuel to US, British and other warships.Opponents of the mission accused the government of abusing its lower house majority, gained in 2005 during the popular premiership of Junichiro Koizumi.\"The most recent will of the people is reflected in the upper house,\" the Democrats' secretary general, Yukio Hatoyama, said.", "tags": ["World news", "Afghanistan", "Japan", "Middle East and North Africa", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan resumes Afghan war role"},{"date": "2008-03-20T13:13:57Z", "country": "japan", "content": "A robotic cat with magical powers has been enlisted by Japan's diplomatic corps to promote the country's popular culture overseas.No less a figure than the foreign minister, Masahiko Komura, this week appointed Doraemon, a popular cartoon character, as Japan's first \"animation ambassador.\"At a ceremony held in a ministry room usually reserved for receiving foreign dignitaries, the blue-and-white cat with no ears was given a certificate and a plate piled high with his favourite snack: dorayaki pancakes.In front of dozens of journalists, a straight-faced Komura said: \"Doraemon, I hope you will travel around the world as an anime ambassador and deepen people's understanding of Japan so they will become our friends.\"Doraemon's charm offensive will begin with the screening of his hit film, Nobita's Dinosaur 2006 at Japanese diplomatic offices in several countries, including China, France and Spain.The feline envoy - whose voice was provided by an actress hidden behind a sliding paper screen - promised to use his roving role to convey \"what ordinary Japanese people think, our lifestyles and what kind of future we want to build.\"Traditionalists may question his credentials, but Doraemon, the creation of cartoonist Fujiko F Fujio, seems a sensible choice.Having built huge following in Japan following his comic book debut in 1969, he has become instantly recognizable throughout East Asia: in 2002, Time magazine named him one of 22 Asian heroes.Doraemon's human counterparts would no doubt give anything to be able to possess similar powers to extricate themselves from the diplomatic quagmire.The robotic cat, who travels back in time from the 22nd century, has an array of futuristic gadgets tucked away in a \"fourth-dimensional\" bottomless pocket on his tummy. They include an \"anywhere door\" that enables him and his friends to travel anywhere and to any time they like.His appointment is part of a drive to harness the international popularity of Japanese manga - many of which are now being translated into other languages - to promote the country's soft power.Last year the then foreign minister - and self-confessed manga addict - Taro Aso, created a \"Nobel prize\" for international manga artists.In November, Astro Boy, an iconic cartoon character created in the 1950s, was named as Japan's envoy for overseas safety.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan enlists cartoon cat as ambassador"},{"date": "2008-03-10T11:15:55Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is to bow to international pressure and ban the possession of child pornography, although the new law is expected to anger child welfare groups by exempting manga comics and animated films.Media reports said the Liberal Democratic party and its junior coalition partner are drafting legislation that would bring Japan into line with most other developed countries, amid mounting criticism of its failure to address the sexual exploitation of minors.Currently, Japan and Russia are the only G8 countries in which it is still legal to own pornographic images of children provided they do not intend to sell them or post them on the internet.Japan is one of the world's biggest suppliers of child pornography and the second biggest consumer after the US, despite a 1999 law that banned the production, sale and distribution of images of children under 18.The government decided to act following scathing public criticism by the US ambassador to Tokyo, Thomas Schieffer. \"The term 'child pornography' misrepresents the heinous nature of this crime,\" Schieffer wrote in a recent newspaper article.\"Unlike some people in adult pornography, children are not willing or paid participants. The majority of images and videos depict the violent and brutal sexual assault of children, most of them younger than 12 years old. We are talking about child rape.\"This week Schieffer will discuss the measures with the justice minister, Kunio Hatoyama.\"This is a reprehensible market,\" Hatoyama said. \"It is true that the lack of a penalty for individual possession is serving as a loophole. As with narcotics, approval of possession could lead to distribution over the internet.\"Though they welcomed the new law, child welfare campaigners said they were dismayed that the legislation will almost certainly not apply to the huge market in manga and other forms of animation that sexually exploit children.\"We would like the revised law to cover manga, but it is extremely difficult,\" a spokeswoman for Unicef's Japan office told the Guardian.\"We keep encountering arguments about freedom of expression, but if the US and other countries can ban that kind of material, why does Japan continue to tolerate it?\"Saito said it was impossible to gauge the size of Japan's child pornography market because it includes illegal websites and DVDs featuring children who, in some cases, are much younger than 18.Figures show an alarming increase in demand for child pornography in Japan. Last year, 304 children under 18 were identified as victims, police said, up more than 20% from 2006 and the highest total since records began in 1999.While police prosecuted 25 child pornography cases in 1999, the figure had risen to 585 cases by 2006.Criminalising possession has widespread public support amid a slew of media reports about men offering money to girls in return for sexually explicit photographs via mobile phone dating sites.A survey last year found that about 70% of adults were in favour of banning possession, while almost 86% said manga and other illustrations should also be covered by the revised law.Sexually explicit comics account for a sizeable chunk of Japan's 500bn yen manga market. Many feature schoolgirls or childlike adults being raped or engaging in sadomasochism.Manga belonging to the popular \"lolicon\" - Japanese slang for Lolita complex - genre are likely to escape the ban, as MPs are concerned that outlawing them could infringe on freedom of expression and drive men who use them as an outlet for their sexual urges to commit more serious offences.Other critics of a far-reaching ban say the characters depicted in scores of lolicon titles are fictional and so are not being harmed.Police are responding to public concern over books carrying suggestive photographs of girls under 15 that are commonly sold alongside hardcore pornography.Among last year's most popular \"junior idol\" titles was Melty Pudding, featuring 9-year-old Rei Asamizu dressed in a bikini.But in a rare move, police earlier this year arrested the publisher of a book that contained photographs of a scantily dressed 14-year-old girl striking suggestive poses.\u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday March 11 2008.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Pornography", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan to outlaw possession of child porn"},{"date": "2008-03-29T00:15:42Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Which funds are the biggest losers from the credit crunch? Shares in banks? Commercial property? No, it's practically anything invested in Japan.At the end of 2005, Melchior Japan Opportunities was celebrating a 94.1% gain, putting it at the top of the table for all unit trusts over the year. Today it is rock bottom with a fall of 43.6% over the past year. Japan funds from Legg Mason, Axa Framlington, M&G and Schroder are all languishing among the bottom 10 unit trusts. The 2005 bounce in the Nikkei 225 share average was shortlived, and today confidence levels are at their lowest in a decade. One of the two Japan funds which is in positive territory over the past year is Neptune Japan Opportunities, run by Chris Taylor. But even he is deeply pessimistic about the outlook. In one anecdote after another, he tells me what a basket case Japan is. And it all comes down to demographics. \"This is a country where there are more funerals than weddings. Japan is in a demographic hole. Every year there are more people retiring than are entering the workforce. The people who are joining the workforce are on lower earnings than those who are retiring, and a lot of them are now in temporary or casual employment.\"Back in 2005, the belief was that the decade-long stranglehold of deflation and stagnation was now over. Employment was creeping up, property prices had stopped falling and the Nikkei 225 had broken through 16,200. But three years on it is trading below 12,000, as the hoped-for 'broadening out' of the recovery and the return of the consumer failed to materialise. \"The amount of yen being earned by those in employment is in year-on-year decline. There are fewer people and they are earning less money. Just where is consumer demand going to come from? You do wonder how they are ever going to solve the problem,\" says Taylor. Of course, it is not all doom and gloom. One of his preferred stocks is Nintendo. It has been just about everybody's favourite stock in Japan since it brought out the top-selling Wii games console and is still struggling to cope with demand from stores worldwide. \"The Wii is the only games product that has won customers outside of the traditional gaming categories. It's a big hit in nursing homes. When it's freely available maybe I'll sell out,\" he says.\"One of the attractions of Nintendo is that they don't just make money from selling consoles. They make so much more from selling the games software, and unlike the others they write most of it themselves.\"There are other bright spots on the Japanese corporate landscape. Taylor's favourite stock is Unicharm Petcare. The Japanese may not be having any children, but they do have lots of dogs. And Unicharm has a new wonder product: doggy diapers. They're big in Japan, and about to launch globally. But the country has suffered a double whammy: the bursting of the asset price bubble of the 1980s and the hollowing out of the economy by Chinese competition. Yes, there are still world-class manufacturers such as Toyota and Sony. But the \"mom and pop\" smaller companies that for decades provided the nuts and bolts for the giant companies, are crumbling. \"Around two-thirds of the Japanese economy is made up of companies with fewer than 10 workers. But a hollowing out of the economy is going on, and big companies are using China as the source of cheap, low-tech components,\" says Taylor.\"Effectively there are two economies; the global exporting companies which lead their sectors, and the smaller companies hooked into a shrinking domestic economy.\" As a fund manager, it means you want to be firmly invested in big-cap stocks. The last corporate results season showed mid-cap profits declining by 12% and smaller company profits by 40%. At large cap companies, earnings rose, albeit by a miserable 1.3%. Does Japan's experience in handling an asset price implosion and illiquidity in the banks in the early 1990s provide any lessons in how to handle a credit crunch? Taylor is not so sure. Between 1987 and 2002 he was at Fuji Bank, and saw first-hand an inability by senior management to face up to problems. Corporately, he says, they have a habit of brushing things under the carpet. Even when the banks were quasi-nationalised in the early 1990s, it failed to solve the problem. \"Cutting rates and pumping in liquidity was like pushing on a piece of string,\" he says. \"Every time they got some capital, they wrote off some loans. But even today they have got non-performing assets. They don't seem to have a mentality in which you 'fess up to mistakes and get on with it.\" Japanese politics remains gridlocked and desperately unable to achieve fundamental structural reform. Last September, Yasuo Fukuda became the 91st prime minister. Though Taylor rates him an \"experienced political operator\", he says \"he is unlikely to come up with any great political initiatives, so the policy paralysis will remain\".As for Unicharm's dog diapers, let's hope they're not a pile of poo.", "tags": ["Investment funds", "Investments", "Shares", "Money"], "title": "Japan in the doghouse"},{"date": "2008-02-18T14:54:35Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I am sitting in an onsen, an open-air hot volcanic pool, looking at a Japanese guy meditating with an inch of fresh powder on his head.

A stimulus package announced by George Bush last week failed to raise confidence among investors from Wall Street to London.In Tokyo they offloaded shares amid fears that a US economic slowdown will weaken demand for exports, damaging Japan's attempts to keep its own economic recovery on track.Financial stocks were battered for a second day, with Mizuho Financial falling 8.2% and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial by 7.8%.\"It's like a funeral in here,\" Ken Masuda, a senior equities dealer at Shinko Securities, told Reuters.\"No one knows what is going to happen tonight in New York. It's like we've gone blind - you don't know what's coming. Until we see New York, all we can do is sell.\"With the government insisting it had no immediate plans to take action, the pace of this week's falls appear to have wrong-footed officials.\"Stock markets across the world are falling and it basically stems from the US,\" the economy minister, Hiroko Ota, said. \"It is difficult at the moment to consider Japan taking action alone. Instead we need to cooperate globally.\"The yen's recent strength against the dollar, meanwhile, is hitting exporters' overseas earnings and damaging sentiment. Shares in Toyota, Japan's biggest carmaker, fell 7.2% to 4,880 yen (\u00a323) today; Sony, meanwhile, lost 6.9% to close at 5,110 yen.The Bank of Japan governor, Toshihiko Fukui, warned that the impact on Japan of the US slowdown was turning out to be worse than expected.The central bank, which today left interest rates unchanged at 0.5%, said Japan's economic recovery remained on track but that the pace of expansion would slow.\"All in all, it remains likely that the Japanese economy will sustain its growth with stable prices, while a favourable cycle of output, income and spending remains in place,\" he told reporters.\"While the global economy continues to expand with areas in growth spreading, we are paying attention especially to the US economy. Private consumption and capital investment remain on a moderate rising trend there, but there are prolonged adjustments in the housing market.\"The unemployment rate is also rising somewhat recently. A slowdown in the US economy is intensifying. We need to continue to watch developments in the sub-prime problems and their impact.\"Some analysts said Fukui's remarks hinted at an underlying caution that could reveal itself in the coming weeks.\"Fukui is not acting hawkish,\" said Seiji Shiraishi of HSBC Securities Japan. \"His comments about uncertainty over the outlook in the economy suggest that he is toning down his view in accordance with market moves.\"If upcoming hard data turn out weak, Fukui could revise his view on the underlying economy downward.\"", "tags": ["Business", "Japan", "Nikkei", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan meltdown continues"},{"date": "2008-01-18T09:54:13Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The reputation of Japan's paper industry lay in tatters today after the market leader, Oji Paper, admitted it had lied for more than a decade about the volume of recycled paper used in some of its products.The revelation comes days after the country's second-biggest paper company, Nippon Paper Group, admitted it had made similarly false claims.In one case Oji Paper said the amount of recycled paper in its copy and printing paper was as high as 50% when the real figure was between 5% and 10%.The firm's envelopes contained, at most, 30% of recycled paper, although consumers had been led to believe it was as high as 70%. Some products contained no recycled material at all.\"We had let the ratio of recycled paper fall amid rising shipments while the amount of recycled paper did not grow,\" Oji Paper's president, Kazuhisa Shinoda, told reporters in Tokyo.Shinoda said he would not resign over the scandal but apologised for misleading consumers. The fabrication, he said, had \"betrayed public trust and we apologise to our clients and customers\".Nippon Paper's president, Masatomo Nakamura, said he would resign to take responsibility for the scandal.Oji Paper and Nippon Paper are among five firms accused of misleading customers about the recycled-paper content of product lines, including millions of New Year's greetings cards.The scandal dragged down shares in paper companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. Nippon Paper's shares plummeted 10% to 267,000 yen (\u00a3128) after the copier maker Fuji Xerox and other firms said they would stop selling its products.

By passing this legislation, Japan has demonstrated its willingness to stand with those who are trying to create a safer, more tolerant world.\"In an attempt to boost public support for the mission, the measures passed today will limit Japanese ships to refuelling vessels that are not directly involved in the conflict in Afghanistan.The Liberal Democratic party and its junior coalition partner, New Komeito, took the unusual step of using their huge majority in the more powerful lower house to push through the extension, just hours after it had been rejected by the upper house.It was the first time for more than half a century that a Japanese administration had used its constitutional right to override an upper house decision by a minimum two-thirds majority.The defence minister, Shigeru Ishiba, ordered the immediate mobilisation of the refuelling fleet, which is expected to leave port by the end of the month. Over the past six years Japanese ships have supplied about 132m gallons of fuel to US, British and other warships.Opponents of the mission accused the government of abusing its lower house majority, gained in 2005 during the popular premiership of Junichiro Koizumi.\"The most recent will of the people is reflected in the upper house,\" the Democrats' secretary general, Yukio Hatoyama, said.", "tags": ["World news", "Afghanistan", "Japan", "Middle East and North Africa", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan resumes Afghan war role"},{"date": "2008-03-20T13:13:57Z", "country": "japan", "content": "A robotic cat with magical powers has been enlisted by Japan's diplomatic corps to promote the country's popular culture overseas.No less a figure than the foreign minister, Masahiko Komura, this week appointed Doraemon, a popular cartoon character, as Japan's first \"animation ambassador.\"At a ceremony held in a ministry room usually reserved for receiving foreign dignitaries, the blue-and-white cat with no ears was given a certificate and a plate piled high with his favourite snack: dorayaki pancakes.In front of dozens of journalists, a straight-faced Komura said: \"Doraemon, I hope you will travel around the world as an anime ambassador and deepen people's understanding of Japan so they will become our friends.\"Doraemon's charm offensive will begin with the screening of his hit film, Nobita's Dinosaur 2006 at Japanese diplomatic offices in several countries, including China, France and Spain.The feline envoy - whose voice was provided by an actress hidden behind a sliding paper screen - promised to use his roving role to convey \"what ordinary Japanese people think, our lifestyles and what kind of future we want to build.\"Traditionalists may question his credentials, but Doraemon, the creation of cartoonist Fujiko F Fujio, seems a sensible choice.Having built huge following in Japan following his comic book debut in 1969, he has become instantly recognizable throughout East Asia: in 2002, Time magazine named him one of 22 Asian heroes.Doraemon's human counterparts would no doubt give anything to be able to possess similar powers to extricate themselves from the diplomatic quagmire.The robotic cat, who travels back in time from the 22nd century, has an array of futuristic gadgets tucked away in a \"fourth-dimensional\" bottomless pocket on his tummy. They include an \"anywhere door\" that enables him and his friends to travel anywhere and to any time they like.His appointment is part of a drive to harness the international popularity of Japanese manga - many of which are now being translated into other languages - to promote the country's soft power.Last year the then foreign minister - and self-confessed manga addict - Taro Aso, created a \"Nobel prize\" for international manga artists.In November, Astro Boy, an iconic cartoon character created in the 1950s, was named as Japan's envoy for overseas safety.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan enlists cartoon cat as ambassador"},{"date": "2008-03-10T11:15:55Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is to bow to international pressure and ban the possession of child pornography, although the new law is expected to anger child welfare groups by exempting manga comics and animated films.Media reports said the Liberal Democratic party and its junior coalition partner are drafting legislation that would bring Japan into line with most other developed countries, amid mounting criticism of its failure to address the sexual exploitation of minors.Currently, Japan and Russia are the only G8 countries in which it is still legal to own pornographic images of children provided they do not intend to sell them or post them on the internet.Japan is one of the world's biggest suppliers of child pornography and the second biggest consumer after the US, despite a 1999 law that banned the production, sale and distribution of images of children under 18.The government decided to act following scathing public criticism by the US ambassador to Tokyo, Thomas Schieffer. \"The term 'child pornography' misrepresents the heinous nature of this crime,\" Schieffer wrote in a recent newspaper article.\"Unlike some people in adult pornography, children are not willing or paid participants. The majority of images and videos depict the violent and brutal sexual assault of children, most of them younger than 12 years old. We are talking about child rape.\"This week Schieffer will discuss the measures with the justice minister, Kunio Hatoyama.\"This is a reprehensible market,\" Hatoyama said. \"It is true that the lack of a penalty for individual possession is serving as a loophole. As with narcotics, approval of possession could lead to distribution over the internet.\"Though they welcomed the new law, child welfare campaigners said they were dismayed that the legislation will almost certainly not apply to the huge market in manga and other forms of animation that sexually exploit children.\"We would like the revised law to cover manga, but it is extremely difficult,\" a spokeswoman for Unicef's Japan office told the Guardian.\"We keep encountering arguments about freedom of expression, but if the US and other countries can ban that kind of material, why does Japan continue to tolerate it?\"Saito said it was impossible to gauge the size of Japan's child pornography market because it includes illegal websites and DVDs featuring children who, in some cases, are much younger than 18.Figures show an alarming increase in demand for child pornography in Japan. Last year, 304 children under 18 were identified as victims, police said, up more than 20% from 2006 and the highest total since records began in 1999.While police prosecuted 25 child pornography cases in 1999, the figure had risen to 585 cases by 2006.Criminalising possession has widespread public support amid a slew of media reports about men offering money to girls in return for sexually explicit photographs via mobile phone dating sites.A survey last year found that about 70% of adults were in favour of banning possession, while almost 86% said manga and other illustrations should also be covered by the revised law.Sexually explicit comics account for a sizeable chunk of Japan's 500bn yen manga market. Many feature schoolgirls or childlike adults being raped or engaging in sadomasochism.Manga belonging to the popular \"lolicon\" - Japanese slang for Lolita complex - genre are likely to escape the ban, as MPs are concerned that outlawing them could infringe on freedom of expression and drive men who use them as an outlet for their sexual urges to commit more serious offences.Other critics of a far-reaching ban say the characters depicted in scores of lolicon titles are fictional and so are not being harmed.Police are responding to public concern over books carrying suggestive photographs of girls under 15 that are commonly sold alongside hardcore pornography.Among last year's most popular \"junior idol\" titles was Melty Pudding, featuring 9-year-old Rei Asamizu dressed in a bikini.But in a rare move, police earlier this year arrested the publisher of a book that contained photographs of a scantily dressed 14-year-old girl striking suggestive poses.\u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday March 11 2008.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Pornography", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan to outlaw possession of child porn"},{"date": "2008-03-07T14:43:23Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The Japanese government is heading for a messy confrontation in parliament next week after naming Toshiro Muto as its choice to replace Toshihiko Fukui as the Bank of Japan governor.The Democrats, the biggest opposition party, have threatened to oppose Muto's appointment, citing concerns over his close ties to the finance ministry. Muto, a former high-ranking ministry official, is currently Fukui's deputy at the central bank.Government officials warned that further delays to the selection process could damage international confidence in Japan's economy, and urged MPs to ensure a new governor is in place by the time Fukui steps down on March 19.\"Having the governor's seat go vacant simply won't be allowed,\" Fukushiro Nukaga, the finance minister, said.But opposition MPs hinted that they would oppose Muto's appointment because he risked compromising the bank's independence.\"We have been saying at informal meetings that it would be hard to accept Muto if he is nominated,\" Kenji Yamaoka, the Democrats' parliamentary affairs chief, told reporters.Speculation is mounting that the party may instead propose Yutaka Yamaguchi, a former BoJ deputy governor, before the candidates are questioned in parliament early next week.The appointment requires the approval of both houses of the Japanese parliament; Democrat and other opposition MPs will be able to block Muto's selection because they won control of the upper house in elections last August.Whatever his identity, the new governor is not expected to take monetary policy in a new direction, however.\"No matter who takes over the head position at the Bank of Japan, the bank's stance on rates will probably remain unchanged,\" Tohru Sasaki of JP Morgan Chase Bank told the Associated Press.The Nikkei business newspaper urged MPs to reach agreement quickly. \"This abnormal situation will undoubtedly erode Japan's credibility on the international stage,\" it said. \"As the end of the governor's term approaches, we are being forced to confront a nightmare.\"Today the bank's board kept rates on hold at 0.5% at Fukui's final meeting as governor.", "tags": ["Japan", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Showdown over Bank of Japan appointment"},{"date": "2008-06-24T09:45:02Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan aims to restart solar subsidies next year >>Source: ReutersJapan aims to reintroduce subsidies on solar power equipment next year to help generate demand until technological innovation brings prices down.Anger at calm in whaling waters >>Source: BBC NewsThe annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has opened in Santiago without the usual war of words between pro and anti-whaling nations.

Unlike the EU, which imposes a cap-and-trade system to bind polluters to mandatory emissions limits, Japan has encouraged voluntary reduction pledges from industry. Some Japanese industries, such as steelmakers, oppose a European-style system, saying it would hurt their global competitiveness. Fukuda proposed raising the proportion of Japan's energy from \"zero-emission power\" sources, such as nuclear, solar, wind and hydro power, to more than 50% from the current 40%. He said an environment tax should be considered as part of overall tax reforms to be debated later this year.

Other countries are abolishing the death penalty, or using it less.\"Having carried out just one execution in 2005, Japan operated a de facto moratorium for 15 months until 2006 after the justice minister at the time, Seiken Sugiura, refused to sign execution orders because he said the death penalty conflicted with his Buddhist beliefs.Japan has since executed 23 people, including nine last year - the highest number since 1976.The prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, said today he would not bow to international pressure just weeks before the G8 leaders are due to meet in Japan, the only industrialised country apart from the US to retain capital punishment.\"In Japan, the majority view is that capital punishment should be maintained, so I feel no need to change what we have continued doing until now,\" he said in an interview with news agencies from G8 countries.In an attempt to deflect criticism of the secrecy surrounding executions, the justice ministry last December began making the names of hanged men public, along with details of their crimes.

The prime minister said an interim target would be made in the future, adding that Japan could cut its current greenhouse gas emissions by 14% by 2020.Fukuda's comments came in a speech a month before he is due to host a G8 summit at which global warming will be high on the agenda.Japan is the world's second-largest economy and the world's fifth-largest emitter of greenhouses gases.Tokyo would also contribute up to $1.2bn (\u00a3600,000) to a new multilateral fund with the US and Britain to help developing countries fight global warming, Fukuda said. \"When talking about the near future, we no longer have the luxury of encouraging others or spending time playing a game of setting targets for political propaganda.\" Kathrin Gutmann, WWF climate policy coordinator, said the organisation was disappointed at Fukuda's proposals.She chided him for setting the base year for reductions at current levels rather than 1990, as used by the European Union. Japan's emissions had risen since then, she said. \"The G8 leaders need to make concrete steps forward to a low-carbon world, and Japan's Prime Minister Fukuda needs to push hard to trigger that leadership.\"In this light, Fukuda presents only a blurred vision, and the lack of a 2020 target for emissions reduction is utterly disappointing.\"Japan hopes to clinch an agreement on a \"shared vision\" to halve global emissions by the middle of the century at next month's G8 summit, where big emerging countries, such as China and India, will be attending a session on climate change. \"It is impossible to achieve this goal without the participation of major emitter countries and unless all the countries of the world take part in some form,\" Fukuda said. Developing countries and the European Union, which has set a target of reducing emissions by 20% by 2020, argue that rich nations should take the lead, setting bold 2020 targets for reducing emissions.But the US \u2013 which, with China, is one of the world's biggest emitters - has said it will accept binding emissions curbs only on the condition that major emerging countries do the same, which they have so far refused to do so.Washington's stance may change after a new president takes office, in January 2009. Opposition party lawmakers and environmentalists had urged Fukuda to take a bold stance on an interim target to persuade industry and voters to get serious about climate change and convince emerging countries to join a new global framework. Today the opposition Democratic party said Fukuda had watered down his proposals. \"The content is extremely meagre,\" said the Democratic lawmaker Katsuya Fukuda, sponsor of a bill to set a midterm target to cut emissions by 25% from 1990 levels. \"It is completely unclear how he will confront the G8 summit with such content and what he will try to achieve.\" Fukuda said Japan would in the autumn introduce a trial system for carbon trading, seen as one effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But he steered clear of giving a date for the launch of a full-scale trading scheme. Unlike the EU, which imposes a cap-and-trade system to bind polluters to mandatory emissions limits, Japan has encouraged voluntary reduction pledges from industry. Some Japanese industries, such as steelmakers, oppose a European-style system, saying it would hurt their global competitiveness. Fukuda proposed raising the proportion of Japan's energy from \"zero-emission power\" sources, such as nuclear, solar, wind and hydro power, to more than 50% from the current 40%. He said an environment tax should be considered as part of overall tax reforms to be debated later this year.

Shinji Mutsuda, 37, who packed the remains of his two victims into a concrete-filled box and threw them into the sea, was executed in Osaka, the ministry said.Today's hangings come days after a man armed with a knife killed seven people and injured 10 others on a street in Tokyo's Akihabara district.Police said today they had arrested four people who allegedly threatened to carry out copycat killings in posts sent to online message boards.\"I'm sick of it all,\" one suspect, an unemployed 29-year-old man, wrote on the popular 2-Channel site, before threatening to \"kill 100 people\" in the busy Ikebukuro district of Tokyo.Tomohiro Kato, the suspect in the Akihabara attack, had posted similar threats from his mobile phone before embarking on his stabbing spree.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Human rights", "Capital punishment", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Death penalty: Japan executes three prisoners"},{"date": "2008-06-16T10:24:44Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan and China are on the verge of ending a long-running battle over potentially lucrative energy sources in the East China Sea with an agreement to jointly develop gas fields along their disputed maritime border.The deal, which has yet to be confirmed, comes soon after the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, and the Japanese prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, vowed to end the dispute during a summit in Tokyo last month.Japan says it has identified the equivalent of 92m barrels of oil in the area, but both countries agree that further exploration could reveal much bigger quantities.Negotiations started after China unilaterally began explorations in the area in 2004 amid accusations that it would also tap into deposits on the Japanese side of the disputed border.Although demarcation of their overlapping maritime territory has yet to be settled, the two sides agreed to give private firms the go-ahead to start drilling and to take profits commensurate with their respective investments, the Kyodo news agency reported.An official announcement is expected later this week, it said.", "tags": ["Japan", "China", "World news", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "China and Japan reach gas deal"},{"date": "2008-06-01T23:01:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "It is healthy on occasion to visit a country that is not suffering a meltdown in its credit or housing market and where there is quiet confidence that the slowdown gripping Britain and the United States may leave it relatively unscathed.Having contributed little to world growth for more than 10 years as it suffered a \"lost decade\" of stagnation and deflation, Japan, the world's second-largest economy, has quietly plugged itself into Asia's expansion and is hopeful it has \"decoupled\" from the US. And for a country that is totally dependent on imported oil, there is also remarkably little panic about the recent highs in world oil prices.For one thing, Japan has seen a big increase in demand for things such as luxury cars and capital goods from the oil-producing countries, thus cushioning it, to some extent at least, from the effects of dearer energy.Also important is that Japan has very little exposure to the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Japan can be thankful that its own property crash in the early 1990s means it has not seen a boom in house prices in recent years. This is because its banks remained cautious about over-lending on property while consumers, scarred by those house price falls of 80% or 90%, have no appetite for property speculation. In fact the total losses of the Japanese banking system to sub-prime mortgages look to have been less than \u00a35bn, a fraction of the sorts of losses being run up in Britain and the US.\"There is a 50:50 chance of a mild recession this year but we think it will be mild and short with a recovery occurring later this year,\" says Takahide Kiuchi, chief economist at Nomura bank in Tokyo. \"There is no serious credit crunch in Japan and in any case Japan is decoupling gradually from the US.\"He points to the fact that in 2007 Japanese exports to China outstripped those to the US for the first time ever.And recent data showed the Japanese economy grew at an annualised pace of 3.3% in the first quarter of this year, stronger than most analysts had expected. Data last week on industrial production and consumer spending, though, were weaker than expected and showed that the strain is beginning to be felt. But Japan has enjoyed respectable growth for the past six years, its longest uninterrupted expansion for a century, thanks in part to the Bank of Japan running interest rates at, or close to, zero. The country's long-running deflation seems to be finally over, with inflation running at just over 1%.Senior officials say the economy has become much more stable as it has plugged into the booming economies of Asia, exporting everything from consumer goods to machine tools. But not everyone is convinced, with some worried that as Asia slows in response to lower exports to a recession-hit US, Japan's exports will suffer, as will its consumers, whose spending will be hit by higher fuel prices.Little gained\"Japan might plunge into recession. Exports are already in a downturn and while domestic consumption should help an economy in a downturn, that is very sluggish here in Japan,\" says Masayuki Naoshima, of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan, which is increasingly confident that it may soon finally oust the Liberal Democratic Party from power after more than 60 years.He is hoping the party can capitalise on the growing discontent with the considerable economic problems that lie beneath the outwardly healthy picture. He points to growing inequality within a country that used to be famous for the narrow gap between rich and poor.Japan's lost decade pushed the country's wealth down sharply in the world league. It has slipped from second place in terms of national income per head to 18th. Wage growth has been almost non-existent for years as manufacturers have shifted jobs to China at an even faster pace than Britain has done. Japan has shed 3 million manufacturing jobs in the past decade, compared with 1 million in the UK.Bizarre though it may seem, many in Japan envy Britain's job creation record in the service sector, although not the huge trade deficit that has resulted from the UK's recent consumer boom.Unemployment stands at 4% - relatively low by international standards but high compared with Japan's post-war decades of full employment and the highest figure since September last year. There has also been a huge change in the labour market in recent years, with Japan's \"jobs-for-life\" culture having been sharply eroded. About a third of all jobs are now temporary or part-time, and the wages are poor.Naoshima says that about a third of the workforce have annual earnings of 2m yen [\u00a310,000] or less. A small manufacturing business in Tokyo told the Guardian its workers were earning \u00a31,500-\u00a32,000 a month for a 50-hour week.\"The big companies in Japan tell us we have to produce at Chinese prices,\" says Yukinori Kida, who runs a small factory producing specialised ceramic screws that he manages to sell all over the world. \"Unless you have very original products, you lose out.\"In fact, not unlike Britain, innovation is the word on everyone's lips in Tokyo as the Japanese try to figure out how to stay ahead in an ever more competitive global marketplace.Yutaka Asai, chief technology officer at Oki, thinks Japanese spending on research and development, which is very high by international standards, can keep the country going for another decade. \"But in 20 years' time, who knows? It will depend on whether we can keep our knowledge advantage.\"Nothing venturedJapanese policymakers fret that though their big companies such as Toshiba, Sony and so on are constantly evolving new products, Japan does not seem to produce the start-ups that burst out of nowhere and drive immense change, helped by a vibrant venture capital industry hungry for the next big innovation.\"Japan will not change that much if we don't produce the Googles,\" says Takafumi Yamamoto, who runs Tokyo University's technology-licensing operation, which spins off innovations into the private sector. He thinks big companies do not innovate fast enough and is trying to improve collaboration between universities and industry, something that is surprisingly lacking in Japan.Yuji Tokumasu, of the Ministry of Economics, Trade and Industry, agrees: \"We have to create the success stories. We need to change because the big companies don't take risks any more. We need to create a virtuous circle.\"METI has just unveiled a new, government-backed venture capital fund in a bid to boost entrepreneurship. The government is also very keen to boost foreign direct investment into Japan, which it believes would bring in fresh capital and ideas - the country attracts only 3% of global FDI, easily the lowest share of any major economy. But the rejection by METI of an attempt by the British hedge fund TCI to double its stake in the Japanese utility J-Power to 20% has questioned its sincerity.Though many Japanese concerns are mirrored in Britain, the attitude towards immigration is entirely the opposite. The Japanese, facing a shrinking and ageing population, are thinking they need more, rather than less, immigration, particularly of nurses and doctors to look after them as they grow old.The government, too, is wondering how it will have enough working people to support a growing number of pensioners. It is facing a much bigger fiscal problem than Britain. Though its annual budget deficit is about 4% of national income, its total government debt is stuck at about 180% of gross domestic product, nearly four times the UK's and a legacy of the purchases of the banks' non-performing loans in the lost decade.A government official said the country would need to run a budget surplus for \"many, many years\" to shrink that debt. And that means tax rises and spending cuts. No wonder the government is unpopular.3.3% Japan's annual growth rate, based on the first quarter of this year3m Manufacturing jobs lost in the past decade - compared with the UK's 1m4% Japan's unemployment rate - compared with Britain's 5.2%ashley.seager@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Japan", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan continues climb out of lost decade"},{"date": "2008-07-14T10:03:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "NHK, Japan's public service broadcaster, has banned share dealings by its journalists and all staff, totalling 5,700 employees, who have access to its news information management system.

A single bag emits 75 grams of carbon dioxide, 44% of which comes from growing potatoes, with another 30% emitted during the production stage. The packaging accounts for a further 15%, while the delivery and disposal of the bag account for 9% and 2%, respectively.About 30 companies will display their labeled items at an eco-products fair in Tokyo in December, and the first batches are expected to appear in shops at the beginning of April 2009.Sapporo, a leading Japanese brewery, has already said it will carry the labels on cans of its popular Black Label beer. Shoppers will be told how much CO2 is emitted by the machinery used to plant barley and hops, during production and transportation, and when the empty can is recycled.Although the labeling scheme is voluntary, few firms want to be seen to be lagging behind rivals in the rush to corner the growing market in eco-friendly products. The supermarket firm Aeon, as well as the convenience store chains Lawson and Seven-Eleven and the electronics maker Matsushita are among the firms taking part.As host of the groundbreaking Kyoto conference on greenhouse gas emissions in 1997, Japan is under mounting pressure to use it technological prowess and educated consumer base to promote a low-carbon society. But it has so far struggled to reach its Kyoto protocol commitment to slash CO2 emissions by 6% below 1990 levels by 2012.In July, the government vowed to reduce total carbon emissions by up to 80% by 2050 with the prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, calling on consumers to lead a global \"CO2 reduction revolution\".Under Fukuda's Cool Earth Initiative, Japan believes it can lower emissions from current levels by 14% by 2020, although UN scientists say cuts as high as 40% will be needed to avoid environmental catastrophe.Later this year Japanese firms will experiment with a carbon trading system modeled on the one used by the European Union. The government plans to put carbon-capture technology - the storage of CO2 emitted by power plants and factories - in place by 2020.But it remains to be seen whether consumers can be persuaded to consider a product's carbon footprint as well as its price tag. In a recent survey almost 80% of shoppers said they would be willing to spend no more than an extra 2,000 yen (\u00a310) a month on energy-saving vehicles and other eco-friendly products.\"Most people don't know what the term carbon footprint really means,\" Inamura said. \"But we hope this will be a launch pad for other companies to take part and increase public awareness.\"\u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday August 21 2008.

Next they are comparing the wine's acidity to Freddie Mercury's voice.If the standard wine manual is not for you, the manga comic series Kami no Shizuku (The Drops of God) may be just the thing to show you the difference between Burgundy and Bordeaux while keeping you gripped. Written under a nom de plume by Japanese brother and sister Shin and Yuko Kibayashi, who became wine enthusiasts after tasting an amazing Burgundy, the comic is the story of a young man, Shizuku, who discovers the beauty of wine after his father, a famous wine critic, dies and leaves an unusual will: a description of 12 wines he considers to be the best in the world, comparing them to Jesus Christ's disciples. The first person to find these \"disciples\" will inherit the father's wine collection, a contest that pits Shizuku against his adoptive brother, Issey Tomine, who works as a sommelier. Shizuku has no previous knowledge about wine but, with his strong senses of taste and smell, what he learnt from his father and the support of his friends, he submerges himself in the world of wine and tries to solve the mysteries of the disciple wines. The unique style of wine reviewing in Kami no Shizuku has rocked Japan, as well as the growing wine scenes of China and Korea, and boosted European wine sales in the process. \"The minute it was translated into Korean, we had calls from three importers,\" says Basaline Granger Despagne, the producer of the Ch\u00e2teau Mont-P\u00e9rat, whose family has made wine near the Dordogne river for 250 years.Appealing to young readers and a range of budgets - wines costing \u00a35 can spark just as much excitement among the characters as the fine Bordeaux - the comic was published in French earlier this year (as Les Gouttes de Dieu), and may make it into English one day soon.

A single bag emits 75 grams of carbon dioxide, 44% of which comes from growing potatoes, with another 30% emitted during the production stage. The packaging accounts for a further 15%, while the delivery and disposal of the bag account for 9% and 2%, respectively.About 30 companies will display their labeled items at an eco-products fair in Tokyo in December, and the first batches are expected to appear in shops at the beginning of April 2009.Sapporo, a leading Japanese brewery, has already said it will carry the labels on cans of its popular Black Label beer. Shoppers will be told how much CO2 is emitted by the machinery used to plant barley and hops, during production and transportation, and when the empty can is recycled.Although the labeling scheme is voluntary, few firms want to be seen to be lagging behind rivals in the rush to corner the growing market in eco-friendly products. The supermarket firm Aeon, as well as the convenience store chains Lawson and Seven-Eleven and the electronics maker Matsushita are among the firms taking part.As host of the groundbreaking Kyoto conference on greenhouse gas emissions in 1997, Japan is under mounting pressure to use it technological prowess and educated consumer base to promote a low-carbon society. But it has so far struggled to reach its Kyoto protocol commitment to slash CO2 emissions by 6% below 1990 levels by 2012.In July, the government vowed to reduce total carbon emissions by up to 80% by 2050 with the prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, calling on consumers to lead a global \"CO2 reduction revolution\".Under Fukuda's Cool Earth Initiative, Japan believes it can lower emissions from current levels by 14% by 2020, although UN scientists say cuts as high as 40% will be needed to avoid environmental catastrophe.Later this year Japanese firms will experiment with a carbon trading system modeled on the one used by the European Union. The government plans to put carbon-capture technology - the storage of CO2 emitted by power plants and factories - in place by 2020.But it remains to be seen whether consumers can be persuaded to consider a product's carbon footprint as well as its price tag. In a recent survey almost 80% of shoppers said they would be willing to spend no more than an extra 2,000 yen (\u00a310) a month on energy-saving vehicles and other eco-friendly products.\"Most people don't know what the term carbon footprint really means,\" Inamura said. \"But we hope this will be a launch pad for other companies to take part and increase public awareness.\"\u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday August 21 2008.

But so many Italians and other tourists do the same thing that, as a cathedral official, Paolo Bianchi, acknowledged: \"We have staff whose sole job every day is to rub out pierced hearts, declarations of love and travel graffiti.\"In a nation whose prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, is busy giving himself blanket immunity from prosecution, no one would dream of taking the matter further. But when a Japanese holidaymaker photographed a series of graffiti in his own language, it unleashed what the daily La Repubblica termed a \"manhunt\" involving appeals for information in two of Japan's biggest newspapers, on national television and in online forums.One of the guilty, who left her initials and the name of her university, at Gifu, in Japan, was soon traced. She and two fellow students have since been given two-month suspensions and may yet return to Florence to remove the graffiti. Their university offered to pay damages to the cathedral, which the cathedral authorities politely refused.An even more severe fate may await three students at Kyoto Sangyo University who confessed that they too had defaced the marble walls supporting Filippo Brunelleschi's sublime dome.

This month the Bank of England slashed interest rates to 2%, their lowest level in 57 years, and is reportedly considering another cut when its board meets next month.The central bank governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, described the decline in the global economy as \"the most rapid in our lifetime\" and said he could not rule out further cuts.However, Shirakawa said the decision to cut rates and buy more assets to give firms easier access to funds did not mark a return to quantitative easing, a policy it pursued for five years from 2001 under which it flooded the banking system with huge sums of money to promote lending.\"No one on the bank's board seems to think that boosting base money would stimulate the economy,\" he told reporters.Concern is mounting that the rise of the yen, which last week reached a 13-year high against the dollar, would continue to batter Japanese exports and corporate earnings. Car and electronics makers have slashed output and profit forecasts as consumers around the world choose to hold on to what little cash they have. Though there was no return to quantitative easing, the bank said it would ease the pressure on corporate funding, as the government warned the world's second-biggest economy would register zero growth in fiscal 2009.The cabinet office said it expected gross domestic production through to next March to contract by 0.8%, having forecast growth of 1.3% in July.The government said negative growth could be avoided by a moderate recovery in consumer spending as a result of two recently unveiled stimulus packages.In a statement, the BoJ admitted global financial conditions had \"deteriorated sharply\".It said weak exports and a decline in domestic demand, as well as worsening unemployment, had prompted it to act. \"Under these circumstances economic conditions have been deteriorating and are likely to increase in severity for the immediate future,\" it said.\"Given the slowdown in overseas economies and the turmoil in global financial markets, it will likely take some time for the necessary conditions for Japan's economic recovery to be satisfied.\"The bank said it would keep a close watch on the economies of Europe and the US, and expected Japanese banks to \"take full advantage\" of the rate cut in its lending practices, warning that \"pressures acting to depress economic activity from the financial side may become more marked\".The BoJ said it would help firms gain access to new funds by increasing its outright purchase of Japanese government bonds to \u00a51.4 trillion (\u00a310.3bn) per month from \u00a51.2tn, and temporarily buying commercial paper - a form of short-term unsecured borrowing - outright.The finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, welcomed the cut but echoed the bank's gloomy predictions about the economy.\"I think the BOJ made its decision based on an earnest assessment of the economic and financial situation,\" he told reporters. \"Looking at employment and companies' financial conditions, in a broad sense the economy is in a very severe state.\"Analysts said the bank, which until recently was reluctant to take part in concerted rate cuts, had been left with little option given the strength of the yen and the Fed's huge rate reduction on Tuesday.Today's move, however, will fuel speculation the BoJ will make further rate cuts to bring the economy back from the brink of collapse.\"The BoJ seems to have taken all the possible policy options that had been lurking,\" Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, told Reuters.\"It was certainly better than doing nothing. But this won't stop the yen's rising trend, although it could stop the yen's advance temporarily.\"Others have not ruled out a return to quantitative easing, a policy it promoted for five years from 2001 under which it flooded the banking system with huge sums of money to promote lending.The crisis engulfing Japan's exporters was underlined today when the daily Nikkei business newspaper said Toyota's mainstay vehicle operations are likely to post their first loss in the financial year ending next March.", "tags": ["Interest rates", "Global recession", "Business", "Japan", "Money", "World news", "Economics", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan slashes interest rates to 0.1%"},{"date": "2008-11-27T12:53:53Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker, has decided to stop selling phones in Japan, except for its luxury Vertu brand, reports Reuters. \"In the current global economic climate, we have concluded that the continuation of our investment in Japan-specific localized products is no longer sustainable,\" Nokia executive vice president Timo Ihamuotila said in a statement.The story says the problem is that \"Most of the mobile phones used in Japan are part of third-generation networks and boast features such as TV broadcasting and electronic payment functions.\" The need to develop special handsets means non-Japanese suppliers have only a small share of the Japanese market -- about 5%, according to IDC Japan.

In 1972, my second feature disappeared. United Artists, who financed it, loved my script for Memoirs of a Ghost Writer, but hated the title. An alternative had to be found and, bizarrely, that alternative ended up being Pulp. The posters carried this copy: \"Pulp means paperback books, also means pulverised bodies. Mickey King writes pulp, lives pulp, very soon could be pulp.\" The new title turned out to be not just a title but a prophecy. Despite starring Michael Caine, Mickey Rooney, Lionel Stander, Lizabeth Scott and Denis Price, the film might just as well have been pulped in the literary sense - but received the cinematic equivalent.It was a comedy, very offbeat, and the US distributors hadn't the vaguest idea what to do with it. Banished to some vault somewhere in Burbank, Pulp languished for a year or more. Then one day, a technician appeared, brushed the accumulated dust from its label to make sure he had the right unknown, unloved film, and loaded it on to a truck. It was on its way to New York. A new cinema had opened there. I forget its name, but it was dedicated to showing \"lost\" films. Each film for one week only. Little did I know at the time that I would almost singlehandedly be able to keep that cinema in business for years. Eventually, they might even have named it after me. Anyway, the first film they chose to screen was Pulp. Now, at last, the critics would get to see it. Much to the distributor's surprise, it received rave reviews. Time magazine got a little overheated and even mentioned the word \"masterpiece\". While I'm of the opinion that film critics spend too much time in the dark, I'm always grateful when, in the case of my own work, they come to the right conclusions. As they did in this case. Enthusiasm for the film burst from the pages of magazines and newspapers and from radios and televisions across the city, and I like to think of the New York masses converging excitedly on the cinema whose name I've forgotten. Maybe that's a Freudian lapse? For this is where the curse kicks in again. Remember, my film was playing for one week only. So, by the time the aforementioned ecstatic reviews emerged, it was playing nowhere. Its run was over. But my career wasn't. In 1974, I rolled the dice again. Snake eyes. Fate was lining me up for my second \"lost\" film. This was The Terminal Man, which Warner Bros asked me to adapt from Michael Crichton's second novel. In retrospect, I see it was a project that resolutely defied box-office appeal. Yet I chose to make it. Why? I suppose because I get little satisfaction from making films that might be considered commercially safe. I like the risky ones. That philosophy can be tough in a world that's financially driven and sees vast profits in producing the familiar, whether it's cars or computers or hamburgers or films. But then the familiar can also be dangerous territory. It can lull you into complacency. Contemplate complacency for a moment. You feel good, right? You have a healthy bank account, a healthy body, a healthy sex life, a healthy outlook. Just like Harry Benson, the hero of The Terminal Man. Until he suffers brain damage in a car crash. Within seconds complacency is banished. It's replaced by an anger, a violence, that's uncontrollable. Benson, as a last resort, agrees to let his medical team break into his head, the tabernacle of life itself. Once in there, they will implant terminals (hence the film's title) and then select those that will be used to abort his attacks. Inevitably they select the pleasure cells. The very cells that make the world of commerce whirl like prayer wheels. Whirling, it seems, in the hope of eternal growth in output and profits. The obvious insanity at the very heart of what drives us also drove me to make the film. Years before I had written and directed a television film called The Manipulators. The title is self-explanatory, and, not surprisingly, includes library film of Pavlov's behavioural experiments. The methods of manipulation performed on animals, including us humans, was already an obsession with me. So Harry Benson's predicament now became mine. And the way I intended to communicate this to an audience was to have them observe Benson as if he was a trapped animal. The film seemed an obvious candidate for shooting in monochrome, but Warners was not enthusiastic about that idea. In retrospect I'm grateful to the studio because it forced me to choose another route. I eliminated all primary colours from the sets and costumes; only allowing red to feature in two scenes before a profusion of colour at the very end, at a funeral of all places. In my effort to illuminate Benson's loneliness, I consistently broke the rules of commercial film-making. For example, when we witness Benson suffering, the camera doesn't move closer but actually pulls away as if finding it too painful to watch. Even the music - a single Goldberg variation played by Glenn Gould - defied convention (one executive at Warners asked when I was going to orchestrate it). The film was shipped to Toronto for Gould's approval. His own solitary existence and extreme hypochondria must have made for a weird screening. It was to be another 16 years before I managed to rustle up my next \"lost\" film. This was Black Rainbow, an original script, written on spec, picked up by John Quested for Goldcrest Films and distributed in the UK by Palace Pictures. It starred Rosanna Arquette as Martha Travis, a dodgy medium on the road with her father and was shot over six weeks in North Carolina. The film's motif could have been Karl Marx's dictum: \"All that is solid melts into air.\" Indeed the last line of the film comes from the journalist intent on exposing Travis as a fraud. When he finally walks out on his editor, he yells: \"Now you see me; now you don't.\" That line summed up the film's distribution in the UK and US. From then on I consoled myself by calling my work \"films in bottles\". They would wash up somewhere, some time, and maybe surprise somebody watching some remote cable channel in the early hours. This theory was proven correct one morning when I was working with composer Simon Fisher Turner on the music for Croupier (very nearly my fourth \"lost\" film, but was saved from cinema oblivion by a small maverick distributor in the US). The doorbell rang. It was a Japanese musician friend of Simon's, who was built like a sumo wrestler. They did their business, and he was on his way out. He suddenly turned back and approached me. My name had rung a bell. \"You make Black Rainbow?\" \"I did.\" \"I see six times.\" I was so astonished I assumed he'd seen it on video. \"No. In cinema. Black Rainbow very big in Japan.\" He bowed and left. Big in Japan? It was news to me. Trouble is, I don't live in Japan. I live in the UK. And on that score, a definite pattern has finally emerged. Last year I wrote my first novel. True to form it will not be seen in the UK. It has no publisher here. But it does have a publisher in - I still can't quite believe it - in France! And in French!

Though there was no return to quantitative easing, the bank said it would ease the pressure on corporate funding, as the government warned the world's second-biggest economy would register zero growth in fiscal 2009.The cabinet office said it expected gross domestic production through to next March to contract by 0.8%, having forecast growth of 1.3% in July.The government said negative growth could be avoided by a moderate recovery in consumer spending as a result of two recently unveiled stimulus packages.In a statement, the BoJ admitted global financial conditions had \"deteriorated sharply\".It said weak exports and a decline in domestic demand, as well as worsening unemployment, had prompted it to act. \"Under these circumstances economic conditions have been deteriorating and are likely to increase in severity for the immediate future,\" it said.\"Given the slowdown in overseas economies and the turmoil in global financial markets, it will likely take some time for the necessary conditions for Japan's economic recovery to be satisfied.\"The bank said it would keep a close watch on the economies of Europe and the US, and expected Japanese banks to \"take full advantage\" of the rate cut in its lending practices, warning that \"pressures acting to depress economic activity from the financial side may become more marked\".The BoJ said it would help firms gain access to new funds by increasing its outright purchase of Japanese government bonds to \u00a51.4 trillion (\u00a310.3bn) per month from \u00a51.2tn, and temporarily buying commercial paper - a form of short-term unsecured borrowing - outright.The finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, welcomed the cut but echoed the bank's gloomy predictions about the economy.\"I think the BOJ made its decision based on an earnest assessment of the economic and financial situation,\" he told reporters. \"Looking at employment and companies' financial conditions, in a broad sense the economy is in a very severe state.\"Analysts said the bank, which until recently was reluctant to take part in concerted rate cuts, had been left with little option given the strength of the yen and the Fed's huge rate reduction on Tuesday.Today's move, however, will fuel speculation the BoJ will make further rate cuts to bring the economy back from the brink of collapse.\"The BoJ seems to have taken all the possible policy options that had been lurking,\" Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, told Reuters.\"It was certainly better than doing nothing.

In 1972, my second feature disappeared. United Artists, who financed it, loved my script for Memoirs of a Ghost Writer, but hated the title. An alternative had to be found and, bizarrely, that alternative ended up being Pulp. The posters carried this copy: \"Pulp means paperback books, also means pulverised bodies. Mickey King writes pulp, lives pulp, very soon could be pulp.\" The new title turned out to be not just a title but a prophecy. Despite starring Michael Caine, Mickey Rooney, Lionel Stander, Lizabeth Scott and Denis Price, the film might just as well have been pulped in the literary sense - but received the cinematic equivalent.It was a comedy, very offbeat, and the US distributors hadn't the vaguest idea what to do with it. Banished to some vault somewhere in Burbank, Pulp languished for a year or more. Then one day, a technician appeared, brushed the accumulated dust from its label to make sure he had the right unknown, unloved film, and loaded it on to a truck. It was on its way to New York. A new cinema had opened there. I forget its name, but it was dedicated to showing \"lost\" films. Each film for one week only. Little did I know at the time that I would almost singlehandedly be able to keep that cinema in business for years. Eventually, they might even have named it after me. Anyway, the first film they chose to screen was Pulp. Now, at last, the critics would get to see it. Much to the distributor's surprise, it received rave reviews. Time magazine got a little overheated and even mentioned the word \"masterpiece\". While I'm of the opinion that film critics spend too much time in the dark, I'm always grateful when, in the case of my own work, they come to the right conclusions. As they did in this case. Enthusiasm for the film burst from the pages of magazines and newspapers and from radios and televisions across the city, and I like to think of the New York masses converging excitedly on the cinema whose name I've forgotten. Maybe that's a Freudian lapse? For this is where the curse kicks in again. Remember, my film was playing for one week only. So, by the time the aforementioned ecstatic reviews emerged, it was playing nowhere. Its run was over. But my career wasn't. In 1974, I rolled the dice again. Snake eyes. Fate was lining me up for my second \"lost\" film. This was The Terminal Man, which Warner Bros asked me to adapt from Michael Crichton's second novel. In retrospect, I see it was a project that resolutely defied box-office appeal. Yet I chose to make it. Why? I suppose because I get little satisfaction from making films that might be considered commercially safe. I like the risky ones. That philosophy can be tough in a world that's financially driven and sees vast profits in producing the familiar, whether it's cars or computers or hamburgers or films. But then the familiar can also be dangerous territory. It can lull you into complacency. Contemplate complacency for a moment. You feel good, right? You have a healthy bank account, a healthy body, a healthy sex life, a healthy outlook. Just like Harry Benson, the hero of The Terminal Man. Until he suffers brain damage in a car crash. Within seconds complacency is banished. It's replaced by an anger, a violence, that's uncontrollable. Benson, as a last resort, agrees to let his medical team break into his head, the tabernacle of life itself. Once in there, they will implant terminals (hence the film's title) and then select those that will be used to abort his attacks. Inevitably they select the pleasure cells. The very cells that make the world of commerce whirl like prayer wheels. Whirling, it seems, in the hope of eternal growth in output and profits. The obvious insanity at the very heart of what drives us also drove me to make the film. Years before I had written and directed a television film called The Manipulators. The title is self-explanatory, and, not surprisingly, includes library film of Pavlov's behavioural experiments. The methods of manipulation performed on animals, including us humans, was already an obsession with me. So Harry Benson's predicament now became mine. And the way I intended to communicate this to an audience was to have them observe Benson as if he was a trapped animal. The film seemed an obvious candidate for shooting in monochrome, but Warners was not enthusiastic about that idea. In retrospect I'm grateful to the studio because it forced me to choose another route. I eliminated all primary colours from the sets and costumes; only allowing red to feature in two scenes before a profusion of colour at the very end, at a funeral of all places. In my effort to illuminate Benson's loneliness, I consistently broke the rules of commercial film-making. For example, when we witness Benson suffering, the camera doesn't move closer but actually pulls away as if finding it too painful to watch. Even the music - a single Goldberg variation played by Glenn Gould - defied convention (one executive at Warners asked when I was going to orchestrate it). The film was shipped to Toronto for Gould's approval. His own solitary existence and extreme hypochondria must have made for a weird screening. It was to be another 16 years before I managed to rustle up my next \"lost\" film. This was Black Rainbow, an original script, written on spec, picked up by John Quested for Goldcrest Films and distributed in the UK by Palace Pictures. It starred Rosanna Arquette as Martha Travis, a dodgy medium on the road with her father and was shot over six weeks in North Carolina. The film's motif could have been Karl Marx's dictum: \"All that is solid melts into air.\" Indeed the last line of the film comes from the journalist intent on exposing Travis as a fraud. When he finally walks out on his editor, he yells: \"Now you see me; now you don't.\" That line summed up the film's distribution in the UK and US. From then on I consoled myself by calling my work \"films in bottles\". They would wash up somewhere, some time, and maybe surprise somebody watching some remote cable channel in the early hours. This theory was proven correct one morning when I was working with composer Simon Fisher Turner on the music for Croupier (very nearly my fourth \"lost\" film, but was saved from cinema oblivion by a small maverick distributor in the US). The doorbell rang. It was a Japanese musician friend of Simon's, who was built like a sumo wrestler. They did their business, and he was on his way out. He suddenly turned back and approached me. My name had rung a bell. \"You make Black Rainbow?\" \"I did.\" \"I see six times.\" I was so astonished I assumed he'd seen it on video. \"No. In cinema. Black Rainbow very big in Japan.\" He bowed and left. Big in Japan? It was news to me. Trouble is, I don't live in Japan. I live in the UK. And on that score, a definite pattern has finally emerged. Last year I wrote my first novel. True to form it will not be seen in the UK. It has no publisher here. But it does have a publisher in - I still can't quite believe it - in France! And in French!

In the first half of this year the number of cases in which suspects were questioned or arrested stood at 1,202, a 12% increase on the same time last year. The number of cases involving the cultivation of cannabis at home was up by almost 50%, the national police agency said.A record 2,423 violations were recorded in 2006, but police expect that figure to be beaten with ease this year.Recreational marijuana use hit the headlines this summer when three Russian sumo wrestlers were kicked out of the sport for allegedly smoking the drug. In recent months newspapers have reported arrests for dealing, cultivating or possessing marijuana at some of Japan's best universities.Daytime TV shows, meanwhile, blame foreign suppliers for corrupting gullible Japanese teenagers and, increasingly, bored housewives, as they move out heavily policed city centres into the suburbs.The Mainichi Shimbun, often a progressive voice on other issues, devoted part of its front page yesterday to a fuming editorial warning of the potential ruination of Japan's finest universities by the evil weed.Noting that students of the 1960s concerned themselves only with \"world peace\", the paper derided their modern-day counterparts' unhealthy obsession with attaining a different kind of tranquility.Of the recent campus arrests, it says: \"It is rational to believe that these cases are just the tip of the iceberg, and that 'drug pollution' at university campuses is more widespread than generally thought.\"There does not appear to be a problem with supply. In July, police in Tokyo seized 180kg of cannabis - Japan's biggest haul - with a street value of \u00a5720m (\u00a34.6m).Smokers who prefer not to risk buying from dealers - who charge, on average, six times the going rate in the Netherlands - are growing their own. Accordingly, the number of people arrested for growing the plant at home, many with seeds bought on the internet, has risen fivefold over the past 10 years.Japanese law takes a dim view of the recreational use of soft drugs. The 1948 cannabis control law calls for prison terms of up to 10 years and hefty fine for anyone found importing, exporting, growing, selling or buying cannabis.Its use for medical purposes, permitted in some other countries, is also banned.Japanese activists are pushing for a change in the law to permit the use of cannabis among sufferers of diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's.\"Cannabis is harmless compared to alcohol and tobaccos, but still the government overreacts and ruins the lives of anyone found with it,\" Koichi Maeda, the founder of the Japan Medical Marijuana Association, told the Guardian. \"We asked the government to provide evidence of the harm they say marijuana causes, but they couldn't.\"Maeda, who runs a hemp restaurant in Tokyo, believes recent media coverage of the issue shows how far public attitudes towards dope smoking in Japan lag behind those in Britain and parts of Europe.\"The authorities use the media to peddle their claims that marijuana is a gateway drug to harder substances, and the media are too stupid to check if what they are being told is true,\" he said. \"All the newspapers do is run sensationalist articles based on what the police tell them.

The ministry of economy, trade and industry estimates output will decline by a similar amount this month and by more than 2% in January. If the forecasts are right, output for the three months to December will shrink by a record 11%.The previous record monthly drop, of 4.3% in January 2001, came as Japan was struggling to drag itself out of a deflationary spiral.The figures suggest Japan's export-dependent economy is contracting faster than previously feared and comes amid warnings that deflation is looming for the second time in less than a decade. Sharp falls in the price of oil and other commodities slowed price rises to a meagre 1% from a year earlier, compared with 1.9% in October.Unemployment rose to 3.9%, up 0.2% from the previous month, with the overall jobless rate reaching more than 2.5 million, an increase of 100,000 from last year, the health and welfare ministry said.Japan's exporters have seen their profits quickly eroded by the soaring yen \u2013 now hovering around a 13-year high against the dollar \u2013 and a dramatic decline in sales in the US and Europe.The downturn has forced the country's powerhouse car and electronics makers to slash production and cut work forces, with Toyota announcing its first ever loss this week. The labour ministry said 85,000 temporary and part-time workers would lose their jobs by the end of March, well over double the number forecast last month.Households are tightening their belts amid rising uncertainty over jobs, with spending falling 0.5% in November.The government has unveiled financial stimulus packages that include 12tn yen (\u00a390bn) in extra spending, and this week proposed a record \u00a588.5tn budget in an attempt to prevent the economy from collapse.Having taken interest rates to almost zero last week Japan's financial authorities appear to be running out of options.The Bank of Japan recently cut interest rates by 0.2% to 0.1% as central banks around the world moved to ease credit. The BoJ also increased its outright purchases of government bonds and, for the first time, said it would buy commercial paper outright in an attempt to ease the pressure on cash-strapped firms.The prime minister, Taro Aso, described the turmoil as a \"financial tsunami\".\"We need to take unprecedented measures when in an extraordinary economic situation,\" he told reporters. \"Japan cannot evade this tsunami, but by taking bold measures we hope to be the first in the world to come out of recession.\"Analysts said production had \"fallen off a cliff\" and were pessimistic about the prospects for an early recovery. \"What's going on is beyond what Toyota and Sony ever imagined,\" said Mitsuru Saito, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Sec\u00adurities.The mood was similarly grim in South Korea. \"The Korean economy is faced with an unprecedented crisis with exports and domestic demand, the two pillars of economic growth, falling at the same time,\" the ministry of knowledge economy said in a new year policy report.The ministry said it would aim to boost 2009 exports to $450bn (\u00a3305bn) from about $430bn projected for this year.Faced with slowing demand from export markets, China needed to take more steps to stimulate domestic consumption, central bank officials there said.

But then the familiar can also be dangerous territory. It can lull you into complacency. Contemplate complacency for a moment. You feel good, right? You have a healthy bank account, a healthy body, a healthy sex life, a healthy outlook. Just like Harry Benson, the hero of The Terminal Man. Until he suffers brain damage in a car crash. Within seconds complacency is banished. It's replaced by an anger, a violence, that's uncontrollable. Benson, as a last resort, agrees to let his medical team break into his head, the tabernacle of life itself. Once in there, they will implant terminals (hence the film's title) and then select those that will be used to abort his attacks. Inevitably they select the pleasure cells. The very cells that make the world of commerce whirl like prayer wheels. Whirling, it seems, in the hope of eternal growth in output and profits. The obvious insanity at the very heart of what drives us also drove me to make the film. Years before I had written and directed a television film called The Manipulators. The title is self-explanatory, and, not surprisingly, includes library film of Pavlov's behavioural experiments. The methods of manipulation performed on animals, including us humans, was already an obsession with me. So Harry Benson's predicament now became mine. And the way I intended to communicate this to an audience was to have them observe Benson as if he was a trapped animal. The film seemed an obvious candidate for shooting in monochrome, but Warners was not enthusiastic about that idea. In retrospect I'm grateful to the studio because it forced me to choose another route. I eliminated all primary colours from the sets and costumes; only allowing red to feature in two scenes before a profusion of colour at the very end, at a funeral of all places. In my effort to illuminate Benson's loneliness, I consistently broke the rules of commercial film-making. For example, when we witness Benson suffering, the camera doesn't move closer but actually pulls away as if finding it too painful to watch. Even the music - a single Goldberg variation played by Glenn Gould - defied convention (one executive at Warners asked when I was going to orchestrate it). The film was shipped to Toronto for Gould's approval. His own solitary existence and extreme hypochondria must have made for a weird screening. It was to be another 16 years before I managed to rustle up my next \"lost\" film. This was Black Rainbow, an original script, written on spec, picked up by John Quested for Goldcrest Films and distributed in the UK by Palace Pictures. It starred Rosanna Arquette as Martha Travis, a dodgy medium on the road with her father and was shot over six weeks in North Carolina. The film's motif could have been Karl Marx's dictum: \"All that is solid melts into air.\" Indeed the last line of the film comes from the journalist intent on exposing Travis as a fraud. When he finally walks out on his editor, he yells: \"Now you see me; now you don't.\" That line summed up the film's distribution in the UK and US. From then on I consoled myself by calling my work \"films in bottles\". They would wash up somewhere, some time, and maybe surprise somebody watching some remote cable channel in the early hours. This theory was proven correct one morning when I was working with composer Simon Fisher Turner on the music for Croupier (very nearly my fourth \"lost\" film, but was saved from cinema oblivion by a small maverick distributor in the US). The doorbell rang. It was a Japanese musician friend of Simon's, who was built like a sumo wrestler. They did their business, and he was on his way out. He suddenly turned back and approached me. My name had rung a bell. \"You make Black Rainbow?\" \"I did.\" \"I see six times.\" I was so astonished I assumed he'd seen it on video. \"No. In cinema. Black Rainbow very big in Japan.\" He bowed and left. Big in Japan? It was news to me. Trouble is, I don't live in Japan. I live in the UK. And on that score, a definite pattern has finally emerged. Last year I wrote my first novel. True to form it will not be seen in the UK. It has no publisher here. But it does have a publisher in - I still can't quite believe it - in France! And in French!

In the first half of this year the number of cases in which suspects were questioned or arrested stood at 1,202, a 12% increase on the same time last year. The number of cases involving the cultivation of cannabis at home was up by almost 50%, the national police agency said.A record 2,423 violations were recorded in 2006, but police expect that figure to be beaten with ease this year.Recreational marijuana use hit the headlines this summer when three Russian sumo wrestlers were kicked out of the sport for allegedly smoking the drug. In recent months newspapers have reported arrests for dealing, cultivating or possessing marijuana at some of Japan's best universities.Daytime TV shows, meanwhile, blame foreign suppliers for corrupting gullible Japanese teenagers and, increasingly, bored housewives, as they move out heavily policed city centres into the suburbs.The Mainichi Shimbun, often a progressive voice on other issues, devoted part of its front page yesterday to a fuming editorial warning of the potential ruination of Japan's finest universities by the evil weed.Noting that students of the 1960s concerned themselves only with \"world peace\", the paper derided their modern-day counterparts' unhealthy obsession with attaining a different kind of tranquility.Of the recent campus arrests, it says: \"It is rational to believe that these cases are just the tip of the iceberg, and that 'drug pollution' at university campuses is more widespread than generally thought.\"There does not appear to be a problem with supply. In July, police in Tokyo seized 180kg of cannabis - Japan's biggest haul - with a street value of \u00a5720m (\u00a34.6m).Smokers who prefer not to risk buying from dealers - who charge, on average, six times the going rate in the Netherlands - are growing their own. Accordingly, the number of people arrested for growing the plant at home, many with seeds bought on the internet, has risen fivefold over the past 10 years.Japanese law takes a dim view of the recreational use of soft drugs. The 1948 cannabis control law calls for prison terms of up to 10 years and hefty fine for anyone found importing, exporting, growing, selling or buying cannabis.Its use for medical purposes, permitted in some other countries, is also banned.Japanese activists are pushing for a change in the law to permit the use of cannabis among sufferers of diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's.\"Cannabis is harmless compared to alcohol and tobaccos, but still the government overreacts and ruins the lives of anyone found with it,\" Koichi Maeda, the founder of the Japan Medical Marijuana Association, told the Guardian. \"We asked the government to provide evidence of the harm they say marijuana causes, but they couldn't.\"Maeda, who runs a hemp restaurant in Tokyo, believes recent media coverage of the issue shows how far public attitudes towards dope smoking in Japan lag behind those in Britain and parts of Europe.\"The authorities use the media to peddle their claims that marijuana is a gateway drug to harder substances, and the media are too stupid to check if what they are being told is true,\" he said. \"All the newspapers do is run sensationalist articles based on what the police tell them.

Kuma had abducted two seven-year-old girls as they walked to school in 1992 and strangled them in his van. Takashio stabbed to death a 83-year-old woman and her 55-year-old daughter at their home in 2004, and fled with 50,000 yen (about \u00a3330) in cash.The justice minister, Eisuke Mori, said that the men had \"taken precious lives\", describing the cases as having caused grief and heartbreak to the families of the victims, and adding \"so I humbly carried out my duty\".Although domestic support for hanging remains strong, Japan is at odds with a growing international trend towards abolition of the punishment. According to a recent UN report, 141 countries have abolished the death penalty, or at least no longer use it, while 56 retain its use, including the US, Japan and China. Almost 90% of all executions in 2007 were carried out in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the US.The hangings took place as the UN commission on human rights prepared to issue its first review of the human rights situation in Japan for 10 years. The report, due to have been submitted to officials in Tokyo yesterday, is expected to be critical of the use of the death penalty. \"Choosing the same day to hang two men sends a clear signal to the UN that Japan is not willing to listen to criticism or take on board recommendations,\" said Makoto Teranaka, secretary general of Amnesty International's Japan office. Japan has executed inmates at the rate of about one every two months since the previous justice minister, Kunio Hatoyama, took office in August 2007. No executions were carried out for 15 months until 2006 because the justice minister at the time, Seiken Sugiura, said his devout Buddhist beliefs prevented his signing execution orders. Japan has also been criticised for the manner in which it carries out its \"secret\" executions. Inmates, some of whom spend many years on death row, are told of their impending execution shortly before they are led off to the gallows - a tactic that is an attempt to avoid eleventh-hour appeals. Their relatives and lawyers are notified after the fact so they can collect the body for cremation. Of the 101 inmates on death row in Japan, 42 are demanding retrials and another 19 plan to follow suit, according to the pressure group Forum 90.Although Teranaka stopped short of accusing the government of using the executions to detract attention from Japan's economic woes, he said it was pandering to public opinion. \"Crime is falling, and the murder rate is very low, but blanket reporting of crime by the media has made people more afraid and less tolerant\" he said. \"In that sense the Japanese government is indulging in penal populism.\"", "tags": ["Japan", "Human rights", "World news", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Two hanged in Japan despite UN critique"},{"date": "2008-11-27T12:53:53Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker, has decided to stop selling phones in Japan, except for its luxury Vertu brand, reports Reuters. \"In the current global economic climate, we have concluded that the continuation of our investment in Japan-specific localized products is no longer sustainable,\" Nokia executive vice president Timo Ihamuotila said in a statement.The story says the problem is that \"Most of the mobile phones used in Japan are part of third-generation networks and boast features such as TV broadcasting and electronic payment functions.\" The need to develop special handsets means non-Japanese suppliers have only a small share of the Japanese market -- about 5%, according to IDC Japan.

The ministry of economy, trade and industry estimates output will decline by a similar amount this month and by more than 2% in January. If the forecasts are right, output for the three months to December will shrink by a record 11%.The previous record monthly drop, of 4.3% in January 2001, came as Japan was struggling to drag itself out of a deflationary spiral.The figures suggest Japan's export-dependent economy is contracting faster than previously feared and comes amid warnings that deflation is looming for the second time in less than a decade. Sharp falls in the price of oil and other commodities slowed price rises to a meagre 1% from a year earlier, compared with 1.9% in October.Unemployment rose to 3.9%, up 0.2% from the previous month, with the overall jobless rate reaching more than 2.5 million, an increase of 100,000 from last year, the health and welfare ministry said.Japan's exporters have seen their profits quickly eroded by the soaring yen \u2013 now hovering around a 13-year high against the dollar \u2013 and a dramatic decline in sales in the US and Europe.The downturn has forced the country's powerhouse car and electronics makers to slash production and cut work forces, with Toyota announcing its first ever loss this week. The labour ministry said 85,000 temporary and part-time workers would lose their jobs by the end of March, well over double the number forecast last month.Households are tightening their belts amid rising uncertainty over jobs, with spending falling 0.5% in November.The government has unveiled financial stimulus packages that include 12tn yen (\u00a390bn) in extra spending, and this week proposed a record \u00a588.5tn budget in an attempt to prevent the economy from collapse.Having taken interest rates to almost zero last week Japan's financial authorities appear to be running out of options.The Bank of Japan recently cut interest rates by 0.2% to 0.1% as central banks around the world moved to ease credit. The BoJ also increased its outright purchases of government bonds and, for the first time, said it would buy commercial paper outright in an attempt to ease the pressure on cash-strapped firms.The prime minister, Taro Aso, described the turmoil as a \"financial tsunami\".\"We need to take unprecedented measures when in an extraordinary economic situation,\" he told reporters. \"Japan cannot evade this tsunami, but by taking bold measures we hope to be the first in the world to come out of recession.\"Analysts said production had \"fallen off a cliff\" and were pessimistic about the prospects for an early recovery. \"What's going on is beyond what Toyota and Sony ever imagined,\" said Mitsuru Saito, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Sec\u00adurities.The mood was similarly grim in South Korea. \"The Korean economy is faced with an unprecedented crisis with exports and domestic demand, the two pillars of economic growth, falling at the same time,\" the ministry of knowledge economy said in a new year policy report.The ministry said it would aim to boost 2009 exports to $450bn (\u00a3305bn) from about $430bn projected for this year.Faced with slowing demand from export markets, China needed to take more steps to stimulate domestic consumption, central bank officials there said.

In 1972, my second feature disappeared. United Artists, who financed it, loved my script for Memoirs of a Ghost Writer, but hated the title. An alternative had to be found and, bizarrely, that alternative ended up being Pulp. The posters carried this copy: \"Pulp means paperback books, also means pulverised bodies. Mickey King writes pulp, lives pulp, very soon could be pulp.\" The new title turned out to be not just a title but a prophecy. Despite starring Michael Caine, Mickey Rooney, Lionel Stander, Lizabeth Scott and Denis Price, the film might just as well have been pulped in the literary sense - but received the cinematic equivalent.It was a comedy, very offbeat, and the US distributors hadn't the vaguest idea what to do with it. Banished to some vault somewhere in Burbank, Pulp languished for a year or more. Then one day, a technician appeared, brushed the accumulated dust from its label to make sure he had the right unknown, unloved film, and loaded it on to a truck. It was on its way to New York. A new cinema had opened there. I forget its name, but it was dedicated to showing \"lost\" films. Each film for one week only. Little did I know at the time that I would almost singlehandedly be able to keep that cinema in business for years. Eventually, they might even have named it after me. Anyway, the first film they chose to screen was Pulp. Now, at last, the critics would get to see it. Much to the distributor's surprise, it received rave reviews. Time magazine got a little overheated and even mentioned the word \"masterpiece\". While I'm of the opinion that film critics spend too much time in the dark, I'm always grateful when, in the case of my own work, they come to the right conclusions. As they did in this case. Enthusiasm for the film burst from the pages of magazines and newspapers and from radios and televisions across the city, and I like to think of the New York masses converging excitedly on the cinema whose name I've forgotten. Maybe that's a Freudian lapse? For this is where the curse kicks in again. Remember, my film was playing for one week only. So, by the time the aforementioned ecstatic reviews emerged, it was playing nowhere. Its run was over. But my career wasn't. In 1974, I rolled the dice again. Snake eyes. Fate was lining me up for my second \"lost\" film. This was The Terminal Man, which Warner Bros asked me to adapt from Michael Crichton's second novel. In retrospect, I see it was a project that resolutely defied box-office appeal. Yet I chose to make it. Why? I suppose because I get little satisfaction from making films that might be considered commercially safe. I like the risky ones. That philosophy can be tough in a world that's financially driven and sees vast profits in producing the familiar, whether it's cars or computers or hamburgers or films. But then the familiar can also be dangerous territory. It can lull you into complacency. Contemplate complacency for a moment. You feel good, right? You have a healthy bank account, a healthy body, a healthy sex life, a healthy outlook. Just like Harry Benson, the hero of The Terminal Man. Until he suffers brain damage in a car crash. Within seconds complacency is banished. It's replaced by an anger, a violence, that's uncontrollable. Benson, as a last resort, agrees to let his medical team break into his head, the tabernacle of life itself. Once in there, they will implant terminals (hence the film's title) and then select those that will be used to abort his attacks. Inevitably they select the pleasure cells. The very cells that make the world of commerce whirl like prayer wheels. Whirling, it seems, in the hope of eternal growth in output and profits. The obvious insanity at the very heart of what drives us also drove me to make the film. Years before I had written and directed a television film called The Manipulators. The title is self-explanatory, and, not surprisingly, includes library film of Pavlov's behavioural experiments. The methods of manipulation performed on animals, including us humans, was already an obsession with me. So Harry Benson's predicament now became mine. And the way I intended to communicate this to an audience was to have them observe Benson as if he was a trapped animal. The film seemed an obvious candidate for shooting in monochrome, but Warners was not enthusiastic about that idea. In retrospect I'm grateful to the studio because it forced me to choose another route. I eliminated all primary colours from the sets and costumes; only allowing red to feature in two scenes before a profusion of colour at the very end, at a funeral of all places. In my effort to illuminate Benson's loneliness, I consistently broke the rules of commercial film-making. For example, when we witness Benson suffering, the camera doesn't move closer but actually pulls away as if finding it too painful to watch. Even the music - a single Goldberg variation played by Glenn Gould - defied convention (one executive at Warners asked when I was going to orchestrate it). The film was shipped to Toronto for Gould's approval. His own solitary existence and extreme hypochondria must have made for a weird screening. It was to be another 16 years before I managed to rustle up my next \"lost\" film. This was Black Rainbow, an original script, written on spec, picked up by John Quested for Goldcrest Films and distributed in the UK by Palace Pictures. It starred Rosanna Arquette as Martha Travis, a dodgy medium on the road with her father and was shot over six weeks in North Carolina. The film's motif could have been Karl Marx's dictum: \"All that is solid melts into air.\" Indeed the last line of the film comes from the journalist intent on exposing Travis as a fraud. When he finally walks out on his editor, he yells: \"Now you see me; now you don't.\" That line summed up the film's distribution in the UK and US. From then on I consoled myself by calling my work \"films in bottles\". They would wash up somewhere, some time, and maybe surprise somebody watching some remote cable channel in the early hours. This theory was proven correct one morning when I was working with composer Simon Fisher Turner on the music for Croupier (very nearly my fourth \"lost\" film, but was saved from cinema oblivion by a small maverick distributor in the US). The doorbell rang. It was a Japanese musician friend of Simon's, who was built like a sumo wrestler. They did their business, and he was on his way out. He suddenly turned back and approached me. My name had rung a bell. \"You make Black Rainbow?\" \"I did.\" \"I see six times.\" I was so astonished I assumed he'd seen it on video. \"No. In cinema. Black Rainbow very big in Japan.\" He bowed and left. Big in Japan? It was news to me. Trouble is, I don't live in Japan. I live in the UK. And on that score, a definite pattern has finally emerged. Last year I wrote my first novel. True to form it will not be seen in the UK. It has no publisher here. But it does have a publisher in - I still can't quite believe it - in France! And in French!

In the first half of this year the number of cases in which suspects were questioned or arrested stood at 1,202, a 12% increase on the same time last year. The number of cases involving the cultivation of cannabis at home was up by almost 50%, the national police agency said.A record 2,423 violations were recorded in 2006, but police expect that figure to be beaten with ease this year.Recreational marijuana use hit the headlines this summer when three Russian sumo wrestlers were kicked out of the sport for allegedly smoking the drug. In recent months newspapers have reported arrests for dealing, cultivating or possessing marijuana at some of Japan's best universities.Daytime TV shows, meanwhile, blame foreign suppliers for corrupting gullible Japanese teenagers and, increasingly, bored housewives, as they move out heavily policed city centres into the suburbs.The Mainichi Shimbun, often a progressive voice on other issues, devoted part of its front page yesterday to a fuming editorial warning of the potential ruination of Japan's finest universities by the evil weed.Noting that students of the 1960s concerned themselves only with \"world peace\", the paper derided their modern-day counterparts' unhealthy obsession with attaining a different kind of tranquility.Of the recent campus arrests, it says: \"It is rational to believe that these cases are just the tip of the iceberg, and that 'drug pollution' at university campuses is more widespread than generally thought.\"There does not appear to be a problem with supply. In July, police in Tokyo seized 180kg of cannabis - Japan's biggest haul - with a street value of \u00a5720m (\u00a34.6m).Smokers who prefer not to risk buying from dealers - who charge, on average, six times the going rate in the Netherlands - are growing their own. Accordingly, the number of people arrested for growing the plant at home, many with seeds bought on the internet, has risen fivefold over the past 10 years.Japanese law takes a dim view of the recreational use of soft drugs. The 1948 cannabis control law calls for prison terms of up to 10 years and hefty fine for anyone found importing, exporting, growing, selling or buying cannabis.Its use for medical purposes, permitted in some other countries, is also banned.Japanese activists are pushing for a change in the law to permit the use of cannabis among sufferers of diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's.\"Cannabis is harmless compared to alcohol and tobaccos, but still the government overreacts and ruins the lives of anyone found with it,\" Koichi Maeda, the founder of the Japan Medical Marijuana Association, told the Guardian. \"We asked the government to provide evidence of the harm they say marijuana causes, but they couldn't.\"Maeda, who runs a hemp restaurant in Tokyo, believes recent media coverage of the issue shows how far public attitudes towards dope smoking in Japan lag behind those in Britain and parts of Europe.\"The authorities use the media to peddle their claims that marijuana is a gateway drug to harder substances, and the media are too stupid to check if what they are being told is true,\" he said. \"All the newspapers do is run sensationalist articles based on what the police tell them.

Kuma had abducted two seven-year-old girls as they walked to school in 1992 and strangled them in his van. Takashio stabbed to death a 83-year-old woman and her 55-year-old daughter at their home in 2004, and fled with 50,000 yen (about \u00a3330) in cash.The justice minister, Eisuke Mori, said that the men had \"taken precious lives\", describing the cases as having caused grief and heartbreak to the families of the victims, and adding \"so I humbly carried out my duty\".Although domestic support for hanging remains strong, Japan is at odds with a growing international trend towards abolition of the punishment. According to a recent UN report, 141 countries have abolished the death penalty, or at least no longer use it, while 56 retain its use, including the US, Japan and China. Almost 90% of all executions in 2007 were carried out in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the US.The hangings took place as the UN commission on human rights prepared to issue its first review of the human rights situation in Japan for 10 years. The report, due to have been submitted to officials in Tokyo yesterday, is expected to be critical of the use of the death penalty. \"Choosing the same day to hang two men sends a clear signal to the UN that Japan is not willing to listen to criticism or take on board recommendations,\" said Makoto Teranaka, secretary general of Amnesty International's Japan office. Japan has executed inmates at the rate of about one every two months since the previous justice minister, Kunio Hatoyama, took office in August 2007. No executions were carried out for 15 months until 2006 because the justice minister at the time, Seiken Sugiura, said his devout Buddhist beliefs prevented his signing execution orders. Japan has also been criticised for the manner in which it carries out its \"secret\" executions. Inmates, some of whom spend many years on death row, are told of their impending execution shortly before they are led off to the gallows - a tactic that is an attempt to avoid eleventh-hour appeals. Their relatives and lawyers are notified after the fact so they can collect the body for cremation. Of the 101 inmates on death row in Japan, 42 are demanding retrials and another 19 plan to follow suit, according to the pressure group Forum 90.Although Teranaka stopped short of accusing the government of using the executions to detract attention from Japan's economic woes, he said it was pandering to public opinion. \"Crime is falling, and the murder rate is very low, but blanket reporting of crime by the media has made people more afraid and less tolerant\" he said. \"In that sense the Japanese government is indulging in penal populism.\"", "tags": ["Japan", "Human rights", "World news", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Two hanged in Japan despite UN critique"},{"date": "2008-10-05T23:01:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "For a country that counts a cartoon cat among its ambassadors, Japan's new prime minister Taro Aso seems like an obvious choice.

He even sparked a market surge in manga-related shares when it looked likely that he would capture the top job in the world's second largest economy.And there couldn't be a better spokesman for the otaku. Aso is a self-assured, rich, wisecracking aristocrat who believes his fellow otaku and their manga and anime related obsessions can lift Japan out of its current economic hole. It's what's being called \"soft power\" - the diplomatic and economic clout of a nation's pop culture. In this case it is Japan's formidable comic-based culture that has conquered the youth of the west in spectacular fashion, starting with Pokemon.\"Thanks to the otaku, we can send messages about Japanese subculture to the entire world,\" Aso told an audience in Tokyo's electronics and PC game playground Akihabara. \"We should be proud.\" Aside from cultural bridge-building, though, what Aso has to offer voters is less clear. With the Japanese economy as badly bruised as our own, the electorate will be hungry for real change, not just escapism. Despite his cuddly, comic book-reading persona, Aso is a nationalist prone to verbal gaffes. Meanwhile, his Liberal Democratic party is not riding high in the popularity stakes.

But as a measure of how accustomed Japan is becoming to bad economic news, the dismal trade figures were greeted less with panic than with a growing sense of resignation.On a day when Japan's once all-conquering car exporters reported dramatic falls in output, the world's second biggest economy could only look to the other side of the Pacific ocean for its salvation.Earlier in the week the prime minister, Taro Aso, urged President Obama, not to retreat into protectionism to kick-start demand, and had won assurances that recovery would be achieved in tandem, or not at all.Even the modest relief from the bombardment of depressing data cannot come soon enough, both for Aso, whose poor handling of the crisis could see him out of office within months, and for exporters, once the driving force behind Japan Inc., now its biggest victims.FreefallThe sharp fall in exports in January widened Japan's trade deficit to \u00a5952.6bn (\u00a36.8bn), the fourth deficit in as many months - but by far the steepest - and the biggest since records began in 1979. The world's second biggest economy now finds itself in the unusual position of pleading with trading partners to resist protectionism, in a reversal of the \"Japan-bashing\" 1980s, when its vast trade surpluses prompted calls to boycott the country's products in the US.Its big three carmakers - Toyota, Honda and Nissan - reported staggering falls in production. Freefalling demand for cars has sent shock waves throughout Japan's auto industry. Toyota admitted that exports to the US plunged by 80% last month.Yesterday's figures follow depressing trade data from across the Asia-Pacific region in another sign that it has joined the US and Europe at the centre of the economic storm. In South Korea, exports fell a record 33% in January from a year earlier, while Taiwan and Singapore reported falls of 43% and 35%.Plummeting demand for Japanese products - from cars to flat-screen TVs and digital cameras - has forced manufacturers to shed tens of thousands of jobs around the world and slash production. Industrial output fell by a record 9.8% in December and analysts are predicting an even worse figure close to 10% for the January to March period.Japan's economy shrank at its fastest pace for 35 years in the last quarter, with more contractions expected well into this year. At an annualised rate of 12.7%, Japan's shrinkage was three times the size of that in the US.Analysts said the next quarter is unlikely to bring any respite. \"Further downside seems in store for January-March as a whole, based on reports such as suspensions of production in the auto industry,\" said Chiwoong Lee, an economist at Goldman Sachs.Japan is bracing itself for gloomy employment and output figures on Friday. Unemployment rose to 4.4% in December, its biggest climb for more than 40 years. Japan's finance ministry said exports to the US fell almost 53% in January, reducing its bilateral trade surplus by 75% to \u00a5132.8bn, and those to Europe fell by 47.4%.SlideIn addition to plunging demand in important export markets such as the US and Europe, Japan's plight was compounded by evidence of a slowdown in Asia. Exports to the continent were down 47%; those to China fell 45%.\"Exports to Asia, particularly to China, are tumbling at about the same pace as shipments to the United States, signalling that even China's economy may be shrinking,\" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at the Norinchukin Research Institute. \"We don't see any signs of a pickup in the Japanese economy in the near term. The economy will gradually worsen further.\"The figures prompted a slide in the yen to a three-month low against the dollar at \u00a596.7. The dollar's gains, combined with reports that Japan is about to buy shares in the market to boost prices sent the Nikkei share average up 2.65% in late trading. The Bank of Japan has already launched a trillion-yen scheme to buy shares in cash-strapped commercial banks, while parliament is debating a government proposal to invest \u00a520tn in shares of lending institutions.Other Asian markets were buoyed up by reassurances from the US Federal reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, that the US was not about to nationalise big banks.

But as a measure of how accustomed Japan is becoming to bad economic news, the dismal trade figures were greeted less with panic than with a growing sense of resignation.On a day when Japan's once all-conquering car exporters reported dramatic falls in output, the world's second biggest economy could only look to the other side of the Pacific ocean for its salvation.Earlier in the week the prime minister, Taro Aso, urged President Obama, not to retreat into protectionism to kick-start demand, and had won assurances that recovery would be achieved in tandem, or not at all.Even the modest relief from the bombardment of depressing data cannot come soon enough, both for Aso, whose poor handling of the crisis could see him out of office within months, and for exporters, once the driving force behind Japan Inc., now its biggest victims.FreefallThe sharp fall in exports in January widened Japan's trade deficit to \u00a5952.6bn (\u00a36.8bn), the fourth deficit in as many months - but by far the steepest - and the biggest since records began in 1979. The world's second biggest economy now finds itself in the unusual position of pleading with trading partners to resist protectionism, in a reversal of the \"Japan-bashing\" 1980s, when its vast trade surpluses prompted calls to boycott the country's products in the US.Its big three carmakers - Toyota, Honda and Nissan - reported staggering falls in production. Freefalling demand for cars has sent shock waves throughout Japan's auto industry. Toyota admitted that exports to the US plunged by 80% last month.Yesterday's figures follow depressing trade data from across the Asia-Pacific region in another sign that it has joined the US and Europe at the centre of the economic storm. In South Korea, exports fell a record 33% in January from a year earlier, while Taiwan and Singapore reported falls of 43% and 35%.Plummeting demand for Japanese products - from cars to flat-screen TVs and digital cameras - has forced manufacturers to shed tens of thousands of jobs around the world and slash production.

Japan is, however, winning the contest for the country with the most shambolic politics - this week its finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, resigned after turning up drunk to a press conference after the G7 summit in Rome last weekend. Nevertheless, Japan stands a good chance of being one of the few countries to benefit from the economic crisis.Many Japanese would find that hard to believe. Unemployment is rising sharply; the big, famous Japanese names such as Toyota, Panasonic and Sony are all making losses; exports are plummeting; and manufacturing output has dropped to a level last seen in 1983. Any Briton who thinks the reason our economy is weak is that we no longer have much manufacturing should come to Japan, for the reason Japan is weak is that it has too much (20% of GDP, compared with 10% in Britain), making precisely the things that everyone has just stopped buying, such as cars and fancy televisions.So where is the silver lining to all those clouds? It lies in politics, and the sharp kick in the pants that the economic crisis is about to give to the old political elite. A general election must be held by October at the latest, and could be forced much sooner. The same outfit - the Liberal Democratic party, which is actually a conservative group - has run the country for the whole of the past half century, barring nine months in 1993. The LDP survived even the country's stagnation during the 1990s, when Japan's financial crash destroyed its banking system. But, finally, the LDP is running out of road as fast as it long ago ran out of ideas. The prime minister, Taro Aso, has an approval rating that would shame even George Bush.As a result, the main opposition, the Democratic party of Japan, a centre-left group, is miles ahead in the opinion polls. Its leaders are plotting what they will do when they win power in a manner reminiscent of Labour in 1997, though with a touch of 1979 Thatcher too. The party's secretary-general, Yukio Hatoyama, says that as soon as it wins, the DPJ will outline its policies and fire any bureaucrat who won't support them.More than that, however, this opportunity matters because in Japan the public services are in desperate need of reform, just as the economy itself is. The national health system is starved of funds, with the recent tragic result that a woman died in childbirth after having been refused admission by several over-crowded hospitals. The public pension scheme is in disarray, with the government having lost 50m pension records and many people distrusting the state's promises. And, for all its fabled equality and social cohesion, this is a country where there is only a scant safety net for the unemployed, whose numbers are about to rise dramatically. Many of the new unemployed will be part-time and non-contract workers with low pay and few protections: new labour laws in 2001-03 enabled manufacturers to switch to cheap workers, raising profits but also enabling them to slash costs rapidly.It is a country, in other words, that is in desperate need of a change of government, and the election of a party dedicated to repairing broken social services as well as shaking up the economy. No doubt as and when the DPJ wins power, it will bring disappointments and its own occasionally shambolic ministers. No matter.

But as a measure of how accustomed Japan is becoming to bad economic news, the dismal trade figures were greeted less with panic than with a growing sense of resignation.On a day when Japan's once all-conquering car exporters reported dramatic falls in output, the world's second biggest economy could only look to the other side of the Pacific ocean for its salvation.Earlier in the week the prime minister, Taro Aso, urged President Obama, not to retreat into protectionism to kick-start demand, and had won assurances that recovery would be achieved in tandem, or not at all.Even the modest relief from the bombardment of depressing data cannot come soon enough, both for Aso, whose poor handling of the crisis could see him out of office within months, and for exporters, once the driving force behind Japan Inc., now its biggest victims.FreefallThe sharp fall in exports in January widened Japan's trade deficit to \u00a5952.6bn (\u00a36.8bn), the fourth deficit in as many months - but by far the steepest - and the biggest since records began in 1979. The world's second biggest economy now finds itself in the unusual position of pleading with trading partners to resist protectionism, in a reversal of the \"Japan-bashing\" 1980s, when its vast trade surpluses prompted calls to boycott the country's products in the US.Its big three carmakers - Toyota, Honda and Nissan - reported staggering falls in production. Freefalling demand for cars has sent shock waves throughout Japan's auto industry. Toyota admitted that exports to the US plunged by 80% last month.Yesterday's figures follow depressing trade data from across the Asia-Pacific region in another sign that it has joined the US and Europe at the centre of the economic storm. In South Korea, exports fell a record 33% in January from a year earlier, while Taiwan and Singapore reported falls of 43% and 35%.Plummeting demand for Japanese products - from cars to flat-screen TVs and digital cameras - has forced manufacturers to shed tens of thousands of jobs around the world and slash production. Industrial output fell by a record 9.8% in December and analysts are predicting an even worse figure close to 10% for the January to March period.Japan's economy shrank at its fastest pace for 35 years in the last quarter, with more contractions expected well into this year. At an annualised rate of 12.7%, Japan's shrinkage was three times the size of that in the US.Analysts said the next quarter is unlikely to bring any respite. \"Further downside seems in store for January-March as a whole, based on reports such as suspensions of production in the auto industry,\" said Chiwoong Lee, an economist at Goldman Sachs.Japan is bracing itself for gloomy employment and output figures on Friday. Unemployment rose to 4.4% in December, its biggest climb for more than 40 years. Japan's finance ministry said exports to the US fell almost 53% in January, reducing its bilateral trade surplus by 75% to \u00a5132.8bn, and those to Europe fell by 47.4%.SlideIn addition to plunging demand in important export markets such as the US and Europe, Japan's plight was compounded by evidence of a slowdown in Asia. Exports to the continent were down 47%; those to China fell 45%.\"Exports to Asia, particularly to China, are tumbling at about the same pace as shipments to the United States, signalling that even China's economy may be shrinking,\" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at the Norinchukin Research Institute. \"We don't see any signs of a pickup in the Japanese economy in the near term. The economy will gradually worsen further.\"The figures prompted a slide in the yen to a three-month low against the dollar at \u00a596.7. The dollar's gains, combined with reports that Japan is about to buy shares in the market to boost prices sent the Nikkei share average up 2.65% in late trading. The Bank of Japan has already launched a trillion-yen scheme to buy shares in cash-strapped commercial banks, while parliament is debating a government proposal to invest \u00a520tn in shares of lending institutions.Other Asian markets were buoyed up by reassurances from the US Federal reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, that the US was not about to nationalise big banks.

Japan is, however, winning the contest for the country with the most shambolic politics - this week its finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, resigned after turning up drunk to a press conference after the G7 summit in Rome last weekend. Nevertheless, Japan stands a good chance of being one of the few countries to benefit from the economic crisis.Many Japanese would find that hard to believe. Unemployment is rising sharply; the big, famous Japanese names such as Toyota, Panasonic and Sony are all making losses; exports are plummeting; and manufacturing output has dropped to a level last seen in 1983. Any Briton who thinks the reason our economy is weak is that we no longer have much manufacturing should come to Japan, for the reason Japan is weak is that it has too much (20% of GDP, compared with 10% in Britain), making precisely the things that everyone has just stopped buying, such as cars and fancy televisions.So where is the silver lining to all those clouds? It lies in politics, and the sharp kick in the pants that the economic crisis is about to give to the old political elite. A general election must be held by October at the latest, and could be forced much sooner. The same outfit - the Liberal Democratic party, which is actually a conservative group - has run the country for the whole of the past half century, barring nine months in 1993. The LDP survived even the country's stagnation during the 1990s, when Japan's financial crash destroyed its banking system. But, finally, the LDP is running out of road as fast as it long ago ran out of ideas. The prime minister, Taro Aso, has an approval rating that would shame even George Bush.As a result, the main opposition, the Democratic party of Japan, a centre-left group, is miles ahead in the opinion polls. Its leaders are plotting what they will do when they win power in a manner reminiscent of Labour in 1997, though with a touch of 1979 Thatcher too. The party's secretary-general, Yukio Hatoyama, says that as soon as it wins, the DPJ will outline its policies and fire any bureaucrat who won't support them.More than that, however, this opportunity matters because in Japan the public services are in desperate need of reform, just as the economy itself is. The national health system is starved of funds, with the recent tragic result that a woman died in childbirth after having been refused admission by several over-crowded hospitals. The public pension scheme is in disarray, with the government having lost 50m pension records and many people distrusting the state's promises. And, for all its fabled equality and social cohesion, this is a country where there is only a scant safety net for the unemployed, whose numbers are about to rise dramatically. Many of the new unemployed will be part-time and non-contract workers with low pay and few protections: new labour laws in 2001-03 enabled manufacturers to switch to cheap workers, raising profits but also enabling them to slash costs rapidly.It is a country, in other words, that is in desperate need of a change of government, and the election of a party dedicated to repairing broken social services as well as shaking up the economy. No doubt as and when the DPJ wins power, it will bring disappointments and its own occasionally shambolic ministers. No matter. The important thing in a democracy is to punish those who have failed and to bring in a new crowd capable of making new mistakes.

This was reported by some outlets as a tacit admission of failure - including CrunchGear, which said it clearly indicated that \"sales need a boost\" (despite admitting there were \"no official statistics\" on iPhone sales in Japan).The assumption that giving away phones for free is intended to stimulate demand makes sense, but to claim it represents failure ignores out the fact that free phones \u2013 subsidised by a long contract - are the norm in many countries outside of America, even for high-end smartphones and expensive new handsets.However, the presumption that the move to free was the result of terrible sales continued to spread until, finally, Wired.com's Brian X Chen tipped things over the edge. His story, entitled \"Why the Japanese hate the iPhone\", suggested that \"Apple's iPhone has wowed most of the globe \u2013 but not Japan, where the handset is selling so poorly it's being offered for free\".Like any negative comment about Apple, that drew vociferous reaction from the company's legion of fans \u2013 including as an absurd 3,000 word rebuff/rant by Apple Insider \u2013 but, intriguingly, also from one of the subjects interviewed for the article, Noboyuki Hayashi. He responded by publishing his actual view of the iPhone in Japan, including the full text of the email he sent Chen (none of which was used in the article).This all proved mildly entertaining for observers - but while it served to reiterate a couple of well-known facts (journalists get things wrong sometimes; Apple has a vast army of dedicated defenders) it did little to shed light on whether or not Japanese consumers actually like the iPhone.The best answer for that question comes from sales figures, and there aren't any official numbers available at the moment. However, Softbank said last year that the iPhone was boosting subscriber numbers and one industry estimate suggested that Japanese consumers had bought 200,000 iPhones in the three months after it launched last summer (Hayashi revised that figure to suggest it was in excess of 300,000). With concrete numbers telling story, that figure was contrasted with unsourced claims that Softbank and Apple had wanted to achieve 1 million units sold by the end of 2008. However, given that O2 has admitted it took 16 months to sell 1 million iPhones in Britain, reaching a similar number in less than six would be a stretch - even in Japan's mobile-crazy environment.All that's clear is that while the iPhone might not be a strong player in Japan's mobile culture \u2013 and with no built-in TV, no multimedia messaging it's not a surprise - it seems that plenty of Japanese people like it well enough. Not as exciting, but probably a bit more realistic.Update: An earlier version of this article said that the Japanese iPhone had no support for emoticons.

At nearby Uniqlo, the clothing retailer's Spring collection flies off the shelves; McDonald's employees struggle to keep up with orders for double quarter pounders with cheese.But this flurry of activity conceals a deep-seated malaise. Japan's shoppers are spending, but only on the cheapest necessities.The country's usually prodigious consumers are saving for a rainy day now that, after several years of growth, Japan is careering towards the deepest recession in its postwar history.That grim reality was underlined today with the news that the economy shrank 3.3% from October to December last year, its worst performance since the oil crisis of 1974. Many economists now expect it to remain in the doldrums until 2010.Japan's GDP has fallen for three quarters in a row at an annualised rate of 12.7%, the decline in Japanese GDP was three times that of the US during the same quarter. The US contracted by 1% during the same quarter and the eurozone by 1.5%.Described somewhat nonchalantly as the \"Lehman shokku\" (or shock) only a few months ago, the global crisis has left the Japanese confronting an uncomfortable truth: that everyone is an investment banker now.The Nikkei stock market average has shed 32% since September and exports are in the deep freeze. In December unemployment rose to 3.9%, its sharpest rise for 40 years, household sentiment is near a 26-year low while exporters, rocked by plunging global demand, have slashed jobs and production targets.Wholesale prices fell 0.2% in the year to January \u2013 their first drop for five years. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than half of the economy, fell 0.4% between October and December, and the Bank of Japan [BoJ] is warning of a two-year battle with deflation.Bankruptcies are up 16% from last year, with total debts among failed firms reaching \u00a5839bn (\u00a36.4bn). Those that have survived the onslaught are predicting an 83% fall in profits this year and a slew of redundancies: Nissan, Panasonic, Pioneer and NEC have announced a combined 65,000 job cuts in the past month alone.\"There is no doubt that this is the worst economic crisis of the postwar era,\" the economic and fiscal policy minister, Kaoru Yosano, said yesterday, adding that the collapse of car, machinery and IT exports had \"battered\" the economy.Though its banks are in comparatively good shape after an enforced house-cleaning earlier this decade, Japan's huge industrial base has left it hopelessly exposed to the fallout from the US financial crisis.While Japan's leaders boast that their country will be the first to emerge into the post-recession sunlight, it is likely to fall longer and harder than any of the G7 countries except Britain, according to the International Monetary Fund.The BoJ's chief economist, Kazuo Momma, warned that, even after last quarter's miserable performance, \"We have to consider the possibility that there could be an even greater decline between January and March.\"Some analysts share his pessimism. \"One thing we've learned over the past six months is that just because things are bad doesn't mean they can't get any worse,\" says Richard Jerram, chief Japan economist at Macquarie Securities In Tokyo.\"The Japanese consumer has gone into a state of panic, and people have decided that they want to avoid any major expenditure. There has been a sentiment shock.\"Having seen how Japan's refusal to heed the warnings 20 years ago led to a \"lost decade\" of stagnation, the US response has been quick by comparison.But in a week when the Congress passed a $789bn (\u00a3550bn) stimulus package, Japan's response has been rendered impotent by political gridlock and poor leadership.Even as a resurgent opposition stalls the passage of an existing \u00a510tn stimulus package, the embattled prime minister, Taro Aso, is mulling \u00a520tn in additional spending.Few believe the measures, including a one-off handout of \u00a512,000 for each \u00adcitizen, will kick-start flat consumer spending or bring Aso the boost he needs before a general election that must be held by September.Monetary measures have proved just as ineffective, despite a return to ultra-low interest rates and the BoJ's offer to buy up corporate debt and shares held by banks to ease the credit flow to vulnerable companies.Even Yosano appeared to concede that the government had run out of responses to the crisis. \"The situation is rapidly changing, due to factors beyond the Japanese government's control,\" he said.Jerram agrees. \"The government will work within all of the old reference points,\" he said, \"and whatever it decides to do will probably be insufficient and way too late. The government is in a hole but it's not prepared to consider anything wild and ambitious.\"It is just sitting tight and waiting for the situation in the US to improve. That is not economic policy it is economic fatalism. And it is a pretty bad way to run an economy.

However, given that O2 has admitted it took 16 months to sell 1 million iPhones in Britain, reaching a similar number in less than six would be a stretch - even in Japan's mobile-crazy environment.All that's clear is that while the iPhone might not be a strong player in Japan's mobile culture \u2013 and with no built-in TV, no multimedia messaging it's not a surprise - it seems that plenty of Japanese people like it well enough. Not as exciting, but probably a bit more realistic.Update: An earlier version of this article said that the Japanese iPhone had no support for emoticons.

The biofuel blend used, which was 84% camelina, 16% jatropha and less than 1% algae, brings optimism that the airline could be flying full passenger flights using only biofuels within 3-5 years.The remarkable crop, camelina, has been eyed for years as an affordable biofuel that can be grown easily in rotation with traditional food crops like wheat. Used as biodiesel, camelina could also potentially power cars and trucks cheaper than its petroleum counterpart. But for all of its use as a biofuel, it might be most exceptional as a cooking oil. Loaded with Omega-3 fatty acids, vegetable oils made from camelina are good for the heart and the brain, and could also be used as a cheap feed for fish and livestock.According to Sustainable Oils, Inc., a US-based provider of camelina fuels, plans are underway to haul out between 100 and 200 million gallons of the jet fuel as demand increases over the next half decade. The crop is best grown in moderate climates such as in the northern plains of North America, Northern Europe and Central Asia, which means it can be easily produced close to home for the world's most fuel-hungry nations.Given the Boeing prediction last year that flight-related greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced as much as 80% by switching to biofuels, this news bodes well for a notoriously dirty industry.

First, what was the nature of the two lost decades? For the whole of the 1990s Japan experienced what most western observers described as a deep recession, which neither zero interest rates or repeated government initiatives seemed capable of ending. However, this was a recession characterised by near stagnation of GDP and industrial output - but not by falling living standards. It also saw the continuation of high levels of surplus on the trade and current accounts, capital outflows and accumulation of central bank reserves. While not denying that there were problems, it can be argued that Japan, as perhaps the world's most mature economy, had reached a position of saturated markets and low but stable growth.This leads to the second question, the extent to which Japan should be regarded as export dependent. Again it can be argued that this continues to be greatly exaggerated. Japan's long-term trade surplus should be regarded as structural, reflecting a low propensity to import, a diversified production base substituting for imports, and a low level of reliance on foreign capital, as well as highly competitive exports. Third, despite high levels of trade and capital outflows, the Japanese economy remains relatively isolated from the global system with a highly internalised economy.

For the whole of the 1990s Japan experienced what most western observers described as a deep recession, which neither zero interest rates or repeated government initiatives seemed capable of ending. However, this was a recession characterised by near stagnation of GDP and industrial output - but not by falling living standards. It also saw the continuation of high levels of surplus on the trade and current accounts, capital outflows and accumulation of central bank reserves. While not denying that there were problems, it can be argued that Japan, as perhaps the world's most mature economy, had reached a position of saturated markets and low but stable growth.This leads to the second question, the extent to which Japan should be regarded as export dependent. Again it can be argued that this continues to be greatly exaggerated. Japan's long-term trade surplus should be regarded as structural, reflecting a low propensity to import, a diversified production base substituting for imports, and a low level of reliance on foreign capital, as well as highly competitive exports.

Salacious details of criminal cases fill the pages of the popular weekly magazines and provide fodder for cheap TV shows, but the court system itself is seen as distant, formal and, above all, dull.The courts have long been seen as a rubber-stamping exercise for cases already decided by confession (often coerced) in police cells, and the minutely detailed dossiers of public prosecutors. Added to this was a growing feeling that the courts were too remote from people. So in 2004, a law was passed to introduce a new method of adjudication for some criminal trials, beginning in May 2009. Now, the first trial using this system \u2013 a case of murder involving elderly neighbours \u2013 has just started in Tokyo.Some have characterised this saiban-inas a \"jury\" system, but it is actually a lay-judge system. Whereas in the UK 12 ordinary people are called by the courts to hear evidence and make a judgment on the guilt of the accused, in the new Japanese system six citizens join three professional judges. They not only hear evidence, but are also able to question witnesses and help decide the sentence.It seems an onerous task. So it is not surprising that many who were originally shortlisted for lay-judge duty but did not make the final six for the first trial are relieved to have escaped \u2013 not because, they found it inconvenient, but because of the burden of responsibility they felt. This has particular cultural components. Strongly stated opinions and absolutes are not favoured in Japan, and people like to keep options open.But why this particular, strange, hybrid system? The answer is that Japan had an almost identical system from 1928 to 1943. Progressives had tried to introduce a full Anglo-American style 12-person jury, but judges, and conservative and nationalist politicians opposed this and forced a compromise: the saiban-in system. The old system was in place for a very short time: it was hardly suited to the militarist regime that gained control in the 1930s, and was eventually ended.However, opposition seems rather different this time around. In the UK, civil libertarians have been fighting to defend jury systems, but in Japan civil liberties arguments have been marshalled by protesters against the new system. Opponents argue that the selection process violates privacy by forcing citizens' personal views to be exposed, and is authoritarian because citizens cannot refuse to serve except for health reasons. Some have even likened the system to a lynch mob, because Japan still has the death penalty.However, dig deeper, and underlying these arguments are conservative concerns and the once-again rising influence of nationalists akin to those of the late 1920s: defence of the \"professionalism\" of judges, and the arguments about the quasi-sacred integrity and necessary distance of courts from popular influence.More generally, even though this system is the result of a bill passed five years ago, it seems to reflect populist desperation from the increasingly unpopular ruling Liberal Democratic party, which faces defeat for the first time in decades in the general elections this month.If nothing else, the controversy over the legal system has excited Japanese people about the courts, and whatever happens in the future, goings-on in court that result in interest and engagement in criminal justice has to be a good thing.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Courting controversy in Japan | David Murakami Wood"},{"date": "2009-08-05T15:30:43Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan's courts are not usually the subject of massive popular interest in the country.

This year's event has warranted only a handful of cursory mentions in the Western games press. \"Man, Japan is over. We're done. Our game industry is finished,\" veteran Capcom game designer Keiji Inafune is quoted as saying on the show floor. A bleak prognosis, but sadly not an unreasonably alarmist one - Hideo Kojima made similar points at the start of the year.Indeed, Japanese game development has been in gradual decline for a decade. Sure, in the eighties and nineties, videogame culture was absolutely dominated by the big arcade releases - an arena monopolised by Japan. What players wanted from their consoles were pixel-perfect adaptations of coin-ops like Double Dragon, Street Fighter II, Daytona USA and Tekken. But in the mid-nineties, new audiences were drawn to the more expensive and intensely marketed PlayStation. At first they lapped up flashy arcade fare like Ridge Racer and Virtual Fighter, but then older gamers started to look for deep long-term challenges instead of quick 'hardcore' thrills; the influence of the arcade waned, and the whole structure of the industry evolved to embrace this change in appetite. Western developers began to create large, hugely ambitious adventure titles - the likes of Tomb Raider and Grand Theft Auto 3 - which drew their influences from Western culture, rather than manga and martial arts. Rockstar North mashed up mature sex and violence in a way that the big Japanese publishers would not even contemplate, kickstarting a massive new trend for adult interactive experiences far removed from the codified ramblings of Devil May Cry and Onimusha with their comic book mythologies and hyper stylised action. At the same time, the first-person shooter became a major console genre, the likes of Halo, Call of Duty and Medal of Honor bringing the PC gaming experience of choice to a ravenous new fanbase. But, Japanese developers had no background in PC development - the market was almost irrelevant in the country - so the whole FPS culture was alien to them. The same goes for the MMORPG phenomenon.Now, PES has relinquished its crown to FIFA, Resident Evil is in crisis after a weakened fifth instalment, Western developers have stolen, modified and globalised the whole rhythm action genre... Currently, the big Japanese publishers seem content to raid their back catalogues to exploit past glories - Capcom with SFIV, Mega Man and Bionic Commando, Namco with Tekken and Splatterhouse, Konami with Silent Hill, Castlevania and Vandal Hearts... The country's major companies have always been insular, always been keenest to appease the domestic market, but the problem is, no-one else is as interested anymore. So, is Japan really finished as a major force in game development?Well, of course not. For a start, you cannot possibly overlook the enormous impact of the Wii - the machine has revolutionalised the whole concept of the console/human interface, while the Fit brand is one of the biggest in the world right now. You also cannot overlook the fact that Sony is still a massive player in the manufacture of games hardware. And on the games side we're looking forward to Gran Turismo 5, Metal Gear Solid: Rising, Final Fantasy XIII, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Last Guardian, Metroid: Other M, a new Professor Layton game from Level-5, whatever Grasshopper Manufacture is currently working on... the list goes on.But more importantly - and on a more profound level - Japan still makes a singular contribution to the videogame culture and community. Japanese developers draw from a unique aesthetic, an approach to iconography, character design and structure that is unfathomable to studios in the west. The concept of kawaii is the obvious manifestation of this - Loco Roco, Pokemon, Puyo Puyo, Harvest Moon, Cooking Mama - none of them could have originated anywhere else. But it goes much deeper than that - into uses of digital space (Echochrome), movement (SFIV), metamorphosis (Resident Evil), psychological horror (Fatal Frame, Silent Hill), time and seasonality (Animal Crossing), etc, etc. Japanese developers are also more likely to toy with the arcane possibilities of the hardware - for example, introducing light sensors (Boktai), getting you to swap controller ports as a tactical gameplay element (Metal Gear Solid) - this isn't all just going to disappear.Look at Nintendo again - after the relative failure of Game Cube everyone had pretty much written off the company, then there was a moment of tangential genius - the Wii - and it's back to the top of the class for Miyamoto and co. Right now, Japanese development teams are embracing Natal; it is likely they will think of stuff that, say, Activision and Ubisoft wouldn't come up with in a hundred years of dedicated R&D. Some of it won't travel, but some of it will be astonishing, epoch-shattering even.This is, though, clearly a period of transition. It seems Japanese publishers are having difficulty adjusting to the mega-budget Hollywood-style development system required to create chart-topping titles for the current gen consoles. Studios wishing to make a global impact are going to have to take a broader cultural outlook - embracing Western tropes and influences. One way to smooth this process is creative co-operation; it's something Capcom has tried with Bionic Commando and Dead Rising 2, both of which were co-operative projects involving in-house Japanese producers and Western studios. It didn't work out with the former (indeed the Bionic Commando developer, GRIN, has now folded), but the Dead Rising sequel looks promising. The game isn't over; Japan has plenty of lives left.", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture"], "title": "Is Japan 'finished' in the games industry?"},{"date": "2009-08-05T15:30:43Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan's courts are not usually the subject of massive popular interest in the country.

Salacious details of criminal cases fill the pages of the popular weekly magazines and provide fodder for cheap TV shows, but the court system itself is seen as distant, formal and, above all, dull.The courts have long been seen as a rubber-stamping exercise for cases already decided by confession (often coerced) in police cells, and the minutely detailed dossiers of public prosecutors. Added to this was a growing feeling that the courts were too remote from people. So in 2004, a law was passed to introduce a new method of adjudication for some criminal trials, beginning in May 2009. Now, the first trial using this system \u2013 a case of murder involving elderly neighbours \u2013 has just started in Tokyo.Some have characterised this saiban-inas a \"jury\" system, but it is actually a lay-judge system. Whereas in the UK 12 ordinary people are called by the courts to hear evidence and make a judgment on the guilt of the accused, in the new Japanese system six citizens join three professional judges. They not only hear evidence, but are also able to question witnesses and help decide the sentence.It seems an onerous task. So it is not surprising that many who were originally shortlisted for lay-judge duty but did not make the final six for the first trial are relieved to have escaped \u2013 not because, they found it inconvenient, but because of the burden of responsibility they felt. This has particular cultural components. Strongly stated opinions and absolutes are not favoured in Japan, and people like to keep options open.But why this particular, strange, hybrid system? The answer is that Japan had an almost identical system from 1928 to 1943. Progressives had tried to introduce a full Anglo-American style 12-person jury, but judges, and conservative and nationalist politicians opposed this and forced a compromise: the saiban-in system. The old system was in place for a very short time: it was hardly suited to the militarist regime that gained control in the 1930s, and was eventually ended.However, opposition seems rather different this time around. In the UK, civil libertarians have been fighting to defend jury systems, but in Japan civil liberties arguments have been marshalled by protesters against the new system. Opponents argue that the selection process violates privacy by forcing citizens' personal views to be exposed, and is authoritarian because citizens cannot refuse to serve except for health reasons. Some have even likened the system to a lynch mob, because Japan still has the death penalty.However, dig deeper, and underlying these arguments are conservative concerns and the once-again rising influence of nationalists akin to those of the late 1920s: defence of the \"professionalism\" of judges, and the arguments about the quasi-sacred integrity and necessary distance of courts from popular influence.More generally, even though this system is the result of a bill passed five years ago, it seems to reflect populist desperation from the increasingly unpopular ruling Liberal Democratic party, which faces defeat for the first time in decades in the general elections this month.If nothing else, the controversy over the legal system has excited Japanese people about the courts, and whatever happens in the future, goings-on in court that result in interest and engagement in criminal justice has to be a good thing.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Courting controversy in Japan | David Murakami Wood"},{"date": "2009-08-28T10:33:38Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Unemployment in Japan rose to a record high and consumer prices dropped at an unprecedented pace last month, adding to fears that the country's economic recovery is already stalling under the grip of deflation.Just two weeks after Japan emerged from its worst recession in half a century, its internal affairs ministry said that the jobless rate rose to 5.7% in July from 5.4% a month earlier.

And like Mr\u00a0Obama, Mr\u00a0Hatoyama ran on a strong commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions; whatever else happens as a result of the DPJ's win, it is certainly good for the chances of a stronger rather than a weaker agreement in December's climate change talks in Copenhagen.Yet it would be a mistake to exaggerate the extent to which Japanese or US voters are part of some worldwide radicalisation against economic globalisation. Japan's problems, like those of the US, are specific to its own system. Japan's downturn also long predates the credit crunch. The system of de facto one-party LDP rule of the postwar era worked well as long as it delivered an uninterrupted rise in living standards. That ended in the recession of the early 1990s. Since then, the voters have given the LDP several chances to reform itself, which the party has spurned or failed to seize. Those failures have now caught up with the LDP.Mr Hatoyama will bring a more independent approach to Japan's international role. There will be a regional wind of change in East Asia. In\u00a0the end, though, the real test for the DPJ will be whether it can supply the healthcare, pension and job security that Japanese voters crave. This groundbreaking election was, in many respects, a revolt against the LDP's failure to reverse Japan's economic stagnation and decline rather than an uprising in favour of the DPJ's not always consistently argued alternatives.

Salacious details of criminal cases fill the pages of the popular weekly magazines and provide fodder for cheap TV shows, but the court system itself is seen as distant, formal and, above all, dull.The courts have long been seen as a rubber-stamping exercise for cases already decided by confession (often coerced) in police cells, and the minutely detailed dossiers of public prosecutors. Added to this was a growing feeling that the courts were too remote from people. So in 2004, a law was passed to introduce a new method of adjudication for some criminal trials, beginning in May 2009. Now, the first trial using this system \u2013 a case of murder involving elderly neighbours \u2013 has just started in Tokyo.Some have characterised this saiban-inas a \"jury\" system, but it is actually a lay-judge system. Whereas in the UK 12 ordinary people are called by the courts to hear evidence and make a judgment on the guilt of the accused, in the new Japanese system six citizens join three professional judges. They not only hear evidence, but are also able to question witnesses and help decide the sentence.It seems an onerous task. So it is not surprising that many who were originally shortlisted for lay-judge duty but did not make the final six for the first trial are relieved to have escaped \u2013 not because, they found it inconvenient, but because of the burden of responsibility they felt. This has particular cultural components. Strongly stated opinions and absolutes are not favoured in Japan, and people like to keep options open.But why this particular, strange, hybrid system? The answer is that Japan had an almost identical system from 1928 to 1943. Progressives had tried to introduce a full Anglo-American style 12-person jury, but judges, and conservative and nationalist politicians opposed this and forced a compromise: the saiban-in system. The old system was in place for a very short time: it was hardly suited to the militarist regime that gained control in the 1930s, and was eventually ended.However, opposition seems rather different this time around. In the UK, civil libertarians have been fighting to defend jury systems, but in Japan civil liberties arguments have been marshalled by protesters against the new system. Opponents argue that the selection process violates privacy by forcing citizens' personal views to be exposed, and is authoritarian because citizens cannot refuse to serve except for health reasons. Some have even likened the system to a lynch mob, because Japan still has the death penalty.However, dig deeper, and underlying these arguments are conservative concerns and the once-again rising influence of nationalists akin to those of the late 1920s: defence of the \"professionalism\" of judges, and the arguments about the quasi-sacred integrity and necessary distance of courts from popular influence.More generally, even though this system is the result of a bill passed five years ago, it seems to reflect populist desperation from the increasingly unpopular ruling Liberal Democratic party, which faces defeat for the first time in decades in the general elections this month.If nothing else, the controversy over the legal system has excited Japanese people about the courts, and whatever happens in the future, goings-on in court that result in interest and engagement in criminal justice has to be a good thing.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Courting controversy in Japan | David Murakami Wood"},{"date": "2009-08-28T10:33:38Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Unemployment in Japan rose to a record high and consumer prices dropped at an unprecedented pace last month, adding to fears that the country's economic recovery is already stalling under the grip of deflation.Just two weeks after Japan emerged from its worst recession in half a century, its internal affairs ministry said that the jobless rate rose to 5.7% in July from 5.4% a month earlier. Core consumer prices fell 2.2% as concern mounted that the world's second biggest economy is caught in a deflationary spiral.The figures will come as a blow to the prime minister, Taro Aso, whose Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to suffer a heavy defeat in Sunday's general election.Household spending fell 2% last month in a further sign that the boost provided by one-off cash handouts as part of Aso's record \u00a525tn (\u00a3163bn) stimulus programme was beginning to wear off.\"Japanese households are becoming increasingly defensive as the environment surrounding wages and employment turns severe,\" said Kyohei Morita, the chief economist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo.Unemployment, at its highest level since records began in 1953, surpassed the previous record of 5.5% in April 2003 and was expected to rise as high as 6% next year.Takeo Kawamura, the senior government spokesman, defended his party's record on handling the economic crisis. \"There is no denying the fact that the economy is improving overall,\" Kawamura said.Figures out last week showed that the economy grew at an annualised rate of 3.7% in the second quarter of this year \u2013 the first expansion for more than a year.Analysts expect the LDP to be punished for failing to stem job losses as it braces itself for only its second period in opposition for more than 50 years.The number of people out of work rose by more than 200,000 in July, the ministry said, bringing the jobless total to 3.59 million \u2013 more than a million up on last year.\"The rise to a record high in the jobless rate was expected but the worsening job and income situation highlights worries about the Japanese economy heading into a double dip as the government stimulus runs out,\" Yuichi Kodama, an analyst at Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance, told Reuters.\"The economy's recovery may slow down in July-September compared with April-June.\"", "tags": ["Global recession", "Japan", "Economics", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan unemployment hits record high"},{"date": "2009-08-17T07:16:36Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has emerged from its worst recession since the end of the second world war, recording its first quarter of growth for more than a year amid a rise in exports.Japan's fledgling recovery saw gross domestic product (GDP) rise at an annualised rate of 3.7% from April to June, and by 0.9% from the previous three months, the cabinet office said.Exports rose 6.3% from three months earlier, the first increase since the start of 2008 and the biggest gain since the second quarter of 2002.The emergence of the world's second-largest economy from recession follows last week's news that Germany and France \u2013 the two biggest economies in the eurozone \u2013 returned to growth in the second quarter.Freefalling global demand for the consumer durables on which Japan built its economic success \u2013 notably consumer electronics and cars \u2013 were to blame for dragging it into a recession from which few believed it would emerge so quickly.The guarded optimism now surrounding Japan is shared elsewhere.The US economy shrank at an annualised 1% last quarter, its smallest contraction in a year, while the 0.1% contraction seen in the eurozone was its best showing for more than a year. China's economy, helped by a vast $586bn (\u00a3357bn) stimulus package, grew 7.9% from a year earlier.The figures appear to bear out prime minister Taro Aso's assurance that Japan would be one of the first major economies to emerge from recession, although polls suggest they probably will not be enough to save his Liberal Democratic party from defeat in the general election in a fortnight's time.Though parts of his \u00a525tn (\u00a3160bn) stimulus package were derided \u2013 in particular the cash handouts to all residents \u2013 those, together with subsidies for fuel-efficient cars and green electrical appliances, have produced at least some short-term benefits.Experts warned, however, that the recovery could quickly fizzle out without improvements in demand at home, where falling wages and job fears have hit household spending.Unemployment is at a six-year high of 5.4% and could rise to a record 5.8% next year. In addition, wages fell 1.7% in the last quarter, while consumer spending, which accounts for 55% of the economy, rose just 0.8% from the previous three months. Public investment, buoyed by the government stimulus, was up 8.1%.Private capital investment dropped 4.3% from the previous quarter, while housing investment fell 9.5%, the government said.Hiroshi Watanabe, an economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo, said: \"When you look at the numbers, the contrast between external demand and internal demand is as clear as night and day. With payments falling, it's really hard to expect individual spending to hold up.\"Still, even modest, export-led growth offers respite after more than a year of contraction that included a record 13.1% annualised drop in GDP in the last quarter of last year and an 11.7% fall in the first quarter of this year.Yoshimasa Hayashi, the economic and fiscal policy minister, warned of continued threats to sustained recovery. \"Production is still at a low level, and worries remain that employment conditions will worsen,\" he said. \"So we must watch the downside risks.\"The Asia-Pacific region has surprised many analysts with the speed of its recovery.

This year's event has warranted only a handful of cursory mentions in the Western games press. \"Man, Japan is over. We're done. Our game industry is finished,\" veteran Capcom game designer Keiji Inafune is quoted as saying on the show floor. A bleak prognosis, but sadly not an unreasonably alarmist one - Hideo Kojima made similar points at the start of the year.Indeed, Japanese game development has been in gradual decline for a decade. Sure, in the eighties and nineties, videogame culture was absolutely dominated by the big arcade releases - an arena monopolised by Japan. What players wanted from their consoles were pixel-perfect adaptations of coin-ops like Double Dragon, Street Fighter II, Daytona USA and Tekken. But in the mid-nineties, new audiences were drawn to the more expensive and intensely marketed PlayStation. At first they lapped up flashy arcade fare like Ridge Racer and Virtual Fighter, but then older gamers started to look for deep long-term challenges instead of quick 'hardcore' thrills; the influence of the arcade waned, and the whole structure of the industry evolved to embrace this change in appetite. Western developers began to create large, hugely ambitious adventure titles - the likes of Tomb Raider and Grand Theft Auto 3 - which drew their influences from Western culture, rather than manga and martial arts. Rockstar North mashed up mature sex and violence in a way that the big Japanese publishers would not even contemplate, kickstarting a massive new trend for adult interactive experiences far removed from the codified ramblings of Devil May Cry and Onimusha with their comic book mythologies and hyper stylised action. At the same time, the first-person shooter became a major console genre, the likes of Halo, Call of Duty and Medal of Honor bringing the PC gaming experience of choice to a ravenous new fanbase. But, Japanese developers had no background in PC development - the market was almost irrelevant in the country - so the whole FPS culture was alien to them. The same goes for the MMORPG phenomenon.Now, PES has relinquished its crown to FIFA, Resident Evil is in crisis after a weakened fifth instalment, Western developers have stolen, modified and globalised the whole rhythm action genre... Currently, the big Japanese publishers seem content to raid their back catalogues to exploit past glories - Capcom with SFIV, Mega Man and Bionic Commando, Namco with Tekken and Splatterhouse, Konami with Silent Hill, Castlevania and Vandal Hearts... The country's major companies have always been insular, always been keenest to appease the domestic market, but the problem is, no-one else is as interested anymore. So, is Japan really finished as a major force in game development?Well, of course not. For a start, you cannot possibly overlook the enormous impact of the Wii - the machine has revolutionalised the whole concept of the console/human interface, while the Fit brand is one of the biggest in the world right now. You also cannot overlook the fact that Sony is still a massive player in the manufacture of games hardware. And on the games side we're looking forward to Gran Turismo 5, Metal Gear Solid: Rising, Final Fantasy XIII, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Last Guardian, Metroid: Other M, a new Professor Layton game from Level-5, whatever Grasshopper Manufacture is currently working on... the list goes on.But more importantly - and on a more profound level - Japan still makes a singular contribution to the videogame culture and community. Japanese developers draw from a unique aesthetic, an approach to iconography, character design and structure that is unfathomable to studios in the west. The concept of kawaii is the obvious manifestation of this - Loco Roco, Pokemon, Puyo Puyo, Harvest Moon, Cooking Mama - none of them could have originated anywhere else. But it goes much deeper than that - into uses of digital space (Echochrome), movement (SFIV), metamorphosis (Resident Evil), psychological horror (Fatal Frame, Silent Hill), time and seasonality (Animal Crossing), etc, etc. Japanese developers are also more likely to toy with the arcane possibilities of the hardware - for example, introducing light sensors (Boktai), getting you to swap controller ports as a tactical gameplay element (Metal Gear Solid) - this isn't all just going to disappear.Look at Nintendo again - after the relative failure of Game Cube everyone had pretty much written off the company, then there was a moment of tangential genius - the Wii - and it's back to the top of the class for Miyamoto and co. Right now, Japanese development teams are embracing Natal; it is likely they will think of stuff that, say, Activision and Ubisoft wouldn't come up with in a hundred years of dedicated R&D. Some of it won't travel, but some of it will be astonishing, epoch-shattering even.This is, though, clearly a period of transition. It seems Japanese publishers are having difficulty adjusting to the mega-budget Hollywood-style development system required to create chart-topping titles for the current gen consoles. Studios wishing to make a global impact are going to have to take a broader cultural outlook - embracing Western tropes and influences. One way to smooth this process is creative co-operation; it's something Capcom has tried with Bionic Commando and Dead Rising 2, both of which were co-operative projects involving in-house Japanese producers and Western studios. It didn't work out with the former (indeed the Bionic Commando developer, GRIN, has now folded), but the Dead Rising sequel looks promising.

The ruling conservative Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has held power for 52 of the past 53 years. It is the political linchpin of the US-Japan alliance. Now, largely due to lamentable domestic policy failures, opinion polls suggest it is all but dead in the water.The centre-left Democratic party of Japan (DPJ), ahead by up to 20 points in some surveys, is committed, on paper at least, to a radical reappraisal of Japan's postwar defence partnership with Washington. Its manifesto pledges to \"re-examine the role of the US military in the security of the Asia-Pacific region and the significance of US bases in Japan\". Questions have been raised about the continuing presence of roughly 50,000 American troops on Japanese soil and more broadly, about Japan's military support for US operations in Iraq and now in Afghanistan.At the same time, DPJ leaders are advocating improved ties with former adversaries, notably China and South Korea, strained during the 2001-2006 premiership of Junichiro Koizumi. Party chief Yukio Hatoyama has vowed not to follow Koizumi in paying respects to Japan's war dead at the Yasukini shrine in Tokyo, seen in Beijing as a symbol of unrepentant Japanese militarism.Speaking in Tokyo today at a Thomson Reuters conference, Katsuya Okada, the DPJ's second-in-command, said the party wanted an equal relationship with the Obama administration. \"There are various issues of concern between Japan and the US. It is necessary \u2026 to work on changing systems based on trust,\" he said. Japan lacked independence, he complained. \"If Japan just follows what the US says, then I think as a sovereign nation that is very pathetic.\"Okada expressed impatience with the pace of international nuclear disarmament, always a sensitive issue in Japan. Although his party welcomed Barack Obama's call for a nuclear-free world, he suggested Japan should pursue its own disarmament and non-proliferation policies. These and other apparently game-changing DPJ positions have led to talk of a generational shift in Japanese politics, bringing to office leaders who have no personal memories, guilty or otherwise, of the war, and no particular reason to thank the US for the postwar alliance.For all the chit-chat about mould-breaking, a sharp reality check may await the DPJ. Take the nuclear issue: as prime minister Taro Aso noted in Hiroshima last week, Japan continues to benefit from the US \"nuclear umbrella\" when it comes to threats from North Korea, just as during the cold war. While most Japanese supported the abolition of nuclear weapons, he said, such a development was unlikely in the foreseeable future, whatever the DPJ might do or say.Despite its talk of Asian outreach, the DPJ has already confirmed it will adhere to Aso's tough line on North Korea's nukes and missiles and the long-running issue of Japanese citizens abducted by Pyongyang. It will also continue with a $3.1bn missile defence programme jointly developed with the US.In a similarly realistic vein, the DPJ admitted this week that notwithstanding growing economic inter-dependence, China's rapidly rising military spending was a concern. But there was not much it could do about it.\"There is no option for us to be in a military conflict. We should not be in an arms race but rather aiming to reduce arms in the future,\" Okada said almost plaintively. Japan is currently struggling with its worst postwar recession while China is its top two-way trading partner and its biggest 2008 export market \u2013 after the US.The DPJ reacted cautiously last week to a government defence review that recommended easing constitutional constraints to allow Japan's military to expand global co-operation with the US. In truth, its circumspection reflect splits within the party about how far to go in loosening the US leash \u2013 or whether to try at all.Nor will the US voluntarily relax its close embrace, just because some new faces show up at Tokyo head office next month. According to Harvard professor Joseph Nye, Washington attaches high priority to its Japanese alliance, \"a central feature of stability in east Asia\". Shared concerns ranging from China to trans-national pandemics, terrorism and the threats posed by failed states would bind the US and Japan more closely than ever in the 21st century, he predicted.It's a lesson other useful long-time US allies, such as Britain, have learned over the years.

Analysts said worldwide sales of the latest instalment of the 22-year-old game could reach 5.6m.This is the first time the title has appeared on the PS3 platform; the US and European versions, which go on sale on 9 March, will also be available for Microsoft's Xbox 360, the second most popular games console after the Nintendo Wii. (Final Fantasy XIII is not appearing on the Wii.)The game has sold more than 92m units worldwide since its release in 1987.With a price tag of about US$100 (\u00a360), the success of the game would provide a much-needed boost for game software sales in Japan, which declined 7.5% to 132.9bn yen (about \u00a3900m) in the six months to 30 September from a year earlier, according to Enterbrain, a Japanese magazine publisher and analyst.Some industry watchers expect the title to increase PS3 sales by 500,000 units. That will be important for Sony, which has languished in third place for sales of the PS3 since it was released \u2013 after significant delays and high production costs \u2013 in November 2006, nearly a year after the Xbox 360 and Wii. That allowed its rivals to consolidate markets, and Microsoft has focused recently on ensuring that some hit games are sold only on the Xbox 360, such as Forza Motorsport 2 and 3, Gears of War and Halo 3.But sales of the PS3 have now exceeded 4m, Enterbrain said this week, helped by the introduction of a cheaper model in September. The console now costs about half what it did when it went on sale three years ago \u2013 although the supply chain analysis company iSuppli estimated earlier this month that Sony still loses an estimated $30 on each one.The price cut helped make the PS3 the top-selling console in the US during September, the first time it had outstripped sales of both the Wii and Xbox 360.In Final Fantasy's latest incarnation, which was five years in the making, players use a combination of magic and technology to help their characters battle enemies and progress through a futuristic setting.\"Of course, you can complete the game relatively quickly if you want, but if you take your time you'll be able to live inside the game for several months,\" said Square Enix's president, Yoichi Wada.", "tags": ["Games", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "Wii", "Nintendo", "Microsoft", "Sony", "Technology", "World news", "Japan", "Role playing games", "Asia Pacific", "Final Fantasy", "Games consoles"], "title": "Final Fantasy XIII hits shelves in Japan"},{"date": "2009-11-10T11:24:24Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday 23 November 2009In the article below we said that the body of Lindsay Hawker, a British teacher, was found at a flat in Ichikawa, east of Tokyo: in fact the city is Ishikawa Police in Japan say they are questioning the man suspected of murdering Lindsay Hawker, a British teacher whose badly beaten body was found in an apartment near Tokyo in March 2007.TV reports said Tatsuya Ichihashi, 30, had been arrested in Osaka, western Japan, days after it was revealed he had attempted to transform his appearance by undergoing extensive plastic surgery.The development came just over two and a half years after Hawker's body was found at Ichihashi's apartment in Ichikawa, a suburban town in Chiba prefecture east of Tokyo.The 22-year-old, from Brandon, near Coventry, had been severely beaten and strangled, and her arms and legs bound with plastic cord.The British teacher's father, Bill Hawker, welcomed the arrest of her suspected killer as \"a good day for the Hawkers\".He said he would travel to Japan as he \"wanted to look Ichihashi in the eyes himself. We wanted justice and we've finally got justice,\" Hawker said.He added that Ichihashi had shown \"no remorse\" over the past two and a half years. \"This has been a long hard battle and the battle is over. We have worked tirelessly as a family, we have never given up,\" Hawker said. He added: \"I hope the Japanese society give him the maximum punishment available.\"Early reports said police had stopped Ichihashi as he was about to board a ferry for Okinawa.Earlier Ichihashi's mother called a TV programme to plead with her son to give himself up, the first public comment made by his parents, both wealthy medical professionals, since his disappearance.\"It's mum, Tatsuya,\" the woman said in an audio message aired on Fuji TV. \"Dad and mum have decided to speak about our feelings, although we know you won't like this.\"She said she and her husband were pleased to hear comments in the media by his construction site colleagues that he had been a hard worker and wanted to be good to his parents. \"If so, please go to [the] police station and tell them the truth. Please.\"The Japanese media reported today that Ichihashi had lived in the Osaka area for just over a year until last month, working as a day labourer for a construction firm. He is thought to have saved about 1m yen (\u00a36,600), enough to pay for cosmetic surgery.Ichihashi's fingerprints were found in a dormitory belonging to the firm, along with comics, an English dictionary and a passport application, leading police to believe he may have been planning to flee overseas.Ichihashi, who had stalked Hawker and followed her home on one occasion, evaded nine police officers when he was approached for questioning and has remained at large ever since, despite fleeing in bare feet and with no money.Hours before her death, security cameras captured Hawker giving Ichihashi a private language lesson in a nearby cafe after he had begged her to teach him English. One theory is that he lured her to his flat after pretending he had insufficient cash with him to pay for the lesson.Subsequent leads have come to nothing, despite 8,000 reported sightings. In June, police increased the reward for information leading to his arrest from 1m yen to 10m yen.Hawker had been teaching English at a branch of the Nova English conversation school since October 2006, after graduating from Leeds University that year.", "tags": ["Lindsay Hawker", "Japan", "UK news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Lindsay Hawker murder suspect arrested in Japan"},{"date": "2009-12-30T13:00:02Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Shares in Japan Airlines plunged to a record low today amid rumours that Asia's biggest carrier could file for bankruptcy in an attempt to turn around its failing business.The transport minister, Seiji Maehara, and other cabinet ministers were this evening holding crisis talks to discuss JAL's options ahead of an official decision on the airline's future late next month.Maehara told reporters that no decision had been made on whether JAL should be exposed to court-led bankruptcy, and promised state backing for its restructuring efforts, possibly though bridge loans.JAL shares closed down 24% at \u00a567 (46p), having plunged 32% at one stage, with investors taking flight amid media reports that liquidation was now under serious consideration.\"Investors were very nervous about the fate of JAL,\" said Masatoshi Sato, a market analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities. \"With recent reports saying the airline could face bankruptcy, investors were panicking that their JAL stock ownership could be worthless.\"Liquidation could leave JAL shareholders, whose shares were each worth \u00a5213 at the start of the year, with zero.Media reports quoted an official as saying that bankruptcy is the \"strongest possibility\" being considered by the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation [ETIC], a government-backed body formed in October to decide the airline's fate.The ETIC has up to \u00a51.6tn in state-guaranteed funding at its disposal and, according to reports, is still considering a private restructuring plan that would not involve the courts.But bankruptcy became a realistic option last week after the finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, said the government would no longer guarantee loans to JAL. Until now, banks have lent to the airline on the understanding that the loans are guaranteed by the state.Fujii's surprise announcement was a major blow to JAL, the beneficiary of four bailouts since 2001, as the government had been expected to provide up to \u00a5100bn in credit through the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ).Fujii said: \"This is a matter that should be worked out by private companies. The DBJ is wholly owned by the state but it has the status of a private bank so the government is not allowed to meddle in its business.\"JAL's three biggest creditors, Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsubishi, reportedly rejected liquidation during fractious talks with Maehara yesterday.It would saddle them with huge losses on their investments and risk grounding the airline's fleet if it is unable to find enough ready cash to buy fuel and parts from nervous suppliers.Bankruptcy could also complicate rival bids for a minority stake from Delta and American Airlines.The US airlines are hoping to use a partnership with JAL to expand their trans-Pacific services and gain a stronger foothold in the Asian market ahead of the expansion of Haneda airport in Tokyo next year.The Asahi Shimbun newspaper claimed earlier this month that JAL was leaning towards the $1bn (\u00a3630m) bid from Delta, the world's biggest airline, in a move that would end its Oneworld alliance with American, which has offered $1.1bn.A capital tie-up with either could herald a dramatic reshaping of the global aviation industry, as it would give the buyer access to JAL's Chinese and other Asian routes through code-sharing agreements.JAL is heading for its fourth annual loss in five years as a result of the global slump in air travel, inefficiency and an unwieldy pension scheme.The ETIC is expected to ask JAL to cut 9,000 jobs and scrap 45 domestic and international routes in return for capital. The airline had already said it would suspend 50 domestic and international routes by March 2011, and cut 6,800 \u2013 14% of JAL's workforce \u2013 by March the following year.The airline could struggle, however, to secure the two-thirds approval it needs from employees to cut retirement payouts and make a sizeable dent in its \u00a5330bn pension shortfall.Last year it lost \u00a563.2bn but, in a move indicative of its current turmoil, has withdrawn a forecast of similar losses for the year to March 2010.Given the airline's liabilities, which totalled \u00a51.5tn at the end of September, its bankruptcy would be the sixth biggest in Japanese corporate history.", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Japan", "Business", "World news", "Travel & leisure", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "title":

airbase and thousands of troops based on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa was not up for negotiation in a further sign of growing tensions over the future of the US military footprint in east Asia.Reports said the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, told the Japanese ambassador to Washington, Ichiro Fujisaki, that Japan must honour a 2006 agreement to move the Futenma airbase \u2013 located in a crowded city on Okinawa \u2013 to the island's remote east coast.Fujisaki told reporters the discussion had centred on \"the importance of US-Japan\" ties, but Clinton reportedly made it clear that the US expected \"swift implementation\" of the existing accord.Last week, the Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, said he needed more time to determine the base's future following electoral promises to lessen the Japanese dependence on US foreign policy.The original $10.3bn (\u00a36.4bn) relocation plan would also see the transfer of 8,000 marines and their families to the US Pacific territory of Guam by 2014.Discussions about the relocation began well over a decade ago amid mounting opposition to the US military presence on Okinawa, which hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan.The bases are routinely blamed for noise and air pollution, and residents live with the threat of a catastrophic accident.Although serious crimes are relatively uncommon, attitudes changed after three US servicemen were convicted of raping a 12-year-old Okinawan girl in 1995.The Japanese defence minister, Toshimi Kitazawa, said Tokyo had set itself a May 2010 deadline to decide the base's future, but added that he hoped an agreement would be reached sooner.Japan's decision to postpone a decision has been met with an exasperated reaction by US military officials.Last week, General James Conway, the commandant of the US marine corps, said the delay was \"unfortunate\", adding, \"The Futenma replacement facility is absolutely vital to the defence that we provide for the entire region.\"Hatoyama's indecision is also harming his popularity at home, about six months before upper house elections that could give his Democratic party of Japan control of both houses of parliament.In a poll published by the Mainichi newspaper yesterday, 68% of respondents said they were concerned about ties with the US.The Futenma debacle and Hatoyama's handling of the economy saw his cabinet's approval rating slide to 55%, down 9% from last month, the poll revealed.Almost four months after his party swept to power in a landslide election victory, Hatoyama appears no closer to reaching a decision on Futenma.He could choose to honour the original agreement, but the delay suggests he is more sympathetic to moving the base to another part of Japan.The social democratic party, a junior partner in Hatoyama's coalition government, supports moving the base out of Japan and has threatened to leave the coalition if the existing accord is implemented.Barack Obama's irritation was evident earlier this month when the US president snubbed an offer from Hatoyama to explain his thinking on Futenma's future on the sidelines of the climate change summit in Copenhagen.", "tags":

But a spectacular \"bike tree\" invention from Japan bowled me over when I was in Tokyo a couple of weeks ago.Fed up with bicycles locked to railings, piled on top of each other, blocking doorways and roads, a local council in the city installed the mechanical masterpiece. It's basically an automatic storage system for cycles and operates with computer tagging of bikes and either storage in a building or a basement structure.There are a number of locations where these bike trees are now in place in Tokyo \u2013 some hold 600-odd bikes, others more than 6,000. The concept came from the massive Japanese steel company JFE, whose engineering works division first started them in 2007 but are now spreading.The idea is quite simple, although no doubt the technology is fiendishly complicated. Bike owners who want a secure parking spot must register and pay a monthly fee \u2013 1,800 yen (around \u00a312 a month) \u2013 and students get discounts.Bikes are fitted with a small electronic tag. When the bike is placed into the ruts of the bike tree machine, a sensor logs the owner's details. A mechanical arm then emerges, pulls the bike into a cylindrical well and stores it at high speed in a free location. To retrieve the bike, the owner swipes a card through a reader and the bike is plucked from racks and brought back down \u2013 or up if it's a basement design \u2013 to earth.

Analysts said worldwide sales of the latest instalment of the 22-year-old game could reach 5.6m.This is the first time the title has appeared on the PS3 platform; the US and European versions, which go on sale on 9 March, will also be available for Microsoft's Xbox 360, the second most popular games console after the Nintendo Wii. (Final Fantasy XIII is not appearing on the Wii.)The game has sold more than 92m units worldwide since its release in 1987.With a price tag of about US$100 (\u00a360), the success of the game would provide a much-needed boost for game software sales in Japan, which declined 7.5% to 132.9bn yen (about \u00a3900m) in the six months to 30 September from a year earlier, according to Enterbrain, a Japanese magazine publisher and analyst.Some industry watchers expect the title to increase PS3 sales by 500,000 units. That will be important for Sony, which has languished in third place for sales of the PS3 since it was released \u2013 after significant delays and high production costs \u2013 in November 2006, nearly a year after the Xbox 360 and Wii. That allowed its rivals to consolidate markets, and Microsoft has focused recently on ensuring that some hit games are sold only on the Xbox 360, such as Forza Motorsport 2 and 3, Gears of War and Halo 3.But sales of the PS3 have now exceeded 4m, Enterbrain said this week, helped by the introduction of a cheaper model in September. The console now costs about half what it did when it went on sale three years ago \u2013 although the supply chain analysis company iSuppli estimated earlier this month that Sony still loses an estimated $30 on each one.The price cut helped make the PS3 the top-selling console in the US during September, the first time it had outstripped sales of both the Wii and Xbox 360.In Final Fantasy's latest incarnation, which was five years in the making, players use a combination of magic and technology to help their characters battle enemies and progress through a futuristic setting.\"Of course, you can complete the game relatively quickly if you want, but if you take your time you'll be able to live inside the game for several months,\" said Square Enix's president, Yoichi Wada.", "tags": ["Games", "PlayStation", "Xbox", "Wii", "Nintendo", "Microsoft", "Sony", "Technology", "World news", "Japan", "Role playing games", "Asia Pacific", "Final Fantasy", "Games consoles"], "title": "Final Fantasy XIII hits shelves in Japan"},{"date": "2009-11-10T11:24:24Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Monday 23 November 2009In the article below we said that the body of Lindsay Hawker, a British teacher, was found at a flat in Ichikawa, east of Tokyo: in fact the city is Ishikawa Police in Japan say they are questioning the man suspected of murdering Lindsay Hawker, a British teacher whose badly beaten body was found in an apartment near Tokyo in March 2007.TV reports said Tatsuya Ichihashi, 30, had been arrested in Osaka, western Japan, days after it was revealed he had attempted to transform his appearance by undergoing extensive plastic surgery.The development came just over two and a half years after Hawker's body was found at Ichihashi's apartment in Ichikawa, a suburban town in Chiba prefecture east of Tokyo.The 22-year-old, from Brandon, near Coventry, had been severely beaten and strangled, and her arms and legs bound with plastic cord.The British teacher's father, Bill Hawker, welcomed the arrest of her suspected killer as \"a good day for the Hawkers\".He said he would travel to Japan as he \"wanted to look Ichihashi in the eyes himself. We wanted justice and we've finally got justice,\" Hawker said.He added that Ichihashi had shown \"no remorse\" over the past two and a half years. \"This has been a long hard battle and the battle is over. We have worked tirelessly as a family, we have never given up,\" Hawker said. He added: \"I hope the Japanese society give him the maximum punishment available.\"Early reports said police had stopped Ichihashi as he was about to board a ferry for Okinawa.Earlier Ichihashi's mother called a TV programme to plead with her son to give himself up, the first public comment made by his parents, both wealthy medical professionals, since his disappearance.\"It's mum, Tatsuya,\" the woman said in an audio message aired on Fuji TV. \"Dad and mum have decided to speak about our feelings, although we know you won't like this.\"She said she and her husband were pleased to hear comments in the media by his construction site colleagues that he had been a hard worker and wanted to be good to his parents. \"If so, please go to [the] police station and tell them the truth. Please.\"The Japanese media reported today that Ichihashi had lived in the Osaka area for just over a year until last month, working as a day labourer for a construction firm. He is thought to have saved about 1m yen (\u00a36,600), enough to pay for cosmetic surgery.Ichihashi's fingerprints were found in a dormitory belonging to the firm, along with comics, an English dictionary and a passport application, leading police to believe he may have been planning to flee overseas.Ichihashi, who had stalked Hawker and followed her home on one occasion, evaded nine police officers when he was approached for questioning and has remained at large ever since, despite fleeing in bare feet and with no money.Hours before her death, security cameras captured Hawker giving Ichihashi a private language lesson in a nearby cafe after he had begged her to teach him English. One theory is that he lured her to his flat after pretending he had insufficient cash with him to pay for the lesson.Subsequent leads have come to nothing, despite 8,000 reported sightings. In June, police increased the reward for information leading to his arrest from 1m yen to 10m yen.Hawker had been teaching English at a branch of the Nova English conversation school since October 2006, after graduating from Leeds University that year.", "tags": ["Lindsay Hawker", "Japan", "UK news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Lindsay Hawker murder suspect arrested in Japan"},{"date": "2009-12-30T13:00:02Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Shares in Japan Airlines plunged to a record low today amid rumours that Asia's biggest carrier could file for bankruptcy in an attempt to turn around its failing business.The transport minister, Seiji Maehara, and other cabinet ministers were this evening holding crisis talks to discuss JAL's options ahead of an official decision on the airline's future late next month.Maehara told reporters that no decision had been made on whether JAL should be exposed to court-led bankruptcy, and promised state backing for its restructuring efforts, possibly though bridge loans.JAL shares closed down 24% at \u00a567 (46p), having plunged 32% at one stage, with investors taking flight amid media reports that liquidation was now under serious consideration.\"Investors were very nervous about the fate of JAL,\" said Masatoshi Sato, a market analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities. \"With recent reports saying the airline could face bankruptcy, investors were panicking that their JAL stock ownership could be worthless.\"Liquidation could leave JAL shareholders, whose shares were each worth \u00a5213 at the start of the year, with zero.Media reports quoted an official as saying that bankruptcy is the \"strongest possibility\" being considered by the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation [ETIC], a government-backed body formed in October to decide the airline's fate.The ETIC has up to \u00a51.6tn in state-guaranteed funding at its disposal and, according to reports, is still considering a private restructuring plan that would not involve the courts.But bankruptcy became a realistic option last week after the finance minister, Hirohisa Fujii, said the government would no longer guarantee loans to JAL. Until now, banks have lent to the airline on the understanding that the loans are guaranteed by the state.Fujii's surprise announcement was a major blow to JAL, the beneficiary of four bailouts since 2001, as the government had been expected to provide up to \u00a5100bn in credit through the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ).Fujii said: \"This is a matter that should be worked out by private companies. The DBJ is wholly owned by the state but it has the status of a private bank so the government is not allowed to meddle in its business.\"JAL's three biggest creditors, Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsubishi, reportedly rejected liquidation during fractious talks with Maehara yesterday.It would saddle them with huge losses on their investments and risk grounding the airline's fleet if it is unable to find enough ready cash to buy fuel and parts from nervous suppliers.Bankruptcy could also complicate rival bids for a minority stake from Delta and American Airlines.The US airlines are hoping to use a partnership with JAL to expand their trans-Pacific services and gain a stronger foothold in the Asian market ahead of the expansion of Haneda airport in Tokyo next year.The Asahi Shimbun newspaper claimed earlier this month that JAL was leaning towards the $1bn (\u00a3630m) bid from Delta, the world's biggest airline, in a move that would end its Oneworld alliance with American, which has offered $1.1bn.A capital tie-up with either could herald a dramatic reshaping of the global aviation industry, as it would give the buyer access to JAL's Chinese and other Asian routes through code-sharing agreements.JAL is heading for its fourth annual loss in five years as a result of the global slump in air travel, inefficiency and an unwieldy pension scheme.The ETIC is expected to ask JAL to cut 9,000 jobs and scrap 45 domestic and international routes in return for capital. The airline had already said it would suspend 50 domestic and international routes by March 2011, and cut 6,800 \u2013 14% of JAL's workforce \u2013 by March the following year.The airline could struggle, however, to secure the two-thirds approval it needs from employees to cut retirement payouts and make a sizeable dent in its \u00a5330bn pension shortfall.Last year it lost \u00a563.2bn but, in a move indicative of its current turmoil, has withdrawn a forecast of similar losses for the year to March 2010.Given the airline's liabilities, which totalled \u00a51.5tn at the end of September, its bankruptcy would be the sixth biggest in Japanese corporate history.", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Japan", "Business", "World news", "Travel & leisure", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "title":

airbase and thousands of troops based on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa was not up for negotiation in a further sign of growing tensions over the future of the US military footprint in east Asia.Reports said the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, told the Japanese ambassador to Washington, Ichiro Fujisaki, that Japan must honour a 2006 agreement to move the Futenma airbase \u2013 located in a crowded city on Okinawa \u2013 to the island's remote east coast.Fujisaki told reporters the discussion had centred on \"the importance of US-Japan\" ties, but Clinton reportedly made it clear that the US expected \"swift implementation\" of the existing accord.Last week, the Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, said he needed more time to determine the base's future following electoral promises to lessen the Japanese dependence on US foreign policy.The original $10.3bn (\u00a36.4bn) relocation plan would also see the transfer of 8,000 marines and their families to the US Pacific territory of Guam by 2014.Discussions about the relocation began well over a decade ago amid mounting opposition to the US military presence on Okinawa, which hosts more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan.The bases are routinely blamed for noise and air pollution, and residents live with the threat of a catastrophic accident.Although serious crimes are relatively uncommon, attitudes changed after three US servicemen were convicted of raping a 12-year-old Okinawan girl in 1995.The Japanese defence minister, Toshimi Kitazawa, said Tokyo had set itself a May 2010 deadline to decide the base's future, but added that he hoped an agreement would be reached sooner.Japan's decision to postpone a decision has been met with an exasperated reaction by US military officials.Last week, General James Conway, the commandant of the US marine corps, said the delay was \"unfortunate\", adding, \"The Futenma replacement facility is absolutely vital to the defence that we provide for the entire region.\"Hatoyama's indecision is also harming his popularity at home, about six months before upper house elections that could give his Democratic party of Japan control of both houses of parliament.In a poll published by the Mainichi newspaper yesterday, 68% of respondents said they were concerned about ties with the US.The Futenma debacle and Hatoyama's handling of the economy saw his cabinet's approval rating slide to 55%, down 9% from last month, the poll revealed.Almost four months after his party swept to power in a landslide election victory, Hatoyama appears no closer to reaching a decision on Futenma.He could choose to honour the original agreement, but the delay suggests he is more sympathetic to moving the base to another part of Japan.The social democratic party, a junior partner in Hatoyama's coalition government, supports moving the base out of Japan and has threatened to leave the coalition if the existing accord is implemented.Barack Obama's irritation was evident earlier this month when the US president snubbed an offer from Hatoyama to explain his thinking on Futenma's future on the sidelines of the climate change summit in Copenhagen.", "tags":

minister admitted today that the soaring yen risks damaging the country's export-led economy, sparking speculation the government is preparing to intervene in currency markets for the first time in more than five years.Hirohisa Fujii's comments came after the dollar slumped to below \u00a585 \u2013 its lowest level for 14 years \u2013 before rallying to the low-\u00a586 range.Fujii said the yen's relentless rise was \"one-sided\" and \"harmful\" to the economy.\"There is no doubt that the market has moved too far in one direction,\" he said. \"Moves right now are extreme, and it would be possible to take appropriate measures.\"Fujii did not indicate an immediate return to intervention in the markets for the first time since March 2004. But he said he would support a G7 joint statement on currencies to take the momentum out of the yen's recent rally. \"I would respond flexibly to a joint statement on currencies,\" he said.His remarks did little to reassure business leaders, who warned that the yen's rise would further damage exporters, just as they are emerging from the gloom of the global recession.The Canon chief executive, Fujio Mitarai, said Japan was \"standing on the edge of a cliff\" and was in need of \"urgent steps\" to prevent catastrophe.\"In the midst of deflation, such a sharp rise in the yen is a very serious problem and could drag down the economy,\" said Mitarai, who also heads Nippon Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business lobby. \"I certainly hope the government responds with emergency steps.\"Toyota and Sony are among the major exporters that risk falling short of their forecasts for the full year because a strong yen erodes their earnings overseas.Exporters had based their earnings estimates on a yen-dollar exchange rate of \u00a590-95, but could be forced to revise them sharply downwards with no end in sight to the yen's rise.Another setback to recent improvements in Japan's export performance raises the prospect of the world's second biggest economy slipping back into recession, with analysts warning that the corporate sector is near \"breaking point\".But Naoto Kan, the deputy prime minister, said: \"I have not heard of intervention at this point but in the future there will be various options and if necessary I'll talk to ministers involved.\"Some analysts did not expect intervention while the dollar remains above the \u00a580 mark.\"I found it very interesting that the Japanese finance minister said a strong yen could harm Japan's economy, because that's what it really is all about,\" said Gerrard Katz, head of foreign exchange trading at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong. \"But the way the market is going, we're not close to intervention levels.\"The dollar's recent fall has proceeded amid signs that the US will maintain low interest rates and Japan will not intervene to weaken the yen. The US currency has been offloaded amid a loss of confidence among investors spooked by the Dubai debt scare.The last time it intervened, Japan's finance ministry sold \u00a535 trillion over 15 months in an effort to keep the yen weak and cushion the blow for the country's exporters.Pressure for a return to intervention will mount as long as prices begin to fall at home, analysts said.

But Barack Obama will face tough challenges over the economy, trade and Japan's alliance with Washington from the moment he arrives in Tokyo tomorrow at the start of his first presidential visit to the region.Until recently, the US could depend on Japan \u2013 its closest Asian ally for 50 years \u2013 to smooth its path into trickier diplomatic territory nearby. But the recent election of a centre-left government in Tokyo intent on ending Japan's subservience to Washington is threatening to weaken what a former US ambassador to the country described as the most important bilateral partnership in the world.South Korea, another old ally, will push hard for progress on a stalled trade agreement, though administration officials have played down hope of a breakthrough.Relations between Washington and Beijing are at their most amicable for years. But some observers question whether closer ties will bring measurable results, and the friendship is not without its problems: today it emerged that Obama may ditch his sole meeting with the Chinese public unless Washington and Beijing can resolve disagreements over its format.In an interview with Reuters this week, Obama described China as a \"vital partner\", but warned of \"enormous strains\" if economic imbalances between the country and the US were not corrected.Trade tensions have already been felt, with China attacking US tariffs on its tyres and steel pipes. But Beijing hinted today that it might allow appreciation of the yuan. American manufacturers complain the Chinese currency is kept artificially low.Obama's nine-day, four-country tour will also see him putting the case for the release of Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to Burma's prime minister, Thein Sein, and other south-east Asian leaders in Singapore.But Obama's priority will be addressing the rift with Tokyo \u2013 caused by a 2006 agreement to reduce the American presence on the southern island of Okinawa, home to more than half the 47,000 US troops in Japan.The US is keen to push ahead with the deal \u2013 12 years in the making \u2013 which would see the Futenma military base relocated from the crowded city of Ginowan to a remote site off the east coast. The move would also presage the transfer of 8,000 marines to the US Pacific territory of Guam.Japan's new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, took office promising to review the agreement. His apparent preference is for the base to be moved out of Okinawa altogether, possibly to a location overseas. \"There are many issues that President Obama is concerned about and issues that Japan is concerned about, so we would like to discuss each theme,\" he told the Japanese parliament. \"I am convinced it will be a meaningful trip.\"Obama says he expects Japan to abide by the $10bn (\u00a36bn) agreement to relocate Futenma to a new offshore location. \"It is perfectly appropriate for the new government to want to re-examine how to move forward,\" he said in an interview with Japanese broadcaster NHK.\"I am confident that once that review is completed that they will conclude that the alliance we have, the basing arrangements that have been discussed, all those things serve the interests of Japan and they will continue.\"Hatoyama's unenviable task will be to reconcile Washington's demands with opposition to the US presence on Okinawa. At the weekend more than 20,000 people protested against the US presence, a show of force that coincided with the arrest of an American soldier accused of killing a Japanese man in a hit-and-run incident.Attempts have begun to get the leaders' meeting off to an auspicious start, with Japan's pledge on Tuesday of 5bn yen in aid for Afghanistan over five years.The announcement was designed to assuage US concerns that Japan's commitment to the \"war on terror\" is wavering following its decision not to renew its refuelling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of the US and allied forces in Afghanistan.The global economy and North Korea's nuclear programme will be a priority throughout Obama's tour, as will climate change, with the Copenhagen summit just weeks away.His hosts will also want to explore China's growing influence in the region. With the country forecast to overtake Japan as Asia's biggest economy next year, concerns persist in Tokyo about the prospect of closer ties between Washington and Beijing.\"That idea sends shivers down Japanese spines,\" said Richard Samuels, a Japan security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Obama's overarching message will be that \"the US is here to stay in Asia\", Jeffrey Bader, the president's top Asia adviser, said last week, vowing that \"the US will be a player and participant on the ground floor, not a distant spectator\".In China, North Korea's nuclear programme, and that of Iran, will be high on the agenda, as will Afghanistan and Pakistan. But no major announcements are expected and the White House effectively dismissed the prospect of a climate change agreement between the world's two largest carbon emitters. US officials have said Obama will also raise human rights.In his meeting this Sunday with the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations, Obama will press for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and more than 2,000 other political prisoners in Burma.His new policy of engagement with the Burmese junta is already paying dividends.

But a spectacular \"bike tree\" invention from Japan bowled me over when I was in Tokyo a couple of weeks ago.Fed up with bicycles locked to railings, piled on top of each other, blocking doorways and roads, a local council in the city installed the mechanical masterpiece. It's basically an automatic storage system for cycles and operates with computer tagging of bikes and either storage in a building or a basement structure.There are a number of locations where these bike trees are now in place in Tokyo \u2013 some hold 600-odd bikes, others more than 6,000. The concept came from the massive Japanese steel company JFE, whose engineering works division first started them in 2007 but are now spreading.The idea is quite simple, although no doubt the technology is fiendishly complicated. Bike owners who want a secure parking spot must register and pay a monthly fee \u2013 1,800 yen (around \u00a312 a month) \u2013 and students get discounts.Bikes are fitted with a small electronic tag. When the bike is placed into the ruts of the bike tree machine, a sensor logs the owner's details. A mechanical arm then emerges, pulls the bike into a cylindrical well and stores it at high speed in a free location.

The waters were placid, and the couple were excited about their wedding in November.They were not alone. Agents from North Korea were on the hillside. They overpowered the couple, took them to a waiting boat on Wakasa Bay and transported them nearly 500 miles to the Communist country where they were to spend the next quarter of a century.The disappearance of the couple was a local mystery and might well have remained so had it not been for a seemingly unrelated event thousands of miles away in the Middle East.Nearly a decade after the Chimura abduction, two North Korean agents stepped on to a Korean Air flight in Baghdad bound for Bangkok. In Bahrain the agents disembarked, leaving a bomb on board. The Boeing 707 took off again, exploded in flight, and 104 passengers and 11 crew were killed. The agents were subsequently arrested while trying to leave the country. One, a 70-year-old, killed himself with a poison capsule. The other, 26-year-old Kim Hyon Hui, attempted suicide in the same fashion but was stopped.Kim was later flown to Seoul where a trial revealed a fact that would cause diplomatic reverberations: North Korea had been regularly abducting Japanese citizens to help train special agents. Those agents would then pass themselves off as citizens from Japan, take part in terrorist plots and blacken the name of that nation.North Korea's antipathy towards Japan was ingrained after years of, at times, brutal colonisation from the 1900s to the end of the second world war.For Japan the news was the piece of a jigsaw that went towards solving the puzzle of numerous unexplained disappearances.Concrete confirmation came in July 2002 when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, admitted that \"over-zealous\" special forces had abducted a least a dozen Japanese citizens \u2013 men, women and children between the ages of 13 and 46. Eight had since died.\"It was regretful and I want to frankly apologise,\" said Kim.Chimura was one of those who survived, along with Fukie. They returned to Japan three months after Kim's admission, and after diplomatic wranglings were joined by their three children, who had been born in Pyongyang.Today, the family lives in Obama. But beyond these lives hopefully returning to normal, the anger of the Japanese government is plain to see. Last week Yukio Hatoyama's recently-elected government said it was launching an investigation into the abductions, an inquiry that would potentially identify scores more victims.Officially, 17 Japanese have been identified as abductees, although private groups put the number in the scores. Five have returned but the Japanese government contends that Pyongyang holds the remaining 12. Accounts of the eight deaths tell of some dying, remarkably young, from heart attacks, others suffering gas incidents, another killed in a road accident.Hiroshi Nakai, a cabinet member and minister of state for the abduction issue, said previous administrations had not been bold enough in their efforts. \"We are trying to start a new investigation with a new perspective on this issue. We think if we make further thorough investigations there would be more people who could be confirmed as abductees.\"At stake is not just the concern of the families but the delicate balance of diplomacy. Since North Korea carried out its first nuclear test the international community has been desperate to contain its proliferation.Six-party talks, including Japan, the US and China, have made arguably little progress. But in the latter days of the Bush administration and at the start of the Obama tenure, the US signalled a willingness to deal with Kim Jong-il directly. In August Bill Clinton became the highest-profile US visitor to Pyongyang when he secured the release of two American journalists captured while in a border area. There have also been face-to-face talks between diplomats as recently as last week in New York.Japan has viewed a thawing of relations between Kim Jong-il and the US with some concern and is determined the abduction issue will not be sidelined. \"Japan will never work on the normalisation of relations with North Korea without the resolution of the abduction issue,\" said Nakai. \"It doesn't matter to Japan if the US normalises the relationship. The abduction issue is a roadblock \u2026 to normalisation for Japan.\"Meanwhile the Japanese government explores other avenues to keep the issue alive. It invites the media to visit the abduction sites \u2013 the Guardian took part in one for this article \u2013 and produces comic books and DVDs. It also broadcasts a daily three-hour shortwave radio programme to North Korea with taped messages from relatives and news from the homeland.Shigeo Iizuke has taken advantage of this to try to reach his missing sister, who vanished more than 30 years ago. In June 1978, Yaeko Taguchi, who was 22 and a bar worker, dropped her two children, aged one and two, at a daycare centre before going to work at the Hollywood cabaret in Tokyo's Ikebukuro district. She never arrived.Iizuke filed a report with the police and waited. Months turned to years. He and his wife adopted Taguchi's son, one-year-old Koichiro. Another sister took on the responsibility of raising the other child. Nothing was heard of Taguchi until the court testimony from Kim Hyon Hui, the Korean airline bomber. She confessed to being trained by a Japanese abductee for nearly two years prior to her terror mission. Subsequent investigations by Japanese authorities confirmed the teacher had been Taguchi.It also confirmed one of the key motives of the abductions. North Korea, sealed off from the world in a hermit-like state, needed its agents trained in the ways of foreign societies to be able to assimilate with those societies and pass unnoticed.\"My sister was a perfect candidate,\" says Iizuke. \"She had experienced married life, and children, was knowledgeable about fashions and trends and songs of young Japanese women. She was quite suitable to be a teacher of life to North Koreans.\"Now 71, with thinning, swept back hair, Iizuke clutches a picture of Taguchi, a laminated image of a woman with eyes closed in laughter, a broad smile spreading across a grainy face. He says he knows she is not dead, despite the insistence of North Korea. He has also since garnered more information about her desperate struggle against her abduction.\"It seems she was deceived and taken somewhere, maybe under the influence of a sleeping pill,\" said Iizuke. \"She was taken to a beach and although her route is sill not clear \u2026 she was taken to North Korea that way. When she came to, she was wrapped in a black bag. She begged the agent; she had left two small children behind.\"Iizuke, founding member of the Association of the Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea, firmly believes Japan now has to press harder for his sister's return.And he points to his adopted son as evidence for that. \"The boy my sister left behind in Japan was one year old. He's now 31. He does not remember anything about his mother. He does not remember her voice, he does not remember the warmth of her skin. Her son desperately wants to know of the reality of his mother.\"Megumi Yokota The youngest, she was just 13 when taken in November 1977. Some believe she was a mistaken target, having witnessed agents in action. DNA analysis of ashes returned to her family proved it was not her.Yaeko Taguchi Abducted in June 1978.

Given that his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to a watershed election victory only last August, such an outcome could be deeply embarrassing for the US and deeply resented in Japan.Despite its stated intention to pay greater attention to Asia, the Obama administration is making a hash of relations with Japan. Its insistence that Tokyo's new centre-left leaders honour a 2006 deal on the Futenma base between George Bush and their long-entrenched conservative predecessors looks like an attempt to ride roughshod over Japan's democratic process.Blame for rising bilateral strains also lies with Hatoyama, who seems to have promised more than he can deliver. Shigeru Ishiba, a senior Liberal Democrat party opposition leader, openly mocked the prime minister last week for supposedly making an election pledge he had \"no idea\" how to fulfil.The Okinawa dispute reflects broader differences. Hatoyama's view that Japan needs a more \"balanced\" relationship with Washington after 65 years of polite subservience in the security sphere, and his related interest in developing an EEC-style east Asian economic community including China, have produced sharply critical reactions in Washington.\"The relationship between the US and Japan is in its worst state ever,\" said Hisahiko Okazaki, a former ambassador, in the daily newspaper Sankei Shimbun. \"The Japan-US alliance is too valuable an asset to lose,\" he wrote.Despite such dramatic huffing and puffing, the bottom-line reality, say senior foreign ministry officials, former and serving ministers, and leading commentators, is there is not the remotest chance that the security alliance will be \"lost\". It may be adapted or modified. It may evolve. And for its part, says former deputy foreign minister Hitoshi Tanaka, Japan \"needs to think seriously about how it can better contribute to international security\" and \"to consider if it is still right to stick to the existing interpretation of the constitutional prohibition on the use of force\".But the official consensus is firm that the US relationship will continue to form the \"cornerstone\" of Japan's defences, as foreign minister Katsuya Okada put it \u2013 a position shared by Hatoyama.The main reason behind this confidence that, despite all the stresses and strains, the alliance will endure is not hard to discern: growing mutual fear of China.If Obama has mismanaged ties with Japan, his problems with China are infinitely greater by comparison, ranging from security issues such as Iran, Taiwan, North Korea and Tibet to fair trade, currency valuations, human rights and climate change. Obama wants to befriend China and work with it. But if China chooses a diverging path, as it often appears inclined to do, the help and assistance of Japan in containing it will be indispensable to the US \u2013 and vice versa.Underscoring this point, last week's exchanges over Okinawa coincided with the latest, unsettling broadside from the People's Liberation Army that, according to some Japanese analysts, calls the shots in Beijing. \"China's big goal in the 21st century is to become world number one, the top power,\" wrote PLA senior colonel Liu Mingfu. China, he said, was determined to become the \"global champion\" while conflict with the US over \"who rises and [who] fails to dominate the world\" was inevitable.This may be bluster. But it is safer to assume it is not. With this unruly giant bellowing on the doorstep, Japan and the US need each other more than ever. What they lack is new thinking about how to make their relationship work better.", "tags": ["World news", "Japan", "China", "US foreign policy", "US military", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "China threat can heal US-Japan rift | Simon Tisdall"},{"date": "2010-01-19T11:35:04Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan Airlines today filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to reverse the fortunes of a once-revered corporate icon now saddled with billions of dollars of debt and a reputation for mismanagement and inefficiency.The airline's board decided to place the company at the mercy of a state-led restructuring plan that will require it to shed almost 15,700 jobs and cut more than 30 unprofitable routes.JAL said its entire board would resign but added that the airline would continue flying even as it files for protection from creditors under Japan's version of Chapter 11 in the US.The airline will receive support from the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation [ETIC], which will provide \u00a5300bn (\u00a32bn) in fresh capital and a \u00a5600bn credit line to cover payments for essentials such as fuel and parts.Asia's biggest airline cited combined debts of \u00a52.3 trillion, making the bankruptcy one of the biggest in Japanese history.

But reports suggest JAL is preparing to accept a rival offer worth about $1bn from Delta and defect to its Sky Team group.Delta estimates a switch to Sky Team would increase JAL's revenues by $400m a year and give the two airlines a 43% share of the market between Japan and North America.", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Japan", "Japan holidays", "Travel"], "title": "Japan Airlines files for bankruptcy"},{"date": "2010-01-13T10:04:14Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Shares in Japan Airlines plummeted 81% today to just \u00a57 amid strong indications that the firm will file for bankruptcy and have its shares delisted as early as next week.Asia's biggest airline is expected to submit itself to a government-led rehabilitation package that will include a complete reduction of its capital.Investors, whose shares were each worth \u00a5213 at the beginning of last year, will see the value of their investment wiped out.In return, the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation [ETIC], a state-run body formed in October to oversee JAL's rehabilitation, will offer \u00a5300bn (\u00a32bn) in fresh investment.In addition, the body is reportedly preparing to offer a \u00a5600bn credit line \u2013 \u00a5200bn of it from the state-owned Development Bank of Japan \u2013 to avert an immediate cash crisis and keep JAL planes in the air.On Tuesday, the government reportedly secured the agreement of JAL's biggest creditors to write off \u00a5350bn in unpaid loans to smooth the path to what would be the sixth-biggest bankruptcy in Japanese history.Seiji Maehara, the transport minister, told reporters: \"I met with the heads of the three megabanks this morning and explained to them about a public-led restructuring and asked for their support.

Given that his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to a watershed election victory only last August, such an outcome could be deeply embarrassing for the US and deeply resented in Japan.Despite its stated intention to pay greater attention to Asia, the Obama administration is making a hash of relations with Japan. Its insistence that Tokyo's new centre-left leaders honour a 2006 deal on the Futenma base between George Bush and their long-entrenched conservative predecessors looks like an attempt to ride roughshod over Japan's democratic process.Blame for rising bilateral strains also lies with Hatoyama, who seems to have promised more than he can deliver. Shigeru Ishiba, a senior Liberal Democrat party opposition leader, openly mocked the prime minister last week for supposedly making an election pledge he had \"no idea\" how to fulfil.The Okinawa dispute reflects broader differences. Hatoyama's view that Japan needs a more \"balanced\" relationship with Washington after 65 years of polite subservience in the security sphere, and his related interest in developing an EEC-style east Asian economic community including China, have produced sharply critical reactions in Washington.\"The relationship between the US and Japan is in its worst state ever,\" said Hisahiko Okazaki, a former ambassador, in the daily newspaper Sankei Shimbun. \"The Japan-US alliance is too valuable an asset to lose,\" he wrote.Despite such dramatic huffing and puffing, the bottom-line reality, say senior foreign ministry officials, former and serving ministers, and leading commentators, is there is not the remotest chance that the security alliance will be \"lost\". It may be adapted or modified. It may evolve. And for its part, says former deputy foreign minister Hitoshi Tanaka, Japan \"needs to think seriously about how it can better contribute to international security\" and \"to consider if it is still right to stick to the existing interpretation of the constitutional prohibition on the use of force\".But the official consensus is firm that the US relationship will continue to form the \"cornerstone\" of Japan's defences, as foreign minister Katsuya Okada put it \u2013 a position shared by Hatoyama.The main reason behind this confidence that, despite all the stresses and strains, the alliance will endure is not hard to discern: growing mutual fear of China.If Obama has mismanaged ties with Japan, his problems with China are infinitely greater by comparison, ranging from security issues such as Iran, Taiwan, North Korea and Tibet to fair trade, currency valuations, human rights and climate change. Obama wants to befriend China and work with it. But if China chooses a diverging path, as it often appears inclined to do, the help and assistance of Japan in containing it will be indispensable to the US \u2013 and vice versa.Underscoring this point, last week's exchanges over Okinawa coincided with the latest, unsettling broadside from the People's Liberation Army that, according to some Japanese analysts, calls the shots in Beijing. \"China's big goal in the 21st century is to become world number one, the top power,\" wrote PLA senior colonel Liu Mingfu. China, he said, was determined to become the \"global champion\" while conflict with the US over \"who rises and [who] fails to dominate the world\" was inevitable.This may be bluster. But it is safer to assume it is not. With this unruly giant bellowing on the doorstep, Japan and the US need each other more than ever.

As commander of the 4th air defence missile unit, Taniguchi is on the front line of Japan's much downplayed but scarily real, ongoing stand-off with North Korea, one of several potential conflicts in a rough neighbourhood.Japanese politicians and their US military allies tend to soft-pedal problems with Pyongyang, stressing the need to resume the diplomatic process broken off last year. But no one at Iruma has forgotten the moment last April when North Korea lofted a TaepoDong-2 long range ballistic missile over Japan, sending it crashing into the Pacific \u2013 or the North's second nuclear test explosion the following month.\"If an enemy dares to attack us, that's lucky for us,\" an unsmiling Taniguchi said. \"Once they are within range, it is our opportunity, not theirs.\"Taniguchi's confidence in Japan's ability to defend itself rests on the weapons under his command \u2013 an American designed, Japanese built Patriot PAC-3 missile battery, attached to one of the six ballistic missile defence (BMD) groups girdling the country since 2007.The innocuous-looking, green-painted oblong canisters contain four Patriot missiles each. Mounted on trucks, pointing skywards, and electronically linked to six naval destroyers equipped with Aegis phased array radar, they mark the Japan Self-Defence Force's first foray into BMD. The full deployment will be completed this year.This is the type of defensive missile system the Obama administration plans to introduce in eastern Europe. It is also similar to the missiles the US has controversially agreed to sell to Taiwan, to help counter the growing threat from China.Under Article 9 of its postwar constitution, Japan renounced \"forever\" the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. But the 1960 US-Japan security treaty made clear that Tokyo has a right to self-defence.Since then, and with accelerating speed since the 9/11 attacks, Japan's defence and security activities have expanded. While still essentially defensive in nature, they include international peacekeeping operations, logistical and financial support in Afghanistan, emphasis on strengthened bilateral and multilateral regional alliances, overseas disaster relief, anti-piracy and coastguard operations, and a pro-active overseas development programme.Defence ministry officials and analysts in Tokyo suggest three factors are driving this evolution. One is a host of regional threats and potential flashpoints. They include territorial disputes with China, Russia and South Korea; China's rapid military build-up (its defence spending is rising in double digits each year); its aggressive oil exploration activities in the East China Sea; and North Korea's unpredictable behaviour.\"The environment that we face is harsh and difficult and this is making us feel that we may have to be more self-reliant,\" said a senior defence ministry official. \"On the other hand, this makes it all the more important to solidify our alliance with the US.\"The second factor fuelling Japanese insecurity, however, is growing doubt about that very alliance. A simmering row over relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base in Okinawa, US troop drawdowns in east Asia, revived concerns about the dependability of the US \"nuclear umbrella\" and the general perception that US global predominance is weakening in the new \"Chinese century\" all suggest Japan must do more to look after itself.This thinking is reflected, thirdly, in Japan's domestic politics, which remain in flux after last autumn's watershed defeat of the conservative Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the war, by the centre-left Democratic party.Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's emphasis on east Asian communal \"fraternity\" and a \"more equal\", balanced relationship with the US has put noses out of joint in Washington but appears to have struck a chord with Japanese voters. Upper House elections in July could further embolden the Democrats. Meanwhile, entrenched economic difficulties are also spurring un-Japanese talk of radical solutions.Such problems are for the politicians to sort out. At Iruma air base, Major Taniguchi sticks to the basics, and he draws an unexpected parallel. When it comes to air defence, the RAF's triumph in the Battle of Britain in 1940 is his inspiration, he says. Japan was devastated in the second world war because it could not defend itself in the air.By the look on his face, it is clear that if Taniguchi has any say in the matter, it won't happen again.", "tags": ["World news", "Japan", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "China", "Politics", "Defence policy", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan is ready for North Korea | Simon Tisdall"},{"date": "2010-01-19T11:35:04Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan Airlines today filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to reverse the fortunes of a once-revered corporate icon now saddled with billions of dollars of debt and a reputation for mismanagement and inefficiency.The airline's board decided to place the company at the mercy of a state-led restructuring plan that will require it to shed almost 15,700 jobs and cut more than 30 unprofitable routes.JAL said its entire board would resign but added that the airline would continue flying even as it files for protection from creditors under Japan's version of Chapter 11 in the US.The airline will receive support from the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation [ETIC], which will provide \u00a5300bn (\u00a32bn) in fresh capital and a \u00a5600bn credit line to cover payments for essentials such as fuel and parts.Asia's biggest airline cited combined debts of \u00a52.3 trillion, making the bankruptcy one of the biggest in Japanese history.

As commander of the 4th air defence missile unit, Taniguchi is on the front line of Japan's much downplayed but scarily real, ongoing stand-off with North Korea, one of several potential conflicts in a rough neighbourhood.Japanese politicians and their US military allies tend to soft-pedal problems with Pyongyang, stressing the need to resume the diplomatic process broken off last year. But no one at Iruma has forgotten the moment last April when North Korea lofted a TaepoDong-2 long range ballistic missile over Japan, sending it crashing into the Pacific \u2013 or the North's second nuclear test explosion the following month.\"If an enemy dares to attack us, that's lucky for us,\" an unsmiling Taniguchi said. \"Once they are within range, it is our opportunity, not theirs.\"Taniguchi's confidence in Japan's ability to defend itself rests on the weapons under his command \u2013 an American designed, Japanese built Patriot PAC-3 missile battery, attached to one of the six ballistic missile defence (BMD) groups girdling the country since 2007.The innocuous-looking, green-painted oblong canisters contain four Patriot missiles each. Mounted on trucks, pointing skywards, and electronically linked to six naval destroyers equipped with Aegis phased array radar, they mark the Japan Self-Defence Force's first foray into BMD. The full deployment will be completed this year.This is the type of defensive missile system the Obama administration plans to introduce in eastern Europe. It is also similar to the missiles the US has controversially agreed to sell to Taiwan, to help counter the growing threat from China.Under Article 9 of its postwar constitution, Japan renounced \"forever\" the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. But the 1960 US-Japan security treaty made clear that Tokyo has a right to self-defence.Since then, and with accelerating speed since the 9/11 attacks, Japan's defence and security activities have expanded. While still essentially defensive in nature, they include international peacekeeping operations, logistical and financial support in Afghanistan, emphasis on strengthened bilateral and multilateral regional alliances, overseas disaster relief, anti-piracy and coastguard operations, and a pro-active overseas development programme.Defence ministry officials and analysts in Tokyo suggest three factors are driving this evolution. One is a host of regional threats and potential flashpoints. They include territorial disputes with China, Russia and South Korea; China's rapid military build-up (its defence spending is rising in double digits each year); its aggressive oil exploration activities in the East China Sea; and North Korea's unpredictable behaviour.\"The environment that we face is harsh and difficult and this is making us feel that we may have to be more self-reliant,\" said a senior defence ministry official. \"On the other hand, this makes it all the more important to solidify our alliance with the US.\"The second factor fuelling Japanese insecurity, however, is growing doubt about that very alliance. A simmering row over relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base in Okinawa, US troop drawdowns in east Asia, revived concerns about the dependability of the US \"nuclear umbrella\" and the general perception that US global predominance is weakening in the new \"Chinese century\" all suggest Japan must do more to look after itself.This thinking is reflected, thirdly, in Japan's domestic politics, which remain in flux after last autumn's watershed defeat of the conservative Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the war, by the centre-left Democratic party.Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's emphasis on east Asian communal \"fraternity\" and a \"more equal\", balanced relationship with the US has put noses out of joint in Washington but appears to have struck a chord with Japanese voters. Upper House elections in July could further embolden the Democrats. Meanwhile, entrenched economic difficulties are also spurring un-Japanese talk of radical solutions.Such problems are for the politicians to sort out. At Iruma air base, Major Taniguchi sticks to the basics, and he draws an unexpected parallel. When it comes to air defence, the RAF's triumph in the Battle of Britain in 1940 is his inspiration, he says. Japan was devastated in the second world war because it could not defend itself in the air.By the look on his face, it is clear that if Taniguchi has any say in the matter, it won't happen again.", "tags": ["World news", "Japan", "North Korea", "Nuclear weapons", "China", "Politics", "Defence policy", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan is ready for North Korea | Simon Tisdall"},{"date": "2010-02-25T09:59:41Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Failure to resolve a sharp disagreement over the future of the US military presence in Japan could undermine trust between the two countries, Katsuya Okada, the Japanese foreign minister, said today.Japan's new centre-left government, which took office last September promising a more independent foreign policy, has given Washington assurances it will decide on a new location for a US marine base on the island of Okinawa, by the end of May.But the US, alarmed at a possible deterioration in ties with its key ally in the Asia-Pacific region, has indicated that it wishes to stick to an existing deal agreed with the previous conservative administration.\"I believe that we have to reach a final conclusion by the end of May,\" Okada said in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. \"That's something we can't afford to miss.\"If that cannot be consummated, I am afraid the trust between the two countries could be undermined.\"He declined to express a preference for the base's location, saying to do so would fuel current media speculation about a split in the cabinet.Last week, the commander of the US marines in the Pacific said the base should remain in Okinawa and not be moved, as some in Japan have suggested, to the US Pacific territory of Guam.\"Okinawa is in the perfect place in the region,\" Lt Gen Keith Stalder said. \"It's literally a day away from almost anything that can occur in the region.\"Okada said he was confident the US would discuss any new proposal by Japan. Under the current agreement, Futenma airbase, located in the middle of a heavily populated city, would be moved to an offshore location in Okinawa, and 8,000 marines would be redeployed to Guam.Okada said he did not feel that US pressure over the base amounted to bullying, although he admitted Washington had been consistent in arguing that the current agreement was the best approach.\"I don't think the US would utterly refuse to talk to us regarding the conclusion we reach after we have discussed it in the cabinet,\" Okada said. \"If that is the case, there is no point for us to continue to study the matter in the cabinet.\"He denied reports that the government and the Obama administration had already started negotiating an alternative location for Futenma.\"We will go to the US after a conclusion has been reached inside the cabinet,\" he said. \"I'm aware that it's not easy to come up with a proposal that would satisfy the Okinawan people and the US government.\"Okada, speaking hours before Toyota's president, Akio Toyoda, was due to go before US congressional investigators to defend his firm's safety record, said he hoped the global recall of millions of Toyota cars would not further strain bilateral ties.\"I certainly would like to hope this matter will not undermine the trust of the Americans, not just [in] Toyota as a company, but Japan as a whole,\" he said. \"It is essentially a matter of one enterprise ... there's very little the Japanese government can do.\"Turning to relations with China, Okada said Japan was concerned about a perceived lack of transparency about Beijing's growing military expenditure.China's expanding military capabilities made the US-Japan alliance all the more important, not just for Japan, but for the region as a whole.But he welcomed China's attempts to persuade North Korea to rejoin talks on its nuclear programme.\"We would like to see further [Chinese] efforts to influence North Korea,\" he said, but added, \"Japan, South Korea and the US demand that North Korea come back to six-party talks with no conditions. To achieve that we are continuing economic sanctions.\"Okada's comments came as US negotiators arrived in the region to try and kick-start the talks, which Pyongyang abandoned last year, shortly before it conducted its second nuclear test.Japan's Asahi newspaper reported this week that China had told North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, to abandon his nuclear ambitions, open up the economy and end dynastic politics, in return for more food and energy aid.In an apparent sign of progress, China's president, Hu Jintao, met a senior North Korean official in Beijing on Tuesday and praised the co-operation between the two sides.", "tags": ["Japan", "US military", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news"], "title": "Japan fears US military row could escalate"},{"date": "2010-01-19T11:35:04Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan Airlines today filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to reverse the fortunes of a once-revered corporate icon now saddled with billions of dollars of debt and a reputation for mismanagement and inefficiency.The airline's board decided to place the company at the mercy of a state-led restructuring plan that will require it to shed almost 15,700 jobs and cut more than 30 unprofitable routes.JAL said its entire board would resign but added that the airline would continue flying even as it files for protection from creditors under Japan's version of Chapter 11 in the US.The airline will receive support from the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation [ETIC], which will provide \u00a5300bn (\u00a32bn) in fresh capital and a \u00a5600bn credit line to cover payments for essentials such as fuel and parts.Asia's biggest airline cited combined debts of \u00a52.3 trillion, making the bankruptcy one of the biggest in Japanese history.

To be in detention day after day, tied down, with no lawyer, is a terrifying thing for anyone to endure.\"To have that happen to them when all they were trying to do was draw attention to the abuse of public funds is beyond scary. It is wrong.\"Naidoo urged the Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, to reopen the investigation into alleged embezzlement by the whaling crew and to ensure Sato and Suzuki were given a fair trial. \"The eyes of the world are on Japan,\" he added.Since the arrests, more than 250,000 people have signed a petition demanding justice for 32-year-old Sato and Suzuki, 42.Anti-whaling campaigners have accused the authorities of staging a politically motivated trial, designed to depict peaceful activists as \"terrorists\", with the eventual aim of closing down Greenpeace's office in Japan.In an interview with the Guardian after he was released on bail, Suzuki remained unrepentant. \"Since my arrest, I have not lied once about what I did,\" he said.\"But the whalers have had to make up one story after another. Their lies will come back to haunt them.\"Two years ago, Greenpeace abandoned its pursuit of the whaling fleet to focus on building an anti-whaling coalition among the Japanese people.A provision in the International Whaling commission's 1986 ban on commercial whaling permits Japan to conduct \"lethal research\" into about 1,000 whales in the Southern ocean each year.", "tags": ["Japan", "Greenpeace", "Whaling", "Environment", "World news", "Activism", "Whales", "Cetaceans"], "title": "Anti-whaling activists face trial in Japan"},{"date": "2010-01-19T11:35:04Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan Airlines today filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to reverse the fortunes of a once-revered corporate icon now saddled with billions of dollars of debt and a reputation for mismanagement and inefficiency.The airline's board decided to place the company at the mercy of a state-led restructuring plan that will require it to shed almost 15,700 jobs and cut more than 30 unprofitable routes.JAL said its entire board would resign but added that the airline would continue flying even as it files for protection from creditors under Japan's version of Chapter 11 in the US.The airline will receive support from the state-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation [ETIC], which will provide \u00a5300bn (\u00a32bn) in fresh capital and a \u00a5600bn credit line to cover payments for essentials such as fuel and parts.Asia's biggest airline cited combined debts of \u00a52.3 trillion, making the bankruptcy one of the biggest in Japanese history. Its creditors, which include three Japanese \"megabanks,\" will forgive \u00a5730bn in debts, far higher than previously estimated.The news ended weeks of speculation over JAL's future after Japan's new centre-left government ruled out an emergency bailout.The airline will, however, stay in business while it attempts to repair its battered reputation and return to profitability by the end of the 2012 financial year.The government said it would \"provide the necessary support for JAL until the completion of its rehabilitation\".JAL said it wished to \"sincerely apologise to all of our shareholders, financial creditors, customers and suppliers and other parties concerned for the great inconvenience and concern this situation might cause\".Earlier in the day the firm suffered the indignity of seeing its shares sink to a record low of \u00a53. Those shares will soon be worth nothing now that the Tokyo stock exchange has confirmed they will be delisted tomorrow.In exchange for financial backing from ETIC, JAL will slash a third of its 47,000-strong workforce by March 2013 and cut 14 international and 17 domestic routes over the same period.JAL is expecting operating losses of \u00a5265bn for the year to the end of March, having amassed losses of \u00a551bn last year. It lost \u00a5131.2bn in the six months to September.Its long-term future will be dependent on efforts to emerge as a leaner airline, probably with support through new partnerships with overseas carriers that could transform the airline business in Asia-Pacific.Analysts were upbeat about JAL's immediate future, but acknowledged that questions remain over its potential for growth.\"I am not worried about the future of the carrier as I believe the government will strongly support it,\" said Yasuhiro Matsumoto, a credit analyst at Shinsei Securities. \"But whether it will be able to grow as a business is unclear. I can't see how JAL is going to build its network domestically and internationally.\"The company, which has received four government bailouts since 2001, has seen its market value decline 90% since the beginning of the month. With a market value of \u00a390m \u2013 less than the price of a Boeing 747 \u2013 the airline is now trailing the likes of Croatia Airlines and Jazeera Airways.JAL's dramatic decline has proved a sobering experience for an airline that grew from a handful of leased planes in 1951 into a global fleet of 280 aircraft serving 220 airports in 35 countries.In recent years it became a victim of its own success, making a series of risky investments while creaking under the weight of skyrocketing pension and salary costs.It was subject to government pressure to serve unprofitable domestic airports, built for no other reason than to support the construction industry, in return for government bailouts during its periodic crises.The airline will halve its subsidiaries, which include a hotel chain and credit card business, to give itself a fighting chance of recovery amid falling passenger numbers and volatile fuel prices.Its first obvious break with the past was the appointment of Kazuo Inamori, the founder of the electrical components maker Kyocera, as chief executive.A very different airline is expected to emerge under the stewardship of the 77-year-old Inamori, a trained Buddhist monk and self-confessed airline industry novice. Reports said it would have to retire 53 of its largest jets and replace them with smaller aircraft suited to domestic and regional flights.JAL will also have to decide over rival offers of investment from two US airlines keen to boost their presence in east Asia,American Airlines and its partners, including British Airways, say they are willing to invest $1.4bn (\u00a3850m) to keep JAL as part of their Oneworld alliance. But reports suggest JAL is preparing to accept a rival offer worth about $1bn from Delta and defect to its Sky Team group.Delta estimates a switch to Sky Team would increase JAL's revenues by $400m a year and give the two airlines a 43% share of the market between Japan and North America.", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Japan", "Japan holidays", "Travel"], "title": "Japan Airlines files for bankruptcy"},{"date": "2010-01-13T10:04:14Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Shares in Japan Airlines plummeted 81% today to just \u00a57 amid strong indications that the firm will file for bankruptcy and have its shares delisted as early as next week.Asia's biggest airline is expected to submit itself to a government-led rehabilitation package that will include a complete reduction of its capital.Investors, whose shares were each worth \u00a5213 at the beginning of last year, will see the value of their investment wiped out.In return, the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation [ETIC], a state-run body formed in October to oversee JAL's rehabilitation, will offer \u00a5300bn (\u00a32bn) in fresh investment.In addition, the body is reportedly preparing to offer a \u00a5600bn credit line \u2013 \u00a5200bn of it from the state-owned Development Bank of Japan \u2013 to avert an immediate cash crisis and keep JAL planes in the air.On Tuesday, the government reportedly secured the agreement of JAL's biggest creditors to write off \u00a5350bn in unpaid loans to smooth the path to what would be the sixth-biggest bankruptcy in Japanese history.Seiji Maehara, the transport minister, told reporters: \"I met with the heads of the three megabanks this morning and explained to them about a public-led restructuring and asked for their support. I got mostly positive responses.\"JAL shares fell by their daily limit of \u00a530 today, having lost 45% on Tuesday. The airline, reeling from one of the most ignominious weeks in its 59-year-history, has lost $1.8bn (\u00a31.1bn) in market value in just two days.Yasuhiro Matsumoto, a senior credit analyst at Shinsei Securities, said: \"It is highly probable that JAL will have its capital wiped out when it files for bankruptcy.\"The only buyers were those clinging to fading hopes that JAL may be permitted to retain a small percentage of its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, enabling them to make a quick profit.While reports said the ETIC was considering that option, officials are said to favour delisting as a way of holding shareholders accountable for the firm's miserable performance.JAL, already weighed down by debts totalling $16m, has been hit hard by falling passenger numbers, inefficiency and an unwieldy pension scheme. It is expecting operating losses of \u00a5265bn for the year to the end of March, having amassed losses of \u00a551bn last year.The firm has secured the two-thirds support it needs from employees and retirees to impose swingeing pension cuts to reduce an estimated pension shortfall of \u00a5331bn. Failure to gain approval could have seen the pension fund dissolved in bankruptcy court.The new-look JAL is expected to shed almost 16,000 jobs \u2013 about 30% of its workforce \u2013 and drastically reduce its routes in an attempt to return to profitability.The Kyodo news agency said the restructuring regime could include the launch of a budget airline that would operate only economy-class seats on domestic routes and charge passengers for drinks.The turnaround will be spearheaded by a new chief executive; Kazuo Inamori, the 77-year-old founder of the electronics component maker Kyocera, will take over from Haruka Nishimatsu.While investors dumped shares that could soon be worth nothing, US airlines continued to vie for a stake in JAL's network of domestic and Asian routes, despite reports that ETIC is ruling out investments from foreign airlines because they could complicate bankruptcy proceedings.American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and Cathay Pacific have joined forces with a $1.4bn offer of new investment, plus a guaranteed $2bn in revenue for the next three years, to keep JAL in their Oneworld alliance.BA's part of the offer includes more co-operation on flights between Japan and Europe, and help with establishing new JAL services between Heathrow and Haneda airport, near Tokyo, which is scheduled to open a new runway and international terminal this year.Delta, the world's biggest airline, is attempting to lure JAL to its Sky Team alliance with a rival offer of $1bn, including $500m in cash.", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Japan", "Global economy"], "title": "Japan Airlines heads towards bankruptcy"},{"date": "2010-03-08T18:30:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "A long-running row about relocating a US Marine Corps base on Okinawa is threatening to boil over, with Yukio Hatoyama, Japan's prime minister, admitting at the weekend that failure to resolve the dispute could force his resignation. Given that his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to a watershed election victory only last August, such an outcome could be deeply embarrassing for the US and deeply resented in Japan.Despite its stated intention to pay greater attention to Asia, the Obama administration is making a hash of relations with Japan. Its insistence that Tokyo's new centre-left leaders honour a 2006 deal on the Futenma base between George Bush and their long-entrenched conservative predecessors looks like an attempt to ride roughshod over Japan's democratic process.Blame for rising bilateral strains also lies with Hatoyama, who seems to have promised more than he can deliver. Shigeru Ishiba, a senior Liberal Democrat party opposition leader, openly mocked the prime minister last week for supposedly making an election pledge he had \"no idea\" how to fulfil.The Okinawa dispute reflects broader differences. Hatoyama's view that Japan needs a more \"balanced\" relationship with Washington after 65 years of polite subservience in the security sphere, and his related interest in developing an EEC-style east Asian economic community including China, have produced sharply critical reactions in Washington.\"The relationship between the US and Japan is in its worst state ever,\" said Hisahiko Okazaki, a former ambassador, in the daily newspaper Sankei Shimbun. \"The Japan-US alliance is too valuable an asset to lose,\" he wrote.Despite such dramatic huffing and puffing, the bottom-line reality, say senior foreign ministry officials, former and serving ministers, and leading commentators, is there is not the remotest chance that the security alliance will be \"lost\". It may be adapted or modified. It may evolve. And for its part, says former deputy foreign minister Hitoshi Tanaka, Japan \"needs to think seriously about how it can better contribute to international security\" and \"to consider if it is still right to stick to the existing interpretation of the constitutional prohibition on the use of force\".But the official consensus is firm that the US relationship will continue to form the \"cornerstone\" of Japan's defences, as foreign minister Katsuya Okada put it \u2013 a position shared by Hatoyama.The main reason behind this confidence that, despite all the stresses and strains, the alliance will endure is not hard to discern: growing mutual fear of China.If Obama has mismanaged ties with Japan, his problems with China are infinitely greater by comparison, ranging from security issues such as Iran, Taiwan, North Korea and Tibet to fair trade, currency valuations, human rights and climate change. Obama wants to befriend China and work with it. But if China chooses a diverging path, as it often appears inclined to do, the help and assistance of Japan in containing it will be indispensable to the US \u2013 and vice versa.Underscoring this point, last week's exchanges over Okinawa coincided with the latest, unsettling broadside from the People's Liberation Army that, according to some Japanese analysts, calls the shots in Beijing. \"China's big goal in the 21st century is to become world number one, the top power,\" wrote PLA senior colonel Liu Mingfu. China, he said, was determined to become the \"global champion\" while conflict with the US over \"who rises and [who] fails to dominate the world\" was inevitable.This may be bluster. But it is safer to assume it is not. With this unruly giant bellowing on the doorstep, Japan and the US need each other more than ever.

Under the current agreement, Futenma airbase, located in the middle of a heavily populated city, would be moved to an offshore location in Okinawa, and 8,000 marines would be redeployed to Guam.Okada said he did not feel that US pressure over the base amounted to bullying, although he admitted Washington had been consistent in arguing that the current agreement was the best approach.\"I don't think the US would utterly refuse to talk to us regarding the conclusion we reach after we have discussed it in the cabinet,\" Okada said. \"If that is the case, there is no point for us to continue to study the matter in the cabinet.\"He denied reports that the government and the Obama administration had already started negotiating an alternative location for Futenma.\"We will go to the US after a conclusion has been reached inside the cabinet,\" he said. \"I'm aware that it's not easy to come up with a proposal that would satisfy the Okinawan people and the US government.\"Okada, speaking hours before Toyota's president, Akio Toyoda, was due to go before US congressional investigators to defend his firm's safety record, said he hoped the global recall of millions of Toyota cars would not further strain bilateral ties.\"I certainly would like to hope this matter will not undermine the trust of the Americans, not just [in] Toyota as a company, but Japan as a whole,\" he said. \"It is essentially a matter of one enterprise ... there's very little the Japanese government can do.\"Turning to relations with China, Okada said Japan was concerned about a perceived lack of transparency about Beijing's growing military expenditure.China's expanding military capabilities made the US-Japan alliance all the more important, not just for Japan, but for the region as a whole.But he welcomed China's attempts to persuade North Korea to rejoin talks on its nuclear programme.\"We would like to see further [Chinese] efforts to influence North Korea,\" he said, but added, \"Japan, South Korea and the US demand that North Korea come back to six-party talks with no conditions. To achieve that we are continuing economic sanctions.\"Okada's comments came as US negotiators arrived in the region to try and kick-start the talks, which Pyongyang abandoned last year, shortly before it conducted its second nuclear test.Japan's Asahi newspaper reported this week that China had told North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, to abandon his nuclear ambitions, open up the economy and end dynastic politics, in return for more food and energy aid.In an apparent sign of progress, China's president, Hu Jintao, met a senior North Korean official in Beijing on Tuesday and praised the co-operation between the two sides.", "tags": ["Japan", "US military", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news"], "title": "Japan fears US military row could escalate"},{"date": "2010-02-14T14:11:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Two Greenpeace activists who were arrested after attempting to expose embezzlement in Japan's whaling fleet will go on trial tomorrow in a case campaigners hope will spark a domestic backlash against the heavily-subsidised industry.Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki were detained in June 2008, two months after intercepting a consignment of whale meat they claimed had been stolen by a member of the crew on the Nisshin Maru, the Japanese Antarctic whaling fleet's mother ship.The activists \u2013 who claimed the meat was destined for the black market \u2013 face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of theft and trespass.They said the package, retrieved from a warehouse in Aomori, northern Japan, was marked \"cardboard\" but contained 23kg of salted whale meat worth around 350,000 yen (\u00a32,477).Greenpeace said it had evidence to prove that at least 23 of the ship's crew smuggled more than 90 boxes of salted whale, disguised as personal baggage, and accused them of defrauding the Japanese taxpayer with the approval of Kyodo Senpaku, which operates the whaling fleet.Kyodo Senpaku insisted the packages were a \"bonus\" for crew members who had spent several months in the inhospitable waters of the southern ocean.Prosecutors, who initially agreed to pursue the embezzlement claims, dropped the investigation on the day Sato and Suzuki were arrested in early-morning raids on their homes.According to Greenpeace,, Japanese taxpayers contribute an estimated 500m yen to the \"scientific\" whale hunts each year.Earlier this month, a UN human rights body condemned the detention of Sato and Suzuki and warned Japan that it had breached several articles of the UN declaration of human rights.During their 26 days in custody, 23 of which saw them held without charge, the suspects were denied access to lawyers, strapped to chairs and interrogated for up to 12 hours a day.Their interrogators likened them to members of Aum Supreme Truth, the doomsday cult that carried out the fatal gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in 1995.Suzuki protested by going on hunger strike for nine days and refusing to talk to investigators for four more.\"They have taken a stand in the public interest,\" Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace's executive director, told reporters in Tokyo.\"It has come at a personal and professional cost. To be in detention day after day, tied down, with no lawyer, is a terrifying thing for anyone to endure.\"To have that happen to them when all they were trying to do was draw attention to the abuse of public funds is beyond scary. It is wrong.\"Naidoo urged the Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, to reopen the investigation into alleged embezzlement by the whaling crew and to ensure Sato and Suzuki were given a fair trial. \"The eyes of the world are on Japan,\" he added.Since the arrests, more than 250,000 people have signed a petition demanding justice for 32-year-old Sato and Suzuki, 42.Anti-whaling campaigners have accused the authorities of staging a politically motivated trial, designed to depict peaceful activists as \"terrorists\", with the eventual aim of closing down Greenpeace's office in Japan.In an interview with the Guardian after he was released on bail, Suzuki remained unrepentant. \"Since my arrest, I have not lied once about what I did,\" he said.\"But the whalers have had to make up one story after another. Their lies will come back to haunt them.\"Two years ago, Greenpeace abandoned its pursuit of the whaling fleet to focus on building an anti-whaling coalition among the Japanese people.A provision in the International Whaling commission's 1986 ban on commercial whaling permits Japan to conduct \"lethal research\" into about 1,000 whales in the Southern ocean each year.", "tags": ["Japan", "Greenpeace", "Whaling", "Environment", "World news", "Activism", "Whales", "Cetaceans"], "title": "Anti-whaling activists face trial in Japan"},{"date": "2010-01-19T08:25:47Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan Airlines (JAL) was today reported to be hours away from bankruptcy \u2013 the first step in an attempt to free itself from the huge debts and poor management that have come to define a once-revered Japanese corporate symbol.As the Japanese transport minister, Seiji Maehara, prepared to put the airline in the hands of a state-backed turnaround body, it suffered the indignity of seeing shares reach a record low of four yen (2.6 pence).JAL, which has received three government bailouts in the past decade, has seen the value of its shares fall by 90% since the beginning of the month.With a market value of $150m (\u00a391m) \u2013 less than the price of a Boeing 747 jet \u2013 the airline is now trailing the likes of Croatia Airlines and Jazeera Airways.JAL shares could soon be worth nothing if, as expected, they are de-listed from the Tokyo stock exchange.Despite filing for what would be Japan's sixth-biggest ever bankruptcy, the airline is expected to stay in business while it attempts to rid itself of debts of $16bn and repair its battered reputation.\"The government wants to continue to support JAL to ensure its continued stable and safe operations,\" Maehara told reporters.In exchange for financial backing from the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation (Etic), JAL will reportedly be asked to cut 15,600 jobs \u2013 one-third of its workforce \u2013 by March 2013 and cut unprofitable routes.The airline is expecting operating losses of 265bn yen (\u00a31.8bn) for the year to the end of March, having amassed losses of 51bn yen last year.Its long-term future will be dependent on efforts to emerge as a leaner business, probably with additional support through new partnerships with overseas carriers that could transform the airline business in the Asia-Pacific market.The restructuring plan, due to be announced later today, could mark the anointing of JAL's rival All Nippon Airways as Japan's flagship carrier.Analysts were upbeat about JAL's immediate future but admitted questions over its potential for growth remained.\"I am not worried about the future of the carrier as I believe the government will strongly support it,\" Yasuhiro Matsumoto, a credit analyst at Shinsei Securities, said.\"But whether it will be able to grow as a business is unclear.

Given that his Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to a watershed election victory only last August, such an outcome could be deeply embarrassing for the US and deeply resented in Japan.Despite its stated intention to pay greater attention to Asia, the Obama administration is making a hash of relations with Japan. Its insistence that Tokyo's new centre-left leaders honour a 2006 deal on the Futenma base between George Bush and their long-entrenched conservative predecessors looks like an attempt to ride roughshod over Japan's democratic process.Blame for rising bilateral strains also lies with Hatoyama, who seems to have promised more than he can deliver. Shigeru Ishiba, a senior Liberal Democrat party opposition leader, openly mocked the prime minister last week for supposedly making an election pledge he had \"no idea\" how to fulfil.The Okinawa dispute reflects broader differences. Hatoyama's view that Japan needs a more \"balanced\" relationship with Washington after 65 years of polite subservience in the security sphere, and his related interest in developing an EEC-style east Asian economic community including China, have produced sharply critical reactions in Washington.\"The relationship between the US and Japan is in its worst state ever,\" said Hisahiko Okazaki, a former ambassador, in the daily newspaper Sankei Shimbun. \"The Japan-US alliance is too valuable an asset to lose,\" he wrote.Despite such dramatic huffing and puffing, the bottom-line reality, say senior foreign ministry officials, former and serving ministers, and leading commentators, is there is not the remotest chance that the security alliance will be \"lost\". It may be adapted or modified. It may evolve. And for its part, says former deputy foreign minister Hitoshi Tanaka, Japan \"needs to think seriously about how it can better contribute to international security\" and \"to consider if it is still right to stick to the existing interpretation of the constitutional prohibition on the use of force\".But the official consensus is firm that the US relationship will continue to form the \"cornerstone\" of Japan's defences, as foreign minister Katsuya Okada put it \u2013 a position shared by Hatoyama.The main reason behind this confidence that, despite all the stresses and strains, the alliance will endure is not hard to discern: growing mutual fear of China.If Obama has mismanaged ties with Japan, his problems with China are infinitely greater by comparison, ranging from security issues such as Iran, Taiwan, North Korea and Tibet to fair trade, currency valuations, human rights and climate change. Obama wants to befriend China and work with it. But if China chooses a diverging path, as it often appears inclined to do, the help and assistance of Japan in containing it will be indispensable to the US \u2013 and vice versa.Underscoring this point, last week's exchanges over Okinawa coincided with the latest, unsettling broadside from the People's Liberation Army that, according to some Japanese analysts, calls the shots in Beijing. \"China's big goal in the 21st century is to become world number one, the top power,\" wrote PLA senior colonel Liu Mingfu. China, he said, was determined to become the \"global champion\" while conflict with the US over \"who rises and [who] fails to dominate the world\" was inevitable.This may be bluster. But it is safer to assume it is not. With this unruly giant bellowing on the doorstep, Japan and the US need each other more than ever.

As commander of the 4th air defence missile unit, Taniguchi is on the front line of Japan's much downplayed but scarily real, ongoing stand-off with North Korea, one of several potential conflicts in a rough neighbourhood.Japanese politicians and their US military allies tend to soft-pedal problems with Pyongyang, stressing the need to resume the diplomatic process broken off last year. But no one at Iruma has forgotten the moment last April when North Korea lofted a TaepoDong-2 long range ballistic missile over Japan, sending it crashing into the Pacific \u2013 or the North's second nuclear test explosion the following month.\"If an enemy dares to attack us, that's lucky for us,\" an unsmiling Taniguchi said. \"Once they are within range, it is our opportunity, not theirs.\"Taniguchi's confidence in Japan's ability to defend itself rests on the weapons under his command \u2013 an American designed, Japanese built Patriot PAC-3 missile battery, attached to one of the six ballistic missile defence (BMD) groups girdling the country since 2007.The innocuous-looking, green-painted oblong canisters contain four Patriot missiles each. Mounted on trucks, pointing skywards, and electronically linked to six naval destroyers equipped with Aegis phased array radar, they mark the Japan Self-Defence Force's first foray into BMD. The full deployment will be completed this year.This is the type of defensive missile system the Obama administration plans to introduce in eastern Europe. It is also similar to the missiles the US has controversially agreed to sell to Taiwan, to help counter the growing threat from China.Under Article 9 of its postwar constitution, Japan renounced \"forever\" the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes. But the 1960 US-Japan security treaty made clear that Tokyo has a right to self-defence.Since then, and with accelerating speed since the 9/11 attacks, Japan's defence and security activities have expanded. While still essentially defensive in nature, they include international peacekeeping operations, logistical and financial support in Afghanistan, emphasis on strengthened bilateral and multilateral regional alliances, overseas disaster relief, anti-piracy and coastguard operations, and a pro-active overseas development programme.Defence ministry officials and analysts in Tokyo suggest three factors are driving this evolution. One is a host of regional threats and potential flashpoints. They include territorial disputes with China, Russia and South Korea; China's rapid military build-up (its defence spending is rising in double digits each year); its aggressive oil exploration activities in the East China Sea; and North Korea's unpredictable behaviour.\"The environment that we face is harsh and difficult and this is making us feel that we may have to be more self-reliant,\" said a senior defence ministry official. \"On the other hand, this makes it all the more important to solidify our alliance with the US.\"The second factor fuelling Japanese insecurity, however, is growing doubt about that very alliance. A simmering row over relocating the Futenma US Marine Corps base in Okinawa, US troop drawdowns in east Asia, revived concerns about the dependability of the US \"nuclear umbrella\" and the general perception that US global predominance is weakening in the new \"Chinese century\" all suggest Japan must do more to look after itself.This thinking is reflected, thirdly, in Japan's domestic politics, which remain in flux after last autumn's watershed defeat of the conservative Liberal Democrats, in power almost continuously since the war, by the centre-left Democratic party.Prime minister Yukio Hatoyama's emphasis on east Asian communal \"fraternity\" and a \"more equal\", balanced relationship with the US has put noses out of joint in Washington but appears to have struck a chord with Japanese voters. Upper House elections in July could further embolden the Democrats. Meanwhile, entrenched economic difficulties are also spurring un-Japanese talk of radical solutions.Such problems are for the politicians to sort out. At Iruma air base, Major Taniguchi sticks to the basics, and he draws an unexpected parallel.

Under the current agreement, Futenma airbase, located in the middle of a heavily populated city, would be moved to an offshore location in Okinawa, and 8,000 marines would be redeployed to Guam.Okada said he did not feel that US pressure over the base amounted to bullying, although he admitted Washington had been consistent in arguing that the current agreement was the best approach.\"I don't think the US would utterly refuse to talk to us regarding the conclusion we reach after we have discussed it in the cabinet,\" Okada said. \"If that is the case, there is no point for us to continue to study the matter in the cabinet.\"He denied reports that the government and the Obama administration had already started negotiating an alternative location for Futenma.\"We will go to the US after a conclusion has been reached inside the cabinet,\" he said. \"I'm aware that it's not easy to come up with a proposal that would satisfy the Okinawan people and the US government.\"Okada, speaking hours before Toyota's president, Akio Toyoda, was due to go before US congressional investigators to defend his firm's safety record, said he hoped the global recall of millions of Toyota cars would not further strain bilateral ties.\"I certainly would like to hope this matter will not undermine the trust of the Americans, not just [in] Toyota as a company, but Japan as a whole,\" he said. \"It is essentially a matter of one enterprise ... there's very little the Japanese government can do.\"Turning to relations with China, Okada said Japan was concerned about a perceived lack of transparency about Beijing's growing military expenditure.China's expanding military capabilities made the US-Japan alliance all the more important, not just for Japan, but for the region as a whole.But he welcomed China's attempts to persuade North Korea to rejoin talks on its nuclear programme.\"We would like to see further [Chinese] efforts to influence North Korea,\" he said, but added, \"Japan, South Korea and the US demand that North Korea come back to six-party talks with no conditions. To achieve that we are continuing economic sanctions.\"Okada's comments came as US negotiators arrived in the region to try and kick-start the talks, which Pyongyang abandoned last year, shortly before it conducted its second nuclear test.Japan's Asahi newspaper reported this week that China had told North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, to abandon his nuclear ambitions, open up the economy and end dynastic politics, in return for more food and energy aid.In an apparent sign of progress, China's president, Hu Jintao, met a senior North Korean official in Beijing on Tuesday and praised the co-operation between the two sides.", "tags": ["Japan", "US military", "US foreign policy", "US news", "World news"], "title": "Japan fears US military row could escalate"},{"date": "2010-02-14T14:11:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Two Greenpeace activists who were arrested after attempting to expose embezzlement in Japan's whaling fleet will go on trial tomorrow in a case campaigners hope will spark a domestic backlash against the heavily-subsidised industry.Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki were detained in June 2008, two months after intercepting a consignment of whale meat they claimed had been stolen by a member of the crew on the Nisshin Maru, the Japanese Antarctic whaling fleet's mother ship.The activists \u2013 who claimed the meat was destined for the black market \u2013 face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of theft and trespass.They said the package, retrieved from a warehouse in Aomori, northern Japan, was marked \"cardboard\" but contained 23kg of salted whale meat worth around 350,000 yen (\u00a32,477).Greenpeace said it had evidence to prove that at least 23 of the ship's crew smuggled more than 90 boxes of salted whale, disguised as personal baggage, and accused them of defrauding the Japanese taxpayer with the approval of Kyodo Senpaku, which operates the whaling fleet.Kyodo Senpaku insisted the packages were a \"bonus\" for crew members who had spent several months in the inhospitable waters of the southern ocean.Prosecutors, who initially agreed to pursue the embezzlement claims, dropped the investigation on the day Sato and Suzuki were arrested in early-morning raids on their homes.According to Greenpeace,, Japanese taxpayers contribute an estimated 500m yen to the \"scientific\" whale hunts each year.Earlier this month, a UN human rights body condemned the detention of Sato and Suzuki and warned Japan that it had breached several articles of the UN declaration of human rights.During their 26 days in custody, 23 of which saw them held without charge, the suspects were denied access to lawyers, strapped to chairs and interrogated for up to 12 hours a day.Their interrogators likened them to members of Aum Supreme Truth, the doomsday cult that carried out the fatal gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in 1995.Suzuki protested by going on hunger strike for nine days and refusing to talk to investigators for four more.\"They have taken a stand in the public interest,\" Kumi Naidoo, Greenpeace's executive director, told reporters in Tokyo.\"It has come at a personal and professional cost. To be in detention day after day, tied down, with no lawyer, is a terrifying thing for anyone to endure.\"To have that happen to them when all they were trying to do was draw attention to the abuse of public funds is beyond scary. It is wrong.\"Naidoo urged the Japanese prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, to reopen the investigation into alleged embezzlement by the whaling crew and to ensure Sato and Suzuki were given a fair trial. \"The eyes of the world are on Japan,\" he added.Since the arrests, more than 250,000 people have signed a petition demanding justice for 32-year-old Sato and Suzuki, 42.Anti-whaling campaigners have accused the authorities of staging a politically motivated trial, designed to depict peaceful activists as \"terrorists\", with the eventual aim of closing down Greenpeace's office in Japan.In an interview with the Guardian after he was released on bail, Suzuki remained unrepentant. \"Since my arrest, I have not lied once about what I did,\" he said.\"But the whalers have had to make up one story after another. Their lies will come back to haunt them.\"Two years ago, Greenpeace abandoned its pursuit of the whaling fleet to focus on building an anti-whaling coalition among the Japanese people.A provision in the International Whaling commission's 1986 ban on commercial whaling permits Japan to conduct \"lethal research\" into about 1,000 whales in the Southern ocean each year.", "tags": ["Japan", "Greenpeace", "Whaling", "Environment", "World news", "Activism", "Whales", "Cetaceans"], "title": "Anti-whaling activists face trial in Japan"},{"date": "2010-01-19T08:25:47Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan Airlines (JAL) was today reported to be hours away from bankruptcy \u2013 the first step in an attempt to free itself from the huge debts and poor management that have come to define a once-revered Japanese corporate symbol.As the Japanese transport minister, Seiji Maehara, prepared to put the airline in the hands of a state-backed turnaround body, it suffered the indignity of seeing shares reach a record low of four yen (2.6 pence).JAL, which has received three government bailouts in the past decade, has seen the value of its shares fall by 90% since the beginning of the month.With a market value of $150m (\u00a391m) \u2013 less than the price of a Boeing 747 jet \u2013 the airline is now trailing the likes of Croatia Airlines and Jazeera Airways.JAL shares could soon be worth nothing if, as expected, they are de-listed from the Tokyo stock exchange.Despite filing for what would be Japan's sixth-biggest ever bankruptcy, the airline is expected to stay in business while it attempts to rid itself of debts of $16bn and repair its battered reputation.\"The government wants to continue to support JAL to ensure its continued stable and safe operations,\" Maehara told reporters.In exchange for financial backing from the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation (Etic), JAL will reportedly be asked to cut 15,600 jobs \u2013 one-third of its workforce \u2013 by March 2013 and cut unprofitable routes.The airline is expecting operating losses of 265bn yen (\u00a31.8bn) for the year to the end of March, having amassed losses of 51bn yen last year.Its long-term future will be dependent on efforts to emerge as a leaner business, probably with additional support through new partnerships with overseas carriers that could transform the airline business in the Asia-Pacific market.The restructuring plan, due to be announced later today, could mark the anointing of JAL's rival All Nippon Airways as Japan's flagship carrier.Analysts were upbeat about JAL's immediate future but admitted questions over its potential for growth remained.\"I am not worried about the future of the carrier as I believe the government will strongly support it,\" Yasuhiro Matsumoto, a credit analyst at Shinsei Securities, said.\"But whether it will be able to grow as a business is unclear. I can't see how JAL is going to build its network domestically and internationally.\"JAL's decline has been a sobering experience for an airline that grew from a handful of leased planes in 1951 into a global fleet of 280 aircraft and almost 50,000 employees.It will begin its recovery by filing for court protection \u2013 a move akin to Chapter 11 in the US \u2013 which would pave the way for a 300bn yen injection of fresh capital from Etic.The body indicated that it would draw on government-backed funding to open a line of credit that would enable JAL to buy fuel and parts to keep its planes in the air.JAL's main creditors, which include three Japanese megabanks, have reportedly agreed to waive debts of 350bn yen.The airline is also likely to offload unprofitable side businesses to give itself a fighting chance of recovery amid falling passenger numbers, rising fuel prices and high restructuring costs.Its first obvious break with the past will be the expected appointment of Kazuo Inamori, the founder of the electrical components maker Kyocera, as the chief executive in place of Haruka Nishimatsu.A very different airline is expected to emerge under the stewardship of the 77-year-old Inamori, a successful entrepreneur but an airline industry novice.Under the restructuring plan, JAL could retire 53 of its largest jets and replace them with smaller aircraft suited to domestic and regional flights.The airline will also have to decide on rival offers of investment from two US airlines keen to gain a bigger foothold in Asia.American Airlines and its partners, including British Airways, say they are willing to invest $1.4bn to keep JAL as part of their Oneworld Alliance.However, reports suggest JAL is preparing to accept a rival offer, worth about $1bn, from Delta and defect to its Sky Team group.", "tags": ["Japan", "Airline industry", "Japan holidays", "Business", "Travel", "World news"], "title": "Japan Airlines 'hours away from bankruptcy'"},{"date": "2010-01-10T19:53:06Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan Airlines is expected to be declared bankrupt, possibly as early as this week, despite offers of aid from US rivals that could rescue the stricken carrier.The airline, which is the biggest in Asia but is burdened with debts of \u00a310bn, will file for bankruptcy as part of a state-\u00adsponsored restructuring that is likely to see it emerge slimmed down and ready to renegotiate with its partners.The move could have significant implications for British Airways, which is a partner with American Airlines and Japan Airlines in the Oneworld Alliance.Government officials said they would reject offers of equity investment in the airline from American and Delta Airlines, which is part of the rival SkyTeam grouping, ahead of a bankruptcy filing.They said the government planned to put in new management and restructure the company before seeking to negotiate with rival airlines over possible tie-ups.Delta and American have been courting Japan Airlines with rival offers of financial aid, backed by private equity partners.

It may also sound the death-knell for a business model that placed quick profits and rapid expansion above all else.Almost three years after Nova, Japan's biggest eikaiwa, or English conversation school chain, went bust, Geos filed for bankruptcy with debts of about $81m. It immediately closed 99 schools employing 483 people, with G.communications, a Nagoya-based chain, acquiring the 230 remaining branches.Students at the closed schools were told they would not receive tuition rebates but would be allowed to transfer to other schools or learn online with the money they had already paid.Few were surprised that Geos, founded in 1973, met the same fate as Nova, but that did little to mollify students unable to transfer to other schools or teachers uneasy about the new working conditions at G.com.Geos reportedly started finding new buyers for its overseas schools as soon as the depth of its financial crisis became clear. It operated schools in several other countries, including the UK, US, France and Canada, and in January closed all eight of its schools in Australia, leaving 2,300 students unable to receive refunds and 390 staff without jobs.While disaffected teachers and students consider their options, the eikaiwa sector is left reeling from its second high-profile failure in three years.The once booming industry, its image already tarnished by Nova's sudden collapse, is grappling with falls in student numbers and an inability to adapt to a more sophisticated market.Geos, like Nova, fell victim to its unshakeable belief in an over-ambitious business model that depended on persuading students to part with huge sums of cash up front and investing it in advertising and new schools.But the current climate is a long way from the eikaiwa heyday when Nova operated about 900 branches and Geos about 500.Enrollment in foreign-language schools in Japan plummeted from 826,858 students in February 2006 to 335,604 this year, according to the ministry of economy, trade and industry.About 40,000 students attended Geos schools in September 2008, but the number had fallen by more than 3,000 by the time the company collapsed, according to Teikoku Data Bank. It had become trapped in a cycle of falling student numbers and the revenues needed to fund aggressive TV commercials.\"It was clear that things weren't going well for Geos,\" said Dennis Tesolat, general secretary of the General Union, an Osaka-based organisation that represents mainly language teachers.\"They were paying high rents to build schools near train stations in rural areas where people tend to use cars. Geos was expanding without knowing what it was doing.\"Tesolat acknowledged that the school had moved quickly to reach a deal with G.com and prevent the widespread panic that followed Nova's collapse, but said the industry's future remained cloudy.\"The market has changed because students have options that weren't open to them before.\"In the old days you had to go to an eikaiwa, but students no longer believe that you have to hand over $10,000 to a school. They can take lessons online, there are free materials on the internet. Being with a native English speaker is not seen as the only way to fluency.\"The industry is now on the brink of a potentially painful period of restructuring that could lead to the emergence of a more cautious breed of schools that focus more on career development and teaching than on expansion and advertising.\"The schools that devise a way to keep good teachers for a relatively long time will win in the end,\" said Tesolat.Industry insiders agree that the Geos debacle should bring an end to the time-honoured practice of persuading students to hand over large sums of money, often borrowed from consumer loans firms, for long-term contracts.\"Eikaiwa is an education industry, but it is also a business so you have to grow in a healthy manner and look after your employees and students,\" said Dean Rogers, owner of the Dean Morgan chain of language schools. \"The 100% prepaid package, financed by loans, is not the right way to do it.\"Surprisingly perhaps, Rogers believes now is a \"great time\" to be in the industry, particularly for smaller chains that offer more manageable deals to students and have no interest in empire building.\"The market is already out there and you don't need to be a rocket scientist to make it work. This is a crisis for the larger schools because their brand image has been tarnished.\"The fate of Geos and Nova may also force prospective teachers to reconsider a short-term career in the eikaiwa industry.While classes at surviving Geos schools have resumed under their new owners, some teachers shunned the offer of provisional three-month contracts with G.com.\"The contract was very vague,\" said Tuan Hong, an ex-Geos teacher from Britain who is looking for a new job. \"To me it looked like a diplomatic way of putting people out of a job.\"The 29-year-old, who had taught for Geos in Tokyo for more than three years, said the school had long ago lost sight of its responsibilities to students and teachers.\"Our priority as teachers was to sell, whether it was books, calculators or new contracts. We were treated more like salespeople than teachers.

It may also sound the death-knell for a business model that placed quick profits and rapid expansion above all else.Almost three years after Nova, Japan's biggest eikaiwa, or English conversation school chain, went bust, Geos filed for bankruptcy with debts of about $81m. It immediately closed 99 schools employing 483 people, with G.communications, a Nagoya-based chain, acquiring the 230 remaining branches.Students at the closed schools were told they would not receive tuition rebates but would be allowed to transfer to other schools or learn online with the money they had already paid.Few were surprised that Geos, founded in 1973, met the same fate as Nova, but that did little to mollify students unable to transfer to other schools or teachers uneasy about the new working conditions at G.com.Geos reportedly started finding new buyers for its overseas schools as soon as the depth of its financial crisis became clear. It operated schools in several other countries, including the UK, US, France and Canada, and in January closed all eight of its schools in Australia, leaving 2,300 students unable to receive refunds and 390 staff without jobs.While disaffected teachers and students consider their options, the eikaiwa sector is left reeling from its second high-profile failure in three years.The once booming industry, its image already tarnished by Nova's sudden collapse, is grappling with falls in student numbers and an inability to adapt to a more sophisticated market.Geos, like Nova, fell victim to its unshakeable belief in an over-ambitious business model that depended on persuading students to part with huge sums of cash up front and investing it in advertising and new schools.But the current climate is a long way from the eikaiwa heyday when Nova operated about 900 branches and Geos about 500.Enrollment in foreign-language schools in Japan plummeted from 826,858 students in February 2006 to 335,604 this year, according to the ministry of economy, trade and industry.About 40,000 students attended Geos schools in September 2008, but the number had fallen by more than 3,000 by the time the company collapsed, according to Teikoku Data Bank. It had become trapped in a cycle of falling student numbers and the revenues needed to fund aggressive TV commercials.\"It was clear that things weren't going well for Geos,\" said Dennis Tesolat, general secretary of the General Union, an Osaka-based organisation that represents mainly language teachers.\"They were paying high rents to build schools near train stations in rural areas where people tend to use cars. Geos was expanding without knowing what it was doing.\"Tesolat acknowledged that the school had moved quickly to reach a deal with G.com and prevent the widespread panic that followed Nova's collapse, but said the industry's future remained cloudy.\"The market has changed because students have options that weren't open to them before.\"In the old days you had to go to an eikaiwa, but students no longer believe that you have to hand over $10,000 to a school. They can take lessons online, there are free materials on the internet. Being with a native English speaker is not seen as the only way to fluency.\"The industry is now on the brink of a potentially painful period of restructuring that could lead to the emergence of a more cautious breed of schools that focus more on career development and teaching than on expansion and advertising.\"The schools that devise a way to keep good teachers for a relatively long time will win in the end,\" said Tesolat.Industry insiders agree that the Geos debacle should bring an end to the time-honoured practice of persuading students to hand over large sums of money, often borrowed from consumer loans firms, for long-term contracts.\"Eikaiwa is an education industry, but it is also a business so you have to grow in a healthy manner and look after your employees and students,\" said Dean Rogers, owner of the Dean Morgan chain of language schools. \"The 100% prepaid package, financed by loans, is not the right way to do it.\"Surprisingly perhaps, Rogers believes now is a \"great time\" to be in the industry, particularly for smaller chains that offer more manageable deals to students and have no interest in empire building.\"The market is already out there and you don't need to be a rocket scientist to make it work. This is a crisis for the larger schools because their brand image has been tarnished.\"The fate of Geos and Nova may also force prospective teachers to reconsider a short-term career in the eikaiwa industry.While classes at surviving Geos schools have resumed under their new owners, some teachers shunned the offer of provisional three-month contracts with G.com.\"The contract was very vague,\" said Tuan Hong, an ex-Geos teacher from Britain who is looking for a new job. \"To me it looked like a diplomatic way of putting people out of a job.\"The 29-year-old, who had taught for Geos in Tokyo for more than three years, said the school had long ago lost sight of its responsibilities to students and teachers.\"Our priority as teachers was to sell, whether it was books, calculators or new contracts.

If found guilty Bethune, a member of the Sea Shepherd marine conservation group, could face up to 15 years in prison.Dressed in a black suit and white shirt and flanked by security guards, Bethune told the Tokyo district court he had had \"good reason\" to leap aboard the Shonan Maru 2 from a jet ski in February.He had intended to carry out a citizen's arrest of the ship's captain and to present him with a $3m (\u00a32m) bill for the loss of the Ady Gil, Bethune's high-speed powerboat, which had been ripped in half in a collision with the Shonan Maru 2 the previous month.Bethune was detained aboard the ship and arrested on 12 March as soon as it returned to Japan. He has been held at a Tokyo detention centre ever since.Prosecutors claim Bethune and other Sea Shepherd activists had hurled glass bottles containing butyric acid \u2013 rancid butter \u2013 at whalers, leaving one with burns to his face.\"I admit that I boarded the Shonan Maru 2, but I believe I had good reason to do so,\" Bethune said. \"I admit that I fired the butyric acid, but there were additional circumstances that we will discuss in court.\"Sea Shepherd claims the whaler was injured when his pepper spray blew back in his face.Further hearings will take place tomorrow and Monday, and a verdict is expected next month.The trial opened amid tight security inside and outside the courtroom. About 20 ultra-nationalists called for Bethune to be found guilty and held up banners accusing the \"white people\" of the international anti-whaling movement of racism. One read: \"Don't fuck with the Japanese.\" Others carried derogatory comments about Bethune.Shuhei Nishimura, who led the protest, said Bethune deserved a custodial sentence \"or else he will act like a wild wolf in the fields and plot another terrorist attack against Japan. To avoid this, we must punish him severely.\"Bethune was led into court in handcuffs and with a rope tied around his waist, although both were removed when he took his seat. He smiled when prosecutors showed a photograph of him on a protest boat and described him as a \"trademark skinhead\".Japanese whaling officials routinely refer to Sea Shepherd members as \"terrorists\" and said harassment by the group had forced the fleet to return to port last month with only half its intended catch of 935 whales.Although the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial whaling in 1986, Japan is permitted to slaughter whales in the name of \"research\".Japan's aggressive pursuit of anti-whaling activists comes amid mounting condemnation of its annual culls in the Antarctic, particularly from Australia and New Zealand.Two Greenpeace members are also standing trial on theft charges after intercepting a package of whale meat to prove allegations of embezzlement by Japanese whalers. Toru Suzuki and Junichi Sato face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty.

Not so Japan. Hatoyama is out, but it's business as usual. The machine of government grinds on, like a kind of self-propelling juggernaut that rumbles forward regardless of who is in the driving seat. The public, meanwhile, go about their daily lives as if nothing had happened. It looks like apathy, but it's not. It's despair and resignation.\"Shoganai,\" they say (a popular word with shades of meaning ranging from \"c'est la vie\" to \"tough shit\"). This is politics; there's nothing we can do about it. It drives me nuts, of course. I wish people would at least show some frustration, use some strong language, perhaps even resolve to go out to vote (turnout at the last election was under 50%). Only a minority are willing to air their views \u2013 often people who have left the rat race: independent bar owners, the odd housewife, mature students, pensioners, and the like. But most people seem too exhausted or busy even to think about it.At first, Hatoyama seemed like a good thing. Before the election, he was promising to shift power away from the civil service, to introduce child benefits, and to remove the US military presence from Okinawa. He had even begun to deliver on some of his pledges, banning civil servants from holding their own press conferences and abolishing high school fees. Two issues, however, have been his undoing. The first is the fact that his mother, Yasuko, heiress to the Bridgestone tyre fortune, allegedly made illegal donations to his campaign using the names of dead and imaginary people. The second is that he bent under US pressure to renege on his promise to make American troops leave Okinawa, choosing instead to honour a 2006 deal to relocate the Futenma base away from Ginowan City to Henoko Bay. Not only has this caused considerable annoyance to Okinawans, it will also damage coral reefs and threaten endangered marine fauna.These two issues \u2013 family privilege and US interference \u2013 are the essence of what makes people feel so powerless here. Hatoyama, like the majority of the ruling elite, is from a rich and powerful political dynasty. These dynasties, many of them descended from feudal retainers and landlords, established a virtual monopoly over government after the abolition of the shogunate in 1868. Although in the ensuing years they attempted to create a simulacrum of democracy, in reality they did nothing of the sort, and they've had a stranglehold on power ever since.After the war, General MacArthur saw to it that power remained in the hands of conservative upper-class families and instituted a \"red purge\" which resulted in people with leftwing sympathies being summarily dismissed from the media, academia, the civil service, the teaching profession and industry. Dissent was trampled on, and the way paved for 50 years of Liberal Democratic party rule, vested interests, bribery and corruption. Some people naively thought that the gravy train might finally terminate once the LDP was voted out. But the antics of Mama Hatoyama have put paid to that.However, it's not just corruption and nepotism that keeps people out of politics. Dogged resignation to the status quo is inculcated from an early age here. There is next to no education in civics and no attempt to make children aware of their democratic rights. Children are not encouraged to express an opinion at school, where classes are large and taught by rote. The energies of pushy children are channelled into sports clubs where they learn how to fit into a hierarchy, first learning how to stoically endure discipline from older members, and then, as they get older, learning how to discipline their juniors. Less pushy children, meanwhile, can sleep in class and go unnoticed.There is also great emphasis placed on the individual's ability to gaman (put up stoically with suffering), rather than on problem-solving skills, and children are taught to fear the censure or ridicule of others, which makes them unwilling to stand out. In fact, the education system, with its songs, uniforms, rituals and group-focused activities, has achieved an almost perfectly Foucauldian model of passive citizenship. It's an achievement, of sorts.But there may be hope. Japan has a venerable tradition of popular rights movements, although many were brutally suppressed, and in some places, the spirit of local activism persists. Even though ordinary people are largely kept out of national politics, issues in rural areas still motivate people. Recently, the Okinawans have been taking an increasingly more proactive stance in the issue of US bases. If this local issue grows into a national one, politicians might have to sit up and listen to public opinion.

Like Clegg, Hatoyama proposed a more equal, less subservient bilateral relationship. He wanted to explore alternative alliances, including closer ties with China. He even suggested closing a US military base. Now he's paying the price of his effrontery.Attending last month's nuclear summit in Washington, Hatoyama's officials lobbied hard for a one-on-one meeting between their man and Barack Obama. The request was brusquely rebuffed. Instead the Japanese prime minister had to settle for a rushed 10 minutes sitting next to Obama at dinner, making his points while his host consulted the menu. In Tokyo, his treatment was described as humiliating.More extraordinary still, according to US press accounts, Obama bluntly informed Hatoyama that he was \"running out of time\" to settle the dispute over relocation of a US Marine Corps base at Futenma, on Okinawa, and asked him to his face whether he could be trusted. Japanese officials were reportedly so affronted by Obama's rudeness that they did not distribute the usual written record of the exchanges.It got worse. Hatoyama's presumption in appearing to challenge US security interests, and Obama's rough handling of him, led Washington Post gossip columnist Al Kamen to label him the summit's \"biggest loser\". Kamen said Obama administration officials had ridiculed the Japanese leader as \"increasingly loopy\". This in turn provoked a media frenzy in Japan, as translators tried to establish exactly how insulting \"loopy\" really was.A top aide to Hatoyama criticised the term as \"somewhat impolite\". But then, to everyone's amazement, Hatoyama went to the Diet (parliament) and suggested, self-deprecatingly, that the description may be accurate. \"As the Washington Post says, I may certainly be a foolish prime minister,\" he said, before going on to admit that he could have handled the Futenma base issue sooner and better.Hatoyama's Democratic party won in a landslide last August, ending 50 years of almost unbroken rule by the conservative Liberal Democrats who by and large submitted unquestioningly to Washington's will. His ideas about giving Japan a more independent voice in the world, of loosening the American harness, were actually quite modest and mostly unlikely to be implemented.But far from respecting the voters' verdict, the US responded with bullying, name-calling, arm-twisting and exaggerated warnings about the consequences for Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, culminating in the banquet snub. Now Hatoyama's self-criticism suggests he may not last much longer.Given his relatively more provocative views on nuclear disarmament, closer British ties with a united Europe, and the importance of upholding human rights, even in \"war on terror\" conflict zones, \"prime minister\" Clegg could be assured of a yet rougher, Kinnock-esque reception in Washington \u2013 though even brasher Americans may hesitate to suggest the elected leader of their closest military ally was off his nut.Clegg may also wonder, in such circumstances, how long he could hold on to power. Hatoyama must certainly be wondering himself. The growing perception among Japanese voters that he is weakly bowing to US demands on Futenma, reinforced by his apologetic talk in Okinawa today about the need for compromise, has greatly undermined him.A majority believes he should resign if he loses the Futenma fight or misses his self-imposed deadline of the end of May for settling it. In the latest poll, only nine months after he swept to victory, his approval rating is down to 21%. Some analysts say he is playing for time, hoping to fudge the issue until after July's upper house parliamentary elections. Some suggest he may be replaced.Factors other than US pressure have contributed to Hatoyama's plight, including Japan's government debt problems (bigger even than Britain's) and a \"money politics\" sleaze scandal. But at the same time, Obama's hardball tactics could backfire. With the LDP opposition in disarray, the Democrats are likely to be in power for some years to come. Resentment of America, fed by sympathy for the fierce opposition of many Okinawans to the overbearing 49,000-strong US presence there, could actually solidify and spread if Japan is humiliated. And China will surely welcome, and encourage, fractures in the US-Japan alliance.As president, Obama has gained a reputation, fairly or unfairly, for disregarding America's friends while coddling its enemies, for appeasing upstart dictators while alienating old allies. Hatoyama's crusade against Japan's \"old politics\" looks like being one casualty. If he were to take office, Clegg would also encounter formidable US hostility to some of his ideas.

The huge budget reflects the difficulties of drilling deep offshore. In Japan, hydrates in the Sea of Kumano are found about 30km offshore in about 100 metres of water and at a depth below the seabed of 200 metres, making it difficult to mine the unstable hydrates.Concerns had been raised that digging for frozen methane would destabilise the methane beds, which contain enough gas worldwide to snuff out most complex life on earth. Methane itself is a greenhouse gas which is 21 times as damaging as carbon dioxide and any leakage from wells could be an environmental problem.Professor Gerald Dickens, of Rice University in Texas,a leading researcher into methane hydrates, thinks accidental releases can be avoided.\"The only potential issue in regards to drilling would be if there is greatly over-pressured gas immediately beneath the gas hydrate. However, there is growing belief and rationale to suggest that this cannot occur in nature. So, as far as drilling there should be no issue.\"Environmentalists, however, are concernedabout the burning of more earth-locked hydrocarbons. Methane may be a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than coal or oil but will still release many tons of CO2. Jogmec acknowledges the problems, admitting mining of methane ice could lead to landslides and the devastation of marine life in the mining areas. \"There are many other technological problems to overcome,\" says the Jogmec website. \"Not least that when you drill you create heat, which turns the frozen methane into gas, which could then leak uncontrollably through the sea to our atmosphere.\"The US, China, Canada and South Korea are among other countries seeking to develop commercially viable extraction technology and each is now exploring the mining of methane hydrates from their own sea beds.\"Some commercial production of methane from methane hydrate could be achieved in the United States before 2025,\" says a US government report on the subject.", "tags": ["Energy industry", "Business", "Energy", "Environment", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan to drill for controversial 'fire ice'"},{"date": "2010-09-27T08:22:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": " In a bid to shore up its precarious energy security Japan is to start commercial test drilling for controversial frozen methane gas along its coast next year.The gas is methane hydrate, a sherbet-like substance consisting of methane trapped in water ice \u2013 sometimes called \"fire ice\" or MH \u2013 that is locked deep underwater or under permafrost by the cold and under pressure 23 times that of normal atmosphere.A consortium led by the Japanese government and the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (Jogmec) will be sinking several wells off the south-eastern coast of Japan to assess the commercial viability of extracting gas from frozen methane deep beneath local waters.

He was only 46, and his legacy of work is a mere four completed feature films and one television series. So, it's likely many of you have not heard of the man \u2013 doubly likely since his films were all animated.There has long been an argument regarding the validity of animation as a medium for adults. It's easy for many to dismiss animated film as being automatically for kids or, worse, for teenagers. But for myself and others, animation is just another way of telling a story or getting a message across to an audience. This is why I referred to Satoshi Kon as a \"director\" in the opening paragraph: his films are so involving and cinematic it's easy to forget that they are constructed one frame at a time. What's more, they are definitely not for kids. These days, rather than give unbelievers in the power and potential of animated features the short thrift they clearly deserve, I'll point them in the direction of Kon's slim catalogue. Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers and Paprika are all extremely accomplished films.Like many, I first encountered Kon's work upon the release of his 1998 directorial debut, Perfect Blue. The early 90s had seen a glut of anime releases over here following the success of Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira. I managed to catch most of them on video, enjoying a crash course in a culture and artform offering much that was novel to the western viewer. But precious few were anywhere near Akira's level of achievement, and plenty were simply hideous, so my interest waned. When Perfect Blue came along, I wasn't in any hurry to sit through another hard-to-follow story of ultra-violence and tentacle rape. Concerning a J-pop sensation trying to go solo, it seemed designed to keep audiences away. But the reviews and rumours kept referencing Hitchcock, Lynch and Scorsese. This was clearly not a run-of-the-mill production.Based on a novel, Perfect Blue was allegedly intended as a live-action feature, but with money hard to raise it was downgraded to direct-to-video, then direct-to-video-animation. When Satoshi Kon took the reigns, it was no one's idea of a hit \u2013 which is probably why he was able to get the gig in the first place. But when his vision took hold it was soon headed for theatrical release. Without giving too much away, the film starts off in stylish yet straightforward fashion as pop singer Rumi leaves her successful band to pursue an acting career. Her fans are in uproar; her stalker goes over the edge. As the pressure and trauma mount, Rumi's grip on reality becomes fractured \u2013 and then things start to get really interesting. It was special enough for Darren Aronofsky to secure the rights, and though his live-action remake never got past the starter's gate he did lift two very striking shots for Requiem For A Dream, while the trailer for his forthcoming Black Swan seems to have a little flavour of it, too.Kon's next films surpassed all expectations. It became clear with Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers that he was doing something very different from his peers. The first, which tells the story of a popular film star who withdraws from public life, proved he was a director-aficionado with a deep knowledge and even deeper love of cinema. Chiyoko's narrative is interspersed with memories/clips from her films that blur together \u2013 telling not only her own history but also a potted history of Japanese cinema. The actress was based on Setsuko Hara and Hideko Takamine, muses of the great directors Yasujir\u014d Ozu and Mikio Naruse respectively. Millennium Actress also touched on Kaiju Eiga, the Japanese monster-movie genre. There aren't any other animated films I can think of that assimilate such a range of references.Kon's brief sojourn in the world of television also yielded spectacular results, with the bizarre Paranoia Agent. This series, again best approached with as little foreknowledge as possible, starts with a designer of cutesy characters trying to come up with a new creation to match the popularity of her iconic pink dog, Maromi, as a series of seemingly random people are brutally attacked by a kid wielding a golden baseball bat. Reality is not to be trusted and the oft-employed comparisons to the work of David Lynch are not too wide of the mark.For me, his finest work was his last: Paprika. Again it's completely unfair to condense it into a brief synopsis, but it deals with a machine that can place an avatar into another person's dreams. I wasn't the only one to notice, when the first trailer from Christopher Nolan's Inception hit, that it looks a bit like the 2006 animation \u2013 though I wouldn't call it a rip-off, there are enough similarities to suggest he has at least seen it. For my money, Kon's is the better film \u2013 the Japanese director really wasn't afraid to \"dream a little bigger\" . Paprika is more spectacular, imaginative, fun and emotional than Nolan's hit. Now, there's a live action version with director Wolfgang Peterson mooted.Satoshi Kon left us with one final film, The Dream Machine, still in production. Little is known about this project other than that it concerns robots and is aimed at younger viewers \u2013 though we know how little that really means. Beside my sympathy for his family and friends, Kon's death did shock and sadden me on a personal level because in him I had found a director who didn't disappoint, one I could trust wholeheartedly \u2013 which is incredibly rare. To speak selfishly, I feel sadness that I will never see him complete a new film. Here was a director I felt I could depend on to reaffirm my faith in cinema \u2013 a faith that gets a good battering almost daily as I sit through films that do little more than waste my time. But Kon's films are ones I foresee myself returning to many times in the future.And as for those children, the supposed target audience for his animations?

In Japan, hydrates in the Sea of Kumano are found about 30km offshore in about 100 metres of water and at a depth below the seabed of 200 metres, making it difficult to mine the unstable hydrates.Concerns had been raised that digging for frozen methane would destabilise the methane beds, which contain enough gas worldwide to snuff out most complex life on earth. Methane itself is a greenhouse gas which is 21 times as damaging as carbon dioxide and any leakage from wells could be an environmental problem.Professor Gerald Dickens, of Rice University in Texas,a leading researcher into methane hydrates, thinks accidental releases can be avoided.\"The only potential issue in regards to drilling would be if there is greatly over-pressured gas immediately beneath the gas hydrate. However, there is growing belief and rationale to suggest that this cannot occur in nature. So, as far as drilling there should be no issue.\"Environmentalists, however, are concernedabout the burning of more earth-locked hydrocarbons. Methane may be a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than coal or oil but will still release many tons of CO2. Jogmec acknowledges the problems, admitting mining of methane ice could lead to landslides and the devastation of marine life in the mining areas. \"There are many other technological problems to overcome,\" says the Jogmec website. \"Not least that when you drill you create heat, which turns the frozen methane into gas, which could then leak uncontrollably through the sea to our atmosphere.\"The US, China, Canada and South Korea are among other countries seeking to develop commercially viable extraction technology and each is now exploring the mining of methane hydrates from their own sea beds.\"Some commercial production of methane from methane hydrate could be achieved in the United States before 2025,\" says a US government report on the subject.", "tags": ["Energy industry", "Business", "Energy", "Environment", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan to drill for controversial 'fire ice'"},{"date": "2010-09-24T08:54:49Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japanese prosecutors have released the captain of a Chinese fishing boat, two weeks after a collision in disputed waters sparked a dramatic deterioration in ties between Beijing and Tokyo.Zhan Qixiong was arrested on 8 September, a day after his ship collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the Senkakus, a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both countries.Prosecutors on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, where Zhan was detained, said they would monitor both governments' response to their decision before deciding whether to indict him, but that course of action is looking increasingly unlikely.They said the row caused by Zhan's detention and the possible impact on Japan-China ties had been a factor in their decision.They accepted that Zhan had not intended to damage the Japanese vessels, but said he had been to blame by ignoring repeated requests to leave the area.\"We have decided that further investigation while keeping the captain in custody would not be appropriate, considering the impact on the people of our country as well as Japan-China relations in the future,\" the district's vice-prosecutor, Toru Suzuki, said.The Senkakus, which are controlled by Japan, are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits.

He was only 46, and his legacy of work is a mere four completed feature films and one television series. So, it's likely many of you have not heard of the man \u2013 doubly likely since his films were all animated.There has long been an argument regarding the validity of animation as a medium for adults. It's easy for many to dismiss animated film as being automatically for kids or, worse, for teenagers. But for myself and others, animation is just another way of telling a story or getting a message across to an audience. This is why I referred to Satoshi Kon as a \"director\" in the opening paragraph: his films are so involving and cinematic it's easy to forget that they are constructed one frame at a time. What's more, they are definitely not for kids. These days, rather than give unbelievers in the power and potential of animated features the short thrift they clearly deserve, I'll point them in the direction of Kon's slim catalogue. Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers and Paprika are all extremely accomplished films.Like many, I first encountered Kon's work upon the release of his 1998 directorial debut, Perfect Blue. The early 90s had seen a glut of anime releases over here following the success of Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira. I managed to catch most of them on video, enjoying a crash course in a culture and artform offering much that was novel to the western viewer. But precious few were anywhere near Akira's level of achievement, and plenty were simply hideous, so my interest waned. When Perfect Blue came along, I wasn't in any hurry to sit through another hard-to-follow story of ultra-violence and tentacle rape. Concerning a J-pop sensation trying to go solo, it seemed designed to keep audiences away. But the reviews and rumours kept referencing Hitchcock, Lynch and Scorsese. This was clearly not a run-of-the-mill production.Based on a novel, Perfect Blue was allegedly intended as a live-action feature, but with money hard to raise it was downgraded to direct-to-video, then direct-to-video-animation. When Satoshi Kon took the reigns, it was no one's idea of a hit \u2013 which is probably why he was able to get the gig in the first place. But when his vision took hold it was soon headed for theatrical release. Without giving too much away, the film starts off in stylish yet straightforward fashion as pop singer Rumi leaves her successful band to pursue an acting career. Her fans are in uproar; her stalker goes over the edge. As the pressure and trauma mount, Rumi's grip on reality becomes fractured \u2013 and then things start to get really interesting. It was special enough for Darren Aronofsky to secure the rights, and though his live-action remake never got past the starter's gate he did lift two very striking shots for Requiem For A Dream, while the trailer for his forthcoming Black Swan seems to have a little flavour of it, too.Kon's next films surpassed all expectations. It became clear with Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers that he was doing something very different from his peers. The first, which tells the story of a popular film star who withdraws from public life, proved he was a director-aficionado with a deep knowledge and even deeper love of cinema. Chiyoko's narrative is interspersed with memories/clips from her films that blur together \u2013 telling not only her own history but also a potted history of Japanese cinema. The actress was based on Setsuko Hara and Hideko Takamine, muses of the great directors Yasujir\u014d Ozu and Mikio Naruse respectively. Millennium Actress also touched on Kaiju Eiga, the Japanese monster-movie genre. There aren't any other animated films I can think of that assimilate such a range of references.Kon's brief sojourn in the world of television also yielded spectacular results, with the bizarre Paranoia Agent. This series, again best approached with as little foreknowledge as possible, starts with a designer of cutesy characters trying to come up with a new creation to match the popularity of her iconic pink dog, Maromi, as a series of seemingly random people are brutally attacked by a kid wielding a golden baseball bat. Reality is not to be trusted and the oft-employed comparisons to the work of David Lynch are not too wide of the mark.For me, his finest work was his last: Paprika. Again it's completely unfair to condense it into a brief synopsis, but it deals with a machine that can place an avatar into another person's dreams. I wasn't the only one to notice, when the first trailer from Christopher Nolan's Inception hit, that it looks a bit like the 2006 animation \u2013 though I wouldn't call it a rip-off, there are enough similarities to suggest he has at least seen it. For my money, Kon's is the better film \u2013 the Japanese director really wasn't afraid to \"dream a little bigger\" . Paprika is more spectacular, imaginative, fun and emotional than Nolan's hit. Now, there's a live action version with director Wolfgang Peterson mooted.Satoshi Kon left us with one final film, The Dream Machine, still in production. Little is known about this project other than that it concerns robots and is aimed at younger viewers \u2013 though we know how little that really means. Beside my sympathy for his family and friends, Kon's death did shock and sadden me on a personal level because in him I had found a director who didn't disappoint, one I could trust wholeheartedly \u2013 which is incredibly rare. To speak selfishly, I feel sadness that I will never see him complete a new film. Here was a director I felt I could depend on to reaffirm my faith in cinema \u2013 a faith that gets a good battering almost daily as I sit through films that do little more than waste my time. But Kon's films are ones I foresee myself returning to many times in the future.And as for those children, the supposed target audience for his animations? Well, they have plenty of time to grow into them.", "tags": ["Animation", "Film", "Culture", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Anime"], "title": "Japan mourns anime master Satoshi Kon"},{"date": "2010-08-11T17:00:12Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has been getting a raw deal from the so-called economic experts. Consider this: in the midst of the great recession, the United States is suffering through nearly 10% unemployment, rising inequality and poverty, 47 million people without health insurance, declining retirement prospects for the middle class and a general increase in economic insecurity. Various European nations also are having their difficulties, and no one knows if China is the next bubble due to explode.How, then, should we regard a country that has 5% unemployment, the lowest income inequality, healthcare for all its people and is one of the world's leading exporters? This country also scores high on life expectancy, low on infant mortality, is at the top in numeracy and literacy, and is low on crime, incarceration, homicides, mental illness and drug abuse. It also has a low rate of carbon emissions, doing its part to reduce global warming. In all these categories, this particular country beats both the US and China by a country mile.Doesn't that sound like a country from which Americans and others might learn a thing or two about how to get out of the hole in which we're stuck?Not if that place is Japan. During and before the current economic crisis, few countries have been vilified as an economic basket case so much as Japan: it's been hard to find any reference to the country without some mention of its allegedly sclerotic economy, its zombie banks, its deflation and slow economic growth. This malaise has even been called \"Japan syndrome\", sounding like a disease to warn policymakers, as in \"you don't want to end up like Japan.\"No one has been more influential in defining this narrative than Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman. Throughout the 1990s, and still today, Krugman has skewered Japan's economy and leaders. In the late 1990s, Krugman wrote a series of gloom-and-doom articles, complete with equations and titles like \"Japan's Trap\" and \"Setting Sun\", bluntly stating:But let's look at some of the Japanese metrics during that time. Throughout the 1990s, the Japanese unemployment rate was \u2013 ready for this? \u2013 about 3%, half the US unemployment rate at the time. During that allegedly \"lost decade\", Japan also had universal healthcare, less inequality, the highest life expectancy, low infant mortality and low rates of crime and incarceration. Americans should be so lucky as to experience a Japanese-style lost decade.Reopening the case of Japan raises some important questions. How do economists such as Krugman decide what to value and prioritise, or what to measure? What is an economy for? To produce the prosperity, security and services that people need? Or to satisfy economists and their equations, theories and models?In the current debate over fiscal stimulus versus deficit reduction for economic recovery, various economists now are criticising Germany. Krugman has written that the Germans \"seem to be getting their talking points from the collected speeches of Herbert Hoover\". Krugman, a stimulus hawk, is criticising Germany for the same thing for which he has criticised Japan \u2013 not spending, or consuming, enough to stimulate its economy.Yet, in the early 1990s, when the US was plagued by large deficits and recession, the Clinton administration didn't employ Krugman-type fiscal stimulus. Instead, it cut the deficit. By the end of the decade, the US budget showed a sizable surplus and the economy was booming.Japan's economy has been and remains successful. So is Germany's. They have reached an economic steady state in which they don't need roaring growth rates to provide for their people. But for the economic Cassandras, apparently, it doesn't matter if people's needs are being met; what matters is whether their theories and equations balance.Unfortunately, there is a common sense aspect to this that gets lost amid the rhetoric. Two lessons of our times are that economic bubbles eventually burst, and that the environmental consequences of unbridled growth in this age of global warming are severe. In other words, the real game is no longer strictly about economic growth; it's about sustainability and learning to do more with less. The era of US-style trickle-down economies is over for wealthy countries because trickle-down is neither economically sound nor ecologically sustainable. The developed nations must lead the way towards a different path of development.This is not an easy challenge, yet it is the course that Japan and Germany have chosen. Americans would be wise to learn from them. If the US didn't have such a trickle-down economy that has produced so much inequality \u2013 if it was, in fact, better at sharing its wealth \u2013 perhaps it wouldn't need so much fiscal stimulus and growth.", "tags": ["Japan", "US economy", "US economic growth and recession", "US unemployment and employment data", "Economics", "Business", "Germany", "US news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "The economic fallacy of 'zombie' Japan | Steven Hill"},{"date": "2010-09-27T08:22:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": " In a bid to shore up its precarious energy security Japan is to start commercial test drilling for controversial frozen methane gas along its coast next year.The gas is methane hydrate, a sherbet-like substance consisting of methane trapped in water ice \u2013 sometimes called \"fire ice\" or MH \u2013 that is locked deep underwater or under permafrost by the cold and under pressure 23 times that of normal atmosphere.A consortium led by the Japanese government and the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (Jogmec) will be sinking several wells off the south-eastern coast of Japan to assess the commercial viability of extracting gas from frozen methane deep beneath local waters. Surveys suggest Japan has enough methane hydrate for 100 years at the current rate of usage.Lying hundreds of metres below the sea and deeper still below sediments, fire ice is exceedingly difficult to extract. Japan is claiming successful tests using a method that gently depressurises the frozen gas.Tokyo plans to start commercial output of methane hydrates by 2018. At present, Japan imports nearly all its gas \u2013 about 58.6m tonnes of liquified gas annually \u2013 and is heavily dependent on oil imports. In a desperate attempt to secure more oil, for example, Japan recently did a deal with the United Arab Emirates. In exchange for using Japan as a base for Asian oil trading, Japan now has priority to purchase rights to up to 4m barrels of immediately accessible crude.Lucia van Geuns, an energy analyst at the international energy programme of the Clingendael Institute, said: \"Methane hydrates could make Japan energy independent. Japan put a lot of R&D into this project because of course the less energy it imports the better.

Consider this: in the midst of the great recession, the United States is suffering through nearly 10% unemployment, rising inequality and poverty, 47 million people without health insurance, declining retirement prospects for the middle class and a general increase in economic insecurity. Various European nations also are having their difficulties, and no one knows if China is the next bubble due to explode.How, then, should we regard a country that has 5% unemployment, the lowest income inequality, healthcare for all its people and is one of the world's leading exporters? This country also scores high on life expectancy, low on infant mortality, is at the top in numeracy and literacy, and is low on crime, incarceration, homicides, mental illness and drug abuse. It also has a low rate of carbon emissions, doing its part to reduce global warming. In all these categories, this particular country beats both the US and China by a country mile.Doesn't that sound like a country from which Americans and others might learn a thing or two about how to get out of the hole in which we're stuck?Not if that place is Japan. During and before the current economic crisis, few countries have been vilified as an economic basket case so much as Japan: it's been hard to find any reference to the country without some mention of its allegedly sclerotic economy, its zombie banks, its deflation and slow economic growth. This malaise has even been called \"Japan syndrome\", sounding like a disease to warn policymakers, as in \"you don't want to end up like Japan.\"No one has been more influential in defining this narrative than Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman. Throughout the 1990s, and still today, Krugman has skewered Japan's economy and leaders. In the late 1990s, Krugman wrote a series of gloom-and-doom articles, complete with equations and titles like \"Japan's Trap\" and \"Setting Sun\", bluntly stating:But let's look at some of the Japanese metrics during that time. Throughout the 1990s, the Japanese unemployment rate was \u2013 ready for this? \u2013 about 3%, half the US unemployment rate at the time. During that allegedly \"lost decade\", Japan also had universal healthcare, less inequality, the highest life expectancy, low infant mortality and low rates of crime and incarceration. Americans should be so lucky as to experience a Japanese-style lost decade.Reopening the case of Japan raises some important questions. How do economists such as Krugman decide what to value and prioritise, or what to measure? What is an economy for? To produce the prosperity, security and services that people need? Or to satisfy economists and their equations, theories and models?In the current debate over fiscal stimulus versus deficit reduction for economic recovery, various economists now are criticising Germany. Krugman has written that the Germans \"seem to be getting their talking points from the collected speeches of Herbert Hoover\". Krugman, a stimulus hawk, is criticising Germany for the same thing for which he has criticised Japan \u2013 not spending, or consuming, enough to stimulate its economy.Yet, in the early 1990s, when the US was plagued by large deficits and recession, the Clinton administration didn't employ Krugman-type fiscal stimulus. Instead, it cut the deficit. By the end of the decade, the US budget showed a sizable surplus and the economy was booming.Japan's economy has been and remains successful. So is Germany's. They have reached an economic steady state in which they don't need roaring growth rates to provide for their people. But for the economic Cassandras, apparently, it doesn't matter if people's needs are being met; what matters is whether their theories and equations balance.Unfortunately, there is a common sense aspect to this that gets lost amid the rhetoric. Two lessons of our times are that economic bubbles eventually burst, and that the environmental consequences of unbridled growth in this age of global warming are severe. In other words, the real game is no longer strictly about economic growth; it's about sustainability and learning to do more with less.

Surveys suggest Japan has enough methane hydrate for 100 years at the current rate of usage.Lying hundreds of metres below the sea and deeper still below sediments, fire ice is exceedingly difficult to extract. Japan is claiming successful tests using a method that gently depressurises the frozen gas.Tokyo plans to start commercial output of methane hydrates by 2018. At present, Japan imports nearly all its gas \u2013 about 58.6m tonnes of liquified gas annually \u2013 and is heavily dependent on oil imports. In a desperate attempt to secure more oil, for example, Japan recently did a deal with the United Arab Emirates. In exchange for using Japan as a base for Asian oil trading, Japan now has priority to purchase rights to up to 4m barrels of immediately accessible crude.Lucia van Geuns, an energy analyst at the international energy programme of the Clingendael Institute, said: \"Methane hydrates could make Japan energy independent. Japan put a lot of R&D into this project because of course the less energy it imports the better. Whether they can commercialise methane hydrates remains to be seen.\"If it does succeed, and that's very much a long shot, it will have a huge impact \u2013 equivalent to the use of gas shales in the US.\"Japan's trade ministry, which is behind the scheme, has requested a budget of \u00a58.9bn (\u00a3667m) for the drilling to start next spring. The huge budget reflects the difficulties of drilling deep offshore. In Japan, hydrates in the Sea of Kumano are found about 30km offshore in about 100 metres of water and at a depth below the seabed of 200 metres, making it difficult to mine the unstable hydrates.Concerns had been raised that digging for frozen methane would destabilise the methane beds, which contain enough gas worldwide to snuff out most complex life on earth. Methane itself is a greenhouse gas which is 21 times as damaging as carbon dioxide and any leakage from wells could be an environmental problem.Professor Gerald Dickens, of Rice University in Texas,a leading researcher into methane hydrates, thinks accidental releases can be avoided.\"The only potential issue in regards to drilling would be if there is greatly over-pressured gas immediately beneath the gas hydrate. However, there is growing belief and rationale to suggest that this cannot occur in nature. So, as far as drilling there should be no issue.\"Environmentalists, however, are concernedabout the burning of more earth-locked hydrocarbons. Methane may be a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than coal or oil but will still release many tons of CO2. Jogmec acknowledges the problems, admitting mining of methane ice could lead to landslides and the devastation of marine life in the mining areas. \"There are many other technological problems to overcome,\" says the Jogmec website. \"Not least that when you drill you create heat, which turns the frozen methane into gas, which could then leak uncontrollably through the sea to our atmosphere.\"The US, China, Canada and South Korea are among other countries seeking to develop commercially viable extraction technology and each is now exploring the mining of methane hydrates from their own sea beds.\"Some commercial production of methane from methane hydrate could be achieved in the United States before 2025,\" says a US government report on the subject.", "tags": ["Energy industry", "Business", "Energy", "Environment", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan to drill for controversial 'fire ice'"},{"date": "2010-09-24T08:54:49Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japanese prosecutors have released the captain of a Chinese fishing boat, two weeks after a collision in disputed waters sparked a dramatic deterioration in ties between Beijing and Tokyo.Zhan Qixiong was arrested on 8 September, a day after his ship collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the Senkakus, a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both countries.Prosecutors on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, where Zhan was detained, said they would monitor both governments' response to their decision before deciding whether to indict him, but that course of action is looking increasingly unlikely.They said the row caused by Zhan's detention and the possible impact on Japan-China ties had been a factor in their decision.They accepted that Zhan had not intended to damage the Japanese vessels, but said he had been to blame by ignoring repeated requests to leave the area.\"We have decided that further investigation while keeping the captain in custody would not be appropriate, considering the impact on the people of our country as well as Japan-China relations in the future,\" the district's vice-prosecutor, Toru Suzuki, said.The Senkakus, which are controlled by Japan, are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits. Analysts say that underlying the dispute is rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic reasons and for control of the area's natural resources.Japanese officials had earlier warned that the swift deterioration in bilateral ties posed a threat to the economies of both countries.China was Japan's largest trading partner last year and Japan was China's third largest.

The US currency saw its sharpest rise in two years, climbing from a 15-year-low of just under 83 yen to more than 85.5 yen.No other central bank took part in the attempt to hold down the yen, which according to reports in Tokyo involved the central bank selling more than $1bn of yen in three separate bouts of intervention.Chief cabinet secretary Yoshito Sengoku said that the Japanese government took the decision after the yen strengthened to \u00a583 to the dollar, and indicated that it was determined not to allow it to go through the \u00a582 barrier. And Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, said the yen's strength had become a problem \"that could not be overlooked\".On the Tokyo stock market, the fall in the value of the currency had an immediate impact on the share prices of Japan's biggest exporters, with Toyota and Sony rising by around 4%. The Nikkei 225 stock index, which was down before the intervention, closed 217 points higher at 9,516.56 points.But the lack of support from the other leading central banks \u2013 the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss Central Bank \u2013 led some analysts to question whether the action would have any real impact.Billionaire financier George Soros told Reuters that Japan was right to weaken the yen, but currency analysts said authorities would struggle to keep the yen weak, particularly if markets suspect the Federal Reserve decides to pump more money into the US economy this year to prevent a faltering economic recovery from stalling. Weak US manufacturing data today kept alive the possibility that the Fed will extend its quantitative easing programme under which the central banks seeks to boost demand by creating electronic money.China, the US, the euro area and Britain are all trying to secure a bigger share of global markets for their exporters, making them unwilling to take action that would push up the value of their currencies. Washington has been putting pressure on Beijing in recent months to allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate.\"Japan's intervention to weaken the yen is unlikely to make a major difference to the outlook for the currency,\" said Julian Jessop of Capital Economics. \"The key driver of the yen's recent rise has been demand for a safe haven from problems elsewhere, meaning that there may soon be more willing buyers to snap up any yen that the Bank of Japan is ready to sell.'David Bloom, currency analyst at HSBC said: \"The Japanese authorities need to be aggressive now and hit the market hard, fast and furious because as time goes on, the announcement effect will dissipate. The amounts become so large they start to work against international acceptance of this policy. For this to actually work what is needed is global co-operation.\"\"The intervention will only help ease the yen's sudden surge,\" predicted Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan's third-largest bank.Kirby Daley, senior strategist at Newbridge Group, agreed that Japan was unlikely to be able to drag the yen back to the \u00a590 level, and might soon have to defend the \u00a580 that was reached in 1995.\"As always, the ministry of finance has offered traders a fabulous opportunity,\" Daley said, a suggestion that the BoJ may face a protracted battle with speculators.Other analysts pointed out that around \u00a32.6tn of currency is traded on the foreign exchanges each day, questioning whether Japan's intervention would have a major impact.Consumer electronics company Sony said it welcomed the move, and urged the Japanese government to weaken the yen again if needed. \"While we welcome the latest currency intervention by the government and Bank of Japan \u2026 we hope they will continue to closely monitor foreign exchange trends and take appropriate measures,\" the company said.", "tags": ["Yen", "Financial crisis", "Currencies", "Business", "Japan", "Yoshihiko Noda", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan acts to weaken surging yen"},{"date": "2010-08-26T15:49:54Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Director Satoshi Kon sadly passed away on Tuesday, succumbing to pancreatic cancer. He was only 46, and his legacy of work is a mere four completed feature films and one television series. So, it's likely many of you have not heard of the man \u2013 doubly likely since his films were all animated.There has long been an argument regarding the validity of animation as a medium for adults. It's easy for many to dismiss animated film as being automatically for kids or, worse, for teenagers. But for myself and others, animation is just another way of telling a story or getting a message across to an audience. This is why I referred to Satoshi Kon as a \"director\" in the opening paragraph: his films are so involving and cinematic it's easy to forget that they are constructed one frame at a time. What's more, they are definitely not for kids. These days, rather than give unbelievers in the power and potential of animated features the short thrift they clearly deserve, I'll point them in the direction of Kon's slim catalogue. Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers and Paprika are all extremely accomplished films.Like many, I first encountered Kon's work upon the release of his 1998 directorial debut, Perfect Blue. The early 90s had seen a glut of anime releases over here following the success of Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira. I managed to catch most of them on video, enjoying a crash course in a culture and artform offering much that was novel to the western viewer. But precious few were anywhere near Akira's level of achievement, and plenty were simply hideous, so my interest waned. When Perfect Blue came along, I wasn't in any hurry to sit through another hard-to-follow story of ultra-violence and tentacle rape. Concerning a J-pop sensation trying to go solo, it seemed designed to keep audiences away. But the reviews and rumours kept referencing Hitchcock, Lynch and Scorsese. This was clearly not a run-of-the-mill production.Based on a novel, Perfect Blue was allegedly intended as a live-action feature, but with money hard to raise it was downgraded to direct-to-video, then direct-to-video-animation. When Satoshi Kon took the reigns, it was no one's idea of a hit \u2013 which is probably why he was able to get the gig in the first place. But when his vision took hold it was soon headed for theatrical release. Without giving too much away, the film starts off in stylish yet straightforward fashion as pop singer Rumi leaves her successful band to pursue an acting career. Her fans are in uproar; her stalker goes over the edge. As the pressure and trauma mount, Rumi's grip on reality becomes fractured \u2013 and then things start to get really interesting. It was special enough for Darren Aronofsky to secure the rights, and though his live-action remake never got past the starter's gate he did lift two very striking shots for Requiem For A Dream, while the trailer for his forthcoming Black Swan seems to have a little flavour of it, too.Kon's next films surpassed all expectations. It became clear with Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers that he was doing something very different from his peers. The first, which tells the story of a popular film star who withdraws from public life, proved he was a director-aficionado with a deep knowledge and even deeper love of cinema. Chiyoko's narrative is interspersed with memories/clips from her films that blur together \u2013 telling not only her own history but also a potted history of Japanese cinema. The actress was based on Setsuko Hara and Hideko Takamine, muses of the great directors Yasujir\u014d Ozu and Mikio Naruse respectively. Millennium Actress also touched on Kaiju Eiga, the Japanese monster-movie genre. There aren't any other animated films I can think of that assimilate such a range of references.Kon's brief sojourn in the world of television also yielded spectacular results, with the bizarre Paranoia Agent.

It comes days after the corpse of Tokyo's supposed oldest man was found mummified more than 30 years after his unreported death.Officials in the capital's Suginami ward attempted to visit Furuya, who was born in 1897, at an apartment in the city yesterday but were told by her 79-year-old daughter that she had never lived there.The daughter gave them the address of a house in Chiba, outside Tokyo, where Furuya was apparently living with the daughter's estranged younger brother. Officials arrived at the address to find that the building had been demolished to make way for a motorway.Furuya and her daughter were registered as having moved to Tokyo in 1986 but the exact date of the older woman's disappearance remains a mystery. Police are attempting to contact her son to establish her whereabouts.The failure of the city's welfare office to maintain contact with its two oldest residents is an embarrassment for a country that prides itself on looking after its huge population of senior citizens.Tokyo welfare officials said they had not directly contacted the pair for decades, despite having recorded their apparent feats of longevity. The city reportedly learned of the man's death and the woman's disappearance when they began updating records ahead of a national holiday held to show respect for the elderly.It has since emerged that a search is under way for a 106-year-old man in Nagoya, while the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said three more centenarians had vanished.The government said it would establish their whereabouts, and those of an unknown number of other centenarians, as Japan prepares to mark respect-for-the-aged day on 21 September.\"It is important for authorities to grasp the reality of where and how old people are living,\" said the health minister, Akira Nagatsuma.Japan is home to 40,399 centenarians, including 4,800 in Tokyo, according to the health ministry. Each year, those who have turned or are just about to turn 100 receive a congratulatory letter and trophy from the prime minister.The phenomenon of disappearing seniors hit the headlines late last month when police discovered that Sogen Kato, then thought to be Tokyo's oldest man at 111, had long since died.His mummified corpse, dressed in long johns and covered with a blanket, was found 32 years after he retreated to his bedroom, telling his 81-year-old daughter and her 83-year-old husband that he wanted to become \"a living Buddha\".\"He was a very scary man,\" Kyodo News quoted one of Kato's grandchildren as telling police. \"We couldn't open the door. He shut himself in the room without food or water.\"Police arrested several members of the family on suspicion of abandoning a corpse and continuing to withdraw millions of yen in pension payments from his bank account.\"His family must have known he has been dead all these years and acted as if nothing happened,\" said Yutaka Muroi, a Tokyo metropolitan welfare official. \"It's so eerie.\"It is not the first time Japan has been found wanting regarding the welfare of its oldest citizens. After a similar case in 2005, involving a woman who hadn't been seen for 40 years, local governments were urged to update their records and found there were 52 fewer centenarians than previously thought.The job of keeping track of the elderly is likely to become even more difficult.

Surveys suggest Japan has enough methane hydrate for 100 years at the current rate of usage.Lying hundreds of metres below the sea and deeper still below sediments, fire ice is exceedingly difficult to extract. Japan is claiming successful tests using a method that gently depressurises the frozen gas.Tokyo plans to start commercial output of methane hydrates by 2018. At present, Japan imports nearly all its gas \u2013 about 58.6m tonnes of liquified gas annually \u2013 and is heavily dependent on oil imports. In a desperate attempt to secure more oil, for example, Japan recently did a deal with the United Arab Emirates. In exchange for using Japan as a base for Asian oil trading, Japan now has priority to purchase rights to up to 4m barrels of immediately accessible crude.Lucia van Geuns, an energy analyst at the international energy programme of the Clingendael Institute, said: \"Methane hydrates could make Japan energy independent. Japan put a lot of R&D into this project because of course the less energy it imports the better. Whether they can commercialise methane hydrates remains to be seen.\"If it does succeed, and that's very much a long shot, it will have a huge impact \u2013 equivalent to the use of gas shales in the US.\"Japan's trade ministry, which is behind the scheme, has requested a budget of \u00a58.9bn (\u00a3667m) for the drilling to start next spring. The huge budget reflects the difficulties of drilling deep offshore. In Japan, hydrates in the Sea of Kumano are found about 30km offshore in about 100 metres of water and at a depth below the seabed of 200 metres, making it difficult to mine the unstable hydrates.Concerns had been raised that digging for frozen methane would destabilise the methane beds, which contain enough gas worldwide to snuff out most complex life on earth. Methane itself is a greenhouse gas which is 21 times as damaging as carbon dioxide and any leakage from wells could be an environmental problem.Professor Gerald Dickens, of Rice University in Texas,a leading researcher into methane hydrates, thinks accidental releases can be avoided.\"The only potential issue in regards to drilling would be if there is greatly over-pressured gas immediately beneath the gas hydrate. However, there is growing belief and rationale to suggest that this cannot occur in nature. So, as far as drilling there should be no issue.\"Environmentalists, however, are concernedabout the burning of more earth-locked hydrocarbons. Methane may be a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than coal or oil but will still release many tons of CO2. Jogmec acknowledges the problems, admitting mining of methane ice could lead to landslides and the devastation of marine life in the mining areas. \"There are many other technological problems to overcome,\" says the Jogmec website. \"Not least that when you drill you create heat, which turns the frozen methane into gas, which could then leak uncontrollably through the sea to our atmosphere.\"The US, China, Canada and South Korea are among other countries seeking to develop commercially viable extraction technology and each is now exploring the mining of methane hydrates from their own sea beds.\"Some commercial production of methane from methane hydrate could be achieved in the United States before 2025,\" says a US government report on the subject.", "tags": ["Energy industry", "Business", "Energy", "Environment", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan to drill for controversial 'fire ice'"},{"date": "2010-09-24T08:54:49Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japanese prosecutors have released the captain of a Chinese fishing boat, two weeks after a collision in disputed waters sparked a dramatic deterioration in ties between Beijing and Tokyo.Zhan Qixiong was arrested on 8 September, a day after his ship collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the Senkakus, a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both countries.Prosecutors on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, where Zhan was detained, said they would monitor both governments' response to their decision before deciding whether to indict him, but that course of action is looking increasingly unlikely.They said the row caused by Zhan's detention and the possible impact on Japan-China ties had been a factor in their decision.They accepted that Zhan had not intended to damage the Japanese vessels, but said he had been to blame by ignoring repeated requests to leave the area.\"We have decided that further investigation while keeping the captain in custody would not be appropriate, considering the impact on the people of our country as well as Japan-China relations in the future,\" the district's vice-prosecutor, Toru Suzuki, said.The Senkakus, which are controlled by Japan, are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits. Analysts say that underlying the dispute is rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic reasons and for control of the area's natural resources.Japanese officials had earlier warned that the swift deterioration in bilateral ties posed a threat to the economies of both countries.China was Japan's largest trading partner last year and Japan was China's third largest.

The US currency saw its sharpest rise in two years, climbing from a 15-year-low of just under 83 yen to more than 85.5 yen.No other central bank took part in the attempt to hold down the yen, which according to reports in Tokyo involved the central bank selling more than $1bn of yen in three separate bouts of intervention.Chief cabinet secretary Yoshito Sengoku said that the Japanese government took the decision after the yen strengthened to \u00a583 to the dollar, and indicated that it was determined not to allow it to go through the \u00a582 barrier. And Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, said the yen's strength had become a problem \"that could not be overlooked\".On the Tokyo stock market, the fall in the value of the currency had an immediate impact on the share prices of Japan's biggest exporters, with Toyota and Sony rising by around 4%. The Nikkei 225 stock index, which was down before the intervention, closed 217 points higher at 9,516.56 points.But the lack of support from the other leading central banks \u2013 the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss Central Bank \u2013 led some analysts to question whether the action would have any real impact.Billionaire financier George Soros told Reuters that Japan was right to weaken the yen, but currency analysts said authorities would struggle to keep the yen weak, particularly if markets suspect the Federal Reserve decides to pump more money into the US economy this year to prevent a faltering economic recovery from stalling. Weak US manufacturing data today kept alive the possibility that the Fed will extend its quantitative easing programme under which the central banks seeks to boost demand by creating electronic money.China, the US, the euro area and Britain are all trying to secure a bigger share of global markets for their exporters, making them unwilling to take action that would push up the value of their currencies. Washington has been putting pressure on Beijing in recent months to allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate.\"Japan's intervention to weaken the yen is unlikely to make a major difference to the outlook for the currency,\" said Julian Jessop of Capital Economics. \"The key driver of the yen's recent rise has been demand for a safe haven from problems elsewhere, meaning that there may soon be more willing buyers to snap up any yen that the Bank of Japan is ready to sell.'David Bloom, currency analyst at HSBC said: \"The Japanese authorities need to be aggressive now and hit the market hard, fast and furious because as time goes on, the announcement effect will dissipate. The amounts become so large they start to work against international acceptance of this policy. For this to actually work what is needed is global co-operation.\"\"The intervention will only help ease the yen's sudden surge,\" predicted Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan's third-largest bank.Kirby Daley, senior strategist at Newbridge Group, agreed that Japan was unlikely to be able to drag the yen back to the \u00a590 level, and might soon have to defend the \u00a580 that was reached in 1995.\"As always, the ministry of finance has offered traders a fabulous opportunity,\" Daley said, a suggestion that the BoJ may face a protracted battle with speculators.Other analysts pointed out that around \u00a32.6tn of currency is traded on the foreign exchanges each day, questioning whether Japan's intervention would have a major impact.Consumer electronics company Sony said it welcomed the move, and urged the Japanese government to weaken the yen again if needed. \"While we welcome the latest currency intervention by the government and Bank of Japan \u2026 we hope they will continue to closely monitor foreign exchange trends and take appropriate measures,\" the company said.", "tags": ["Yen", "Financial crisis", "Currencies", "Business", "Japan", "Yoshihiko Noda", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan acts to weaken surging yen"},{"date": "2010-08-26T15:49:54Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Director Satoshi Kon sadly passed away on Tuesday, succumbing to pancreatic cancer. He was only 46, and his legacy of work is a mere four completed feature films and one television series. So, it's likely many of you have not heard of the man \u2013 doubly likely since his films were all animated.There has long been an argument regarding the validity of animation as a medium for adults. It's easy for many to dismiss animated film as being automatically for kids or, worse, for teenagers. But for myself and others, animation is just another way of telling a story or getting a message across to an audience. This is why I referred to Satoshi Kon as a \"director\" in the opening paragraph: his films are so involving and cinematic it's easy to forget that they are constructed one frame at a time. What's more, they are definitely not for kids. These days, rather than give unbelievers in the power and potential of animated features the short thrift they clearly deserve, I'll point them in the direction of Kon's slim catalogue. Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers and Paprika are all extremely accomplished films.Like many, I first encountered Kon's work upon the release of his 1998 directorial debut, Perfect Blue. The early 90s had seen a glut of anime releases over here following the success of Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira. I managed to catch most of them on video, enjoying a crash course in a culture and artform offering much that was novel to the western viewer. But precious few were anywhere near Akira's level of achievement, and plenty were simply hideous, so my interest waned. When Perfect Blue came along, I wasn't in any hurry to sit through another hard-to-follow story of ultra-violence and tentacle rape. Concerning a J-pop sensation trying to go solo, it seemed designed to keep audiences away. But the reviews and rumours kept referencing Hitchcock, Lynch and Scorsese. This was clearly not a run-of-the-mill production.Based on a novel, Perfect Blue was allegedly intended as a live-action feature, but with money hard to raise it was downgraded to direct-to-video, then direct-to-video-animation. When Satoshi Kon took the reigns, it was no one's idea of a hit \u2013 which is probably why he was able to get the gig in the first place. But when his vision took hold it was soon headed for theatrical release. Without giving too much away, the film starts off in stylish yet straightforward fashion as pop singer Rumi leaves her successful band to pursue an acting career. Her fans are in uproar; her stalker goes over the edge. As the pressure and trauma mount, Rumi's grip on reality becomes fractured \u2013 and then things start to get really interesting. It was special enough for Darren Aronofsky to secure the rights, and though his live-action remake never got past the starter's gate he did lift two very striking shots for Requiem For A Dream, while the trailer for his forthcoming Black Swan seems to have a little flavour of it, too.Kon's next films surpassed all expectations. It became clear with Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers that he was doing something very different from his peers. The first, which tells the story of a popular film star who withdraws from public life, proved he was a director-aficionado with a deep knowledge and even deeper love of cinema. Chiyoko's narrative is interspersed with memories/clips from her films that blur together \u2013 telling not only her own history but also a potted history of Japanese cinema. The actress was based on Setsuko Hara and Hideko Takamine, muses of the great directors Yasujir\u014d Ozu and Mikio Naruse respectively. Millennium Actress also touched on Kaiju Eiga, the Japanese monster-movie genre. There aren't any other animated films I can think of that assimilate such a range of references.Kon's brief sojourn in the world of television also yielded spectacular results, with the bizarre Paranoia Agent. This series, again best approached with as little foreknowledge as possible, starts with a designer of cutesy characters trying to come up with a new creation to match the popularity of her iconic pink dog, Maromi, as a series of seemingly random people are brutally attacked by a kid wielding a golden baseball bat. Reality is not to be trusted and the oft-employed comparisons to the work of David Lynch are not too wide of the mark.For me, his finest work was his last: Paprika. Again it's completely unfair to condense it into a brief synopsis, but it deals with a machine that can place an avatar into another person's dreams. I wasn't the only one to notice, when the first trailer from Christopher Nolan's Inception hit, that it looks a bit like the 2006 animation \u2013 though I wouldn't call it a rip-off, there are enough similarities to suggest he has at least seen it. For my money, Kon's is the better film \u2013 the Japanese director really wasn't afraid to \"dream a little bigger\" . Paprika is more spectacular, imaginative, fun and emotional than Nolan's hit. Now, there's a live action version with director Wolfgang Peterson mooted.Satoshi Kon left us with one final film, The Dream Machine, still in production. Little is known about this project other than that it concerns robots and is aimed at younger viewers \u2013 though we know how little that really means. Beside my sympathy for his family and friends, Kon's death did shock and sadden me on a personal level because in him I had found a director who didn't disappoint, one I could trust wholeheartedly \u2013 which is incredibly rare. To speak selfishly, I feel sadness that I will never see him complete a new film. Here was a director I felt I could depend on to reaffirm my faith in cinema \u2013 a faith that gets a good battering almost daily as I sit through films that do little more than waste my time. But Kon's films are ones I foresee myself returning to many times in the future.And as for those children, the supposed target audience for his animations? Well, they have plenty of time to grow into them.", "tags": ["Animation", "Film", "Culture", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Anime"], "title": "Japan mourns anime master Satoshi Kon"},{"date": "2010-08-11T17:00:12Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has been getting a raw deal from the so-called economic experts. Consider this: in the midst of the great recession, the United States is suffering through nearly 10% unemployment, rising inequality and poverty, 47 million people without health insurance, declining retirement prospects for the middle class and a general increase in economic insecurity. Various European nations also are having their difficulties, and no one knows if China is the next bubble due to explode.How, then, should we regard a country that has 5% unemployment, the lowest income inequality, healthcare for all its people and is one of the world's leading exporters? This country also scores high on life expectancy, low on infant mortality, is at the top in numeracy and literacy, and is low on crime, incarceration, homicides, mental illness and drug abuse. It also has a low rate of carbon emissions, doing its part to reduce global warming. In all these categories, this particular country beats both the US and China by a country mile.Doesn't that sound like a country from which Americans and others might learn a thing or two about how to get out of the hole in which we're stuck?Not if that place is Japan. During and before the current economic crisis, few countries have been vilified as an economic basket case so much as Japan: it's been hard to find any reference to the country without some mention of its allegedly sclerotic economy, its zombie banks, its deflation and slow economic growth. This malaise has even been called \"Japan syndrome\", sounding like a disease to warn policymakers, as in \"you don't want to end up like Japan.\"No one has been more influential in defining this narrative than Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman. Throughout the 1990s, and still today, Krugman has skewered Japan's economy and leaders. In the late 1990s, Krugman wrote a series of gloom-and-doom articles, complete with equations and titles like \"Japan's Trap\" and \"Setting Sun\", bluntly stating:But let's look at some of the Japanese metrics during that time. Throughout the 1990s, the Japanese unemployment rate was \u2013 ready for this? \u2013 about 3%, half the US unemployment rate at the time. During that allegedly \"lost decade\", Japan also had universal healthcare, less inequality, the highest life expectancy, low infant mortality and low rates of crime and incarceration. Americans should be so lucky as to experience a Japanese-style lost decade.Reopening the case of Japan raises some important questions. How do economists such as Krugman decide what to value and prioritise, or what to measure? What is an economy for? To produce the prosperity, security and services that people need? Or to satisfy economists and their equations, theories and models?In the current debate over fiscal stimulus versus deficit reduction for economic recovery, various economists now are criticising Germany. Krugman has written that the Germans \"seem to be getting their talking points from the collected speeches of Herbert Hoover\". Krugman, a stimulus hawk, is criticising Germany for the same thing for which he has criticised Japan \u2013 not spending, or consuming, enough to stimulate its economy.Yet, in the early 1990s, when the US was plagued by large deficits and recession, the Clinton administration didn't employ Krugman-type fiscal stimulus. Instead, it cut the deficit. By the end of the decade, the US budget showed a sizable surplus and the economy was booming.Japan's economy has been and remains successful. So is Germany's. They have reached an economic steady state in which they don't need roaring growth rates to provide for their people. But for the economic Cassandras, apparently, it doesn't matter if people's needs are being met; what matters is whether their theories and equations balance.Unfortunately, there is a common sense aspect to this that gets lost amid the rhetoric. Two lessons of our times are that economic bubbles eventually burst, and that the environmental consequences of unbridled growth in this age of global warming are severe. In other words, the real game is no longer strictly about economic growth; it's about sustainability and learning to do more with less. The era of US-style trickle-down economies is over for wealthy countries because trickle-down is neither economically sound nor ecologically sustainable. The developed nations must lead the way towards a different path of development.This is not an easy challenge, yet it is the course that Japan and Germany have chosen. Americans would be wise to learn from them. If the US didn't have such a trickle-down economy that has produced so much inequality \u2013 if it was, in fact, better at sharing its wealth \u2013 perhaps it wouldn't need so much fiscal stimulus and growth.", "tags": ["Japan", "US economy", "US economic growth and recession", "US unemployment and employment data", "Economics", "Business", "Germany", "US news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "The economic fallacy of 'zombie' Japan | Steven Hill"},{"date": "2010-08-15T19:57:20Z", "country": "japan", "content": "On the command of \"march\", survivors of the second world war's far east campaign moved forward in their wheelchairs today and past the Cenotaph during a service to mark the 65th anniversary of victory over Japan.The ever diminishing number of veterans of a conflict that took the lives of 30,000 British service personnel, including 12,500 in prisoner of war camps, saw Prince Charles and David Cameron lay wreaths at the Whitehall war memorial to \"the glorious dead\", alongside the head of the army, General Sir David Richards.The Fourteenth Army, known as \"the forgotten army\", which fought back against the Japanese in India and then Burma, was the largest ever assembled by the British Empire and Commonwealth numbering more than half a million men, 340,000 of whom were from India, 100,000 from Britain and 119,000 from the east and west African colonies.In warm sunshine, four buglers sounded the last post and Viscount John Slim, the son of General William Slim, commander of the Commonwealth and Empire forces, read the Kohima Epitaph, written following the battle of Kohima near the border of Burma where 4,000 British troops and almost 6,000 Japanese troops died: \"When you go home, tell them of us and say, for your tomorrow, we gave our today.\"Prince Charles saluted and Cameron stood head bowed in front of a rank of veterans bearing standards, including that of the Burma Star Association, which represents veterans of the war against Japan.

Surveys suggest Japan has enough methane hydrate for 100 years at the current rate of usage.Lying hundreds of metres below the sea and deeper still below sediments, fire ice is exceedingly difficult to extract. Japan is claiming successful tests using a method that gently depressurises the frozen gas.Tokyo plans to start commercial output of methane hydrates by 2018. At present, Japan imports nearly all its gas \u2013 about 58.6m tonnes of liquified gas annually \u2013 and is heavily dependent on oil imports. In a desperate attempt to secure more oil, for example, Japan recently did a deal with the United Arab Emirates. In exchange for using Japan as a base for Asian oil trading, Japan now has priority to purchase rights to up to 4m barrels of immediately accessible crude.Lucia van Geuns, an energy analyst at the international energy programme of the Clingendael Institute, said: \"Methane hydrates could make Japan energy independent. Japan put a lot of R&D into this project because of course the less energy it imports the better. Whether they can commercialise methane hydrates remains to be seen.\"If it does succeed, and that's very much a long shot, it will have a huge impact \u2013 equivalent to the use of gas shales in the US.\"Japan's trade ministry, which is behind the scheme, has requested a budget of \u00a58.9bn (\u00a3667m) for the drilling to start next spring. The huge budget reflects the difficulties of drilling deep offshore. In Japan, hydrates in the Sea of Kumano are found about 30km offshore in about 100 metres of water and at a depth below the seabed of 200 metres, making it difficult to mine the unstable hydrates.Concerns had been raised that digging for frozen methane would destabilise the methane beds, which contain enough gas worldwide to snuff out most complex life on earth. Methane itself is a greenhouse gas which is 21 times as damaging as carbon dioxide and any leakage from wells could be an environmental problem.Professor Gerald Dickens, of Rice University in Texas,a leading researcher into methane hydrates, thinks accidental releases can be avoided.\"The only potential issue in regards to drilling would be if there is greatly over-pressured gas immediately beneath the gas hydrate. However, there is growing belief and rationale to suggest that this cannot occur in nature. So, as far as drilling there should be no issue.\"Environmentalists, however, are concernedabout the burning of more earth-locked hydrocarbons. Methane may be a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than coal or oil but will still release many tons of CO2. Jogmec acknowledges the problems, admitting mining of methane ice could lead to landslides and the devastation of marine life in the mining areas. \"There are many other technological problems to overcome,\" says the Jogmec website. \"Not least that when you drill you create heat, which turns the frozen methane into gas, which could then leak uncontrollably through the sea to our atmosphere.\"The US, China, Canada and South Korea are among other countries seeking to develop commercially viable extraction technology and each is now exploring the mining of methane hydrates from their own sea beds.\"Some commercial production of methane from methane hydrate could be achieved in the United States before 2025,\" says a US government report on the subject.", "tags": ["Energy industry", "Business", "Energy", "Environment", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan to drill for controversial 'fire ice'"},{"date": "2010-09-24T08:54:49Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japanese prosecutors have released the captain of a Chinese fishing boat, two weeks after a collision in disputed waters sparked a dramatic deterioration in ties between Beijing and Tokyo.Zhan Qixiong was arrested on 8 September, a day after his ship collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the Senkakus, a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both countries.Prosecutors on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa, where Zhan was detained, said they would monitor both governments' response to their decision before deciding whether to indict him, but that course of action is looking increasingly unlikely.They said the row caused by Zhan's detention and the possible impact on Japan-China ties had been a factor in their decision.They accepted that Zhan had not intended to damage the Japanese vessels, but said he had been to blame by ignoring repeated requests to leave the area.\"We have decided that further investigation while keeping the captain in custody would not be appropriate, considering the impact on the people of our country as well as Japan-China relations in the future,\" the district's vice-prosecutor, Toru Suzuki, said.The Senkakus, which are controlled by Japan, are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits. Analysts say that underlying the dispute is rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic reasons and for control of the area's natural resources.Japanese officials had earlier warned that the swift deterioration in bilateral ties posed a threat to the economies of both countries.China was Japan's largest trading partner last year and Japan was China's third largest.

The US currency saw its sharpest rise in two years, climbing from a 15-year-low of just under 83 yen to more than 85.5 yen.No other central bank took part in the attempt to hold down the yen, which according to reports in Tokyo involved the central bank selling more than $1bn of yen in three separate bouts of intervention.Chief cabinet secretary Yoshito Sengoku said that the Japanese government took the decision after the yen strengthened to \u00a583 to the dollar, and indicated that it was determined not to allow it to go through the \u00a582 barrier. And Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, said the yen's strength had become a problem \"that could not be overlooked\".On the Tokyo stock market, the fall in the value of the currency had an immediate impact on the share prices of Japan's biggest exporters, with Toyota and Sony rising by around 4%. The Nikkei 225 stock index, which was down before the intervention, closed 217 points higher at 9,516.56 points.But the lack of support from the other leading central banks \u2013 the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss Central Bank \u2013 led some analysts to question whether the action would have any real impact.Billionaire financier George Soros told Reuters that Japan was right to weaken the yen, but currency analysts said authorities would struggle to keep the yen weak, particularly if markets suspect the Federal Reserve decides to pump more money into the US economy this year to prevent a faltering economic recovery from stalling. Weak US manufacturing data today kept alive the possibility that the Fed will extend its quantitative easing programme under which the central banks seeks to boost demand by creating electronic money.China, the US, the euro area and Britain are all trying to secure a bigger share of global markets for their exporters, making them unwilling to take action that would push up the value of their currencies. Washington has been putting pressure on Beijing in recent months to allow its currency, the renminbi, to appreciate.\"Japan's intervention to weaken the yen is unlikely to make a major difference to the outlook for the currency,\" said Julian Jessop of Capital Economics. \"The key driver of the yen's recent rise has been demand for a safe haven from problems elsewhere, meaning that there may soon be more willing buyers to snap up any yen that the Bank of Japan is ready to sell.'David Bloom, currency analyst at HSBC said: \"The Japanese authorities need to be aggressive now and hit the market hard, fast and furious because as time goes on, the announcement effect will dissipate. The amounts become so large they start to work against international acceptance of this policy. For this to actually work what is needed is global co-operation.\"\"The intervention will only help ease the yen's sudden surge,\" predicted Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan's third-largest bank.Kirby Daley, senior strategist at Newbridge Group, agreed that Japan was unlikely to be able to drag the yen back to the \u00a590 level, and might soon have to defend the \u00a580 that was reached in 1995.\"As always, the ministry of finance has offered traders a fabulous opportunity,\" Daley said, a suggestion that the BoJ may face a protracted battle with speculators.Other analysts pointed out that around \u00a32.6tn of currency is traded on the foreign exchanges each day, questioning whether Japan's intervention would have a major impact.Consumer electronics company Sony said it welcomed the move, and urged the Japanese government to weaken the yen again if needed. \"While we welcome the latest currency intervention by the government and Bank of Japan \u2026 we hope they will continue to closely monitor foreign exchange trends and take appropriate measures,\" the company said.", "tags": ["Yen", "Financial crisis", "Currencies", "Business", "Japan", "Yoshihiko Noda", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan acts to weaken surging yen"},{"date": "2010-08-26T15:49:54Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Director Satoshi Kon sadly passed away on Tuesday, succumbing to pancreatic cancer. He was only 46, and his legacy of work is a mere four completed feature films and one television series. So, it's likely many of you have not heard of the man \u2013 doubly likely since his films were all animated.There has long been an argument regarding the validity of animation as a medium for adults. It's easy for many to dismiss animated film as being automatically for kids or, worse, for teenagers. But for myself and others, animation is just another way of telling a story or getting a message across to an audience. This is why I referred to Satoshi Kon as a \"director\" in the opening paragraph: his films are so involving and cinematic it's easy to forget that they are constructed one frame at a time. What's more, they are definitely not for kids. These days, rather than give unbelievers in the power and potential of animated features the short thrift they clearly deserve, I'll point them in the direction of Kon's slim catalogue. Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers and Paprika are all extremely accomplished films.Like many, I first encountered Kon's work upon the release of his 1998 directorial debut, Perfect Blue. The early 90s had seen a glut of anime releases over here following the success of Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira. I managed to catch most of them on video, enjoying a crash course in a culture and artform offering much that was novel to the western viewer. But precious few were anywhere near Akira's level of achievement, and plenty were simply hideous, so my interest waned. When Perfect Blue came along, I wasn't in any hurry to sit through another hard-to-follow story of ultra-violence and tentacle rape. Concerning a J-pop sensation trying to go solo, it seemed designed to keep audiences away. But the reviews and rumours kept referencing Hitchcock, Lynch and Scorsese. This was clearly not a run-of-the-mill production.Based on a novel, Perfect Blue was allegedly intended as a live-action feature, but with money hard to raise it was downgraded to direct-to-video, then direct-to-video-animation. When Satoshi Kon took the reigns, it was no one's idea of a hit \u2013 which is probably why he was able to get the gig in the first place. But when his vision took hold it was soon headed for theatrical release. Without giving too much away, the film starts off in stylish yet straightforward fashion as pop singer Rumi leaves her successful band to pursue an acting career. Her fans are in uproar; her stalker goes over the edge. As the pressure and trauma mount, Rumi's grip on reality becomes fractured \u2013 and then things start to get really interesting. It was special enough for Darren Aronofsky to secure the rights, and though his live-action remake never got past the starter's gate he did lift two very striking shots for Requiem For A Dream, while the trailer for his forthcoming Black Swan seems to have a little flavour of it, too.Kon's next films surpassed all expectations. It became clear with Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers that he was doing something very different from his peers. The first, which tells the story of a popular film star who withdraws from public life, proved he was a director-aficionado with a deep knowledge and even deeper love of cinema. Chiyoko's narrative is interspersed with memories/clips from her films that blur together \u2013 telling not only her own history but also a potted history of Japanese cinema. The actress was based on Setsuko Hara and Hideko Takamine, muses of the great directors Yasujir\u014d Ozu and Mikio Naruse respectively. Millennium Actress also touched on Kaiju Eiga, the Japanese monster-movie genre. There aren't any other animated films I can think of that assimilate such a range of references.Kon's brief sojourn in the world of television also yielded spectacular results, with the bizarre Paranoia Agent. This series, again best approached with as little foreknowledge as possible, starts with a designer of cutesy characters trying to come up with a new creation to match the popularity of her iconic pink dog, Maromi, as a series of seemingly random people are brutally attacked by a kid wielding a golden baseball bat. Reality is not to be trusted and the oft-employed comparisons to the work of David Lynch are not too wide of the mark.For me, his finest work was his last: Paprika. Again it's completely unfair to condense it into a brief synopsis, but it deals with a machine that can place an avatar into another person's dreams. I wasn't the only one to notice, when the first trailer from Christopher Nolan's Inception hit, that it looks a bit like the 2006 animation \u2013 though I wouldn't call it a rip-off, there are enough similarities to suggest he has at least seen it. For my money, Kon's is the better film \u2013 the Japanese director really wasn't afraid to \"dream a little bigger\" . Paprika is more spectacular, imaginative, fun and emotional than Nolan's hit. Now, there's a live action version with director Wolfgang Peterson mooted.Satoshi Kon left us with one final film, The Dream Machine, still in production. Little is known about this project other than that it concerns robots and is aimed at younger viewers \u2013 though we know how little that really means. Beside my sympathy for his family and friends, Kon's death did shock and sadden me on a personal level because in him I had found a director who didn't disappoint, one I could trust wholeheartedly \u2013 which is incredibly rare. To speak selfishly, I feel sadness that I will never see him complete a new film. Here was a director I felt I could depend on to reaffirm my faith in cinema \u2013 a faith that gets a good battering almost daily as I sit through films that do little more than waste my time. But Kon's films are ones I foresee myself returning to many times in the future.And as for those children, the supposed target audience for his animations? Well, they have plenty of time to grow into them.", "tags": ["Animation", "Film", "Culture", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Anime"], "title": "Japan mourns anime master Satoshi Kon"},{"date": "2010-08-11T17:00:12Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has been getting a raw deal from the so-called economic experts. Consider this: in the midst of the great recession, the United States is suffering through nearly 10% unemployment, rising inequality and poverty, 47 million people without health insurance, declining retirement prospects for the middle class and a general increase in economic insecurity. Various European nations also are having their difficulties, and no one knows if China is the next bubble due to explode.How, then, should we regard a country that has 5% unemployment, the lowest income inequality, healthcare for all its people and is one of the world's leading exporters? This country also scores high on life expectancy, low on infant mortality, is at the top in numeracy and literacy, and is low on crime, incarceration, homicides, mental illness and drug abuse. It also has a low rate of carbon emissions, doing its part to reduce global warming. In all these categories, this particular country beats both the US and China by a country mile.Doesn't that sound like a country from which Americans and others might learn a thing or two about how to get out of the hole in which we're stuck?Not if that place is Japan. During and before the current economic crisis, few countries have been vilified as an economic basket case so much as Japan: it's been hard to find any reference to the country without some mention of its allegedly sclerotic economy, its zombie banks, its deflation and slow economic growth. This malaise has even been called \"Japan syndrome\", sounding like a disease to warn policymakers, as in \"you don't want to end up like Japan.\"No one has been more influential in defining this narrative than Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman. Throughout the 1990s, and still today, Krugman has skewered Japan's economy and leaders. In the late 1990s, Krugman wrote a series of gloom-and-doom articles, complete with equations and titles like \"Japan's Trap\" and \"Setting Sun\", bluntly stating:But let's look at some of the Japanese metrics during that time. Throughout the 1990s, the Japanese unemployment rate was \u2013 ready for this? \u2013 about 3%, half the US unemployment rate at the time. During that allegedly \"lost decade\", Japan also had universal healthcare, less inequality, the highest life expectancy, low infant mortality and low rates of crime and incarceration. Americans should be so lucky as to experience a Japanese-style lost decade.Reopening the case of Japan raises some important questions. How do economists such as Krugman decide what to value and prioritise, or what to measure? What is an economy for? To produce the prosperity, security and services that people need? Or to satisfy economists and their equations, theories and models?In the current debate over fiscal stimulus versus deficit reduction for economic recovery, various economists now are criticising Germany. Krugman has written that the Germans \"seem to be getting their talking points from the collected speeches of Herbert Hoover\". Krugman, a stimulus hawk, is criticising Germany for the same thing for which he has criticised Japan \u2013 not spending, or consuming, enough to stimulate its economy.Yet, in the early 1990s, when the US was plagued by large deficits and recession, the Clinton administration didn't employ Krugman-type fiscal stimulus. Instead, it cut the deficit. By the end of the decade, the US budget showed a sizable surplus and the economy was booming.Japan's economy has been and remains successful. So is Germany's. They have reached an economic steady state in which they don't need roaring growth rates to provide for their people. But for the economic Cassandras, apparently, it doesn't matter if people's needs are being met; what matters is whether their theories and equations balance.Unfortunately, there is a common sense aspect to this that gets lost amid the rhetoric. Two lessons of our times are that economic bubbles eventually burst, and that the environmental consequences of unbridled growth in this age of global warming are severe. In other words, the real game is no longer strictly about economic growth; it's about sustainability and learning to do more with less. The era of US-style trickle-down economies is over for wealthy countries because trickle-down is neither economically sound nor ecologically sustainable. The developed nations must lead the way towards a different path of development.This is not an easy challenge, yet it is the course that Japan and Germany have chosen. Americans would be wise to learn from them. If the US didn't have such a trickle-down economy that has produced so much inequality \u2013 if it was, in fact, better at sharing its wealth \u2013 perhaps it wouldn't need so much fiscal stimulus and growth.", "tags": ["Japan", "US economy", "US economic growth and recession", "US unemployment and employment data", "Economics", "Business", "Germany", "US news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "The economic fallacy of 'zombie' Japan | Steven Hill"},{"date": "2010-08-15T19:57:20Z", "country": "japan", "content": "On the command of \"march\", survivors of the second world war's far east campaign moved forward in their wheelchairs today and past the Cenotaph during a service to mark the 65th anniversary of victory over Japan.The ever diminishing number of veterans of a conflict that took the lives of 30,000 British service personnel, including 12,500 in prisoner of war camps, saw Prince Charles and David Cameron lay wreaths at the Whitehall war memorial to \"the glorious dead\", alongside the head of the army, General Sir David Richards.The Fourteenth Army, known as \"the forgotten army\", which fought back against the Japanese in India and then Burma, was the largest ever assembled by the British Empire and Commonwealth numbering more than half a million men, 340,000 of whom were from India, 100,000 from Britain and 119,000 from the east and west African colonies.In warm sunshine, four buglers sounded the last post and Viscount John Slim, the son of General William Slim, commander of the Commonwealth and Empire forces, read the Kohima Epitaph, written following the battle of Kohima near the border of Burma where 4,000 British troops and almost 6,000 Japanese troops died: \"When you go home, tell them of us and say, for your tomorrow, we gave our today.\"Prince Charles saluted and Cameron stood head bowed in front of a rank of veterans bearing standards, including that of the Burma Star Association, which represents veterans of the war against Japan.

It comes days after the corpse of Tokyo's supposed oldest man was found mummified more than 30 years after his unreported death.Officials in the capital's Suginami ward attempted to visit Furuya, who was born in 1897, at an apartment in the city yesterday but were told by her 79-year-old daughter that she had never lived there.The daughter gave them the address of a house in Chiba, outside Tokyo, where Furuya was apparently living with the daughter's estranged younger brother.

Police are attempting to contact her son to establish her whereabouts.The failure of the city's welfare office to maintain contact with its two oldest residents is an embarrassment for a country that prides itself on looking after its huge population of senior citizens.Tokyo welfare officials said they had not directly contacted the pair for decades, despite having recorded their apparent feats of longevity. The city reportedly learned of the man's death and the woman's disappearance when they began updating records ahead of a national holiday held to show respect for the elderly.It has since emerged that a search is under way for a 106-year-old man in Nagoya, while the Asahi Shimbun newspaper said three more centenarians had vanished.The government said it would establish their whereabouts, and those of an unknown number of other centenarians, as Japan prepares to mark respect-for-the-aged day on 21 September.\"It is important for authorities to grasp the reality of where and how old people are living,\" said the health minister, Akira Nagatsuma.Japan is home to 40,399 centenarians, including 4,800 in Tokyo, according to the health ministry.

He shut himself in the room without food or water.\"Police arrested several members of the family on suspicion of abandoning a corpse and continuing to withdraw millions of yen in pension payments from his bank account.\"His family must have known he has been dead all these years and acted as if nothing happened,\" said Yutaka Muroi, a Tokyo metropolitan welfare official. \"It's so eerie.\"It is not the first time Japan has been found wanting regarding the welfare of its oldest citizens. After a similar case in 2005, involving a woman who hadn't been seen for 40 years, local governments were urged to update their records and found there were 52 fewer centenarians than previously thought.The job of keeping track of the elderly is likely to become even more difficult. Japanese women have enjoyed the world's longest life expectancy \u2013 now a record 86.4 years \u2013 for the last quarter of a century, while men can expect to live 79.5 years.Welfare officials complain that they do not have the authority to forcibly inspect the homes of centenarians if other members of their family object.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Ageing", "Older people", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan launches nationwide search for centenarians"},{"date": "2010-07-09T23:02:15Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I think I might have to move to Japan.

The recall will begin in other markets shortly.Seven models of Toyota's luxury Lexus range are involved in the recall, along with its Crown model. The car manufacturer has stressed that it is not aware of any crashes having been caused by the fault, although it has received 220 complaints.But the recall, costing an estimated \u00a520bn (\u00a3150m), follows a series of safety problems that have dogged the Japanese car giant for the last 18 months.The firm has recalled millions of cars for reasons from the relatively minor \u2013 involving faulty window switches \u2013 to the potentially very dangerous \u2013 such as faulty accelerator pedals. Just last week it recalled 17,000 Lexus hybrid motors after testing showed fuel can spill during a rear-end crash.In September last year the firm announced the biggest recall in its history over fears, involving almost 4m vehicles in the US, that accelerator pedals could become trapped in floormats and \"may result in very high vehicle speeds and make it difficult to stop the vehicle, which could cause a crash, serious injury or death\". Five months later it recalled around 2.3m vehicles in the US to fix potentially faulty accelerator pedals.In April, Toyota was fined a record $16.4m (\u00a311m) by the US transport department for its tardiness in responding to the crisis. Announcing the settlement, US transport secretary Ray LaHood said that \"by failing to report known safety problems as it is required to do under the law, Toyota put consumers at risk\".The Lexus models involved in the current recall are the LS460, LS600h, LS600hL, GS350, GS450h, GS460 and IS350.", "tags": ["Toyota", "Japan", "Business", "World news", "Lexus"], "title": "Toyota starts Lexus recall in Japan"},{"date": "2010-11-18T15:39:10Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The arrest today of the de facto leader of Japan's most powerful underworld organisation has sparked fears of a violent internal power struggle, as police step up their crackdown on organised crime.Kiyoshi Takayama, the second-in-command of the Yamaguchi-gumi, is being held on suspicion of extorting about \u00a540m (\u00a3300,000) from a man involved in the construction industry.The national police agency declared war on the Yamaguchi-gumi in September in an attempt to rein it in before the release of its leader, Kenichi Shinoda, from prison next spring.Shinoda began a six-year prison sentence in December 2005 for violating gun control laws and entrusted the running of the Yamaguchi-gumi to Takayama, who is also head of the organisation's biggest and most violent faction, the Kodo-kai.\"If Takayama is successfully prosecuted it will be devastating for the Yamaguchi-gumi, and could even spark a war for control of the organisation,\" said Jake Adelstein, author of Tokyo Vice: an American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan.\"He has been running the organisation with an iron fist, and other factions will see his arrest as an opportunity.

His antagonism towards the police has angered some in the organisation. He is not a popular man.\"Takayama, 63, did not resist arrest during a dawn police raid involving 140 officers at a Kodo-kai base in the western city of Kobe. He has, however, denied involvement in the extortion case, according to Japanese media.Although he was not present at meetings with the alleged extortion victim, police believe they can build a case against him using a law that holds gang leaders responsible for crimes committed by their juniors.When Shinoda was sworn in as the Yamaguchi-gumi's sixth don in July 2005, he vowed to expand the 95-year-old organisation's influence beyond its traditional Kobe base.Until recently Japan's crime syndicates, which are not illegal, operated with relative impunity. Gangsters made no attempt to hide their underworld affiliations and listed their offices in the phone book.But Takayama's arrest has heightened fears of a dramatic deterioration in relations with the police.Takaharu Ando, the combative head of the national police agency, has vowed to destroy the Yamaguchi-gumi as part of an unprecedented crackdown on organised crime. \"We want them to disappear from public life,\" he told reporters after his appointment last year.Aside from gambling, loan sharking, protection rackets and prostitution, the yakuza have added stock market manipulation and front companies to their myriad illegal activities.Takayama was influential in the Yamaguchi-gumi's expansion into Tokyo, an audacious move that led to several shootings in the capital in 2007.The Kodo-kai faction, thought to have about 4,000 members, has dispensed with the yakuza's traditional policy of co-operating with the police. Its members have followed officers to their homes, photographed them with members of their families, and attempted to unearth information that could be used to blackmail them.In other major departures from yakuza tradition, they never confess to their crimes and have been accused of targeting civilians.There were about 87,000 gangsters active in Japan at the end of 2005, according to the national police agency. An estimated 50,000 belong to the Yamaguchi-gumi, which has recently attracted mobsters from smaller gangs targeted by rigorous police investigations.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Organised crime", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Yakuza chief arrested in Japan"},{"date": "2010-12-14T14:01:41Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The past year has underlined how Japan's future is inextricably linked with that of China and, by extension, why it may have to stop thinking of itself as an economic superpower. As Japan staggered through one of the hottest summers in recent memory, confirmation arrived that China had replaced it as the world's second-biggest economy, after the US.The Japanese reaction ranged from studied insouciance \u2013 it wasn't as if it hadn't been warned \u2013 to resignation and anger. Some questioned the validity of GDP figures as a reliable indicator, pointing out the vast differences in per capita income between the two countries.Conservative commentators, meanwhile, issued an increasingly hollow-sounding exhortation: that in the Asian context at least, Japan should never be comfortable with second place.But with some economists expecting Japan to give way to several other countries, including the likes of Indonesia and Turkey, by the middle of the century, the icy blast of economic realism from its neighbour has left the Japanese approaching 2011 in contemplative mood.After 20 years of stagnation, a decade of battles with deflation, and the dual spectres of a shrinking workforce and rising elderly population, some are suggesting that Japan should lower its expectations and embrace a future of frugality and sustainability.And, in recognising that the ceaseless quest for growth may not be at the heart of a nation's wellbeing, Japan could offer lessons for other developed economies as they scramble to avoid their own versions of the \"lost decade\".Shikataganai, an oft-heard expression here, is a verbal shrug emitted when hopes are dashed by the supremacy of external forces \u2013 and that Japan is at the cusp of a transition from economic miracle worker to a less obtrusive participant in global capitalism has a feel of inevitability to it.Few people believe the current members of the political class that authored Japan's postwar transformation have the wherewithal to conjure yet another miracle. Nor, despite the best intentions of the left-of-centre government, do they appear to believe their future lies in recalibrating foreign policy away from the US and towards the rest of Asia.On the contrary, relations with China will remain Janus-faced for the foreseeable future. Japan views China as an economic and military rival, but also as a site for its manufacturing plants and, thanks to the rise of a Chinese middle class, a crucial market for the cars and electronics it produces.While conservatives fret over the pace of China's economic development, and the size of its defence budget, a new voice is emerging: one that asks why a country that spent 250 years in sakoku isolation \u2013 a period that saw little economic growth \u2013 cannot beat a retreat into a modified version of the past.It isn't hard to see why such a radical rethink of Japan's economic raison d'etre should at least be debated. The Nikkei stock index is only at about a quarter of its all-time high of 1989; real estate is worth about a quarter of what it was in 1974. While Japan's (reformed) banks dodged the worst of the Lehman shock, the country is displaying the symptoms of a malaise it once dismissed as a western disease: unemployment, the emergence of the \"working poor\", a widening income gap, and the ignominious spectacle of a corporate icon, Toyota, called to account for shoddy workmanship in the committee rooms of the US Congress.It is easy to overstate Japan's sense of disquiet, but even optimists accept that the certainties of the postwar period are creaking under the strain of economic realities. Graduates are no longer guaranteed lifetime employment with major companies and, even if they were, fewer are willing to submit to the work ethic expected of their baby-boomer fathers.The previous generation endured commutes on packed trains, long working hours, few holidays and a cramped existence in the soulless suburbs. Employers' expectations have changed little, but the old quid pro quo \u2013 that workers will see their standard of living improve \u2013 no longer applies.While the postwar generation worked at a time of population growth and rising wages, the young workers of today have only ever known weak consumption, falling prices and contraction.Japan's skewed demographics will only lend weight to the view that its people will have to recalibrate their expectations. Government figures estimate that the population, now at 127 million, could fall by about 40 million by 2050, when almost 40% of the population will be aged 65 or older.Japan depends heavily on Middle East oil and imports around 50% of its food, but its comparatively homogeneous society has never shown much enthusiasm for similarly impressive influxes of foreign labour, despite warnings that it will need to accept 10 million immigrant workers over the next half -century to keep its economy ticking over.There is little sign now, however, soon after Japan's parliament approved yet another stimulus package, that policy-makers are about to accept the case for sustainability over growth.Two decades ago, a group of economists predicted that 2010 would be the year that Japan finally overtook the US as the world's biggest economy.

Despite conducting two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, North Korea has yet to prove that it had produced a viable weapon.\"These developments \u2026 are a clear manifestation of the risks posed by North Korea's defiance of its international obligations and commitments,\" the US envoy Glyn Davies told a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in Vienna.IAEA officials believe Pyongyang's enrichment activities had begun before April last year, when the UN body's inspectors were last permitted to visit the country.\"If so, there is a clear likelihood that [it] has built other uranium enrichment-related facilities in its territory,\" Davies said.The IAEA's director-general, Yukiya Amano, voiced \"great concern\" over the reports, and called on Pyongyang to allow inspectors to return to verify the claims.Japan, the US and South Korea have rejected Chinese calls for an emergency meeting of countries involved in multilateral talks to end North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.Instead, the three countries will meet in Washington on Monday to discuss a unified response to the attack and the revelations about Pyongyang's nuclear programme.China said it would keep a \"close watch\" on the meeting. \"As the situation on the Korean peninsula is highly complicated and sensitive, we expect the meeting to ease tensions and promote dialogue, rather then heighten tensions and intensify confrontation,\" said Jiang Yu, a foreign ministry spokeswoman.The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who will meet her Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Washington, said efforts were being made to work with Russia and China to prevent the crisis from growing.\"North Korea poses an immediate threat to the region around it, particularly to South Korea and Japan, and a medium-term threat, should it collapse, to China,\" Clinton said.", "tags": ["US military", "South Korea", "North Korea", "Japan", "World news", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US and Japan begin joint military exercise"},{"date": "2010-11-18T15:39:10Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The arrest today of the de facto leader of Japan's most powerful underworld organisation has sparked fears of a violent internal power struggle, as police step up their crackdown on organised crime.Kiyoshi Takayama, the second-in-command of the Yamaguchi-gumi, is being held on suspicion of extorting about \u00a540m (\u00a3300,000) from a man involved in the construction industry.The national police agency declared war on the Yamaguchi-gumi in September in an attempt to rein it in before the release of its leader, Kenichi Shinoda, from prison next spring.Shinoda began a six-year prison sentence in December 2005 for violating gun control laws and entrusted the running of the Yamaguchi-gumi to Takayama, who is also head of the organisation's biggest and most violent faction, the Kodo-kai.\"If Takayama is successfully prosecuted it will be devastating for the Yamaguchi-gumi, and could even spark a war for control of the organisation,\" said Jake Adelstein, author of Tokyo Vice: an American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan.\"He has been running the organisation with an iron fist, and other factions will see his arrest as an opportunity.

Its members have followed officers to their homes, photographed them with members of their families, and attempted to unearth information that could be used to blackmail them.In other major departures from yakuza tradition, they never confess to their crimes and have been accused of targeting civilians.There were about 87,000 gangsters active in Japan at the end of 2005, according to the national police agency. An estimated 50,000 belong to the Yamaguchi-gumi, which has recently attracted mobsters from smaller gangs targeted by rigorous police investigations.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Organised crime", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Yakuza chief arrested in Japan"},{"date": "2010-12-14T14:01:41Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The past year has underlined how Japan's future is inextricably linked with that of China and, by extension, why it may have to stop thinking of itself as an economic superpower. As Japan staggered through one of the hottest summers in recent memory, confirmation arrived that China had replaced it as the world's second-biggest economy, after the US.The Japanese reaction ranged from studied insouciance \u2013 it wasn't as if it hadn't been warned \u2013 to resignation and anger. Some questioned the validity of GDP figures as a reliable indicator, pointing out the vast differences in per capita income between the two countries.Conservative commentators, meanwhile, issued an increasingly hollow-sounding exhortation: that in the Asian context at least, Japan should never be comfortable with second place.But with some economists expecting Japan to give way to several other countries, including the likes of Indonesia and Turkey, by the middle of the century, the icy blast of economic realism from its neighbour has left the Japanese approaching 2011 in contemplative mood.After 20 years of stagnation, a decade of battles with deflation, and the dual spectres of a shrinking workforce and rising elderly population, some are suggesting that Japan should lower its expectations and embrace a future of frugality and sustainability.And, in recognising that the ceaseless quest for growth may not be at the heart of a nation's wellbeing, Japan could offer lessons for other developed economies as they scramble to avoid their own versions of the \"lost decade\".Shikataganai, an oft-heard expression here, is a verbal shrug emitted when hopes are dashed by the supremacy of external forces \u2013 and that Japan is at the cusp of a transition from economic miracle worker to a less obtrusive participant in global capitalism has a feel of inevitability to it.Few people believe the current members of the political class that authored Japan's postwar transformation have the wherewithal to conjure yet another miracle. Nor, despite the best intentions of the left-of-centre government, do they appear to believe their future lies in recalibrating foreign policy away from the US and towards the rest of Asia.On the contrary, relations with China will remain Janus-faced for the foreseeable future. Japan views China as an economic and military rival, but also as a site for its manufacturing plants and, thanks to the rise of a Chinese middle class, a crucial market for the cars and electronics it produces.While conservatives fret over the pace of China's economic development, and the size of its defence budget, a new voice is emerging: one that asks why a country that spent 250 years in sakoku isolation \u2013 a period that saw little economic growth \u2013 cannot beat a retreat into a modified version of the past.It isn't hard to see why such a radical rethink of Japan's economic raison d'etre should at least be debated. The Nikkei stock index is only at about a quarter of its all-time high of 1989; real estate is worth about a quarter of what it was in 1974. While Japan's (reformed) banks dodged the worst of the Lehman shock, the country is displaying the symptoms of a malaise it once dismissed as a western disease: unemployment, the emergence of the \"working poor\", a widening income gap, and the ignominious spectacle of a corporate icon, Toyota, called to account for shoddy workmanship in the committee rooms of the US Congress.It is easy to overstate Japan's sense of disquiet, but even optimists accept that the certainties of the postwar period are creaking under the strain of economic realities. Graduates are no longer guaranteed lifetime employment with major companies and, even if they were, fewer are willing to submit to the work ethic expected of their baby-boomer fathers.The previous generation endured commutes on packed trains, long working hours, few holidays and a cramped existence in the soulless suburbs. Employers' expectations have changed little, but the old quid pro quo \u2013 that workers will see their standard of living improve \u2013 no longer applies.While the postwar generation worked at a time of population growth and rising wages, the young workers of today have only ever known weak consumption, falling prices and contraction.Japan's skewed demographics will only lend weight to the view that its people will have to recalibrate their expectations. Government figures estimate that the population, now at 127 million, could fall by about 40 million by 2050, when almost 40% of the population will be aged 65 or older.Japan depends heavily on Middle East oil and imports around 50% of its food, but its comparatively homogeneous society has never shown much enthusiasm for similarly impressive influxes of foreign labour, despite warnings that it will need to accept 10 million immigrant workers over the next half -century to keep its economy ticking over.There is little sign now, however, soon after Japan's parliament approved yet another stimulus package, that policy-makers are about to accept the case for sustainability over growth.Two decades ago, a group of economists predicted that 2010 would be the year that Japan finally overtook the US as the world's biggest economy. How long will it be before bets are being taken on when it becomes the first economy to shake off its addiction to growth and give other mature economies a glimpse into a more frugal future?What's striking about the images in photographer Michael Wolf's new book Tokyo Compression, aside from the lengths to which people will go to wedge themselves into a bulging carriage, must be the looks of resignation among the victims.

Despite conducting two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, North Korea has yet to prove that it had produced a viable weapon.\"These developments \u2026 are a clear manifestation of the risks posed by North Korea's defiance of its international obligations and commitments,\" the US envoy Glyn Davies told a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in Vienna.IAEA officials believe Pyongyang's enrichment activities had begun before April last year, when the UN body's inspectors were last permitted to visit the country.\"If so, there is a clear likelihood that [it] has built other uranium enrichment-related facilities in its territory,\" Davies said.The IAEA's director-general, Yukiya Amano, voiced \"great concern\" over the reports, and called on Pyongyang to allow inspectors to return to verify the claims.Japan, the US and South Korea have rejected Chinese calls for an emergency meeting of countries involved in multilateral talks to end North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.Instead, the three countries will meet in Washington on Monday to discuss a unified response to the attack and the revelations about Pyongyang's nuclear programme.China said it would keep a \"close watch\" on the meeting. \"As the situation on the Korean peninsula is highly complicated and sensitive, we expect the meeting to ease tensions and promote dialogue, rather then heighten tensions and intensify confrontation,\" said Jiang Yu, a foreign ministry spokeswoman.The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who will meet her Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Washington, said efforts were being made to work with Russia and China to prevent the crisis from growing.\"North Korea poses an immediate threat to the region around it, particularly to South Korea and Japan, and a medium-term threat, should it collapse, to China,\" Clinton said.", "tags": ["US military", "South Korea", "North Korea", "Japan", "World news", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US and Japan begin joint military exercise"},{"date": "2010-11-15T15:21:35Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Cardiff council's leader Rodney Berman will today attend a conference in Japan to find inspiration on how to tackle health deprivation in Cardiff.Berman was invited to join the global forum on urbanisation and health, being held in Kobe, by the World Health Organisation (WHO) \u2013 who have funded the trip.With the authority achieving healthy city status in 2009, Cardiff council said the aim was to find new ways to tackle health deprivation in Cardiff as well as other 'urban health challenges'.

The future of the long-standing Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) programme, which has sponsored more than 50,000 mainly native English speakers to work as language assistants in schools in Japan since 1987, has been put into doubt while a government review is carried out.According to reports in the Daily Yomiuri newspaper, the foreign ministry, which is one of the government departments involved in the programme, has cut its request for JET funding in 2011 by 14% to $1.6m.Boston schools told to retest 15,000 studentsBoston's public schools authority last month agreed to reassess the English language skills of its students and provide additional language support.

The settlement with the departments of justice and education follows claims that the authority had breached equal opportunities legislation by failing to properly identify and adequately serve thousands of English language learners (ELLs) since 2003.The city's current superintendent of education conceded that over 15,000 students who had been wrongly assessed as having adequate English skills, who were not submitted for language skills assessment or who were inadequately tested, would be retested and offered additional language classes where necessary.The settlement means that Boston city officials will avoid facing charges in court, but eight other school districts from across the US are facing similar investigations by federal authorities.According to Education Week, federal officials are scrutinising six of the eight, including Los Angeles Unified School District, to establish whether the authorities are \"ensuring access to equal educational opportunities\" for ELLs.Women golfers get lessons on fairwaysWomen golfers in the US have been offered specialist language training in their breaks between play at major tournaments, to help them communicate with the media and fans. The LPGA, the professional women golfers' organisation in the US, which attracts players from around the world, is providing access to tutoring for its members.In 2008 LPGA officials caused a public outcry after proposing that foreign players should be penalised if they did not learn English. Players from South Korea, who dominate the golf tour, were accused of not making enough effort to engage with the media.The one-to-one tuition, which has been running since the beginning of this year, is aimed at building players' confidence in press conferences and when meeting fans.Indian workers offered speaking skills in SaudiA not-for-profit organisation based in southern India has teamed up with language training provider ELS to offer English classes for expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia.The Centre for Information and Guidance India is promoting the courses, which start in Jeddah later this month, to develop the spoken communication skills of Indian workers in Saudi Arabia.A spokesman for ELS told the Arab News newspaper: \"India is emerging as a superpower mainly because of the abundant availability of skilled manpower.

Now that Shanghai looks in parts like Beverly Hills and Delhi is lighting up with Thai restaurants, there are few cities on the planet that are less western than Tokyo \u2013 even if it's not necessarily a part of any east that you might recognise. The abiding allure of Japan's huge network of tiny details is that, like something in a Salman Rushdie novel, it seems to blur all notions of high and low, east and west, old and new into one state-of-the-art global amusement park that is wildly fresh and novel in its best incarnations, and at least zany in its worst.I've lived at a safe distance from Japan's capital for 23 years now, in Kyoto and Nara, three or four hours away by train and several centuries away in terms of their antique pasts. But if I were going to Tokyo tomorrow, I would, on arrival, hold off on the \"maid cafes\" in the nerds' electronic hive of Akihabara, on the Hysteric Glamour fashions around Harajuku, even on the gleaming shops of the Ginza that have long made Tokyo seem an early visitor from the 23rd century. Instead I'd begin by looking for the old.The evergreen riddle of Japan, after all, is that all its revolving-door fashions, fascination with the west and hunger for the new never seem to make it any less Japanese at the core; the place is like a froth of shifting surfaces and flashing images projected on an old, strangely shaped piece of wood that never moves. My Japanese wife is mad for Marilyn Manson and Metallica and used to gun her Honda Hurricane around the winding streets of Kyoto. But every day, before she heads out in her leather jacket, she places fresh water in a bowl around the small shrine she's set up, and an apple for the gods; she cleans every item of clothing either of us have used the previous day; and then she puts on a CD of monks chanting and sits stock-still in her chair in meditation.Much of Japan is like that still, and if you're arriving in Tokyo soon \u2013 especially if you're coming from far away and are jet lagged \u2013 the first place I'd recommend you see is the Tsukiji fish market (tsukiji-market.or.jp) visiting ideally as close to 5am as possible. Nothing will convince you more quickly that you're not in Kansas (or Hampstead) any more, and the sushi you can try nearby will tell you you're not at Wagamama either.From there I'd suggest heading to Ueno, a slightly down-at-heel area, built around a park, that still has a\u00a0faintly rural feel and reminds you of what Tokyo used to be when its Meiji refashioners, in the late 19th century, took their cues from London and Paris. Wander through the Tokyo National Museum (tnm.go.jp/en), which has perhaps the best collection of classical Japanese art in the world.At dusk, for this opening immersion, I would head towards Asakusa Kannon Temple, whose great front gate makes you feel as if you're entering a Hiroshige woodcut. One of the centres of Shitamachi, the old \"Low City\" of Edo (even by the end of the 18th century the city was the world's largest in terms of population), it still has echoes of the time when it sat at the heart of a bustling entertainment district, home to the country's first cinema and first music hall.The power of Japan, for me, lies in everything you find here that you couldn't imagine seeing in another country, even \u2013 sometimes especially \u2013 when what you think you're enjoying is something foreign, deliciously lost in translation. Last month, McDonald's outlets across the nation were serving Tsukimi, or \"Moon-Viewing\" burgers \u2013 a moon-like fried egg between the buns \u2013 in honour of the harvest moon that has been ritually observed for millennia across east Asia.On your second day, there's something to be said for going to Kamakura (city.kamakura.kanagawa.jp/english), the leafy, temple-filled mini-Kyoto that's only an hour away from Tokyo by train. Just ramble through its leafy lanes, walk into shrines that look deserted, breathe in the quiet of a place that was Japan's capital from 1185 to 1333 and has been a kind of resting place ever after.It's part of the curiosity of contemporary Japan that it presents you with some of the most jangled and mishmashed, unattractive urban landscapes in the world and yet, in many places, every little shop and cafe you enter will be immaculate and exquisite, whether it plays only Beatles records or Mozart. The details are often perfect, even as the whole sounds like 15 languages shouted all at once. And to savour Japan, it makes most sense to seek out its privacies, its secret corners; until I came here, I\u00a0never realised that the society famous for its conformist surfaces is \u2013 for that very reason, perhaps \u2013 a home to wild obsessives, who have collected every King Crimson bootleg in existence or will show you their collection of videos of ancient Hawaii Five-O episodes.In these ways, it's best to browse Tokyo, to get lost, almost as if you were in some virtual reality; more than any city I know, the place is like a website, alight with odd links, hobbyists' addenda, animated figures and racing graphics. And once you've tasted a\u00a0little of the old city, like striking a\u00a0gong or a temple bell before a feast, you can fling yourself into the new. The Mori Art Museum (mori.art.museum/eng) on the 53rd floor of the Mori Tower in the Roppongi Hills complex, say, whose sleek passageways and views over the city and make it look like a high-definition TV screen writ large. There are dog rental stores around town, vending machines selling underwear and whisky, and three-star Michelin restaurants with only a single table and a few seats at the bar (Yukimura, 1-5-5.Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku, +81 3 5772 1610). At the New Otani hotel (newotani.co.jp/en/tokyo) you can enjoy a\u00a0400-year-old Japanese garden and a rooftop rose garden with 2,000 bushes, where fireflies flicker in the summer.The very best side of Tokyo comes out \u2013 though perhaps this is true of every place \u2013 when you can see the strange and the familiar all at once. Go out drinking in Roppongi on a Saturday night and you'll half-believe you're in LA, or at least Hong Kong, among the Romanian restaurants and Filipina hostess clubs; then, on Sunday morning, walk down Omotesando street, past all the note-perfect French cafes and high-end boutiques, with the Kings Road of Takeshita street just a short hop away.On Sunday afternoons, on Jingu Bridge, at the end of Omotesando, \"cosplay\" (a mix of \"costume\" and \"play\") girls from the suburbs come out in their wild outfits, dressed as nurses or goths or dominatrices or Alice in Wonderland. Costumes, you will soon register, are as outlandish as uniforms are constant in Japan, if only because the same people who are dressed down for six days every week get their own back by dressing up on Sundays.Right behind the bridge, wide pathways take you to the Meiji shrine (meijijingu.or.jp/english), where you are back in the thick, textured, slightly elusive place that has altered very little over centuries. Shrine maidens dressed all in white \u2013 traditionally they were virgins \u2013 are selling good luck charms for passing exams to the wild teenage girls in microskirts and fishnet stockings whose hairstyles seem to have been copied from Lady Gaga.Everywhere in Japan there are things that are worth doing just because they can't be done in quite the same way anywhere else. Try to arrive at a\u00a0fancy department store at 10 am, when it opens, to see the scores of perfectly coiffed employees lined up to call out a formal welcome. Try Isetan (isetan.co.jp) in Shinjuku; you can spend the next many hours lost in the capacious food halls in its basement. Look for the three-course \"teishoku\" set lunches, which will offer you the same food you'd spend \u00a320 on at dinnertime for a third of the price. And never spurn a convenience store, because there is more in their small heaven and earth than is dreamed of in your philosophy.The first time I came to Japan, as a sightseer 25 years ago, I made sure to take myself to Tokyo Disneyland (tokyodisneyresort.co.jp) so I could see the whole seamless, public and well-organised society in miniature; I could get a (cartoon version, but defiantly partisan) tour of Japanese history in one pavilion, eat melon sorbets in another and see on every side how Japan had taken something deeply American and made it entirely its own (and cleaner, quieter, more efficient). In time though, after I came to live here, I began to see how much of Japan can be enjoyed as a kind of theme park, where most people are dressed up to play a part, as polite, chirpy and eager to please as one of Walt Disney's Mouseketeers, and inhabiting what looks less like real life and more like a super-synthetic version of The Happiest Place on Earth.There are 35 million people in Greater Tokyo \u2013 more than in all of Canada \u2013 and when you arrive at Tokyo station you may feel that they're all streaming past you at the same time. Two million souls do indeed pour through Shinjuku station every day. But what ultimately stays with many a\u00a0visitor to the epicentre of Japan are the moments of stillness, of collectedness, of almost mysterious remoteness, where you see the changeless nerve centre from which all the wild changes arise.Pico Iyer is the author of nine books, including The Lady and the Monk (IB Tauris), about his first year in Japan", "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "Asia", "City breaks", "Travel", "Cultural trips"], "title": "Big in Japan: why Tokyo is top"},{"date": "2010-11-18T15:39:10Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The arrest today of the de facto leader of Japan's most powerful underworld organisation has sparked fears of a violent internal power struggle, as police step up their crackdown on organised crime.Kiyoshi Takayama, the second-in-command of the Yamaguchi-gumi, is being held on suspicion of extorting about \u00a540m (\u00a3300,000) from a man involved in the construction industry.The national police agency declared war on the Yamaguchi-gumi in September in an attempt to rein it in before the release of its leader, Kenichi Shinoda, from prison next spring.Shinoda began a six-year prison sentence in December 2005 for violating gun control laws and entrusted the running of the Yamaguchi-gumi to Takayama, who is also head of the organisation's biggest and most violent faction, the Kodo-kai.\"If Takayama is successfully prosecuted it will be devastating for the Yamaguchi-gumi, and could even spark a war for control of the organisation,\" said Jake Adelstein, author of Tokyo Vice: an American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan.\"He has been running the organisation with an iron fist, and other factions will see his arrest as an opportunity. His antagonism towards the police has angered some in the organisation. He is not a popular man.\"Takayama, 63, did not resist arrest during a dawn police raid involving 140 officers at a Kodo-kai base in the western city of Kobe. He has, however, denied involvement in the extortion case, according to Japanese media.Although he was not present at meetings with the alleged extortion victim, police believe they can build a case against him using a law that holds gang leaders responsible for crimes committed by their juniors.When Shinoda was sworn in as the Yamaguchi-gumi's sixth don in July 2005, he vowed to expand the 95-year-old organisation's influence beyond its traditional Kobe base.Until recently Japan's crime syndicates, which are not illegal, operated with relative impunity. Gangsters made no attempt to hide their underworld affiliations and listed their offices in the phone book.But Takayama's arrest has heightened fears of a dramatic deterioration in relations with the police.Takaharu Ando, the combative head of the national police agency, has vowed to destroy the Yamaguchi-gumi as part of an unprecedented crackdown on organised crime. \"We want them to disappear from public life,\" he told reporters after his appointment last year.Aside from gambling, loan sharking, protection rackets and prostitution, the yakuza have added stock market manipulation and front companies to their myriad illegal activities.Takayama was influential in the Yamaguchi-gumi's expansion into Tokyo, an audacious move that led to several shootings in the capital in 2007.The Kodo-kai faction, thought to have about 4,000 members, has dispensed with the yakuza's traditional policy of co-operating with the police. Its members have followed officers to their homes, photographed them with members of their families, and attempted to unearth information that could be used to blackmail them.In other major departures from yakuza tradition, they never confess to their crimes and have been accused of targeting civilians.There were about 87,000 gangsters active in Japan at the end of 2005, according to the national police agency. An estimated 50,000 belong to the Yamaguchi-gumi, which has recently attracted mobsters from smaller gangs targeted by rigorous police investigations.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Organised crime", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Yakuza chief arrested in Japan"},{"date": "2010-12-14T14:01:41Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The past year has underlined how Japan's future is inextricably linked with that of China and, by extension, why it may have to stop thinking of itself as an economic superpower. As Japan staggered through one of the hottest summers in recent memory, confirmation arrived that China had replaced it as the world's second-biggest economy, after the US.The Japanese reaction ranged from studied insouciance \u2013 it wasn't as if it hadn't been warned \u2013 to resignation and anger. Some questioned the validity of GDP figures as a reliable indicator, pointing out the vast differences in per capita income between the two countries.Conservative commentators, meanwhile, issued an increasingly hollow-sounding exhortation: that in the Asian context at least, Japan should never be comfortable with second place.But with some economists expecting Japan to give way to several other countries, including the likes of Indonesia and Turkey, by the middle of the century, the icy blast of economic realism from its neighbour has left the Japanese approaching 2011 in contemplative mood.After 20 years of stagnation, a decade of battles with deflation, and the dual spectres of a shrinking workforce and rising elderly population, some are suggesting that Japan should lower its expectations and embrace a future of frugality and sustainability.And, in recognising that the ceaseless quest for growth may not be at the heart of a nation's wellbeing, Japan could offer lessons for other developed economies as they scramble to avoid their own versions of the \"lost decade\".Shikataganai, an oft-heard expression here, is a verbal shrug emitted when hopes are dashed by the supremacy of external forces \u2013 and that Japan is at the cusp of a transition from economic miracle worker to a less obtrusive participant in global capitalism has a feel of inevitability to it.Few people believe the current members of the political class that authored Japan's postwar transformation have the wherewithal to conjure yet another miracle. Nor, despite the best intentions of the left-of-centre government, do they appear to believe their future lies in recalibrating foreign policy away from the US and towards the rest of Asia.On the contrary, relations with China will remain Janus-faced for the foreseeable future. Japan views China as an economic and military rival, but also as a site for its manufacturing plants and, thanks to the rise of a Chinese middle class, a crucial market for the cars and electronics it produces.While conservatives fret over the pace of China's economic development, and the size of its defence budget, a new voice is emerging: one that asks why a country that spent 250 years in sakoku isolation \u2013 a period that saw little economic growth \u2013 cannot beat a retreat into a modified version of the past.It isn't hard to see why such a radical rethink of Japan's economic raison d'etre should at least be debated. The Nikkei stock index is only at about a quarter of its all-time high of 1989; real estate is worth about a quarter of what it was in 1974. While Japan's (reformed) banks dodged the worst of the Lehman shock, the country is displaying the symptoms of a malaise it once dismissed as a western disease: unemployment, the emergence of the \"working poor\", a widening income gap, and the ignominious spectacle of a corporate icon, Toyota, called to account for shoddy workmanship in the committee rooms of the US Congress.It is easy to overstate Japan's sense of disquiet, but even optimists accept that the certainties of the postwar period are creaking under the strain of economic realities. Graduates are no longer guaranteed lifetime employment with major companies and, even if they were, fewer are willing to submit to the work ethic expected of their baby-boomer fathers.The previous generation endured commutes on packed trains, long working hours, few holidays and a cramped existence in the soulless suburbs. Employers' expectations have changed little, but the old quid pro quo \u2013 that workers will see their standard of living improve \u2013 no longer applies.While the postwar generation worked at a time of population growth and rising wages, the young workers of today have only ever known weak consumption, falling prices and contraction.Japan's skewed demographics will only lend weight to the view that its people will have to recalibrate their expectations. Government figures estimate that the population, now at 127 million, could fall by about 40 million by 2050, when almost 40% of the population will be aged 65 or older.Japan depends heavily on Middle East oil and imports around 50% of its food, but its comparatively homogeneous society has never shown much enthusiasm for similarly impressive influxes of foreign labour, despite warnings that it will need to accept 10 million immigrant workers over the next half -century to keep its economy ticking over.There is little sign now, however, soon after Japan's parliament approved yet another stimulus package, that policy-makers are about to accept the case for sustainability over growth.Two decades ago, a group of economists predicted that 2010 would be the year that Japan finally overtook the US as the world's biggest economy. How long will it be before bets are being taken on when it becomes the first economy to shake off its addiction to growth and give other mature economies a glimpse into a more frugal future?What's striking about the images in photographer Michael Wolf's new book Tokyo Compression, aside from the lengths to which people will go to wedge themselves into a bulging carriage, must be the looks of resignation among the victims.

My Japanese wife is mad for Marilyn Manson and Metallica and used to gun her Honda Hurricane around the winding streets of Kyoto. But every day, before she heads out in her leather jacket, she places fresh water in a bowl around the small shrine she's set up, and an apple for the gods; she cleans every item of clothing either of us have used the previous day; and then she puts on a CD of monks chanting and sits stock-still in her chair in meditation.Much of Japan is like that still, and if you're arriving in Tokyo soon \u2013 especially if you're coming from far away and are jet lagged \u2013 the first place I'd recommend you see is the Tsukiji fish market (tsukiji-market.or.jp) visiting ideally as close to 5am as possible. Nothing will convince you more quickly that you're not in Kansas (or Hampstead) any more, and the sushi you can try nearby will tell you you're not at Wagamama either.From there I'd suggest heading to Ueno, a slightly down-at-heel area, built around a park, that still has a\u00a0faintly rural feel and reminds you of what Tokyo used to be when its Meiji refashioners, in the late 19th century, took their cues from London and Paris. Wander through the Tokyo National Museum (tnm.go.jp/en), which has perhaps the best collection of classical Japanese art in the world.At dusk, for this opening immersion, I would head towards Asakusa Kannon Temple, whose great front gate makes you feel as if you're entering a Hiroshige woodcut. One of the centres of Shitamachi, the old \"Low City\" of Edo (even by the end of the 18th century the city was the world's largest in terms of population), it still has echoes of the time when it sat at the heart of a bustling entertainment district, home to the country's first cinema and first music hall.The power of Japan, for me, lies in everything you find here that you couldn't imagine seeing in another country, even \u2013 sometimes especially \u2013 when what you think you're enjoying is something foreign, deliciously lost in translation. Last month, McDonald's outlets across the nation were serving Tsukimi, or \"Moon-Viewing\" burgers \u2013 a moon-like fried egg between the buns \u2013 in honour of the harvest moon that has been ritually observed for millennia across east Asia.On your second day, there's something to be said for going to Kamakura (city.kamakura.kanagawa.jp/english), the leafy, temple-filled mini-Kyoto that's only an hour away from Tokyo by train. Just ramble through its leafy lanes, walk into shrines that look deserted, breathe in the quiet of a place that was Japan's capital from 1185 to 1333 and has been a kind of resting place ever after.It's part of the curiosity of contemporary Japan that it presents you with some of the most jangled and mishmashed, unattractive urban landscapes in the world and yet, in many places, every little shop and cafe you enter will be immaculate and exquisite, whether it plays only Beatles records or Mozart. The details are often perfect, even as the whole sounds like 15 languages shouted all at once. And to savour Japan, it makes most sense to seek out its privacies, its secret corners; until I came here, I\u00a0never realised that the society famous for its conformist surfaces is \u2013 for that very reason, perhaps \u2013 a home to wild obsessives, who have collected every King Crimson bootleg in existence or will show you their collection of videos of ancient Hawaii Five-O episodes.In these ways, it's best to browse Tokyo, to get lost, almost as if you were in some virtual reality; more than any city I know, the place is like a website, alight with odd links, hobbyists' addenda, animated figures and racing graphics. And once you've tasted a\u00a0little of the old city, like striking a\u00a0gong or a temple bell before a feast, you can fling yourself into the new. The Mori Art Museum (mori.art.museum/eng) on the 53rd floor of the Mori Tower in the Roppongi Hills complex, say, whose sleek passageways and views over the city and make it look like a high-definition TV screen writ large. There are dog rental stores around town, vending machines selling underwear and whisky, and three-star Michelin restaurants with only a single table and a few seats at the bar (Yukimura, 1-5-5.Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku, +81 3 5772 1610). At the New Otani hotel (newotani.co.jp/en/tokyo) you can enjoy a\u00a0400-year-old Japanese garden and a rooftop rose garden with 2,000 bushes, where fireflies flicker in the summer.The very best side of Tokyo comes out \u2013 though perhaps this is true of every place \u2013 when you can see the strange and the familiar all at once. Go out drinking in Roppongi on a Saturday night and you'll half-believe you're in LA, or at least Hong Kong, among the Romanian restaurants and Filipina hostess clubs; then, on Sunday morning, walk down Omotesando street, past all the note-perfect French cafes and high-end boutiques, with the Kings Road of Takeshita street just a short hop away.On Sunday afternoons, on Jingu Bridge, at the end of Omotesando, \"cosplay\" (a mix of \"costume\" and \"play\") girls from the suburbs come out in their wild outfits, dressed as nurses or goths or dominatrices or Alice in Wonderland. Costumes, you will soon register, are as outlandish as uniforms are constant in Japan, if only because the same people who are dressed down for six days every week get their own back by dressing up on Sundays.Right behind the bridge, wide pathways take you to the Meiji shrine (meijijingu.or.jp/english), where you are back in the thick, textured, slightly elusive place that has altered very little over centuries. Shrine maidens dressed all in white \u2013 traditionally they were virgins \u2013 are selling good luck charms for passing exams to the wild teenage girls in microskirts and fishnet stockings whose hairstyles seem to have been copied from Lady Gaga.Everywhere in Japan there are things that are worth doing just because they can't be done in quite the same way anywhere else. Try to arrive at a\u00a0fancy department store at 10 am, when it opens, to see the scores of perfectly coiffed employees lined up to call out a formal welcome. Try Isetan (isetan.co.jp) in Shinjuku; you can spend the next many hours lost in the capacious food halls in its basement. Look for the three-course \"teishoku\" set lunches, which will offer you the same food you'd spend \u00a320 on at dinnertime for a third of the price. And never spurn a convenience store, because there is more in their small heaven and earth than is dreamed of in your philosophy.The first time I came to Japan, as a sightseer 25 years ago, I made sure to take myself to Tokyo Disneyland (tokyodisneyresort.co.jp) so I could see the whole seamless, public and well-organised society in miniature; I could get a (cartoon version, but defiantly partisan) tour of Japanese history in one pavilion, eat melon sorbets in another and see on every side how Japan had taken something deeply American and made it entirely its own (and cleaner, quieter, more efficient). In time though, after I came to live here, I began to see how much of Japan can be enjoyed as a kind of theme park, where most people are dressed up to play a part, as polite, chirpy and eager to please as one of Walt Disney's Mouseketeers, and inhabiting what looks less like real life and more like a super-synthetic version of The Happiest Place on Earth.There are 35 million people in Greater Tokyo \u2013 more than in all of Canada \u2013 and when you arrive at Tokyo station you may feel that they're all streaming past you at the same time. Two million souls do indeed pour through Shinjuku station every day. But what ultimately stays with many a\u00a0visitor to the epicentre of Japan are the moments of stillness, of collectedness, of almost mysterious remoteness, where you see the changeless nerve centre from which all the wild changes arise.Pico Iyer is the author of nine books, including The Lady and the Monk (IB Tauris), about his first year in Japan", "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "Asia", "City breaks", "Travel", "Cultural trips"], "title": "Big in Japan: why Tokyo is top"},{"date": "2010-10-01T23:06:13Z", "country": "japan", "content": "On one level the Royal Opera's recent tour of Japan was, as a manager described it, \"a team building exercise on a rather extravagant scale\". The party of 250 people included a full orchestra and chorus, backstage staff, technical crew and management support. And indeed, in the time I spent following them around, I duly picked up on the warm and fuzzy feelings engendered by late-night sessions in karaoke bars, excitement over trips to Mount Fuji, the swapping of restaurant etiquette tips and problem-solving sessions involving apparently incomprehensible tube maps.Not that there weren't operas as well. Performances of La Traviata and Manon in Tokyo and Yokohama were enthusiastically received despite some alarums and excursions involving understudies, and understudies of understudies. And aside from the full-stage productions, the Japanese promoters of the tour \u2013 who accepted all financial risk for the venture, leaving the opera house to break even at worst, also asked for a concert performance that would both show off the orchestra and chorus as well as somehow exemplifying British music for Japanese audiences.\"So I spent quite a lot of time planning it,\" explained director of music Antonio Pappano over a breakfast of fish, soup and rice at his Tokyo hotel. \"We had some Elgar, Britten and Vaughan Williams. There was a bit of Gilbert & Sullivan and a few other things. I think we came up with a pretty lovely programme, but they said no. It turned out what they really wanted was Handel's Messiah.\" Which is what the orchestra, chorus and soloists of the Royal Opera performed, albeit in the expanded Mozart orchestration. The promoters' instincts as to local taste proved sound and, to the slight surprise of the company, a significant portion of the packed audience actually stood up for the Hallelujah Chorus.While this throwback to a Clive James-esque slice of \"how others see us\" was a minor element of the tour as a whole, it is nevertheless true that Japanese taste \u2013 and Chinese, American, Korean and many other tastes \u2013 will not be irrelevant to the calculations made in London over the coming years. The tour might have marked something of a culmination of Pappano's successful nine-year artistic tenure at Covent Garden, but it also signified the beginning of a new, and far more ambitious, phase of the company's development. Although they are bracing themselves for cuts to their grant, which currently accounts for around 25% of their total income, chief executive Tony Hall says, \"The really big strategic issue facing us is that in the very near future there will only be three or maybe four big opera houses in the world. There will be the Met in New York, maybe La Scala because of its historic reputation, maybe Paris and a few others you could\u00a0argue over. But we will certainly be one of those world-class venues, and we therefore need Japanese audiences to see just how good we are because they will not just be seeing us on stage. The digital age will make a huge difference. We are already available on big-screen relays to cinemas, on DVD and via our Japanese language website. It won't be long before people will have, on demand, the world's great opera houses piped live into their homes. Occasionally people say that audiences for opera are small. That's not even true in national terms. But when you think in a global sense, the audiences are enormous and we will be available to all of them.\"The contrast with the last time the company toured with a full orchestra and chorus, in 1998 to Finland, Germany and Edinburgh, is stark. The music making might have been exemplary under Bernard Haitink (who restricted himself to matters in the pit, the opposite of Pappano's access-all-areas, hands-on approach), but back then the company was homeless while Covent Garden was closed for renovations and there was a genuine fear that it might not reopen. And while the worst of the management convulsions that had destabilised the company over the previous few years were over, the company still felt organisationally fragile.Of course, the house reopened in 1999 as a far more welcoming building, both to its audience and to those who just fancy a nose around or a drink in a bar. And as well as being less remote to its audience, the organisation is also now better linked to other arts companies and has a kind of mentoring role for groups such as Ballet Black and Music Theatre Wales.But just as the 1990s problems of organisation and access were not solved without pain, so the road to the digital future is already proving bumpy. One night in Japan, the opera company hierarchy were obliged to calm a Twitter storm of protest about their apparently heavy-handed response to a copyright issue on the opera blog Intermezzo. Last week a new row over a perceived \"rights grab\" as to ownership of work done on Royal Opera productions blew up. \"We are in slightly uncharted waters,\" Hall admits. \"We are in a very different age to a decade or two ago when significant sums of money could be made from studio recordings. That money is no longer there. It is also difficult to keep track of a market that moves very fast. So we are trying to do something with our contracts that allows us to respond, with the artists and with their consent, as fast as we can to exploit our productions in the marketplace, knowing that the returns are much lower than they were two decades ago.\"Although the business model remains a work in progress, there is general consensus that in musical terms Pappano has pretty much got it right. \"When even Massenet can seem deep, something remarkable is going on,\" said one reviewer about the new production of Manon earlier this summer. \"Under Antonio Pappano's stewardship, the Royal Opera is experiencing a golden age of musical sensitivity and dramatic insight.\" Another commentator compared the organisation to a big Rolls-Royce \"just purring along\".Pappano says it took him five years to feel in proper command of the orchestra \u2013 \"to get that feeling you really understand each other, that you are inhabiting each other's sound world.\" He is plainly held in very high regard by his players and singers and while nearly everyone I spoke to in Japan had the decency to admit that the oft-used description of them as a family was cheesy, they also said it did bear some resemblance to the truth. More importantly, this team spirit carried through to the stage, most notably when soprano Ermonela Jaho \u2013 herself a late replacement for Angela Gheorgiou, who pulled out of the tour just a week before departure \u2013 twice had to be replaced after the first act of La Traviata by her understudy Ailyn P\u00e9rez. Potential artistic \u2013 and commercial \u2013 disaster was avoided with impressive ease.Pappano returns to the house next week with a concert performance of Bizet's The Pearl Fishers. He likes to give the orchestra a chance to play on stage before they disappear into the darkness of the pit for the rest of the season. \"And I have a very warm spot in my heart for this work. The orchestral writing is typical Bizet but with an element of the sea \u2013 so a different tumult to Carmen, but still something pretty meaty for the home forces to chew on.\"The new season also features a rare production of Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user and a series of operas that appear to feature \"women under duress\": the baroque rarity Niobe (witnesses murder of her 14 children and is then turned to stone), Adriana Lecouvreur (poisoned) and Mark-Anthony Turnage's new work Anna Nicole \u2013 with lyrics by Richard Thomas of Jerry Springer: The Opera fame \u2013 about the Playboy model and controversial heiress who died aged 39 in 2007 after an apparent drug overdose.\"It's a wonderful season,\" says Pappano, \"although I'm also aware that 2011/12 could well be a bit tougher financially. But the company has been prudent and we have tried very hard not to make any compromises in the repertoire. All this will be discussed over the next few months, although for me changing a title for financial reasons will really be a defeat. What is good is that all the decisions are thought through from top to bottom of the organisation. Yes, the beans are counted, but that is just part of the equation.\"Pappano's current contract will take him to 2014, but he is already scheduling 2015. He wouldn't be short\u00a0of offers if he did want to move, and his recent BBC television series Opera Italia, which will be repeated later this month, has seen him increasingly cast as the accessible front man for classical music, a job he admits is both attractive and important. \"But I really am very happy here and I am up for the fight that we have ahead of us. In the end, all that matters is what is on stage. It really is all about the work and that makes me optimistic. I know the people I'm working with and I know the capacity they have. You come back from something like this Japan tour and you bring home all the good habits about working together you've picked up on the road. Everyone wants to make it work so we have every chance of pulling it off. I'm Italian so I like cooking analogies; when you have top ingredients you have to do something drastically wrong to spoil the meal. I think the chances are we will prepare something that will taste pretty good.\"See more photographs from behind the scenes of the tour at theguardian.com/classical", "tags": ["Opera", "Culture", "Music", "Royal Opera House"], "title": "The Royal Opera on tour in Japan"},{"date": "2010-11-18T15:39:10Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The arrest today of the de facto leader of Japan's most powerful underworld organisation has sparked fears of a violent internal power struggle, as police step up their crackdown on organised crime.Kiyoshi Takayama, the second-in-command of the Yamaguchi-gumi, is being held on suspicion of extorting about \u00a540m (\u00a3300,000) from a man involved in the construction industry.The national police agency declared war on the Yamaguchi-gumi in September in an attempt to rein it in before the release of its leader, Kenichi Shinoda, from prison next spring.Shinoda began a six-year prison sentence in December 2005 for violating gun control laws and entrusted the running of the Yamaguchi-gumi to Takayama, who is also head of the organisation's biggest and most violent faction, the Kodo-kai.\"If Takayama is successfully prosecuted it will be devastating for the Yamaguchi-gumi, and could even spark a war for control of the organisation,\" said Jake Adelstein, author of Tokyo Vice: an American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan.\"He has been running the organisation with an iron fist, and other factions will see his arrest as an opportunity. His antagonism towards the police has angered some in the organisation. He is not a popular man.\"Takayama, 63, did not resist arrest during a dawn police raid involving 140 officers at a Kodo-kai base in the western city of Kobe. He has, however, denied involvement in the extortion case, according to Japanese media.Although he was not present at meetings with the alleged extortion victim, police believe they can build a case against him using a law that holds gang leaders responsible for crimes committed by their juniors.When Shinoda was sworn in as the Yamaguchi-gumi's sixth don in July 2005, he vowed to expand the 95-year-old organisation's influence beyond its traditional Kobe base.Until recently Japan's crime syndicates, which are not illegal, operated with relative impunity. Gangsters made no attempt to hide their underworld affiliations and listed their offices in the phone book.But Takayama's arrest has heightened fears of a dramatic deterioration in relations with the police.Takaharu Ando, the combative head of the national police agency, has vowed to destroy the Yamaguchi-gumi as part of an unprecedented crackdown on organised crime. \"We want them to disappear from public life,\" he told reporters after his appointment last year.Aside from gambling, loan sharking, protection rackets and prostitution, the yakuza have added stock market manipulation and front companies to their myriad illegal activities.Takayama was influential in the Yamaguchi-gumi's expansion into Tokyo, an audacious move that led to several shootings in the capital in 2007.The Kodo-kai faction, thought to have about 4,000 members, has dispensed with the yakuza's traditional policy of co-operating with the police. Its members have followed officers to their homes, photographed them with members of their families, and attempted to unearth information that could be used to blackmail them.In other major departures from yakuza tradition, they never confess to their crimes and have been accused of targeting civilians.There were about 87,000 gangsters active in Japan at the end of 2005, according to the national police agency. An estimated 50,000 belong to the Yamaguchi-gumi, which has recently attracted mobsters from smaller gangs targeted by rigorous police investigations.", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Organised crime", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Yakuza chief arrested in Japan"},{"date": "2010-12-14T14:01:41Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The past year has underlined how Japan's future is inextricably linked with that of China and, by extension, why it may have to stop thinking of itself as an economic superpower. As Japan staggered through one of the hottest summers in recent memory, confirmation arrived that China had replaced it as the world's second-biggest economy, after the US.The Japanese reaction ranged from studied insouciance \u2013 it wasn't as if it hadn't been warned \u2013 to resignation and anger. Some questioned the validity of GDP figures as a reliable indicator, pointing out the vast differences in per capita income between the two countries.Conservative commentators, meanwhile, issued an increasingly hollow-sounding exhortation: that in the Asian context at least, Japan should never be comfortable with second place.But with some economists expecting Japan to give way to several other countries, including the likes of Indonesia and Turkey, by the middle of the century, the icy blast of economic realism from its neighbour has left the Japanese approaching 2011 in contemplative mood.After 20 years of stagnation, a decade of battles with deflation, and the dual spectres of a shrinking workforce and rising elderly population, some are suggesting that Japan should lower its expectations and embrace a future of frugality and sustainability.And, in recognising that the ceaseless quest for growth may not be at the heart of a nation's wellbeing, Japan could offer lessons for other developed economies as they scramble to avoid their own versions of the \"lost decade\".Shikataganai, an oft-heard expression here, is a verbal shrug emitted when hopes are dashed by the supremacy of external forces \u2013 and that Japan is at the cusp of a transition from economic miracle worker to a less obtrusive participant in global capitalism has a feel of inevitability to it.Few people believe the current members of the political class that authored Japan's postwar transformation have the wherewithal to conjure yet another miracle. Nor, despite the best intentions of the left-of-centre government, do they appear to believe their future lies in recalibrating foreign policy away from the US and towards the rest of Asia.On the contrary, relations with China will remain Janus-faced for the foreseeable future. Japan views China as an economic and military rival, but also as a site for its manufacturing plants and, thanks to the rise of a Chinese middle class, a crucial market for the cars and electronics it produces.While conservatives fret over the pace of China's economic development, and the size of its defence budget, a new voice is emerging: one that asks why a country that spent 250 years in sakoku isolation \u2013 a period that saw little economic growth \u2013 cannot beat a retreat into a modified version of the past.It isn't hard to see why such a radical rethink of Japan's economic raison d'etre should at least be debated. The Nikkei stock index is only at about a quarter of its all-time high of 1989; real estate is worth about a quarter of what it was in 1974. While Japan's (reformed) banks dodged the worst of the Lehman shock, the country is displaying the symptoms of a malaise it once dismissed as a western disease: unemployment, the emergence of the \"working poor\", a widening income gap, and the ignominious spectacle of a corporate icon, Toyota, called to account for shoddy workmanship in the committee rooms of the US Congress.It is easy to overstate Japan's sense of disquiet, but even optimists accept that the certainties of the postwar period are creaking under the strain of economic realities. Graduates are no longer guaranteed lifetime employment with major companies and, even if they were, fewer are willing to submit to the work ethic expected of their baby-boomer fathers.The previous generation endured commutes on packed trains, long working hours, few holidays and a cramped existence in the soulless suburbs. Employers' expectations have changed little, but the old quid pro quo \u2013 that workers will see their standard of living improve \u2013 no longer applies.While the postwar generation worked at a time of population growth and rising wages, the young workers of today have only ever known weak consumption, falling prices and contraction.Japan's skewed demographics will only lend weight to the view that its people will have to recalibrate their expectations. Government figures estimate that the population, now at 127 million, could fall by about 40 million by 2050, when almost 40% of the population will be aged 65 or older.Japan depends heavily on Middle East oil and imports around 50% of its food, but its comparatively homogeneous society has never shown much enthusiasm for similarly impressive influxes of foreign labour, despite warnings that it will need to accept 10 million immigrant workers over the next half -century to keep its economy ticking over.There is little sign now, however, soon after Japan's parliament approved yet another stimulus package, that policy-makers are about to accept the case for sustainability over growth.Two decades ago, a group of economists predicted that 2010 would be the year that Japan finally overtook the US as the world's biggest economy. How long will it be before bets are being taken on when it becomes the first economy to shake off its addiction to growth and give other mature economies a glimpse into a more frugal future?What's striking about the images in photographer Michael Wolf's new book Tokyo Compression, aside from the lengths to which people will go to wedge themselves into a bulging carriage, must be the looks of resignation among the victims.

Despite conducting two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, North Korea has yet to prove that it had produced a viable weapon.\"These developments \u2026 are a clear manifestation of the risks posed by North Korea's defiance of its international obligations and commitments,\" the US envoy Glyn Davies told a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in Vienna.IAEA officials believe Pyongyang's enrichment activities had begun before April last year, when the UN body's inspectors were last permitted to visit the country.\"If so, there is a clear likelihood that [it] has built other uranium enrichment-related facilities in its territory,\" Davies said.The IAEA's director-general, Yukiya Amano, voiced \"great concern\" over the reports, and called on Pyongyang to allow inspectors to return to verify the claims.Japan, the US and South Korea have rejected Chinese calls for an emergency meeting of countries involved in multilateral talks to end North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.Instead, the three countries will meet in Washington on Monday to discuss a unified response to the attack and the revelations about Pyongyang's nuclear programme.China said it would keep a \"close watch\" on the meeting. \"As the situation on the Korean peninsula is highly complicated and sensitive, we expect the meeting to ease tensions and promote dialogue, rather then heighten tensions and intensify confrontation,\" said Jiang Yu, a foreign ministry spokeswoman.The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who will meet her Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Washington, said efforts were being made to work with Russia and China to prevent the crisis from growing.\"North Korea poses an immediate threat to the region around it, particularly to South Korea and Japan, and a medium-term threat, should it collapse, to China,\" Clinton said.", "tags": ["US military", "South Korea", "North Korea", "Japan", "World news", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US and Japan begin joint military exercise"},{"date": "2010-11-15T15:21:35Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Cardiff council's leader Rodney Berman will today attend a conference in Japan to find inspiration on how to tackle health deprivation in Cardiff.Berman was invited to join the global forum on urbanisation and health, being held in Kobe, by the World Health Organisation (WHO) \u2013 who have funded the trip.With the authority achieving healthy city status in 2009, Cardiff council said the aim was to find new ways to tackle health deprivation in Cardiff as well as other 'urban health challenges'.

The future of the long-standing Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) programme, which has sponsored more than 50,000 mainly native English speakers to work as language assistants in schools in Japan since 1987, has been put into doubt while a government review is carried out.According to reports in the Daily Yomiuri newspaper, the foreign ministry, which is one of the government departments involved in the programme, has cut its request for JET funding in 2011 by 14% to $1.6m.Boston schools told to retest 15,000 studentsBoston's public schools authority last month agreed to reassess the English language skills of its students and provide additional language support. The settlement with the departments of justice and education follows claims that the authority had breached equal opportunities legislation by failing to properly identify and adequately serve thousands of English language learners (ELLs) since 2003.The city's current superintendent of education conceded that over 15,000 students who had been wrongly assessed as having adequate English skills, who were not submitted for language skills assessment or who were inadequately tested, would be retested and offered additional language classes where necessary.The settlement means that Boston city officials will avoid facing charges in court, but eight other school districts from across the US are facing similar investigations by federal authorities.According to Education Week, federal officials are scrutinising six of the eight, including Los Angeles Unified School District, to establish whether the authorities are \"ensuring access to equal educational opportunities\" for ELLs.Women golfers get lessons on fairwaysWomen golfers in the US have been offered specialist language training in their breaks between play at major tournaments, to help them communicate with the media and fans. The LPGA, the professional women golfers' organisation in the US, which attracts players from around the world, is providing access to tutoring for its members.In 2008 LPGA officials caused a public outcry after proposing that foreign players should be penalised if they did not learn English. Players from South Korea, who dominate the golf tour, were accused of not making enough effort to engage with the media.The one-to-one tuition, which has been running since the beginning of this year, is aimed at building players' confidence in press conferences and when meeting fans.Indian workers offered speaking skills in SaudiA not-for-profit organisation based in southern India has teamed up with language training provider ELS to offer English classes for expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia.The Centre for Information and Guidance India is promoting the courses, which start in Jeddah later this month, to develop the spoken communication skills of Indian workers in Saudi Arabia.A spokesman for ELS told the Arab News newspaper: \"India is emerging as a superpower mainly because of the abundant availability of skilled manpower.

Now that Shanghai looks in parts like Beverly Hills and Delhi is lighting up with Thai restaurants, there are few cities on the planet that are less western than Tokyo \u2013 even if it's not necessarily a part of any east that you might recognise. The abiding allure of Japan's huge network of tiny details is that, like something in a Salman Rushdie novel, it seems to blur all notions of high and low, east and west, old and new into one state-of-the-art global amusement park that is wildly fresh and novel in its best incarnations, and at least zany in its worst.I've lived at a safe distance from Japan's capital for 23 years now, in Kyoto and Nara, three or four hours away by train and several centuries away in terms of their antique pasts. But if I were going to Tokyo tomorrow, I would, on arrival, hold off on the \"maid cafes\" in the nerds' electronic hive of Akihabara, on the Hysteric Glamour fashions around Harajuku, even on the gleaming shops of the Ginza that have long made Tokyo seem an early visitor from the 23rd century. Instead I'd begin by looking for the old.The evergreen riddle of Japan, after all, is that all its revolving-door fashions, fascination with the west and hunger for the new never seem to make it any less Japanese at the core; the place is like a froth of shifting surfaces and flashing images projected on an old, strangely shaped piece of wood that never moves. My Japanese wife is mad for Marilyn Manson and Metallica and used to gun her Honda Hurricane around the winding streets of Kyoto. But every day, before she heads out in her leather jacket, she places fresh water in a bowl around the small shrine she's set up, and an apple for the gods; she cleans every item of clothing either of us have used the previous day; and then she puts on a CD of monks chanting and sits stock-still in her chair in meditation.Much of Japan is like that still, and if you're arriving in Tokyo soon \u2013 especially if you're coming from far away and are jet lagged \u2013 the first place I'd recommend you see is the Tsukiji fish market (tsukiji-market.or.jp) visiting ideally as close to 5am as possible. Nothing will convince you more quickly that you're not in Kansas (or Hampstead) any more, and the sushi you can try nearby will tell you you're not at Wagamama either.From there I'd suggest heading to Ueno, a slightly down-at-heel area, built around a park, that still has a\u00a0faintly rural feel and reminds you of what Tokyo used to be when its Meiji refashioners, in the late 19th century, took their cues from London and Paris. Wander through the Tokyo National Museum (tnm.go.jp/en), which has perhaps the best collection of classical Japanese art in the world.At dusk, for this opening immersion, I would head towards Asakusa Kannon Temple, whose great front gate makes you feel as if you're entering a Hiroshige woodcut. One of the centres of Shitamachi, the old \"Low City\" of Edo (even by the end of the 18th century the city was the world's largest in terms of population), it still has echoes of the time when it sat at the heart of a bustling entertainment district, home to the country's first cinema and first music hall.The power of Japan, for me, lies in everything you find here that you couldn't imagine seeing in another country, even \u2013 sometimes especially \u2013 when what you think you're enjoying is something foreign, deliciously lost in translation. Last month, McDonald's outlets across the nation were serving Tsukimi, or \"Moon-Viewing\" burgers \u2013 a moon-like fried egg between the buns \u2013 in honour of the harvest moon that has been ritually observed for millennia across east Asia.On your second day, there's something to be said for going to Kamakura (city.kamakura.kanagawa.jp/english), the leafy, temple-filled mini-Kyoto that's only an hour away from Tokyo by train. Just ramble through its leafy lanes, walk into shrines that look deserted, breathe in the quiet of a place that was Japan's capital from 1185 to 1333 and has been a kind of resting place ever after.It's part of the curiosity of contemporary Japan that it presents you with some of the most jangled and mishmashed, unattractive urban landscapes in the world and yet, in many places, every little shop and cafe you enter will be immaculate and exquisite, whether it plays only Beatles records or Mozart. The details are often perfect, even as the whole sounds like 15 languages shouted all at once. And to savour Japan, it makes most sense to seek out its privacies, its secret corners; until I came here, I\u00a0never realised that the society famous for its conformist surfaces is \u2013 for that very reason, perhaps \u2013 a home to wild obsessives, who have collected every King Crimson bootleg in existence or will show you their collection of videos of ancient Hawaii Five-O episodes.In these ways, it's best to browse Tokyo, to get lost, almost as if you were in some virtual reality; more than any city I know, the place is like a website, alight with odd links, hobbyists' addenda, animated figures and racing graphics. And once you've tasted a\u00a0little of the old city, like striking a\u00a0gong or a temple bell before a feast, you can fling yourself into the new. The Mori Art Museum (mori.art.museum/eng) on the 53rd floor of the Mori Tower in the Roppongi Hills complex, say, whose sleek passageways and views over the city and make it look like a high-definition TV screen writ large. There are dog rental stores around town, vending machines selling underwear and whisky, and three-star Michelin restaurants with only a single table and a few seats at the bar (Yukimura, 1-5-5.Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku, +81 3 5772 1610). At the New Otani hotel (newotani.co.jp/en/tokyo) you can enjoy a\u00a0400-year-old Japanese garden and a rooftop rose garden with 2,000 bushes, where fireflies flicker in the summer.The very best side of Tokyo comes out \u2013 though perhaps this is true of every place \u2013 when you can see the strange and the familiar all at once. Go out drinking in Roppongi on a Saturday night and you'll half-believe you're in LA, or at least Hong Kong, among the Romanian restaurants and Filipina hostess clubs; then, on Sunday morning, walk down Omotesando street, past all the note-perfect French cafes and high-end boutiques, with the Kings Road of Takeshita street just a short hop away.On Sunday afternoons, on Jingu Bridge, at the end of Omotesando, \"cosplay\" (a mix of \"costume\" and \"play\") girls from the suburbs come out in their wild outfits, dressed as nurses or goths or dominatrices or Alice in Wonderland. Costumes, you will soon register, are as outlandish as uniforms are constant in Japan, if only because the same people who are dressed down for six days every week get their own back by dressing up on Sundays.Right behind the bridge, wide pathways take you to the Meiji shrine (meijijingu.or.jp/english), where you are back in the thick, textured, slightly elusive place that has altered very little over centuries. Shrine maidens dressed all in white \u2013 traditionally they were virgins \u2013 are selling good luck charms for passing exams to the wild teenage girls in microskirts and fishnet stockings whose hairstyles seem to have been copied from Lady Gaga.Everywhere in Japan there are things that are worth doing just because they can't be done in quite the same way anywhere else. Try to arrive at a\u00a0fancy department store at 10 am, when it opens, to see the scores of perfectly coiffed employees lined up to call out a formal welcome. Try Isetan (isetan.co.jp) in Shinjuku; you can spend the next many hours lost in the capacious food halls in its basement. Look for the three-course \"teishoku\" set lunches, which will offer you the same food you'd spend \u00a320 on at dinnertime for a third of the price. And never spurn a convenience store, because there is more in their small heaven and earth than is dreamed of in your philosophy.The first time I came to Japan, as a sightseer 25 years ago, I made sure to take myself to Tokyo Disneyland (tokyodisneyresort.co.jp) so I could see the whole seamless, public and well-organised society in miniature; I could get a (cartoon version, but defiantly partisan) tour of Japanese history in one pavilion, eat melon sorbets in another and see on every side how Japan had taken something deeply American and made it entirely its own (and cleaner, quieter, more efficient). In time though, after I came to live here, I began to see how much of Japan can be enjoyed as a kind of theme park, where most people are dressed up to play a part, as polite, chirpy and eager to please as one of Walt Disney's Mouseketeers, and inhabiting what looks less like real life and more like a super-synthetic version of The Happiest Place on Earth.There are 35 million people in Greater Tokyo \u2013 more than in all of Canada \u2013 and when you arrive at Tokyo station you may feel that they're all streaming past you at the same time. Two million souls do indeed pour through Shinjuku station every day. But what ultimately stays with many a\u00a0visitor to the epicentre of Japan are the moments of stillness, of collectedness, of almost mysterious remoteness, where you see the changeless nerve centre from which all the wild changes arise.Pico Iyer is the author of nine books, including The Lady and the Monk (IB Tauris), about his first year in Japan", "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "Asia", "City breaks", "Travel", "Cultural trips"], "title": "Big in Japan: why Tokyo is top"},{"date": "2010-10-01T23:06:13Z", "country": "japan", "content": "On one level the Royal Opera's recent tour of Japan was, as a manager described it, \"a team building exercise on a rather extravagant scale\". The party of 250 people included a full orchestra and chorus, backstage staff, technical crew and management support. And indeed, in the time I spent following them around, I duly picked up on the warm and fuzzy feelings engendered by late-night sessions in karaoke bars, excitement over trips to Mount Fuji, the swapping of restaurant etiquette tips and problem-solving sessions involving apparently incomprehensible tube maps.Not that there weren't operas as well. Performances of La Traviata and Manon in Tokyo and Yokohama were enthusiastically received despite some alarums and excursions involving understudies, and understudies of understudies. And aside from the full-stage productions, the Japanese promoters of the tour \u2013 who accepted all financial risk for the venture, leaving the opera house to break even at worst, also asked for a concert performance that would both show off the orchestra and chorus as well as somehow exemplifying British music for Japanese audiences.\"So I spent quite a lot of time planning it,\" explained director of music Antonio Pappano over a breakfast of fish, soup and rice at his Tokyo hotel. \"We had some Elgar, Britten and Vaughan Williams. There was a bit of Gilbert & Sullivan and a few other things. I think we came up with a pretty lovely programme, but they said no. It turned out what they really wanted was Handel's Messiah.\" Which is what the orchestra, chorus and soloists of the Royal Opera performed, albeit in the expanded Mozart orchestration. The promoters' instincts as to local taste proved sound and, to the slight surprise of the company, a significant portion of the packed audience actually stood up for the Hallelujah Chorus.While this throwback to a Clive James-esque slice of \"how others see us\" was a minor element of the tour as a whole, it is nevertheless true that Japanese taste \u2013 and Chinese, American, Korean and many other tastes \u2013 will not be irrelevant to the calculations made in London over the coming years. The tour might have marked something of a culmination of Pappano's successful nine-year artistic tenure at Covent Garden, but it also signified the beginning of a new, and far more ambitious, phase of the company's development. Although they are bracing themselves for cuts to their grant, which currently accounts for around 25% of their total income, chief executive Tony Hall says, \"The really big strategic issue facing us is that in the very near future there will only be three or maybe four big opera houses in the world. There will be the Met in New York, maybe La Scala because of its historic reputation, maybe Paris and a few others you could\u00a0argue over. But we will certainly be one of those world-class venues, and we therefore need Japanese audiences to see just how good we are because they will not just be seeing us on stage. The digital age will make a huge difference. We are already available on big-screen relays to cinemas, on DVD and via our Japanese language website. It won't be long before people will have, on demand, the world's great opera houses piped live into their homes. Occasionally people say that audiences for opera are small. That's not even true in national terms. But when you think in a global sense, the audiences are enormous and we will be available to all of them.\"The contrast with the last time the company toured with a full orchestra and chorus, in 1998 to Finland, Germany and Edinburgh, is stark. The music making might have been exemplary under Bernard Haitink (who restricted himself to matters in the pit, the opposite of Pappano's access-all-areas, hands-on approach), but back then the company was homeless while Covent Garden was closed for renovations and there was a genuine fear that it might not reopen. And while the worst of the management convulsions that had destabilised the company over the previous few years were over, the company still felt organisationally fragile.Of course, the house reopened in 1999 as a far more welcoming building, both to its audience and to those who just fancy a nose around or a drink in a bar. And as well as being less remote to its audience, the organisation is also now better linked to other arts companies and has a kind of mentoring role for groups such as Ballet Black and Music Theatre Wales.But just as the 1990s problems of organisation and access were not solved without pain, so the road to the digital future is already proving bumpy. One night in Japan, the opera company hierarchy were obliged to calm a Twitter storm of protest about their apparently heavy-handed response to a copyright issue on the opera blog Intermezzo. Last week a new row over a perceived \"rights grab\" as to ownership of work done on Royal Opera productions blew up. \"We are in slightly uncharted waters,\" Hall admits. \"We are in a very different age to a decade or two ago when significant sums of money could be made from studio recordings. That money is no longer there. It is also difficult to keep track of a market that moves very fast. So we are trying to do something with our contracts that allows us to respond, with the artists and with their consent, as fast as we can to exploit our productions in the marketplace, knowing that the returns are much lower than they were two decades ago.\"Although the business model remains a work in progress, there is general consensus that in musical terms Pappano has pretty much got it right. \"When even Massenet can seem deep, something remarkable is going on,\" said one reviewer about the new production of Manon earlier this summer. \"Under Antonio Pappano's stewardship, the Royal Opera is experiencing a golden age of musical sensitivity and dramatic insight.\" Another commentator compared the organisation to a big Rolls-Royce \"just purring along\".Pappano says it took him five years to feel in proper command of the orchestra \u2013 \"to get that feeling you really understand each other, that you are inhabiting each other's sound world.\" He is plainly held in very high regard by his players and singers and while nearly everyone I spoke to in Japan had the decency to admit that the oft-used description of them as a family was cheesy, they also said it did bear some resemblance to the truth. More importantly, this team spirit carried through to the stage, most notably when soprano Ermonela Jaho \u2013 herself a late replacement for Angela Gheorgiou, who pulled out of the tour just a week before departure \u2013 twice had to be replaced after the first act of La Traviata by her understudy Ailyn P\u00e9rez. Potential artistic \u2013 and commercial \u2013 disaster was avoided with impressive ease.Pappano returns to the house next week with a concert performance of Bizet's The Pearl Fishers. He likes to give the orchestra a chance to play on stage before they disappear into the darkness of the pit for the rest of the season. \"And I have a very warm spot in my heart for this work. The orchestral writing is typical Bizet but with an element of the sea \u2013 so a different tumult to Carmen, but still something pretty meaty for the home forces to chew on.\"The new season also features a rare production of Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user and a series of operas that appear to feature \"women under duress\": the baroque rarity Niobe (witnesses murder of her 14 children and is then turned to stone), Adriana Lecouvreur (poisoned) and Mark-Anthony Turnage's new work Anna Nicole \u2013 with lyrics by Richard Thomas of Jerry Springer: The Opera fame \u2013 about the Playboy model and controversial heiress who died aged 39 in 2007 after an apparent drug overdose.\"It's a wonderful season,\" says Pappano, \"although I'm also aware that 2011/12 could well be a bit tougher financially. But the company has been prudent and we have tried very hard not to make any compromises in the repertoire. All this will be discussed over the next few months, although for me changing a title for financial reasons will really be a defeat. What is good is that all the decisions are thought through from top to bottom of the organisation. Yes, the beans are counted, but that is just part of the equation.\"Pappano's current contract will take him to 2014, but he is already scheduling 2015. He wouldn't be short\u00a0of offers if he did want to move, and his recent BBC television series Opera Italia, which will be repeated later this month, has seen him increasingly cast as the accessible front man for classical music, a job he admits is both attractive and important. \"But I really am very happy here and I am up for the fight that we have ahead of us. In the end, all that matters is what is on stage. It really is all about the work and that makes me optimistic. I know the people I'm working with and I know the capacity they have. You come back from something like this Japan tour and you bring home all the good habits about working together you've picked up on the road. Everyone wants to make it work so we have every chance of pulling it off. I'm Italian so I like cooking analogies; when you have top ingredients you have to do something drastically wrong to spoil the meal. I think the chances are we will prepare something that will taste pretty good.\"See more photographs from behind the scenes of the tour at theguardian.com/classical", "tags": ["Opera", "Culture", "Music", "Royal Opera House"], "title": "The Royal Opera on tour in Japan"},{"date": "2010-12-14T07:32:59Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The United Kingdom has a problem, it seems, when it comes to maths education. Results from an international testing study last week triggered a fresh round of soul-searching after they revealed that the UK is falling down the global rankings for reading, science and particularly maths.And, today, new research revealed exclusively in Education Guardian shows England, Wales and Northern Ireland finishing bottom of another kind of league table, which compares countries according to the number of young people persisting with any kind of maths education beyond the age of 16.The study, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, shows that among 24 states, these three \"home\" nations are the only ones where fewer than 20% of pupils take mathematics in any form during what the researchers classify as the \"upper secondary\" years.Scotland is one of three other countries where the figures stand in the 20-50% range. The remaining 18 countries all have post-16 participation rates for maths of more than 50%, the paper reports, with rates running at more than 95% in eight of them, including Sweden, Finland, Japan and Korea.\"The findings are stark,\" says the paper. \"By any standards, we are out on a limb.\"Not all students who take maths post-16 in other countries are studying advanced mathematics along the lines of A-levels. However, even when only pupils taking maths to advanced level are compared, the UK is still towards the bottom of the class, the research reveals.In Japan, some 85% take advanced maths, equivalent to at least AS-level, in upper secondary; in Taiwan, the figure is 70%; in South Korea, it is 57%; and in New Zealand, 41%. By contrast, advanced maths take-up in the UK ranges from 11% in Wales through 13% in England to 15% in Northern Ireland and 23% in Scotland, with a UK average of between 13% and 14%.Is this a problem? And if so, how should it be tackled? Among those calling for urgent action have been the CBI, the business lobby group, which published a paper in August recommending that all young people continue with some form of maths or numeracy education post-16, whether they were on an academic track or training in the workplace.Young people leaving school with poor maths skills are costing the economy \u00a32.4bn a year, the CBI said, and without an \"uplift\" in mathematics and numeracy capabilities, the UK would find itself falling behind in fields such as environmental technology, pharmaceuticals and the creative industries.Marcus du Sautoy, professor for the public understanding of science at Oxford University, says: \"It's absolutely fundamental that we do increase these numbers. Other countries recognise the central importance of mathematics as part of education and that it must not just stop at age 16. It is the foundation of the whole of science and technological understanding, and we need more maths people. Banks, for example, are crying out for people with mathematical ability.\"The situation in this country is not entirely bleak, with numbers taking A-level actually growing substantially in recent years, after problematic changes to the course prompted an exodus from the subject in 2001. However, the Nuffield paper argues that A-level maths is still attracting a lower proportion of students than it did in the mid-1990s.Jeremy Hodgen, of King's College, London, who led the research, says that many people who need to be proficient with numerical concepts, such as future primary teachers and nurses, are missing out in the UK by dropping the subject at 16.He says: \"Few primary teachers will have done any maths between the age of 16 and their early- to mid-20s, when they take a post graduate certificate in education. That is serious.\"An obvious solution would appear to be simply to make the subject compulsory after the age of 16. After all, as the study points out, eight countries require all pupils, whether in academic or vocational education, to persevere with it.However, attempts to curtail post-16 freedom of subject choice, or even to promote greater breadth of study, have foundered in this country in the past.In 2000, reforms to the A-level which introduced today's AS exams, taken after a year of sixth-form study, were meant to encourage students to take a broader range of subjects, with those who favoured art taking maths or a science at least to AS, and vice versa. But the reform largely failed in this aim.Alan Smithers, director of the centre for education and employment research at Buckingham University, believes compulsion will not work.He says: \"I think it's probably better that, when they get to upper secondary, young people are choosing for themselves. The main problem here is that we do not have the clear pathways that other countries have, where maths is integral to the qualifications that people want to take, whatever they want to do in the future.\"In Germany, for example, young people have to study academic maths to gain the Abitur, the school-leaving qualification for pupils in grammar schools, but also in apprenticeship courses.Given that compulsion would be tricky here, the Nuffield paper suggests other ideas. Hodgen says we should look to New Zealand, where the number of students taking some form of advanced maths is more than treble the figure for England.New Zealand offers a more attractive range of mathematical options to them, says Dr Hodgen, including a \"modern statistics\" choice which might win more followers here than the \"really traditional\" approach to statistics of A-levels.His paper advocates a government review and also the introduction of a maths course which could be pitched at those who gain C and B grades at maths GCSE, who tend now not to opt for A-level.This is in line with ideas set out in another paper over the summer, by the Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education(Acme), which acts as a bridge between maths teachers and the government. It advocated a new set of maths \"pathways\" at post-16 level, to tackle what it said was an inadequate range of options for students not committed to A-levels.Another idea put forward in Acme's paper seems to be winning favour. It has a familiar ring. The government could introduce a new \"baccalaureate\", rewarding students for post-16 study in maths, English and four other subjects.With the coalition already introducing a GCSE-equivalent English baccalaureate, recognising success in five academic subjects, a debate around a post-16 version may be coming. In any case, expect pressure for ministers to start looking at this subject in detail to continue.www.nuffieldfoundation.org", "tags": ["Mathematics", "Schools", "Education"], "title": "Students taking maths post-16: Japan 85%, UK 14%"},{"date": "2010-11-18T15:39:10Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The arrest today of the de facto leader of Japan's most powerful underworld organisation has sparked fears of a violent internal power struggle, as police step up their crackdown on organised crime.Kiyoshi Takayama, the second-in-command of the Yamaguchi-gumi, is being held on suspicion of extorting about \u00a540m (\u00a3300,000) from a man involved in the construction industry.The national police agency declared war on the Yamaguchi-gumi in September in an attempt to rein it in before the release of its leader, Kenichi Shinoda, from prison next spring.Shinoda began a six-year prison sentence in December 2005 for violating gun control laws and entrusted the running of the Yamaguchi-gumi to Takayama, who is also head of the organisation's biggest and most violent faction, the Kodo-kai.\"If Takayama is successfully prosecuted it will be devastating for the Yamaguchi-gumi, and could even spark a war for control of the organisation,\" said Jake Adelstein, author of Tokyo Vice: an American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan.\"He has been running the organisation with an iron fist, and other factions will see his arrest as an opportunity. His antagonism towards the police has angered some in the organisation. He is not a popular man.\"Takayama, 63, did not resist arrest during a dawn police raid involving 140 officers at a Kodo-kai base in the western city of Kobe. He has, however, denied involvement in the extortion case, according to Japanese media.Although he was not present at meetings with the alleged extortion victim, police believe they can build a case against him using a law that holds gang leaders responsible for crimes committed by their juniors.When Shinoda was sworn in as the Yamaguchi-gumi's sixth don in July 2005, he vowed to expand the 95-year-old organisation's influence beyond its traditional Kobe base.Until recently Japan's crime syndicates, which are not illegal, operated with relative impunity. Gangsters made no attempt to hide their underworld affiliations and listed their offices in the phone book.But Takayama's arrest has heightened fears of a dramatic deterioration in relations with the police.Takaharu Ando, the combative head of the national police agency, has vowed to destroy the Yamaguchi-gumi as part of an unprecedented crackdown on organised crime. \"We want them to disappear from public life,\" he told reporters after his appointment last year.Aside from gambling, loan sharking, protection rackets and prostitution, the yakuza have added stock market manipulation and front companies to their myriad illegal activities.Takayama was influential in the Yamaguchi-gumi's expansion into Tokyo, an audacious move that led to several shootings in the capital in 2007.The Kodo-kai faction, thought to have about 4,000 members, has dispensed with the yakuza's traditional policy of co-operating with the police. Its members have followed officers to their homes, photographed them with members of their families, and attempted to unearth information that could be used to blackmail them.In other major departures from yakuza tradition, they never confess to their crimes and have been accused of targeting civilians.There were about 87,000 gangsters active in Japan at the end of 2005, according to the national police agency.

Some questioned the validity of GDP figures as a reliable indicator, pointing out the vast differences in per capita income between the two countries.Conservative commentators, meanwhile, issued an increasingly hollow-sounding exhortation: that in the Asian context at least, Japan should never be comfortable with second place.But with some economists expecting Japan to give way to several other countries, including the likes of Indonesia and Turkey, by the middle of the century, the icy blast of economic realism from its neighbour has left the Japanese approaching 2011 in contemplative mood.After 20 years of stagnation, a decade of battles with deflation, and the dual spectres of a shrinking workforce and rising elderly population, some are suggesting that Japan should lower its expectations and embrace a future of frugality and sustainability.And, in recognising that the ceaseless quest for growth may not be at the heart of a nation's wellbeing, Japan could offer lessons for other developed economies as they scramble to avoid their own versions of the \"lost decade\".Shikataganai, an oft-heard expression here, is a verbal shrug emitted when hopes are dashed by the supremacy of external forces \u2013 and that Japan is at the cusp of a transition from economic miracle worker to a less obtrusive participant in global capitalism has a feel of inevitability to it.Few people believe the current members of the political class that authored Japan's postwar transformation have the wherewithal to conjure yet another miracle. Nor, despite the best intentions of the left-of-centre government, do they appear to believe their future lies in recalibrating foreign policy away from the US and towards the rest of Asia.On the contrary, relations with China will remain Janus-faced for the foreseeable future. Japan views China as an economic and military rival, but also as a site for its manufacturing plants and, thanks to the rise of a Chinese middle class, a crucial market for the cars and electronics it produces.While conservatives fret over the pace of China's economic development, and the size of its defence budget, a new voice is emerging: one that asks why a country that spent 250 years in sakoku isolation \u2013 a period that saw little economic growth \u2013 cannot beat a retreat into a modified version of the past.It isn't hard to see why such a radical rethink of Japan's economic raison d'etre should at least be debated. The Nikkei stock index is only at about a quarter of its all-time high of 1989; real estate is worth about a quarter of what it was in 1974. While Japan's (reformed) banks dodged the worst of the Lehman shock, the country is displaying the symptoms of a malaise it once dismissed as a western disease: unemployment, the emergence of the \"working poor\", a widening income gap, and the ignominious spectacle of a corporate icon, Toyota, called to account for shoddy workmanship in the committee rooms of the US Congress.It is easy to overstate Japan's sense of disquiet, but even optimists accept that the certainties of the postwar period are creaking under the strain of economic realities. Graduates are no longer guaranteed lifetime employment with major companies and, even if they were, fewer are willing to submit to the work ethic expected of their baby-boomer fathers.The previous generation endured commutes on packed trains, long working hours, few holidays and a cramped existence in the soulless suburbs. Employers' expectations have changed little, but the old quid pro quo \u2013 that workers will see their standard of living improve \u2013 no longer applies.While the postwar generation worked at a time of population growth and rising wages, the young workers of today have only ever known weak consumption, falling prices and contraction.Japan's skewed demographics will only lend weight to the view that its people will have to recalibrate their expectations. Government figures estimate that the population, now at 127 million, could fall by about 40 million by 2050, when almost 40% of the population will be aged 65 or older.Japan depends heavily on Middle East oil and imports around 50% of its food, but its comparatively homogeneous society has never shown much enthusiasm for similarly impressive influxes of foreign labour, despite warnings that it will need to accept 10 million immigrant workers over the next half -century to keep its economy ticking over.There is little sign now, however, soon after Japan's parliament approved yet another stimulus package, that policy-makers are about to accept the case for sustainability over growth.Two decades ago, a group of economists predicted that 2010 would be the year that Japan finally overtook the US as the world's biggest economy. How long will it be before bets are being taken on when it becomes the first economy to shake off its addiction to growth and give other mature economies a glimpse into a more frugal future?What's striking about the images in photographer Michael Wolf's new book Tokyo Compression, aside from the lengths to which people will go to wedge themselves into a bulging carriage, must be the looks of resignation among the victims.

Despite conducting two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, North Korea has yet to prove that it had produced a viable weapon.\"These developments \u2026 are a clear manifestation of the risks posed by North Korea's defiance of its international obligations and commitments,\" the US envoy Glyn Davies told a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in Vienna.IAEA officials believe Pyongyang's enrichment activities had begun before April last year, when the UN body's inspectors were last permitted to visit the country.\"If so, there is a clear likelihood that [it] has built other uranium enrichment-related facilities in its territory,\" Davies said.The IAEA's director-general, Yukiya Amano, voiced \"great concern\" over the reports, and called on Pyongyang to allow inspectors to return to verify the claims.Japan, the US and South Korea have rejected Chinese calls for an emergency meeting of countries involved in multilateral talks to end North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.Instead, the three countries will meet in Washington on Monday to discuss a unified response to the attack and the revelations about Pyongyang's nuclear programme.China said it would keep a \"close watch\" on the meeting. \"As the situation on the Korean peninsula is highly complicated and sensitive, we expect the meeting to ease tensions and promote dialogue, rather then heighten tensions and intensify confrontation,\" said Jiang Yu, a foreign ministry spokeswoman.The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who will meet her Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Washington, said efforts were being made to work with Russia and China to prevent the crisis from growing.\"North Korea poses an immediate threat to the region around it, particularly to South Korea and Japan, and a medium-term threat, should it collapse, to China,\" Clinton said.", "tags": ["US military", "South Korea", "North Korea", "Japan", "World news", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "US and Japan begin joint military exercise"},{"date": "2010-11-15T15:21:35Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Cardiff council's leader Rodney Berman will today attend a conference in Japan to find inspiration on how to tackle health deprivation in Cardiff.Berman was invited to join the global forum on urbanisation and health, being held in Kobe, by the World Health Organisation (WHO) \u2013 who have funded the trip.With the authority achieving healthy city status in 2009, Cardiff council said the aim was to find new ways to tackle health deprivation in Cardiff as well as other 'urban health challenges'.

The future of the long-standing Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) programme, which has sponsored more than 50,000 mainly native English speakers to work as language assistants in schools in Japan since 1987, has been put into doubt while a government review is carried out.According to reports in the Daily Yomiuri newspaper, the foreign ministry, which is one of the government departments involved in the programme, has cut its request for JET funding in 2011 by 14% to $1.6m.Boston schools told to retest 15,000 studentsBoston's public schools authority last month agreed to reassess the English language skills of its students and provide additional language support. The settlement with the departments of justice and education follows claims that the authority had breached equal opportunities legislation by failing to properly identify and adequately serve thousands of English language learners (ELLs) since 2003.The city's current superintendent of education conceded that over 15,000 students who had been wrongly assessed as having adequate English skills, who were not submitted for language skills assessment or who were inadequately tested, would be retested and offered additional language classes where necessary.The settlement means that Boston city officials will avoid facing charges in court, but eight other school districts from across the US are facing similar investigations by federal authorities.According to Education Week, federal officials are scrutinising six of the eight, including Los Angeles Unified School District, to establish whether the authorities are \"ensuring access to equal educational opportunities\" for ELLs.Women golfers get lessons on fairwaysWomen golfers in the US have been offered specialist language training in their breaks between play at major tournaments, to help them communicate with the media and fans.

Players from South Korea, who dominate the golf tour, were accused of not making enough effort to engage with the media.The one-to-one tuition, which has been running since the beginning of this year, is aimed at building players' confidence in press conferences and when meeting fans.Indian workers offered speaking skills in SaudiA not-for-profit organisation based in southern India has teamed up with language training provider ELS to offer English classes for expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia.The Centre for Information and Guidance India is promoting the courses, which start in Jeddah later this month, to develop the spoken communication skills of Indian workers in Saudi Arabia.A spokesman for ELS told the Arab News newspaper: \"India is emerging as a superpower mainly because of the abundant availability of skilled manpower.

Now that Shanghai looks in parts like Beverly Hills and Delhi is lighting up with Thai restaurants, there are few cities on the planet that are less western than Tokyo \u2013 even if it's not necessarily a part of any east that you might recognise. The abiding allure of Japan's huge network of tiny details is that, like something in a Salman Rushdie novel, it seems to blur all notions of high and low, east and west, old and new into one state-of-the-art global amusement park that is wildly fresh and novel in its best incarnations, and at least zany in its worst.I've lived at a safe distance from Japan's capital for 23 years now, in Kyoto and Nara, three or four hours away by train and several centuries away in terms of their antique pasts. But if I were going to Tokyo tomorrow, I would, on arrival, hold off on the \"maid cafes\" in the nerds' electronic hive of Akihabara, on the Hysteric Glamour fashions around Harajuku, even on the gleaming shops of the Ginza that have long made Tokyo seem an early visitor from the 23rd century. Instead I'd begin by looking for the old.The evergreen riddle of Japan, after all, is that all its revolving-door fashions, fascination with the west and hunger for the new never seem to make it any less Japanese at the core; the place is like a froth of shifting surfaces and flashing images projected on an old, strangely shaped piece of wood that never moves. My Japanese wife is mad for Marilyn Manson and Metallica and used to gun her Honda Hurricane around the winding streets of Kyoto. But every day, before she heads out in her leather jacket, she places fresh water in a bowl around the small shrine she's set up, and an apple for the gods; she cleans every item of clothing either of us have used the previous day; and then she puts on a CD of monks chanting and sits stock-still in her chair in meditation.Much of Japan is like that still, and if you're arriving in Tokyo soon \u2013 especially if you're coming from far away and are jet lagged \u2013 the first place I'd recommend you see is the Tsukiji fish market (tsukiji-market.or.jp) visiting ideally as close to 5am as possible. Nothing will convince you more quickly that you're not in Kansas (or Hampstead) any more, and the sushi you can try nearby will tell you you're not at Wagamama either.From there I'd suggest heading to Ueno, a slightly down-at-heel area, built around a park, that still has a\u00a0faintly rural feel and reminds you of what Tokyo used to be when its Meiji refashioners, in the late 19th century, took their cues from London and Paris. Wander through the Tokyo National Museum (tnm.go.jp/en), which has perhaps the best collection of classical Japanese art in the world.At dusk, for this opening immersion, I would head towards Asakusa Kannon Temple, whose great front gate makes you feel as if you're entering a Hiroshige woodcut. One of the centres of Shitamachi, the old \"Low City\" of Edo (even by the end of the 18th century the city was the world's largest in terms of population), it still has echoes of the time when it sat at the heart of a bustling entertainment district, home to the country's first cinema and first music hall.The power of Japan, for me, lies in everything you find here that you couldn't imagine seeing in another country, even \u2013 sometimes especially \u2013 when what you think you're enjoying is something foreign, deliciously lost in translation. Last month, McDonald's outlets across the nation were serving Tsukimi, or \"Moon-Viewing\" burgers \u2013 a moon-like fried egg between the buns \u2013 in honour of the harvest moon that has been ritually observed for millennia across east Asia.On your second day, there's something to be said for going to Kamakura (city.kamakura.kanagawa.jp/english), the leafy, temple-filled mini-Kyoto that's only an hour away from Tokyo by train. Just ramble through its leafy lanes, walk into shrines that look deserted, breathe in the quiet of a place that was Japan's capital from 1185 to 1333 and has been a kind of resting place ever after.It's part of the curiosity of contemporary Japan that it presents you with some of the most jangled and mishmashed, unattractive urban landscapes in the world and yet, in many places, every little shop and cafe you enter will be immaculate and exquisite, whether it plays only Beatles records or Mozart. The details are often perfect, even as the whole sounds like 15 languages shouted all at once. And to savour Japan, it makes most sense to seek out its privacies, its secret corners; until I came here, I\u00a0never realised that the society famous for its conformist surfaces is \u2013 for that very reason, perhaps \u2013 a home to wild obsessives, who have collected every King Crimson bootleg in existence or will show you their collection of videos of ancient Hawaii Five-O episodes.In these ways, it's best to browse Tokyo, to get lost, almost as if you were in some virtual reality; more than any city I know, the place is like a website, alight with odd links, hobbyists' addenda, animated figures and racing graphics. And once you've tasted a\u00a0little of the old city, like striking a\u00a0gong or a temple bell before a feast, you can fling yourself into the new. The Mori Art Museum (mori.art.museum/eng) on the 53rd floor of the Mori Tower in the Roppongi Hills complex, say, whose sleek passageways and views over the city and make it look like a high-definition TV screen writ large. There are dog rental stores around town, vending machines selling underwear and whisky, and three-star Michelin restaurants with only a single table and a few seats at the bar (Yukimura, 1-5-5.Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku, +81 3 5772 1610). At the New Otani hotel (newotani.co.jp/en/tokyo) you can enjoy a\u00a0400-year-old Japanese garden and a rooftop rose garden with 2,000 bushes, where fireflies flicker in the summer.The very best side of Tokyo comes out \u2013 though perhaps this is true of every place \u2013 when you can see the strange and the familiar all at once. Go out drinking in Roppongi on a Saturday night and you'll half-believe you're in LA, or at least Hong Kong, among the Romanian restaurants and Filipina hostess clubs; then, on Sunday morning, walk down Omotesando street, past all the note-perfect French cafes and high-end boutiques, with the Kings Road of Takeshita street just a short hop away.On Sunday afternoons, on Jingu Bridge, at the end of Omotesando, \"cosplay\" (a mix of \"costume\" and \"play\") girls from the suburbs come out in their wild outfits, dressed as nurses or goths or dominatrices or Alice in Wonderland. Costumes, you will soon register, are as outlandish as uniforms are constant in Japan, if only because the same people who are dressed down for six days every week get their own back by dressing up on Sundays.Right behind the bridge, wide pathways take you to the Meiji shrine (meijijingu.or.jp/english), where you are back in the thick, textured, slightly elusive place that has altered very little over centuries. Shrine maidens dressed all in white \u2013 traditionally they were virgins \u2013 are selling good luck charms for passing exams to the wild teenage girls in microskirts and fishnet stockings whose hairstyles seem to have been copied from Lady Gaga.Everywhere in Japan there are things that are worth doing just because they can't be done in quite the same way anywhere else. Try to arrive at a\u00a0fancy department store at 10 am, when it opens, to see the scores of perfectly coiffed employees lined up to call out a formal welcome. Try Isetan (isetan.co.jp) in Shinjuku; you can spend the next many hours lost in the capacious food halls in its basement. Look for the three-course \"teishoku\" set lunches, which will offer you the same food you'd spend \u00a320 on at dinnertime for a third of the price. And never spurn a convenience store, because there is more in their small heaven and earth than is dreamed of in your philosophy.The first time I came to Japan, as a sightseer 25 years ago, I made sure to take myself to Tokyo Disneyland (tokyodisneyresort.co.jp) so I could see the whole seamless, public and well-organised society in miniature; I could get a (cartoon version, but defiantly partisan) tour of Japanese history in one pavilion, eat melon sorbets in another and see on every side how Japan had taken something deeply American and made it entirely its own (and cleaner, quieter, more efficient). In time though, after I came to live here, I began to see how much of Japan can be enjoyed as a kind of theme park, where most people are dressed up to play a part, as polite, chirpy and eager to please as one of Walt Disney's Mouseketeers, and inhabiting what looks less like real life and more like a super-synthetic version of The Happiest Place on Earth.There are 35 million people in Greater Tokyo \u2013 more than in all of Canada \u2013 and when you arrive at Tokyo station you may feel that they're all streaming past you at the same time. Two million souls do indeed pour through Shinjuku station every day. But what ultimately stays with many a\u00a0visitor to the epicentre of Japan are the moments of stillness, of collectedness, of almost mysterious remoteness, where you see the changeless nerve centre from which all the wild changes arise.Pico Iyer is the author of nine books, including The Lady and the Monk (IB Tauris), about his first year in Japan", "tags": ["Tokyo holidays", "Japan holidays", "Asia", "City breaks", "Travel", "Cultural trips"], "title": "Big in Japan: why Tokyo is top"},{"date": "2010-10-01T23:06:13Z", "country": "japan", "content": "On one level the Royal Opera's recent tour of Japan was, as a manager described it, \"a team building exercise on a rather extravagant scale\". The party of 250 people included a full orchestra and chorus, backstage staff, technical crew and management support. And indeed, in the time I spent following them around, I duly picked up on the warm and fuzzy feelings engendered by late-night sessions in karaoke bars, excitement over trips to Mount Fuji, the swapping of restaurant etiquette tips and problem-solving sessions involving apparently incomprehensible tube maps.Not that there weren't operas as well. Performances of La Traviata and Manon in Tokyo and Yokohama were enthusiastically received despite some alarums and excursions involving understudies, and understudies of understudies. And aside from the full-stage productions, the Japanese promoters of the tour \u2013 who accepted all financial risk for the venture, leaving the opera house to break even at worst, also asked for a concert performance that would both show off the orchestra and chorus as well as somehow exemplifying British music for Japanese audiences.\"So I spent quite a lot of time planning it,\" explained director of music Antonio Pappano over a breakfast of fish, soup and rice at his Tokyo hotel. \"We had some Elgar, Britten and Vaughan Williams. There was a bit of Gilbert & Sullivan and a few other things. I think we came up with a pretty lovely programme, but they said no. It turned out what they really wanted was Handel's Messiah.\" Which is what the orchestra, chorus and soloists of the Royal Opera performed, albeit in the expanded Mozart orchestration. The promoters' instincts as to local taste proved sound and, to the slight surprise of the company, a significant portion of the packed audience actually stood up for the Hallelujah Chorus.While this throwback to a Clive James-esque slice of \"how others see us\" was a minor element of the tour as a whole, it is nevertheless true that Japanese taste \u2013 and Chinese, American, Korean and many other tastes \u2013 will not be irrelevant to the calculations made in London over the coming years. The tour might have marked something of a culmination of Pappano's successful nine-year artistic tenure at Covent Garden, but it also signified the beginning of a new, and far more ambitious, phase of the company's development. Although they are bracing themselves for cuts to their grant, which currently accounts for around 25% of their total income, chief executive Tony Hall says, \"The really big strategic issue facing us is that in the very near future there will only be three or maybe four big opera houses in the world. There will be the Met in New York, maybe La Scala because of its historic reputation, maybe Paris and a few others you could\u00a0argue over. But we will certainly be one of those world-class venues, and we therefore need Japanese audiences to see just how good we are because they will not just be seeing us on stage. The digital age will make a huge difference. We are already available on big-screen relays to cinemas, on DVD and via our Japanese language website. It won't be long before people will have, on demand, the world's great opera houses piped live into their homes. Occasionally people say that audiences for opera are small. That's not even true in national terms. But when you think in a global sense, the audiences are enormous and we will be available to all of them.\"The contrast with the last time the company toured with a full orchestra and chorus, in 1998 to Finland, Germany and Edinburgh, is stark. The music making might have been exemplary under Bernard Haitink (who restricted himself to matters in the pit, the opposite of Pappano's access-all-areas, hands-on approach), but back then the company was homeless while Covent Garden was closed for renovations and there was a genuine fear that it might not reopen. And while the worst of the management convulsions that had destabilised the company over the previous few years were over, the company still felt organisationally fragile.Of course, the house reopened in 1999 as a far more welcoming building, both to its audience and to those who just fancy a nose around or a drink in a bar. And as well as being less remote to its audience, the organisation is also now better linked to other arts companies and has a kind of mentoring role for groups such as Ballet Black and Music Theatre Wales.But just as the 1990s problems of organisation and access were not solved without pain, so the road to the digital future is already proving bumpy. One night in Japan, the opera company hierarchy were obliged to calm a Twitter storm of protest about their apparently heavy-handed response to a copyright issue on the opera blog Intermezzo. Last week a new row over a perceived \"rights grab\" as to ownership of work done on Royal Opera productions blew up. \"We are in slightly uncharted waters,\" Hall admits. \"We are in a very different age to a decade or two ago when significant sums of money could be made from studio recordings. That money is no longer there. It is also difficult to keep track of a market that moves very fast. So we are trying to do something with our contracts that allows us to respond, with the artists and with their consent, as fast as we can to exploit our productions in the marketplace, knowing that the returns are much lower than they were two decades ago.\"Although the business model remains a work in progress, there is general consensus that in musical terms Pappano has pretty much got it right. \"When even Massenet can seem deep, something remarkable is going on,\" said one reviewer about the new production of Manon earlier this summer. \"Under Antonio Pappano's stewardship, the Royal Opera is experiencing a golden age of musical sensitivity and dramatic insight.\" Another commentator compared the organisation to a big Rolls-Royce \"just purring along\".Pappano says it took him five years to feel in proper command of the orchestra \u2013 \"to get that feeling you really understand each other, that you are inhabiting each other's sound world.\" He is plainly held in very high regard by his players and singers and while nearly everyone I spoke to in Japan had the decency to admit that the oft-used description of them as a family was cheesy, they also said it did bear some resemblance to the truth. More importantly, this team spirit carried through to the stage, most notably when soprano Ermonela Jaho \u2013 herself a late replacement for Angela Gheorgiou, who pulled out of the tour just a week before departure \u2013 twice had to be replaced after the first act of La Traviata by her understudy Ailyn P\u00e9rez. Potential artistic \u2013 and commercial \u2013 disaster was avoided with impressive ease.Pappano returns to the house next week with a concert performance of Bizet's The Pearl Fishers. He likes to give the orchestra a chance to play on stage before they disappear into the darkness of the pit for the rest of the season. \"And I have a very warm spot in my heart for this work. The orchestral writing is typical Bizet but with an element of the sea \u2013 so a different tumult to Carmen, but still something pretty meaty for the home forces to chew on.\"The new season also features a rare production of Wagner's Tannh\u00e4user and a series of operas that appear to feature \"women under duress\": the baroque rarity Niobe (witnesses murder of her 14 children and is then turned to stone), Adriana Lecouvreur (poisoned) and Mark-Anthony Turnage's new work Anna Nicole \u2013 with lyrics by Richard Thomas of Jerry Springer: The Opera fame \u2013 about the Playboy model and controversial heiress who died aged 39 in 2007 after an apparent drug overdose.\"It's a wonderful season,\" says Pappano, \"although I'm also aware that 2011/12 could well be a bit tougher financially. But the company has been prudent and we have tried very hard not to make any compromises in the repertoire. All this will be discussed over the next few months, although for me changing a title for financial reasons will really be a defeat. What is good is that all the decisions are thought through from top to bottom of the organisation.

He wouldn't be short\u00a0of offers if he did want to move, and his recent BBC television series Opera Italia, which will be repeated later this month, has seen him increasingly cast as the accessible front man for classical music, a job he admits is both attractive and important. \"But I really am very happy here and I am up for the fight that we have ahead of us. In the end, all that matters is what is on stage. It really is all about the work and that makes me optimistic. I know the people I'm working with and I know the capacity they have. You come back from something like this Japan tour and you bring home all the good habits about working together you've picked up on the road. Everyone wants to make it work so we have every chance of pulling it off. I'm Italian so I like cooking analogies; when you have top ingredients you have to do something drastically wrong to spoil the meal.

Results from an international testing study last week triggered a fresh round of soul-searching after they revealed that the UK is falling down the global rankings for reading, science and particularly maths.And, today, new research revealed exclusively in Education Guardian shows England, Wales and Northern Ireland finishing bottom of another kind of league table, which compares countries according to the number of young people persisting with any kind of maths education beyond the age of 16.The study, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, shows that among 24 states, these three \"home\" nations are the only ones where fewer than 20% of pupils take mathematics in any form during what the researchers classify as the \"upper secondary\" years.Scotland is one of three other countries where the figures stand in the 20-50% range. The remaining 18 countries all have post-16 participation rates for maths of more than 50%, the paper reports, with rates running at more than 95% in eight of them, including Sweden, Finland, Japan and Korea.\"The findings are stark,\" says the paper. \"By any standards, we are out on a limb.\"Not all students who take maths post-16 in other countries are studying advanced mathematics along the lines of A-levels. However, even when only pupils taking maths to advanced level are compared, the UK is still towards the bottom of the class, the research reveals.In Japan, some 85% take advanced maths, equivalent to at least AS-level, in upper secondary; in Taiwan, the figure is 70%; in South Korea, it is 57%; and in New Zealand, 41%. By contrast, advanced maths take-up in the UK ranges from 11% in Wales through 13% in England to 15% in Northern Ireland and 23% in Scotland, with a UK average of between 13% and 14%.Is this a problem? And if so, how should it be tackled? Among those calling for urgent action have been the CBI, the business lobby group, which published a paper in August recommending that all young people continue with some form of maths or numeracy education post-16, whether they were on an academic track or training in the workplace.Young people leaving school with poor maths skills are costing the economy \u00a32.4bn a year, the CBI said, and without an \"uplift\" in mathematics and numeracy capabilities, the UK would find itself falling behind in fields such as environmental technology, pharmaceuticals and the creative industries.Marcus du Sautoy, professor for the public understanding of science at Oxford University, says: \"It's absolutely fundamental that we do increase these numbers. Other countries recognise the central importance of mathematics as part of education and that it must not just stop at age 16. It is the foundation of the whole of science and technological understanding, and we need more maths people. Banks, for example, are crying out for people with mathematical ability.\"The situation in this country is not entirely bleak, with numbers taking A-level actually growing substantially in recent years, after problematic changes to the course prompted an exodus from the subject in 2001. However, the Nuffield paper argues that A-level maths is still attracting a lower proportion of students than it did in the mid-1990s.Jeremy Hodgen, of King's College, London, who led the research, says that many people who need to be proficient with numerical concepts, such as future primary teachers and nurses, are missing out in the UK by dropping the subject at 16.He says: \"Few primary teachers will have done any maths between the age of 16 and their early- to mid-20s, when they take a post graduate certificate in education. That is serious.\"An obvious solution would appear to be simply to make the subject compulsory after the age of 16. After all, as the study points out, eight countries require all pupils, whether in academic or vocational education, to persevere with it.However, attempts to curtail post-16 freedom of subject choice, or even to promote greater breadth of study, have foundered in this country in the past.In 2000, reforms to the A-level which introduced today's AS exams, taken after a year of sixth-form study, were meant to encourage students to take a broader range of subjects, with those who favoured art taking maths or a science at least to AS, and vice versa. But the reform largely failed in this aim.Alan Smithers, director of the centre for education and employment research at Buckingham University, believes compulsion will not work.He says: \"I think it's probably better that, when they get to upper secondary, young people are choosing for themselves. The main problem here is that we do not have the clear pathways that other countries have, where maths is integral to the qualifications that people want to take, whatever they want to do in the future.\"In Germany, for example, young people have to study academic maths to gain the Abitur, the school-leaving qualification for pupils in grammar schools, but also in apprenticeship courses.Given that compulsion would be tricky here, the Nuffield paper suggests other ideas. Hodgen says we should look to New Zealand, where the number of students taking some form of advanced maths is more than treble the figure for England.New Zealand offers a more attractive range of mathematical options to them, says Dr Hodgen, including a \"modern statistics\" choice which might win more followers here than the \"really traditional\" approach to statistics of A-levels.His paper advocates a government review and also the introduction of a maths course which could be pitched at those who gain C and B grades at maths GCSE, who tend now not to opt for A-level.This is in line with ideas set out in another paper over the summer, by the Advisory Committee on Mathematics Education(Acme), which acts as a bridge between maths teachers and the government. It advocated a new set of maths \"pathways\" at post-16 level, to tackle what it said was an inadequate range of options for students not committed to A-levels.Another idea put forward in Acme's paper seems to be winning favour. It has a familiar ring. The government could introduce a new \"baccalaureate\", rewarding students for post-16 study in maths, English and four other subjects.With the coalition already introducing a GCSE-equivalent English baccalaureate, recognising success in five academic subjects, a debate around a post-16 version may be coming. In any case, expect pressure for ministers to start looking at this subject in detail to continue.www.nuffieldfoundation.org", "tags": ["Mathematics", "Schools", "Education"], "title": "Students taking maths post-16: Japan 85%, UK 14%"},{"date": "2010-12-10T13:09:29Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Any film director who adapts an acclaimed novel runs the risk of upsetting the author's hypersensitive fans. The risks magnify when the writer is the famously ruminative Haruki Murakami.The Japanese author's surreal treatment of the ills of modern society has won him millions of fans worldwide and a reputation for introspection that will now extend to the big screen.The film adaptation of his bestseller Norwegian Wood opens in cinemas in Japan tomorrow, 23 years after the book first enraptured readers with its themes of love, loss and mental illness.Aware that Murakami's devotees will be looking to pounce on every perceived deviation from the novel, the movie's director, Tran Anh Hung, says every effort has been made to capture the essence of the writer's work.\"Murakami protected his work,\" Tran said of his first meeting with the \"quiet, very serious and very careful\" author in 2004. \"He gave us two conditions. One is that he would like to see the script. The other is that he would like to know what the budget would be for the movie.\"The French-Vietnamese director, and the film's producer, Shinji Ogawa, corresponded with Murakami for four years before winning his approval to make the film in 2008.Set in 1960s Tokyo, the Japanese-language film centres on the troubled, at times tortuous, life of a 19-year-old university student, Toru Watanabe, played by Kenichi Matsuyama, and his relationships with Naoko and Midori. Rinko Kikuchi, who was nominated for an Oscar for her supporting role in the 2006 movie Babel, plays the vulnerable Naoko, while the model Kiko Mizuhara makes her film debut as Midori.Tran said he had wanted to turn Murakami's best-known novel into a film since reading it in French translation in 1994 and was convinced the book's universal themes would work as well on screen as they had in print.\"I've read some other love stories, but this one is very special,\" he said during a recent visit to Tokyo. \"The book reveals some shadows that are hidden inside you.\"It was just a story of first love, but the first love that you lose almost immediately once you have it.\"I think this is a universal experience. This is probably why the book was such a success worldwide.\"That said, the 47-year-old director admitted there were moments when he wondered if he had done justice to a book that turned Murakami into an internationally acclaimed author.\"When I read the book, I really had this intuition that it was possible to make a film out of it,\" Tran said. \"And then, when you start working on it, everything that's left is fear \u2013 fear of not being able to do it.\"Norwegian Wood has sold more than 10m copies in Japan and 2.6m overseas since it was published in 1987. His other books, notably Kafka on the Shore and The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, have been translated into dozens of languages.Norwegian Wood represents another shift in emphasis for Tran, whose first movie, the moody The Scent of Green Papaya (1993), won the Camera d'Or at Cannes and was nominated for an Academy award. He won the Golden Lion award at the Venice film festival for Cyclo, his gritty 1995 film about a young rickshaw driver.Reviews in Japan have been mostly positive, although the film, nominated for the Golden Lion in Venice in September, did not win the prize.In the Japan Times, the veteran critic Mark Schilling praised the Taiwanese cinematographer Pin Bing Lee's \"dramatically stylish visuals\" but said that \"the drama of the characters' intertwined and tangled lives feels curiously inert\".", "tags": ["Film", "Haruki Murakami", "Culture", "Books", "Venice film festival 2010", "Japan", "World news", "Venice film festival", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Bated breath as Norwegian Wood film opens in Japan"},{"date": "2011-03-18T12:28:36Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Just a few hours ago, I ran across this video from my friends at the University of Nottingham (I wish I'd run across it a week ago so I could've shared it with you then!).

To say that this is the greatest emergency Japan has faced since the second world war \u2013 as the prime minister, Naoto Kan, said on Monday \u2013 is no exaggeration.Radiation levels above and around the two stricken reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi No\u00a01 nuclear plant have reached such a peak that crews trying to douse one reactor and its spent fuel rod pool were forced back. Increasingly, the ad hoc attempts to cool down the reactors and the pools \u2013 by using high pressure hoses from fire engines and Chinook helicopters dumping water from the air \u2013 appear not to have worked. The latest status of the four reactors at the plant hardly makes reassuring reading.

About 70,000 people have already been evacuated from a 20km radius around the plant, but double that number, who live within 30km, have been told to stay indoors. This advice has been contradicted by the US and Canadian governments, which have instructed their citizens who live within 80km of the plant to leave. Germany's embassy moved its operations from Tokyo to Osaka. If the Japanese government issued the same instructions to residents within 80km of the plant, you would have a major evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people. Where would they all go?The perception of danger even in areas with lower radiation levels is enough to stop truck drivers delivering much-needed fuel to the areas devastated by the tsunami from using the Tohoku Expressway. So the road is being bypassed, causing further delays. Precise, real-time information to reassure emergency workers about local radiation levels is turning out to be as important as the supplies of fuel and food that they deliver. The Tohoku Expressway and other key routes should be lined with Geiger counters.Mr Kan initially reacted well to the tsunami by mobilising 100,000 troops. He learned that lesson from the dithering of a precedessor at the time of the Kobe earthquake \u2013 the last comparable event. Mr Kan swiftly toured the earthquake zone and made a good national address on television. But he has since been absent from TV screens, letting his cabinet secretary do all the talking.

The most dangerous uranium at the plant is not in the reactor cores but in the 11,195 spent fuel rods stored at the site. Why so many? Because it is cheaper to store them on site than to dispose of them, while Japan awaits\u00a0the opening of a reprocessing plant.

The 8.9-magnitude shock triggered tsunami alerts and evacuations across the Pacific region, with Russia, the Philippines and Hawaii all moving vulnerable citizens to higher ground.As dawn broke this morning, the full scale of the damage began to emerge. In one of the worst-hit residential areas, people buried under rubble could be heard calling out \"Help\" and \"When are we going to be rescued?\", Kyodo news agency reported. TV footage showed staff at one hospital waving banners with the words \"Food\" and \"Help\" from a rooftop.The earthquake rocked buildings 235 miles away in Tokyo and experts said it was around 8,000 times more powerful than the recent New Zealand quake. Footage on Japan's state broadcaster NHK showed apocalyptic images of the ensuing tsunami sweeping homes, ships and trucks across the land and of buildings burning in the night.There were unconfirmed reports of 88,000 people missing. Police said they had found 200-300 bodies in a coastal area of devastated Sendai city. Another 137 died elsewhere, with 539 injured and 351 missing. In other developments:\u2022 Officials evacuated 3,000 people when a nuclear plant's cooling system failed, and Japan's trade minister warned of a possible of a radiation leak. Levels inside the plant have surged to 1,000 times normal. A state of emergency was issued at a second nuclear plant early this morning.\u2022 The coastal town of Kesennuma was hit by widespread fires and one-third of the city was under water.\u2022 Emergency response teams were searching for four missing commuter trains and a ship with 80 workers on board.Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, urged people to help their neighbours and to try to minimise damage, as his the country attempted to come to terms with the destruction. \"We ask the people of Japan to exercise the spirit of fraternity, help each other and act fast,\" he said.Barack Obama said the earthquake was \"a potentially catastrophic disaster\". He warned citizens on the west coast of America to heed warnings to evacuate coastal areas. \"Do as you are told,\" he said.The quake happened at 2.46pm local time (5.46am GMT), about six miles below sea level and 78 miles off the east coast of Japan. The shock was felt as far away as Beijing.Aftershocks continued for hours after the first tremor, many of more than magnitude 6.0. Joseph Tame, a Briton living in Tokyo, said concrete buildings shook as if they were made of jelly and high-rises swayed back and forth as the quake hit.Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate prefectures further north bore the brunt of the damage from the shock and the ensuing tsunami. Muddy torrents swept across embankments, tearing buildings from their foundations. Houses blazed as they were carried along by waves, and vehicles smashed into walls and roads, only to be dragged back out to sea as the water reversed its course. Ships crashed into harbours and footage showed a vessel struggling to escape a giant whirlpool.In Sendai the wave carried everything in its path across miles of farmland. Thick mud, choked with cars, buses and even light planes, inundated the airport.In Onahama, the Tokyo Electric Power Co said pressure inside the no 1 reactor at its Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant was rising, heightening the risk of a radiation leak, Japanese media reported early Saturday local time. The company was taking measures to release the pressure, the report added. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, revealed that the American air force had flown in emergency supplies of coolant. Officials earlier evacuated 3,000 residents after the cooling system stopped working. Shaun Burnie, a consultant to the nuclear industry and former head of nuclear campaigns at Greenpeace International, said there was a very real risk of a leak if nuclear fuel inside the reactor core was left to heat up to unsafe levels. \"This is a serious situation which could get very much worse. The last thing the people of Japan need after the tragedy of this earthquake and tsunami is a nuclear catastrophe.\"Much of Kesennuma, a town of 70,000 people in Miyagi prefecture, was ablaze, NHK said. Japan's coastguard said it was searching for 80 dock workers on a vessel swept away from a shipyard in Miyagi. Across the north-east roads buckled, pylons toppled and buildings collapsed. Airports closed and rail services came to a standstill across much of the country. \"Our initial assessment indicates that there has already been enormous damage,\" the chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, said.Phone voice services were out of order in much of the north-east, but data services allowed some people to contact friends and relatives. London-based Naoya Tatsuzawa said his 74-year-old father had sent an email saying he was trapped on the roof of a building north of Sendai city.\"As far as I know he was in good spirits and they were supporting each other, but it has been snowing and is very cold. It must be awful,\" he said. David Halton in Sendai said via Twitter: \"Broken buildings. People without electricity. It's freezing.\"In Tokyo millions were stranded as train services closed. Many spent the night at shelters in schools and other public buildings. Four million were without power.Across the Pacific, scores of countries were on tsunami alert, with experts expressing particular concern about low-lying islands. Warnings were later lifted for many locations including Australia and New Zealand but experts warned that successive waves could grow larger through the day.The US geological survey said the shock was the biggest earthquake to hit Japan since records began in the late 1800s. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries and this shock was one of several to have struck the north-east this week, including one of magnitude 7.3 on Wednesday. In 1933 a magnitude 8.1 quake in the area killed more than 3,000 people.The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki moon, has pledged it will do \"all it can to mobilise humanitarian assistance\".

The shock was felt as far away as Beijing.Aftershocks continued for hours after the first tremor, many of more than magnitude 6.0. Joseph Tame, a Briton living in Tokyo, said concrete buildings shook as if they were made of jelly and high-rises swayed back and forth as the quake hit.Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate prefectures further north bore the brunt of the damage from the shock and the ensuing tsunami. Muddy torrents swept across embankments, tearing buildings from their foundations. Houses blazed as they were carried along by waves, and vehicles smashed into walls and roads, only to be dragged back out to sea as the water reversed its course. Ships crashed into harbours and footage showed a vessel struggling to escape a giant whirlpool.In Sendai the wave carried everything in its path across miles of farmland. Thick mud, choked with cars, buses and even light planes, inundated the airport.In Onahama, the Tokyo Electric Power Co said pressure inside the no 1 reactor at its Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant was rising, heightening the risk of a radiation leak, Japanese media reported early Saturday local time. The company was taking measures to release the pressure, the report added. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, revealed that the American air force had flown in emergency supplies of coolant. Officials earlier evacuated 3,000 residents after the cooling system stopped working. Shaun Burnie, a consultant to the nuclear industry and former head of nuclear campaigns at Greenpeace International, said there was a very real risk of a leak if nuclear fuel inside the reactor core was left to heat up to unsafe levels. \"This is a serious situation which could get very much worse. The last thing the people of Japan need after the tragedy of this earthquake and tsunami is a nuclear catastrophe.\"Much of Kesennuma, a town of 70,000 people in Miyagi prefecture, was ablaze, NHK said. Japan's coastguard said it was searching for 80 dock workers on a vessel swept away from a shipyard in Miyagi. Across the north-east roads buckled, pylons toppled and buildings collapsed. Airports closed and rail services came to a standstill across much of the country. \"Our initial assessment indicates that there has already been enormous damage,\" the chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, said.Phone voice services were out of order in much of the north-east, but data services allowed some people to contact friends and relatives. London-based Naoya Tatsuzawa said his 74-year-old father had sent an email saying he was trapped on the roof of a building north of Sendai city.\"As far as I know he was in good spirits and they were supporting each other, but it has been snowing and is very cold. It must be awful,\" he said. David Halton in Sendai said via Twitter: \"Broken buildings. People without electricity. It's freezing.\"In Tokyo millions were stranded as train services closed. Many spent the night at shelters in schools and other public buildings. Four million were without power.Across the Pacific, scores of countries were on tsunami alert, with experts expressing particular concern about low-lying islands. Warnings were later lifted for many locations including Australia and New Zealand but experts warned that successive waves could grow larger through the day.The US geological survey said the shock was the biggest earthquake to hit Japan since records began in the late 1800s. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries and this shock was one of several to have struck the north-east this week, including one of magnitude 7.3 on Wednesday.

In this video, our favorite chemistry professor delivers a beautiful and coherent description of what happens in nuclear reactors; where the energy comes from, how the initial reaction rate is modulated/controlled with boron rods, how fresh water is used to cool the core and to generate electricity, why sea water permanently damages a reactor, and why taking iodine pills can help circumvent radiation sickness in people who are exposed to some -- but not all -- forms of radiation [read more about this].

Any one of these would test the strongest of nations. Japan has a nuclear crisis, a fuel crisis, 430,000 people homeless, 2\u00a0million households without power, 1.4 million without water \u2013 all that running concurrently with the task of recovering the bodies of over 9,000 people still thought to be missing. To say that this is the greatest emergency Japan has faced since the second world war \u2013 as the prime minister, Naoto Kan, said on Monday \u2013 is no exaggeration.Radiation levels above and around the two stricken reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi No\u00a01 nuclear plant have reached such a peak that crews trying to douse one reactor and its spent fuel rod pool were forced back. Increasingly, the ad hoc attempts to cool down the reactors and the pools \u2013 by using high pressure hoses from fire engines and Chinook helicopters dumping water from the air \u2013 appear not to have worked. The latest status of the four reactors at the plant hardly makes reassuring reading. That leaves reconnecting the plant to the grid and restarting the cooling pumps inside as the last line of defence before a major release of radiation.It is not difficult to make the calculations of population movement that will ensue if large amounts of radioactivity are released into the atmosphere, particularly by one reactor which uses a mixture of uranium and plutonium. About 70,000 people have already been evacuated from a 20km radius around the plant, but double that number, who live within 30km, have been told to stay indoors. This advice has been contradicted by the US and Canadian governments, which have instructed their citizens who live within 80km of the plant to leave. Germany's embassy moved its operations from Tokyo to Osaka. If the Japanese government issued the same instructions to residents within 80km of the plant, you would have a major evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people. Where would they all go?The perception of danger even in areas with lower radiation levels is enough to stop truck drivers delivering much-needed fuel to the areas devastated by the tsunami from using the Tohoku Expressway. So the road is being bypassed, causing further delays. Precise, real-time information to reassure emergency workers about local radiation levels is turning out to be as important as the supplies of fuel and food that they deliver. The Tohoku Expressway and other key routes should be lined with Geiger counters.Mr Kan initially reacted well to the tsunami by mobilising 100,000 troops. He learned that lesson from the dithering of a precedessor at the time of the Kobe earthquake \u2013 the last comparable event. Mr Kan swiftly toured the earthquake zone and made a good national address on television. But he has since been absent from TV screens, letting his cabinet secretary do all the talking. With one crisis in danger of obscuring another coming up behind, Japan needs political leadership as never before. People need reassurance and a constant stream of information on which they can depend. They are getting little of either at the moment.Of all the authorities, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the plant, comes off worst. The most dangerous uranium at the plant is not in the reactor cores but in the 11,195 spent fuel rods stored at the site. Why so many? Because it is cheaper to store them on site than to dispose of them, while Japan awaits\u00a0the opening of a reprocessing plant. Temporary storage pools have become permanent fixtures at power plants. The same is practised at plants in the US. The nuclear industry's inability to deal safely with its waste is coming back to haunt it.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan: the many aftershocks | Editorial"},{"date": "2011-03-20T14:58:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Nine days after they were believed killed by the tsunami, an elderly woman and her teenage grandson were found alive in the rubble of their home in north-east Japan on Sunday.The 80-year-old and the boy survived by eating yoghurt and other scraps of food salvaged from a refrigerator after being trapped in Ishinomaki, one of the worst-hit coastal cities.They were found by police when 16-year-old Jin Abe called for help from the roof of their residence.He had been trapped for a week and finally managed to pull himself through a hole in the debris and alert rescue workers.His grandmother, Sumi Abe, was unable to free herself because her legs were caught under furniture. When she was found, she was shaking and had a low temperature, but was conscious and able to answer questions coherently.Jin had lost feeling in one of his legs and showed symptoms of hypothermia. The survivors have endured a snowstorm and freezing temperatures without electricity or heating.Amid widespread jubilation, the national broadcaster NHK ran images of a helicopter winching the survivors out of danger in a yellow harness. They are both now receiving medical treatment in the Ishinomaki Red Cross hospital.\"I always believed he was alive,\" Jin's father told reporters.The astonishing rescue has given a much-needed boost to emergency workers amid a grim and growing death toll from Japan's deadliest disaster since the second world war.The casualty list stands at 8,277 dead and 12,722 missing and the figures are rising daily.The situation at the evacuation shelters \u2013 where more than 400,000 homeless people have sought refuge \u2013 has improved, but it remains inadequate and vastly different from place to place.At Ishinomaki, the situation remains tough. \"Some of us are still just eating one meal a day,\" said Yoshinori Sato, the secretary of the municipal press office. \"Assistance is coming, but it is two or three days behind other areas.\"Further up the coast, however, the town of Onnagawa, which was flattened by the tsunami, is receiving more than adequate aid. 'We have enough food and blankets and a surplus of kerosene for heating,\" said Hironori Suzuki, the chief of the planning department. \"The priority now is baths. People have been in shelters for 10 days without proper sanitation. Baths would make a big difference.\"Similar views were expressed at the local hospital, where the office manager Toshihiko Abe said the emergency medical needs have largely been met.\"We probably have all we need in terms of material goods. Now the next stage is to rebuild infrastructure and to address the psychological needs of the displaced people, They have lost their homes and their histories, which leads to anxiety. This is something we need to address,\" he said.New elemental challenges continue to plague the recovery effort. The sea returned to the streets of northern Japan on Sunday, although this time it was a creeping high tide rather than a surging tsunami that caused the damage.Homes and roads were flooded by the rising waters, which bubbled up through sewers and drains. Cars and trucks had to turn back from inundated routes in Ishinomaki and Samada. Locals, whose homes had survived the seismic disaster, were faced with a fresh crisis as the waters flooded through their property.While the high tide posed no immediate threat to life, it could prove a longer term worry because it shows how the coastline has been permanently and dramatically shifted by last week's massive, magnitude nine earthquake.\"It's just one thing after another, but there is nothing we can do. The earthquake drove the coastline down by 75 centimetres and today is the high tide so we cannot stop the water,\" said Yoshinori Abe as he splashed through the flooded streets.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Tsunamis", "Ishinomaki"], "title": "Japan tsunami survivors found"},{"date": "2011-03-14T00:01:49Z", "country": "japan", "content": "When Japan's prime minister Naoto Kan described the crisis facing his country as its \"most severe... since the second world war\", his assessment, extraordinary though it was, did not sound at all overstated. As if 10,000 missing residents from one town alone is not calamitous enough for even the most advanced of countries to deal with, technicians were last night battling to save from meltdown nuclear reactors with failed emergency cooling systems. Only a few weeks away from the 25th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, no one can be under any illusions of what could result if the technicians lose their battle.Disasters can sometimes pull a people behind their leaders; but they can just as easily dissolve the trust that the electors repose in the elected. In 2005, the Bush administration's bungling of the damage done by Hurricane Katrina swiftly became effective shorthand for a president out of touch with his people. The early signs do not look good for Mr Kan.Brought in as a rather unlikely change candidate to run a country bogged down in an economic slump lasting two decades, the prime minister's few months in office have left him looking beleaguered \u2013 and with plummeting approval ratings. The country's press has repeatedly accused him of weakness in territorial disputes with China and Russia, while his economic policymaking has often been blocked by the opposition in parliament. And now the government and nuclear industry face accusations that they had seriously underestimated the nuclear plants fundamental vulnerability to earthquakes. There are lessons here for Britain's government, too \u2013 as environment secretary Chris Huhne acknowledged yesterday in calling for an official report on nuclear safety. The obvious point for ministers to make would be that Britain does not face the same quake threat as Japan. An important point, but it may not sway public opinion formed by TV footage of Japan's crisis-hit nuclear plants.Meanwhile, the dimensions of this disaster keep expanding: more than 210,000 people evacuated from five prefectures, 3,400 homes destroyed, the coastal area of Miyako and almost all of the town of Yamada submerged. Many of the victims will be elderly. It is the boast of Japan to have a long-lived people, but those demographics may prove one of the defining features of this crisis. In Shintona many buildings withstood the force of a 10 metre-high wave slamming into the coastline at the speed of a jumbo jet; but a number of their elderly occupants could not.

He told Congress the public should get at least 50 miles away from the stricken plant. The Japanese cleared a radius of 12 miles.He raised further fears by saying that all the water had evaporated from one of the spent fuel pools at the nuclear plant, so there was nothing to stop the fuel rods from getting hotter.Jaczko said officials believe radiation levels are extremely high, which could affect workers' ability to stop temperatures rising.The EU's energy chief, G\u00fcnther Oettinger, told the European parliament the situation was out of control. \"We are somewhere between a disaster and a major disaster,\" he said. \"There could be further catastrophic events, which could pose a threat to the lives of people on the island.\" He said it was impossible to \"exclude the worst\", adding: \"There is talk of an apocalypse and I think the word is particularly well chosen.\"The partial meltdown at Fukushima appeared more serious than the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, the US energy secretary, Steven Chu, told Congress.China, which had been driving a global revival of the nuclear industry, announced it was putting construction on hold, and ordered safety reviews at existing facilities. The heightened concerns \u2013 six days after a devastating earthquake and tsunami plunged Japan into a humanitarian as well as a nuclear emergency \u2013 brought criticism of the authorities' management of the situation at Fukushima.Yuli Andreyev, former head of the agency tasked with cleaning up after Chernobyl, told the Guardian the Japanese had failed to grasp the scale of the disaster. He also said the authorities had to be willing to sacrifice nuclear response workers for the good of the greater public, and should not only be deploying a skeleton staff. \"They don't know what to do,\" he said. \"The personnel have been removed and those that remain are stretched.\"Kenneth Bergeron, a physicist who has done research on nuclear accident simulation, said Three Mile Island had shown the importance of bringing in outside experts. \"I am concerned that the management of this accident was left to very local hands for a very long time,\" he said. \"Sometimes the managers and operators in place when the accident has taken place are not well qualified.

Any one of these would test the strongest of nations. Japan has a nuclear crisis, a fuel crisis, 430,000 people homeless, 2\u00a0million households without power, 1.4 million without water \u2013 all that running concurrently with the task of recovering the bodies of over 9,000 people still thought to be missing. To say that this is the greatest emergency Japan has faced since the second world war \u2013 as the prime minister, Naoto Kan, said on Monday \u2013 is no exaggeration.Radiation levels above and around the two stricken reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi No\u00a01 nuclear plant have reached such a peak that crews trying to douse one reactor and its spent fuel rod pool were forced back. Increasingly, the ad hoc attempts to cool down the reactors and the pools \u2013 by using high pressure hoses from fire engines and Chinook helicopters dumping water from the air \u2013 appear not to have worked. The latest status of the four reactors at the plant hardly makes reassuring reading. That leaves reconnecting the plant to the grid and restarting the cooling pumps inside as the last line of defence before a major release of radiation.It is not difficult to make the calculations of population movement that will ensue if large amounts of radioactivity are released into the atmosphere, particularly by one reactor which uses a mixture of uranium and plutonium. About 70,000 people have already been evacuated from a 20km radius around the plant, but double that number, who live within 30km, have been told to stay indoors. This advice has been contradicted by the US and Canadian governments, which have instructed their citizens who live within 80km of the plant to leave. Germany's embassy moved its operations from Tokyo to Osaka. If the Japanese government issued the same instructions to residents within 80km of the plant, you would have a major evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people. Where would they all go?The perception of danger even in areas with lower radiation levels is enough to stop truck drivers delivering much-needed fuel to the areas devastated by the tsunami from using the Tohoku Expressway. So the road is being bypassed, causing further delays. Precise, real-time information to reassure emergency workers about local radiation levels is turning out to be as important as the supplies of fuel and food that they deliver. The Tohoku Expressway and other key routes should be lined with Geiger counters.Mr Kan initially reacted well to the tsunami by mobilising 100,000 troops. He learned that lesson from the dithering of a precedessor at the time of the Kobe earthquake \u2013 the last comparable event. Mr Kan swiftly toured the earthquake zone and made a good national address on television. But he has since been absent from TV screens, letting his cabinet secretary do all the talking. With one crisis in danger of obscuring another coming up behind, Japan needs political leadership as never before. People need reassurance and a constant stream of information on which they can depend. They are getting little of either at the moment.Of all the authorities, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the operator of the plant, comes off worst. The most dangerous uranium at the plant is not in the reactor cores but in the 11,195 spent fuel rods stored at the site. Why so many? Because it is cheaper to store them on site than to dispose of them, while Japan awaits\u00a0the opening of a reprocessing plant. Temporary storage pools have become permanent fixtures at power plants. The same is practised at plants in the US. The nuclear industry's inability to deal safely with its waste is coming back to haunt it.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan: the many aftershocks | Editorial"},{"date": "2011-03-20T14:58:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Nine days after they were believed killed by the tsunami, an elderly woman and her teenage grandson were found alive in the rubble of their home in north-east Japan on Sunday.The 80-year-old and the boy survived by eating yoghurt and other scraps of food salvaged from a refrigerator after being trapped in Ishinomaki, one of the worst-hit coastal cities.They were found by police when 16-year-old Jin Abe called for help from the roof of their residence.He had been trapped for a week and finally managed to pull himself through a hole in the debris and alert rescue workers.His grandmother, Sumi Abe, was unable to free herself because her legs were caught under furniture. When she was found, she was shaking and had a low temperature, but was conscious and able to answer questions coherently.Jin had lost feeling in one of his legs and showed symptoms of hypothermia. The survivors have endured a snowstorm and freezing temperatures without electricity or heating.Amid widespread jubilation, the national broadcaster NHK ran images of a helicopter winching the survivors out of danger in a yellow harness. They are both now receiving medical treatment in the Ishinomaki Red Cross hospital.\"I always believed he was alive,\" Jin's father told reporters.The astonishing rescue has given a much-needed boost to emergency workers amid a grim and growing death toll from Japan's deadliest disaster since the second world war.The casualty list stands at 8,277 dead and 12,722 missing and the figures are rising daily.The situation at the evacuation shelters \u2013 where more than 400,000 homeless people have sought refuge \u2013 has improved, but it remains inadequate and vastly different from place to place.At Ishinomaki, the situation remains tough. \"Some of us are still just eating one meal a day,\" said Yoshinori Sato, the secretary of the municipal press office. \"Assistance is coming, but it is two or three days behind other areas.\"Further up the coast, however, the town of Onnagawa, which was flattened by the tsunami, is receiving more than adequate aid. 'We have enough food and blankets and a surplus of kerosene for heating,\" said Hironori Suzuki, the chief of the planning department. \"The priority now is baths. People have been in shelters for 10 days without proper sanitation. Baths would make a big difference.\"Similar views were expressed at the local hospital, where the office manager Toshihiko Abe said the emergency medical needs have largely been met.\"We probably have all we need in terms of material goods. Now the next stage is to rebuild infrastructure and to address the psychological needs of the displaced people, They have lost their homes and their histories, which leads to anxiety. This is something we need to address,\" he said.New elemental challenges continue to plague the recovery effort. The sea returned to the streets of northern Japan on Sunday, although this time it was a creeping high tide rather than a surging tsunami that caused the damage.Homes and roads were flooded by the rising waters, which bubbled up through sewers and drains. Cars and trucks had to turn back from inundated routes in Ishinomaki and Samada. Locals, whose homes had survived the seismic disaster, were faced with a fresh crisis as the waters flooded through their property.While the high tide posed no immediate threat to life, it could prove a longer term worry because it shows how the coastline has been permanently and dramatically shifted by last week's massive, magnitude nine earthquake.\"It's just one thing after another, but there is nothing we can do. The earthquake drove the coastline down by 75 centimetres and today is the high tide so we cannot stop the water,\" said Yoshinori Abe as he splashed through the flooded streets.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Tsunamis", "Ishinomaki"], "title": "Japan tsunami survivors found"},{"date": "2011-03-14T00:01:49Z", "country": "japan", "content": "When Japan's prime minister Naoto Kan described the crisis facing his country as its \"most severe... since the second world war\", his assessment, extraordinary though it was, did not sound at all overstated. As if 10,000 missing residents from one town alone is not calamitous enough for even the most advanced of countries to deal with, technicians were last night battling to save from meltdown nuclear reactors with failed emergency cooling systems. Only a few weeks away from the 25th anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, no one can be under any illusions of what could result if the technicians lose their battle.Disasters can sometimes pull a people behind their leaders; but they can just as easily dissolve the trust that the electors repose in the elected. In 2005, the Bush administration's bungling of the damage done by Hurricane Katrina swiftly became effective shorthand for a president out of touch with his people. The early signs do not look good for Mr Kan.Brought in as a rather unlikely change candidate to run a country bogged down in an economic slump lasting two decades, the prime minister's few months in office have left him looking beleaguered \u2013 and with plummeting approval ratings. The country's press has repeatedly accused him of weakness in territorial disputes with China and Russia, while his economic policymaking has often been blocked by the opposition in parliament. And now the government and nuclear industry face accusations that they had seriously underestimated the nuclear plants fundamental vulnerability to earthquakes. There are lessons here for Britain's government, too \u2013 as environment secretary Chris Huhne acknowledged yesterday in calling for an official report on nuclear safety. The obvious point for ministers to make would be that Britain does not face the same quake threat as Japan. An important point, but it may not sway public opinion formed by TV footage of Japan's crisis-hit nuclear plants.Meanwhile, the dimensions of this disaster keep expanding: more than 210,000 people evacuated from five prefectures, 3,400 homes destroyed, the coastal area of Miyako and almost all of the town of Yamada submerged. Many of the victims will be elderly. It is the boast of Japan to have a long-lived people, but those demographics may prove one of the defining features of this crisis. In Shintona many buildings withstood the force of a 10 metre-high wave slamming into the coastline at the speed of a jumbo jet; but a number of their elderly occupants could not.

The 8.9-magnitude shock triggered tsunami alerts and evacuations across the Pacific region, with Russia, the Philippines and Hawaii all moving vulnerable citizens to higher ground.As dawn broke this morning, the full scale of the damage began to emerge. In one of the worst-hit residential areas, people buried under rubble could be heard calling out \"Help\" and \"When are we going to be rescued?\", Kyodo news agency reported. TV footage showed staff at one hospital waving banners with the words \"Food\" and \"Help\" from a rooftop.The earthquake rocked buildings 235 miles away in Tokyo and experts said it was around 8,000 times more powerful than the recent New Zealand quake. Footage on Japan's state broadcaster NHK showed apocalyptic images of the ensuing tsunami sweeping homes, ships and trucks across the land and of buildings burning in the night.There were unconfirmed reports of 88,000 people missing. Police said they had found 200-300 bodies in a coastal area of devastated Sendai city. Another 137 died elsewhere, with 539 injured and 351 missing. In other developments:\u2022 Officials evacuated 3,000 people when a nuclear plant's cooling system failed, and Japan's trade minister warned of a possible of a radiation leak. Levels inside the plant have surged to 1,000 times normal. A state of emergency was issued at a second nuclear plant early this morning.\u2022 The coastal town of Kesennuma was hit by widespread fires and one-third of the city was under water.\u2022 Emergency response teams were searching for four missing commuter trains and a ship with 80 workers on board.Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, urged people to help their neighbours and to try to minimise damage, as his the country attempted to come to terms with the destruction. \"We ask the people of Japan to exercise the spirit of fraternity, help each other and act fast,\" he said.Barack Obama said the earthquake was \"a potentially catastrophic disaster\". He warned citizens on the west coast of America to heed warnings to evacuate coastal areas. \"Do as you are told,\" he said.The quake happened at 2.46pm local time (5.46am GMT), about six miles below sea level and 78 miles off the east coast of Japan. The shock was felt as far away as Beijing.Aftershocks continued for hours after the first tremor, many of more than magnitude 6.0. Joseph Tame, a Briton living in Tokyo, said concrete buildings shook as if they were made of jelly and high-rises swayed back and forth as the quake hit.Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate prefectures further north bore the brunt of the damage from the shock and the ensuing tsunami. Muddy torrents swept across embankments, tearing buildings from their foundations. Houses blazed as they were carried along by waves, and vehicles smashed into walls and roads, only to be dragged back out to sea as the water reversed its course. Ships crashed into harbours and footage showed a vessel struggling to escape a giant whirlpool.In Sendai the wave carried everything in its path across miles of farmland. Thick mud, choked with cars, buses and even light planes, inundated the airport.In Onahama, the Tokyo Electric Power Co said pressure inside the no 1 reactor at its Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear plant was rising, heightening the risk of a radiation leak, Japanese media reported early Saturday local time. The company was taking measures to release the pressure, the report added. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, revealed that the American air force had flown in emergency supplies of coolant. Officials earlier evacuated 3,000 residents after the cooling system stopped working. Shaun Burnie, a consultant to the nuclear industry and former head of nuclear campaigns at Greenpeace International, said there was a very real risk of a leak if nuclear fuel inside the reactor core was left to heat up to unsafe levels. \"This is a serious situation which could get very much worse. The last thing the people of Japan need after the tragedy of this earthquake and tsunami is a nuclear catastrophe.\"Much of Kesennuma, a town of 70,000 people in Miyagi prefecture, was ablaze, NHK said. Japan's coastguard said it was searching for 80 dock workers on a vessel swept away from a shipyard in Miyagi. Across the north-east roads buckled, pylons toppled and buildings collapsed. Airports closed and rail services came to a standstill across much of the country. \"Our initial assessment indicates that there has already been enormous damage,\" the chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, said.Phone voice services were out of order in much of the north-east, but data services allowed some people to contact friends and relatives. London-based Naoya Tatsuzawa said his 74-year-old father had sent an email saying he was trapped on the roof of a building north of Sendai city.\"As far as I know he was in good spirits and they were supporting each other, but it has been snowing and is very cold. It must be awful,\" he said. David Halton in Sendai said via Twitter: \"Broken buildings. People without electricity. It's freezing.\"In Tokyo millions were stranded as train services closed. Many spent the night at shelters in schools and other public buildings. Four million were without power.Across the Pacific, scores of countries were on tsunami alert, with experts expressing particular concern about low-lying islands. Warnings were later lifted for many locations including Australia and New Zealand but experts warned that successive waves could grow larger through the day.The US geological survey said the shock was the biggest earthquake to hit Japan since records began in the late 1800s. Japan is one of the most seismically active countries and this shock was one of several to have struck the north-east this week, including one of magnitude 7.3 on Wednesday. In 1933 a magnitude 8.1 quake in the area killed more than 3,000 people.The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki moon, has pledged it will do \"all it can to mobilise humanitarian assistance\".

Public broadcaster NHK showed images of a large ship ramming into a breakwater in Kennuma city, Miyagi prefecture.The quake and tsunami halted air and rail services across large parts of the country.

At least 10 people were injured when part of a hall roof collapsed in Tokyo, the metropolitan police department said.All flights were grounded immediately after the quake while officials checked for runway damage. Strong tremors were felt in Tokyo about 30 minutes after the quake. Newsreaders in the capital wore helmets as they gave updates, while office workers rushed out of buildings and on to the streets for safety.Osamu Akiya, 46, was working at his Tokyo office when the quake hit, sending bookshelves and other items flying and opening up cracks in the wall.\"I've been through many earthquakes, but I've never felt anything like this,\" he said. \"I don't know if we'll be able to get home tonight.\"Television footage showed a building on fire in the Odaiba district of Tokyo, although it was not immediately clear if the blaze was connected to the earthquake. Another fire was seen burning out of control at the at Cosmo oil refinery in Ichihara, in Chiba prefecture near Tokyo.Water levels rose quickly in the coastal town of Miyako in Iwate prefecture, while vehicles, houses and buildings were swept away by the tsunami in Onahama city, Fukushima prefecture.TV news presenters repeatedly warned people along the Pacific coast to head for higher ground.The quake is one of several to have struck north-east Japan this week, including one of magnitude 7.3 on Wednesday.In 1933, a magnitude 8.1 quake in the area killed more than 3,000 people.

He told Congress the public should get at least 50 miles away from the stricken plant. The Japanese cleared a radius of 12 miles.He raised further fears by saying that all the water had evaporated from one of the spent fuel pools at the nuclear plant, so there was nothing to stop the fuel rods from getting hotter.Jaczko said officials believe radiation levels are extremely high, which could affect workers' ability to stop temperatures rising.The EU's energy chief, G\u00fcnther Oettinger, told the European parliament the situation was out of control. \"We are somewhere between a disaster and a major disaster,\" he said. \"There could be further catastrophic events, which could pose a threat to the lives of people on the island.\" He said it was impossible to \"exclude the worst\", adding: \"There is talk of an apocalypse and I think the word is particularly well chosen.\"The partial meltdown at Fukushima appeared more serious than the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, the US energy secretary, Steven Chu, told Congress.China, which had been driving a global revival of the nuclear industry, announced it was putting construction on hold, and ordered safety reviews at existing facilities.

There have been six of them in five years. It used to be said that after more than 50 years of almost uninterrupted rule, the Liberal Democratic party had run out of energy. Junichiro Koizumi was the last man who could credibly fill the boots of a leader. But the same is now also true of the ruling Democratic party of Japan, which appears to be discarding its leading lights with similar abandon. Ever since the DPJ ended the LDP's virtual monopoly of postwar power two years ago, successive governments have been in a state of crisis.The first DPJ prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, promised more than he could deliver, particularly on a pledge to relocate US marines and one base out of Okinawa. His successor, Naoto Kan, has repaired the relationship with Washington, but only at the cost of distancing his government still further from the wishes of most Okinawans. Both the left and, cynically, the right on the island are against such a heavy US military footprint. Mr Kan has toiled instead on two fronts \u2013 breaking the gridlock in parliament over the budget, and cleaning up a series of funding scandals that have dogged the party since its inception. He suspended the membership of a party grandee and founder, Ichiro Ozawa, after he had been indicted in a political financing case. Mr Ozawa cast a long shadow over the government, taking 16 DPJ members of parliament with him. A key warrior in Mr Kan's fight with Mr Ozawa was his feisty foreign minister, Seiji Maehara. Now he himself has had to resign after receiving an illegal donation, and Mr Kan's chances of survival are looking slim indeed.Mr Maehara's resignation is a loss. He had both the vision and energy to navigate a military alliance with the US and an increasingly important trading relationship with China. Having been one of the leading critics of Mr Ozawa, he felt compelled to resign, even though the amounts involved in his case were trivial. But it is a measure of Mr Kan's political fragility that even bright prospects for the future can not survive what any other democracy would treat as minor technical infringements. An expenses scandal this is not.There is no consensus on why Japan's prime ministers are so frail. Some put it down to the fact that the ultimate stability resides in the emperor, and dismissing a prime minister is no more traumatic than changing the coach of a baseball team. Others point to the postwar education system. Prime ministers have relatively low salaries, little authority even within cabinet, and limited terms. Whatever it is, Japan could do with one who can stay around for more than a year.

Two months ago, the black wave of the tsunami engulfed 16 towns, 95,000 buildings, 23 railway stations, hundreds of miles of road, railway tracks and sea walls. Over 60,000 acres of agricultural land were contaminated. It will take three years just to clear the debris.In spite of the enormity of the task ahead, there are signs that Japan is moving away from disaster management. It may not be, however, politics as usual. Hauled over the coals, not least by his own party, for the way his government dealt with the operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the embattled prime minister, Naoto Kan, has begun to make decisions which are political in nature. He ordered the temporary closure of Hamaoka \u2013 the nuclear plant which sits on an active faultline \u2013 while a new tsunami wall is built, and he has abandoned plans to build 14 reactors over the next 20 years, opting instead for a 20% increase in renewables.This contrasts with the recommendation of Britain's climate change committee this week to increase reliance on nuclear energy. The Department of Energy and Climate Change is also considering a proposal that would cut the subsidy, through feed-in tariffs for generators of solar power. Disaster-stricken Japan is moving in the opposite direction, and it is brutally clear why. Over 80,000 people living within 12 miles of Fukushima have been forced out of their homes and it is far from clear when they will be able to return. Farmers have been forced to abandon their cows, or dump their milk. The compensation bill alone for the 50,000 families forced to leave the exclusion zone could be astronomical. Tepco may apologise deeply and profusely, but Japan's nuclear industry has lost the stranglehold it once had over the energy debate. There are no votes in trying to defend it now.Stabilising Fukushima and building 70,000 temporary homes are immediate problems. But long-term answers will be just as significant. These are being sought by an ambitious team of philosophers and architects led by Makoto Iokibe, a former professor at Kobe university and someone determined not to repeat the same mistakes.

I'd just finished the illustration I do for a weekly newspaper column and sent the scan to the editor. Suddenly, the building shook so badly that I feared it would collapse. My studio is at the top of a three-storey concrete structure. It has a glass door which opens on to a small terrace, and I rushed to open it because one thing we all know is that tremors can make doors and windows jam. Apart from that, I couldn't do much more but wait.It must have been a minute or two, but it seemed like a very long time until the tremor stopped completely. One of the shelves fell down and CDs scattered all over the floor. The water in the jar for my watercolour paints spilled on the table. I checked the gas main and set off on the five-minute bike ride to the flat where my wife and I live. It was quiet outside. People looked rather stunned, but calm. There were children walking home from school as if nothing had happened.Being born and brought up in Japan I have experienced hundreds of earthquakes in my life, but this was definitely the biggest. We live in Kawasaki, which is west of Tokyo and a few hundred miles away from the worst-hit areas. So the impact that was felt by people nearer to the epicentre must have been enormous.We had no electricity, water or gas for half a day. I couldn't get in touch with my elderly parents, who live 60 miles away. Later, when the phone lines were restored, I found they were all right. But I cannot visit them at the moment because of the petrol shortage and closures of motorways and public transport. Luckily they are doing well in the care of my brother and his wife.Like many people in Japan I spend my days since the earthquake hopelessly watching the worsening situation on TV. Though survivors from flooded villages weep over the loss of friends and family, they almost always add: \"But there are people who are even worse off ... \" This is the phrase that has come to represent the spirit of young and old alike. It has made me feel a little proud to be a part of this community.The Japanese have spent so many centuries living with the effects of earthquakes and typhoons that we all know how powerless and minute we are in the face of nature. We cannot but feel humble when we encounter natural disasters on this scale. But our humility may be our strength, too. It is this very sense of our personal impotence that makes us understand the life-or-death importance of helping each other.One day, in a local market, my wife and I passed a stall selling fresh seaweed. The middle-aged woman who ran it kept saying that this was the last she would be getting and we should savour it because it was very good. She persuaded us to taste it and it was so delicious that we bought two bags.Later we discovered that she was from a coastal town in Miyagi, one of the worst-flooded areas. She couldn't get in touch with her sister's family, the fishermen who had produced the seaweed, but it didn't occur to her to stop working. She probably didn't want to waste the last consignment her family might ever deliver to her.I admire people who do their work. Some - like the workers at the stricken Fukushima nuclear power station - are putting their own lives in danger to carry on doing their duty. I'm trying to work, too. I'm sitting in my flat in relative comfort, even though we don't know what's going to happen to the damaged power plant and there are still aftershocks every now and again.I have just resumed work on my book. It's a rather crazy story about a teapot character, and it is due to be published in May in Japan and later in the UK. I've been doing rough sketches for it, and trying to work out the sequel to my most recent book, Millie's Marvellous Hat.I don't know if I can continue to write and draw humorous stories, but I'll try. I'd rather aim for something funny and happy than be gloomy. I've never done a story without humour - and besides, one thing that has become very clear in the last few terrible weeks is that ordinary, mundane life is a miracle, and the only place where you can find happiness.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Teen books", "Children's books: 8-12 years", "Children and teenagers"], "title": "Satoshi Kitamura: Postcard from Japan"},{"date": "2011-05-12T00:20:36Z", "country": "japan", "content": "It took 10 years to rebuild Kobe after the earthquake in 1995, but that timeframe is now looking optimistic for the reconstruction needed along the north-eastern coastline of Japan.

The warnings were later lifted.The aftershock came as the government announced it was widening the evacuation zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant due to high levels of accumulated radiation and rising fears about the long-term effects on residents' health.The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said the current 12-mile (20km) evacuation zone would be extended to five other communities, including the village of Iitate, which lies 25 miles from the plant.The village's 5,000 residents were told to prepare to leave their homes, although the evacuation would not take place immediately as radiation levels presented no immediate threat to health.The Asahi newspaper said the zone would be widened to 19 miles in some areas, depending on wind direction, adding that residents would be given about a week to prepare.\"We have made a new decision about evacuations based on data analysis of accumulated radiation exposure information,\" Edano told a news conference. \"There is no need to evacuate immediately.\"About 70,000 people living within 12 miles of Fukushima Daiichi have already been evacuated, and another 130,000 living inside a band 12 to 19 miles away have been told to leave voluntarily or remain indoors due to disruption to supply lines and services.Engineers at the plant say that although progress has been made in containing radioactive water that has built up beneath reactors, they are still no closer to restoring damaged cooling systems.Until repairs are made they cannot cool overheated fuel rods that could cause a major leak of radiation if they go into full meltdown.The government had ignored pressure from the International Atomic Energy Agency and environmental groups to widen the evacuation zone. The US has advised its citizens not to go within 50 miles of the plant.Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency, apologised for the anxiety caused by radiation leaks, and warned that the cooling systems could take months to repair.\"It's still difficult to give a timeline regarding when we can resolve the problem,\" Nishiyama said. \"We are very sorry for the evacuees who are anxious to see the problem resolved.\"The governor of Fukushima prefecture, Yuhei Sato, criticised the decision first to ask people in the area to stay indoors, then to consider leaving and now to prepare for evacuation. \"Residents are very confused about what to do,\" he said.Earlier, Sato refused to meet the president of the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, Masataka Shimizu, who had travelled to Fukushima to apologise to the prefecture's people.The tsunami warning was a reminder of the events of a month ago, which were marked across the country by a moment's silence at 2.46pm.More than 14,000 people are still missing, and 152,000 survivors are living in evacuation centres.Reflecting on the damage to his prefecture, which is also at the centre of the nuclear power crisis, Sato said: \"My chest has been ripped open by the suffering and pain that this disaster has caused the people of our prefecture.

Two months ago, the black wave of the tsunami engulfed 16 towns, 95,000 buildings, 23 railway stations, hundreds of miles of road, railway tracks and sea walls. Over 60,000 acres of agricultural land were contaminated. It will take three years just to clear the debris.In spite of the enormity of the task ahead, there are signs that Japan is moving away from disaster management. It may not be, however, politics as usual. Hauled over the coals, not least by his own party, for the way his government dealt with the operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the embattled prime minister, Naoto Kan, has begun to make decisions which are political in nature. He ordered the temporary closure of Hamaoka \u2013 the nuclear plant which sits on an active faultline \u2013 while a new tsunami wall is built, and he has abandoned plans to build 14 reactors over the next 20 years, opting instead for a 20% increase in renewables.This contrasts with the recommendation of Britain's climate change committee this week to increase reliance on nuclear energy. The Department of Energy and Climate Change is also considering a proposal that would cut the subsidy, through feed-in tariffs for generators of solar power. Disaster-stricken Japan is moving in the opposite direction, and it is brutally clear why. Over 80,000 people living within 12 miles of Fukushima have been forced out of their homes and it is far from clear when they will be able to return. Farmers have been forced to abandon their cows, or dump their milk. The compensation bill alone for the 50,000 families forced to leave the exclusion zone could be astronomical. Tepco may apologise deeply and profusely, but Japan's nuclear industry has lost the stranglehold it once had over the energy debate. There are no votes in trying to defend it now.Stabilising Fukushima and building 70,000 temporary homes are immediate problems. But long-term answers will be just as significant. These are being sought by an ambitious team of philosophers and architects led by Makoto Iokibe, a former professor at Kobe university and someone determined not to repeat the same mistakes. Seeking higher ground for the new communities of the north-east is the least of their ideas. He talks of creative reconstruction \u2013 decentralising power away from Tokyo, a reconstruction tax, decreasing the wealth gap between urban and rural areas, creating a springboard for green energy.

About 1m desktop computers would have to be linked up to replicate its performance.The K, a collaborative effort involving Fujitsu and Riken, a government-funded research institute, boasts a current speed of 8.16 petaflops \u2013 or 8.16 quadrillion operations a second \u2013 making it three times faster than China's most powerful machine, the Tianhe-1A, which had topped the rankings since last November.Development of the K was slowed by the natural disaster that struck Japan's north-east coast in March; appropriately enough, when fully functional the supercomputer will be put to use predicting the possible impact of earthquakes and tsunamis.It will also have economic uses in the fields of drugs, new technology and renewable energy, and could be used to improve our understanding of climate change.\"We must realise that science and technology is an area in which Japan can show its strength,\" Riken's president, Ryoji Noyori, told reporters.While Japan's resurgence should have scientists dancing in laboratory corridors, not everyone is convinced that resources should be poured into fueling the country's supercomputer rivalry with the US and, increasingly, China.Funding for the project, estimated at 112bn yen, was almost cut in 2009 when a government panel questioned the investment required in the midst of an economic crisis. Renho, now the government minister in charge of cutting wasteful spending, infuriated scientists when she asked: \"What's wrong with being number two?\"Its future was secured after a group of Nobel prize winners convinced the prime minister at the time, Yukio Hatoyama, that Japan should not settle for second best.Asked to comment on this week's success, Renho said: \"That's good news.

Hard on the heels of a collective silent prayer on Monday to mourn the loss of an estimated 28,000 people, there was another shock: the decision to put the damage to the Fukushima Daiichi reactors on a par with the explosion at Chernobyl. This is not only an admission that the amount of radiation released is of a new order of magnitude (although it is still only a 10th of that form the Soviet accident). It is also a marker for the future. It could take Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) months to get the stricken reactors and spent-fuel-rod pools under control, and as radiation continues to leak, the total amount could, it is feared, exceed the levels of the 1986 disaster.Has the pendulum been made to swing too far the other way, by the very people who dismissed comparisons with Chernobyl only weeks ago? In many ways, Fukushima bears little comparison to the world's worst nuclear accident. The explosion and fire at Chernobyl sent parts of the reactor core high into the atmosphere in a plume that drifted over Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and western Europe. The contamination around Fukushima could potentially spell a terminal blow for the communities around it, as we report today, but those communities lie within 25 miles of the plant and the area affected is still local. The equivalent vehicle for the dispersal of radiation from Fukushima is water rather than air, in this case a rather large quantity of it \u2013 the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, the particles are being carried by a strong current away from population centres, dispersing and diluting them. There are unknowns in this too, such as the degree to which radioactivity will become concentrated in the food chain. But in terms of its geographical reach, Fukushima is still, thankfully, a long way behind Chernobyl.Both disasters have however this in common: weeks after they happened, the experts are no nearer dealing with the root of the problem. They have stopped pumping low-level radioactive water from the buildings into the sea, but they are no closer to restoring the plant's cooling system. And there is potentially three times as much material to contain in Fukushima as there was in Chernobyl. That is the problem of assessing the risk of living with nuclear power. Other industries, such as coal extraction, have incomparably higher death tolls and many more accidents. The risks of a nuclear accident are small in comparison. But when one of them happens, it does so big time.It may take more than just one speech by the prime minister, Naoto Kan, to persuade Japan that the worst is now over, that the situation at the plant is stabilising, and that people should now concentrate on reconstructing the areas devastated by the tsunami. Formidable problems still remain, such as the 150,000 people still living in emergency shelters \u2013 a number that could nearly double if the 130,000 living between 20 and 30 kilometres from the plant have to leave their homes too. Anger at the ever changing assessments of the radiation dangers and advice has so far been directed at Tepco. The governor of Fukushima prefecture, Yuhei Sato, was so upset he refused to meet Tepco's president, who had travelled to the area to apologise.The Japanese have responded to the worst disaster to befall them in modern times stoically \u2013 some, such as the workers who volunteered to stay in the stricken plant, heroically. It has been a month from hell for people who have had little time to mourn the loss of their families and their homes, let alone devise new lives for themselves. But their test has only just begun, as the impact on the economy starts to show through. It could be that the nation finds heart and fresh purpose in the reconstruction, but it will take massive amounts of will and discipline to ensure that it does.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan: No time to mourn | Editorial"},{"date": "2011-05-12T00:20:36Z", "country": "japan", "content": "It took 10 years to rebuild Kobe after the earthquake in 1995, but that timeframe is now looking optimistic for the reconstruction needed along the north-eastern coastline of Japan.

The warnings were later lifted.The aftershock came as the government announced it was widening the evacuation zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant due to high levels of accumulated radiation and rising fears about the long-term effects on residents' health.The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, said the current 12-mile (20km) evacuation zone would be extended to five other communities, including the village of Iitate, which lies 25 miles from the plant.The village's 5,000 residents were told to prepare to leave their homes, although the evacuation would not take place immediately as radiation levels presented no immediate threat to health.The Asahi newspaper said the zone would be widened to 19 miles in some areas, depending on wind direction, adding that residents would be given about a week to prepare.\"We have made a new decision about evacuations based on data analysis of accumulated radiation exposure information,\" Edano told a news conference. \"There is no need to evacuate immediately.\"About 70,000 people living within 12 miles of Fukushima Daiichi have already been evacuated, and another 130,000 living inside a band 12 to 19 miles away have been told to leave voluntarily or remain indoors due to disruption to supply lines and services.Engineers at the plant say that although progress has been made in containing radioactive water that has built up beneath reactors, they are still no closer to restoring damaged cooling systems.Until repairs are made they cannot cool overheated fuel rods that could cause a major leak of radiation if they go into full meltdown.The government had ignored pressure from the International Atomic Energy Agency and environmental groups to widen the evacuation zone. The US has advised its citizens not to go within 50 miles of the plant.Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency, apologised for the anxiety caused by radiation leaks, and warned that the cooling systems could take months to repair.\"It's still difficult to give a timeline regarding when we can resolve the problem,\" Nishiyama said. \"We are very sorry for the evacuees who are anxious to see the problem resolved.\"The governor of Fukushima prefecture, Yuhei Sato, criticised the decision first to ask people in the area to stay indoors, then to consider leaving and now to prepare for evacuation. \"Residents are very confused about what to do,\" he said.Earlier, Sato refused to meet the president of the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, Masataka Shimizu, who had travelled to Fukushima to apologise to the prefecture's people.The tsunami warning was a reminder of the events of a month ago, which were marked across the country by a moment's silence at 2.46pm.More than 14,000 people are still missing, and 152,000 survivors are living in evacuation centres.Reflecting on the damage to his prefecture, which is also at the centre of the nuclear power crisis, Sato said: \"My chest has been ripped open by the suffering and pain that this disaster has caused the people of our prefecture. I can't find the words to express my sorrow.\"The prime minister, Naoto Kan, placed a message in newspapers in several countries, including Britain, China and the United States, thanking the international community for its support.Kan said the generosity shown towards Japan in its time of need demonstrated the human capacity for kizuna, or bonds of friendship, and vowed that Japan would emerge a stronger nation.\"We deeply appreciate the kizuna our friends from around the world have shown and I want to thank every nation, entity, and you personally, from the bottom of my heart,\" he said.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Nuclear power", "World news", "Energy", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Earthquakes", "Tsunamis"], "title": "Japan earthquake prompts tsunami warnings"},{"date": "2011-04-12T23:05:08Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has been shaken by more than 400 strong aftershocks since the earthquake and tsunami hit a month ago. Hard on the heels of a collective silent prayer on Monday to mourn the loss of an estimated 28,000 people, there was another shock: the decision to put the damage to the Fukushima Daiichi reactors on a par with the explosion at Chernobyl. This is not only an admission that the amount of radiation released is of a new order of magnitude (although it is still only a 10th of that form the Soviet accident). It is also a marker for the future. It could take Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) months to get the stricken reactors and spent-fuel-rod pools under control, and as radiation continues to leak, the total amount could, it is feared, exceed the levels of the 1986 disaster.Has the pendulum been made to swing too far the other way, by the very people who dismissed comparisons with Chernobyl only weeks ago? In many ways, Fukushima bears little comparison to the world's worst nuclear accident. The explosion and fire at Chernobyl sent parts of the reactor core high into the atmosphere in a plume that drifted over Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and western Europe. The contamination around Fukushima could potentially spell a terminal blow for the communities around it, as we report today, but those communities lie within 25 miles of the plant and the area affected is still local. The equivalent vehicle for the dispersal of radiation from Fukushima is water rather than air, in this case a rather large quantity of it \u2013 the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, the particles are being carried by a strong current away from population centres, dispersing and diluting them. There are unknowns in this too, such as the degree to which radioactivity will become concentrated in the food chain. But in terms of its geographical reach, Fukushima is still, thankfully, a long way behind Chernobyl.Both disasters have however this in common: weeks after they happened, the experts are no nearer dealing with the root of the problem. They have stopped pumping low-level radioactive water from the buildings into the sea, but they are no closer to restoring the plant's cooling system. And there is potentially three times as much material to contain in Fukushima as there was in Chernobyl. That is the problem of assessing the risk of living with nuclear power. Other industries, such as coal extraction, have incomparably higher death tolls and many more accidents. The risks of a nuclear accident are small in comparison. But when one of them happens, it does so big time.It may take more than just one speech by the prime minister, Naoto Kan, to persuade Japan that the worst is now over, that the situation at the plant is stabilising, and that people should now concentrate on reconstructing the areas devastated by the tsunami. Formidable problems still remain, such as the 150,000 people still living in emergency shelters \u2013 a number that could nearly double if the 130,000 living between 20 and 30 kilometres from the plant have to leave their homes too. Anger at the ever changing assessments of the radiation dangers and advice has so far been directed at Tepco. The governor of Fukushima prefecture, Yuhei Sato, was so upset he refused to meet Tepco's president, who had travelled to the area to apologise.The Japanese have responded to the worst disaster to befall them in modern times stoically \u2013 some, such as the workers who volunteered to stay in the stricken plant, heroically. It has been a month from hell for people who have had little time to mourn the loss of their families and their homes, let alone devise new lives for themselves. But their test has only just begun, as the impact on the economy starts to show through. It could be that the nation finds heart and fresh purpose in the reconstruction, but it will take massive amounts of will and discipline to ensure that it does.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan: No time to mourn | Editorial"},{"date": "2011-04-12T13:00:29Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The earthquake in Japan on 11 March, which triggered a series of devastating events across the east of the country, has left tens of thousands dead or missing, huge swaths of the population anxious about nuclear energy and had an economic impact that remains opaque. For the English language teachers, that means an uncertain future, not that those remaining are thinking ahead too far.The earthquake came at both the best and the worst time for the region's English language teachers. During an exam period and close to Japanese spring break, many teachers were not at work when the tsunami struck, and have had time to think about their ongoing residence in the country. By the end of March, only one ELT fatality from the disaster had been reported, that of 24-year-old Taylor Anderson, a teacher on the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme in the tsunami-struck town of Ishinomaki in Miyagi prefecture.However, with many schools offering one-year contracts that end on 31 March, employers have struggled to keep teachers as much as teachers have struggled to keep their jobs. \"Many foreigners in Japan are on yearly renewable contracts, most of which end in April,\" said Louis Carlet, vice-chairman of Zenkoku Ippan Tokyo General Union, which represents a large number of EL teachers throughout the country.\"What we are seeing is some companies failing to renew teacher positions in this time of crisis. But on the other hand a lot teachers have left the country, so other jobs have opened up, albeit with worse conditions in a lot of situations,\" he said.David Jones, a programme co-ordinator for the JET programme with the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations (Clair), said the organisation was working on a case-by-case basis to organise future teaching programmes.\"There are places in the affected areas who are working with JET, but right now we are waiting for local governments to assess the situation. The decisions are made by local governments in every area, not us.\"Kazuyuki Hoshi, the assistant director at the international affairs section at the Miyagi prefectural government, told the Kyodo news agency: \"I want more JETs to come in the future, but due to the current situation I cannot welcome them openhandedly.''Among those that have decided to stay, some have taken up posts as volunteers in evacuation centres. Many have families and roots in the country, and never thought about leaving.\"I'll be staying,\" said Justin Doub, a father of two and a 31-year-old teacher with a dispatch company in the city of Kitakami, Iwate prefecture. \"I haven't signed a contract for the coming year yet, but I have been promised one. If anything, I'll probably have more work because so many ALTs left.\"Doub's attitude is similar to that of many that remain, stoical in the face of tough times. \"I say things here are normal, but the restaurants are still closed and the convenience stores are half empty. My family back home keep asking whether we have food, and we do have food, but you can't choose what you get. Not that this bothers me, I'm just grateful to be able to eat.\"In Tokyo, managers with numerous large \"eikaiwa\" English conversation companies report a business-as-usual attitude.However, there are factors that could damage English teaching outside of the worst-afflicted region.In tough economic times, English teaching is badly hit. Long considered a luxury in Japan, English schools can often lose students when the economy is struggling. And the government expects the earthquake and its consequences to cost the country more than $300bn.And it is uncertain whether teachers leaving will be replaced in the short term. By the latter half of March, foreigners entering Japan via Narita airport, the nation's eastern hub, had declined by 60%. And convincing new teachers to come to work in Japan after the worst nuclear disaster the world has seen since Chernobyl may be difficult.As Russell Mallon, a resident of Sendai who works in the PR department of an ELT programme, explained: \"I just don't want to be near to any nuclear facility ever again.\"", "tags": ["Tefl", "Japan disaster", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Schools want foreign staff to return in spite of crisis"},{"date": "2011-05-12T00:20:36Z", "country": "japan", "content": "It took 10 years to rebuild Kobe after the earthquake in 1995, but that timeframe is now looking optimistic for the reconstruction needed along the north-eastern coastline of Japan. Two months ago, the black wave of the tsunami engulfed 16 towns, 95,000 buildings, 23 railway stations, hundreds of miles of road, railway tracks and sea walls. Over 60,000 acres of agricultural land were contaminated. It will take three years just to clear the debris.In spite of the enormity of the task ahead, there are signs that Japan is moving away from disaster management. It may not be, however, politics as usual. Hauled over the coals, not least by his own party, for the way his government dealt with the operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the embattled prime minister, Naoto Kan, has begun to make decisions which are political in nature. He ordered the temporary closure of Hamaoka \u2013 the nuclear plant which sits on an active faultline \u2013 while a new tsunami wall is built, and he has abandoned plans to build 14 reactors over the next 20 years, opting instead for a 20% increase in renewables.This contrasts with the recommendation of Britain's climate change committee this week to increase reliance on nuclear energy. The Department of Energy and Climate Change is also considering a proposal that would cut the subsidy, through feed-in tariffs for generators of solar power. Disaster-stricken Japan is moving in the opposite direction, and it is brutally clear why. Over 80,000 people living within 12 miles of Fukushima have been forced out of their homes and it is far from clear when they will be able to return. Farmers have been forced to abandon their cows, or dump their milk. The compensation bill alone for the 50,000 families forced to leave the exclusion zone could be astronomical. Tepco may apologise deeply and profusely, but Japan's nuclear industry has lost the stranglehold it once had over the energy debate.

Hard on the heels of a collective silent prayer on Monday to mourn the loss of an estimated 28,000 people, there was another shock: the decision to put the damage to the Fukushima Daiichi reactors on a par with the explosion at Chernobyl. This is not only an admission that the amount of radiation released is of a new order of magnitude (although it is still only a 10th of that form the Soviet accident). It is also a marker for the future. It could take Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) months to get the stricken reactors and spent-fuel-rod pools under control, and as radiation continues to leak, the total amount could, it is feared, exceed the levels of the 1986 disaster.Has the pendulum been made to swing too far the other way, by the very people who dismissed comparisons with Chernobyl only weeks ago? In many ways, Fukushima bears little comparison to the world's worst nuclear accident. The explosion and fire at Chernobyl sent parts of the reactor core high into the atmosphere in a plume that drifted over Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and western Europe. The contamination around Fukushima could potentially spell a terminal blow for the communities around it, as we report today, but those communities lie within 25 miles of the plant and the area affected is still local. The equivalent vehicle for the dispersal of radiation from Fukushima is water rather than air, in this case a rather large quantity of it \u2013 the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, the particles are being carried by a strong current away from population centres, dispersing and diluting them. There are unknowns in this too, such as the degree to which radioactivity will become concentrated in the food chain. But in terms of its geographical reach, Fukushima is still, thankfully, a long way behind Chernobyl.Both disasters have however this in common: weeks after they happened, the experts are no nearer dealing with the root of the problem. They have stopped pumping low-level radioactive water from the buildings into the sea, but they are no closer to restoring the plant's cooling system. And there is potentially three times as much material to contain in Fukushima as there was in Chernobyl. That is the problem of assessing the risk of living with nuclear power. Other industries, such as coal extraction, have incomparably higher death tolls and many more accidents. The risks of a nuclear accident are small in comparison. But when one of them happens, it does so big time.It may take more than just one speech by the prime minister, Naoto Kan, to persuade Japan that the worst is now over, that the situation at the plant is stabilising, and that people should now concentrate on reconstructing the areas devastated by the tsunami. Formidable problems still remain, such as the 150,000 people still living in emergency shelters \u2013 a number that could nearly double if the 130,000 living between 20 and 30 kilometres from the plant have to leave their homes too. Anger at the ever changing assessments of the radiation dangers and advice has so far been directed at Tepco. The governor of Fukushima prefecture, Yuhei Sato, was so upset he refused to meet Tepco's president, who had travelled to the area to apologise.The Japanese have responded to the worst disaster to befall them in modern times stoically \u2013 some, such as the workers who volunteered to stay in the stricken plant, heroically. It has been a month from hell for people who have had little time to mourn the loss of their families and their homes, let alone devise new lives for themselves. But their test has only just begun, as the impact on the economy starts to show through. It could be that the nation finds heart and fresh purpose in the reconstruction, but it will take massive amounts of will and discipline to ensure that it does.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan: No time to mourn | Editorial"},{"date": "2011-04-12T13:00:29Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The earthquake in Japan on 11 March, which triggered a series of devastating events across the east of the country, has left tens of thousands dead or missing, huge swaths of the population anxious about nuclear energy and had an economic impact that remains opaque. For the English language teachers, that means an uncertain future, not that those remaining are thinking ahead too far.The earthquake came at both the best and the worst time for the region's English language teachers. During an exam period and close to Japanese spring break, many teachers were not at work when the tsunami struck, and have had time to think about their ongoing residence in the country. By the end of March, only one ELT fatality from the disaster had been reported, that of 24-year-old Taylor Anderson, a teacher on the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme in the tsunami-struck town of Ishinomaki in Miyagi prefecture.However, with many schools offering one-year contracts that end on 31 March, employers have struggled to keep teachers as much as teachers have struggled to keep their jobs. \"Many foreigners in Japan are on yearly renewable contracts, most of which end in April,\" said Louis Carlet, vice-chairman of Zenkoku Ippan Tokyo General Union, which represents a large number of EL teachers throughout the country.\"What we are seeing is some companies failing to renew teacher positions in this time of crisis. But on the other hand a lot teachers have left the country, so other jobs have opened up, albeit with worse conditions in a lot of situations,\" he said.David Jones, a programme co-ordinator for the JET programme with the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations (Clair), said the organisation was working on a case-by-case basis to organise future teaching programmes.\"There are places in the affected areas who are working with JET, but right now we are waiting for local governments to assess the situation. The decisions are made by local governments in every area, not us.\"Kazuyuki Hoshi, the assistant director at the international affairs section at the Miyagi prefectural government, told the Kyodo news agency: \"I want more JETs to come in the future, but due to the current situation I cannot welcome them openhandedly.''Among those that have decided to stay, some have taken up posts as volunteers in evacuation centres. Many have families and roots in the country, and never thought about leaving.\"I'll be staying,\" said Justin Doub, a father of two and a 31-year-old teacher with a dispatch company in the city of Kitakami, Iwate prefecture. \"I haven't signed a contract for the coming year yet, but I have been promised one. If anything, I'll probably have more work because so many ALTs left.\"Doub's attitude is similar to that of many that remain, stoical in the face of tough times. \"I say things here are normal, but the restaurants are still closed and the convenience stores are half empty. My family back home keep asking whether we have food, and we do have food, but you can't choose what you get. Not that this bothers me, I'm just grateful to be able to eat.\"In Tokyo, managers with numerous large \"eikaiwa\" English conversation companies report a business-as-usual attitude.However, there are factors that could damage English teaching outside of the worst-afflicted region.In tough economic times, English teaching is badly hit. Long considered a luxury in Japan, English schools can often lose students when the economy is struggling. And the government expects the earthquake and its consequences to cost the country more than $300bn.And it is uncertain whether teachers leaving will be replaced in the short term. By the latter half of March, foreigners entering Japan via Narita airport, the nation's eastern hub, had declined by 60%. And convincing new teachers to come to work in Japan after the worst nuclear disaster the world has seen since Chernobyl may be difficult.As Russell Mallon, a resident of Sendai who works in the PR department of an ELT programme, explained: \"I just don't want to be near to any nuclear facility ever again.\"", "tags": ["Tefl", "Japan disaster", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Schools want foreign staff to return in spite of crisis"},{"date": "2011-04-04T08:58:20Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Organisers have called off plans for a massive \"supergig\", which was to benefit the relief effort in Japan.

Two months ago, the black wave of the tsunami engulfed 16 towns, 95,000 buildings, 23 railway stations, hundreds of miles of road, railway tracks and sea walls. Over 60,000 acres of agricultural land were contaminated. It will take three years just to clear the debris.In spite of the enormity of the task ahead, there are signs that Japan is moving away from disaster management. It may not be, however, politics as usual. Hauled over the coals, not least by his own party, for the way his government dealt with the operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the embattled prime minister, Naoto Kan, has begun to make decisions which are political in nature. He ordered the temporary closure of Hamaoka \u2013 the nuclear plant which sits on an active faultline \u2013 while a new tsunami wall is built, and he has abandoned plans to build 14 reactors over the next 20 years, opting instead for a 20% increase in renewables.This contrasts with the recommendation of Britain's climate change committee this week to increase reliance on nuclear energy. The Department of Energy and Climate Change is also considering a proposal that would cut the subsidy, through feed-in tariffs for generators of solar power. Disaster-stricken Japan is moving in the opposite direction, and it is brutally clear why. Over 80,000 people living within 12 miles of Fukushima have been forced out of their homes and it is far from clear when they will be able to return. Farmers have been forced to abandon their cows, or dump their milk. The compensation bill alone for the 50,000 families forced to leave the exclusion zone could be astronomical. Tepco may apologise deeply and profusely, but Japan's nuclear industry has lost the stranglehold it once had over the energy debate. There are no votes in trying to defend it now.Stabilising Fukushima and building 70,000 temporary homes are immediate problems. But long-term answers will be just as significant. These are being sought by an ambitious team of philosophers and architects led by Makoto Iokibe, a former professor at Kobe university and someone determined not to repeat the same mistakes. Seeking higher ground for the new communities of the north-east is the least of their ideas. He talks of creative reconstruction \u2013 decentralising power away from Tokyo, a reconstruction tax, decreasing the wealth gap between urban and rural areas, creating a springboard for green energy.

About 1m desktop computers would have to be linked up to replicate its performance.The K, a collaborative effort involving Fujitsu and Riken, a government-funded research institute, boasts a current speed of 8.16 petaflops \u2013 or 8.16 quadrillion operations a second \u2013 making it three times faster than China's most powerful machine, the Tianhe-1A, which had topped the rankings since last November.Development of the K was slowed by the natural disaster that struck Japan's north-east coast in March; appropriately enough, when fully functional the supercomputer will be put to use predicting the possible impact of earthquakes and tsunamis.It will also have economic uses in the fields of drugs, new technology and renewable energy, and could be used to improve our understanding of climate change.\"We must realise that science and technology is an area in which Japan can show its strength,\" Riken's president, Ryoji Noyori, told reporters.While Japan's resurgence should have scientists dancing in laboratory corridors, not everyone is convinced that resources should be poured into fueling the country's supercomputer rivalry with the US and, increasingly, China.Funding for the project, estimated at 112bn yen, was almost cut in 2009 when a government panel questioned the investment required in the midst of an economic crisis. Renho, now the government minister in charge of cutting wasteful spending, infuriated scientists when she asked: \"What's wrong with being number two?\"Its future was secured after a group of Nobel prize winners convinced the prime minister at the time, Yukio Hatoyama, that Japan should not settle for second best.Asked to comment on this week's success, Renho said: \"That's good news. I want to salute the people involved.\"The K computer, with more than 68,544 processors, occupies 672 cabinets at Riken's Advanced Institute for Computational Science in the western port city of Kobe. It uses at 9.9 megawatts of power, running up an electricity bill of about $10m (\u00a36.16m) a year \u2014 that's enough electricity to power about 10,000 homes a year.It is more than 200 times faster than the Earth Simulator, a joint project involving NEC and the Japan Agency for Marine-earth Science and Technology, the last Japanese supercomputer to top the global league table, in 2004.Japan's celebrations may not last for long, however.

I'd just finished the illustration I do for a weekly newspaper column and sent the scan to the editor. Suddenly, the building shook so badly that I feared it would collapse. My studio is at the top of a three-storey concrete structure. It has a glass door which opens on to a small terrace, and I rushed to open it because one thing we all know is that tremors can make doors and windows jam. Apart from that, I couldn't do much more but wait.It must have been a minute or two, but it seemed like a very long time until the tremor stopped completely. One of the shelves fell down and CDs scattered all over the floor. The water in the jar for my watercolour paints spilled on the table. I checked the gas main and set off on the five-minute bike ride to the flat where my wife and I live. It was quiet outside. People looked rather stunned, but calm. There were children walking home from school as if nothing had happened.Being born and brought up in Japan I have experienced hundreds of earthquakes in my life, but this was definitely the biggest. We live in Kawasaki, which is west of Tokyo and a few hundred miles away from the worst-hit areas. So the impact that was felt by people nearer to the epicentre must have been enormous.We had no electricity, water or gas for half a day. I couldn't get in touch with my elderly parents, who live 60 miles away. Later, when the phone lines were restored, I found they were all right. But I cannot visit them at the moment because of the petrol shortage and closures of motorways and public transport. Luckily they are doing well in the care of my brother and his wife.Like many people in Japan I spend my days since the earthquake hopelessly watching the worsening situation on TV. Though survivors from flooded villages weep over the loss of friends and family, they almost always add: \"But there are people who are even worse off ... \" This is the phrase that has come to represent the spirit of young and old alike. It has made me feel a little proud to be a part of this community.The Japanese have spent so many centuries living with the effects of earthquakes and typhoons that we all know how powerless and minute we are in the face of nature. We cannot but feel humble when we encounter natural disasters on this scale. But our humility may be our strength, too. It is this very sense of our personal impotence that makes us understand the life-or-death importance of helping each other.One day, in a local market, my wife and I passed a stall selling fresh seaweed. The middle-aged woman who ran it kept saying that this was the last she would be getting and we should savour it because it was very good. She persuaded us to taste it and it was so delicious that we bought two bags.Later we discovered that she was from a coastal town in Miyagi, one of the worst-flooded areas. She couldn't get in touch with her sister's family, the fishermen who had produced the seaweed, but it didn't occur to her to stop working.

But when one of them happens, it does so big time.It may take more than just one speech by the prime minister, Naoto Kan, to persuade Japan that the worst is now over, that the situation at the plant is stabilising, and that people should now concentrate on reconstructing the areas devastated by the tsunami. Formidable problems still remain, such as the 150,000 people still living in emergency shelters \u2013 a number that could nearly double if the 130,000 living between 20 and 30 kilometres from the plant have to leave their homes too. Anger at the ever changing assessments of the radiation dangers and advice has so far been directed at Tepco. The governor of Fukushima prefecture, Yuhei Sato, was so upset he refused to meet Tepco's president, who had travelled to the area to apologise.The Japanese have responded to the worst disaster to befall them in modern times stoically \u2013 some, such as the workers who volunteered to stay in the stricken plant, heroically. It has been a month from hell for people who have had little time to mourn the loss of their families and their homes, let alone devise new lives for themselves. But their test has only just begun, as the impact on the economy starts to show through. It could be that the nation finds heart and fresh purpose in the reconstruction, but it will take massive amounts of will and discipline to ensure that it does.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan: No time to mourn | Editorial"},{"date": "2011-04-12T13:00:29Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The earthquake in Japan on 11 March, which triggered a series of devastating events across the east of the country, has left tens of thousands dead or missing, huge swaths of the population anxious about nuclear energy and had an economic impact that remains opaque. For the English language teachers, that means an uncertain future, not that those remaining are thinking ahead too far.The earthquake came at both the best and the worst time for the region's English language teachers. During an exam period and close to Japanese spring break, many teachers were not at work when the tsunami struck, and have had time to think about their ongoing residence in the country. By the end of March, only one ELT fatality from the disaster had been reported, that of 24-year-old Taylor Anderson, a teacher on the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) Programme in the tsunami-struck town of Ishinomaki in Miyagi prefecture.However, with many schools offering one-year contracts that end on 31 March, employers have struggled to keep teachers as much as teachers have struggled to keep their jobs. \"Many foreigners in Japan are on yearly renewable contracts, most of which end in April,\" said Louis Carlet, vice-chairman of Zenkoku Ippan Tokyo General Union, which represents a large number of EL teachers throughout the country.\"What we are seeing is some companies failing to renew teacher positions in this time of crisis. But on the other hand a lot teachers have left the country, so other jobs have opened up, albeit with worse conditions in a lot of situations,\" he said.David Jones, a programme co-ordinator for the JET programme with the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations (Clair), said the organisation was working on a case-by-case basis to organise future teaching programmes.\"There are places in the affected areas who are working with JET, but right now we are waiting for local governments to assess the situation. The decisions are made by local governments in every area, not us.\"Kazuyuki Hoshi, the assistant director at the international affairs section at the Miyagi prefectural government, told the Kyodo news agency: \"I want more JETs to come in the future, but due to the current situation I cannot welcome them openhandedly.''Among those that have decided to stay, some have taken up posts as volunteers in evacuation centres. Many have families and roots in the country, and never thought about leaving.\"I'll be staying,\" said Justin Doub, a father of two and a 31-year-old teacher with a dispatch company in the city of Kitakami, Iwate prefecture. \"I haven't signed a contract for the coming year yet, but I have been promised one. If anything, I'll probably have more work because so many ALTs left.\"Doub's attitude is similar to that of many that remain, stoical in the face of tough times. \"I say things here are normal, but the restaurants are still closed and the convenience stores are half empty. My family back home keep asking whether we have food, and we do have food, but you can't choose what you get. Not that this bothers me, I'm just grateful to be able to eat.\"In Tokyo, managers with numerous large \"eikaiwa\" English conversation companies report a business-as-usual attitude.However, there are factors that could damage English teaching outside of the worst-afflicted region.In tough economic times, English teaching is badly hit. Long considered a luxury in Japan, English schools can often lose students when the economy is struggling. And the government expects the earthquake and its consequences to cost the country more than $300bn.And it is uncertain whether teachers leaving will be replaced in the short term. By the latter half of March, foreigners entering Japan via Narita airport, the nation's eastern hub, had declined by 60%. And convincing new teachers to come to work in Japan after the worst nuclear disaster the world has seen since Chernobyl may be difficult.As Russell Mallon, a resident of Sendai who works in the PR department of an ELT programme, explained: \"I just don't want to be near to any nuclear facility ever again.\"", "tags": ["Tefl", "Japan disaster", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Schools want foreign staff to return in spite of crisis"},{"date": "2011-04-04T08:58:20Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Organisers have called off plans for a massive \"supergig\", which was to benefit the relief effort in Japan.

Other power utilities would be asked to contribute to the fund, and Tepco is expected to repay the full sum over an, as yet, unspecified number of years.In return for state help, Tepco will have to cut costs and turn its management over to the government \"for a certain period of time\".Tepco, whose share price has fallen 90% since the 11 March tsunami crippled the Fukushima Daiichi plant, promised to make repayments as quickly as possible. \"We hope that the proposed bill will be enacted in parliament as soon as possible,\" it said in a statement.The measure's fate is far from certain, however. Some government and opposition MPs oppose the use of public funds to help Tepco, and the prime minister, Naoto Kan, is still under pressure to resign immediately despite surviving a recent no-confidence motion by promising to step down once the crisis is under control.The current parliamentary session is due to end on 22 June, but the Kan administration is pushing to extend it in the hope of passing the compensation package, as well as an emergency budget to fund post-tsunami reconstruction.News that the bill had gained cabinet approval lifted investor confidence in Tepco, but concern persists that the company will look to consumers to help fund damages claims in the form of higher electricity bills.The trade and industry minister, Banri Kaieda, denied media reports that the government had already approved a 16% increase in electricity charges from next April. \"The government will make sure that any costs passed on to consumers will be kept to a minimum,\" he said.Tepco and two other power utilities are coming under pressure to end their involvement in nuclear power, with groups of investors expected to raise the issue at shareholders meetings at the end of the month.The risks facing the thousands of workers who have taken part in the operation to stabilise Fukushima Daiichi were underlined when Tepco said six more were feared to have exceeded the legal limit of 250 millisieverts [mSv] a year, bringing the total to eight.The limit was raised from 100mSv a year early in the crisis to allow workers to spend more time at the plant, where nuclear fuel in three reactors suffered meltdowns.In the worst cases, two control room workers were exposed to well over twice the legal limit, Tepco said, as it released preliminary results of radiation tests on almost 2,400 workers who were based at the plant in March, when radiation levels were at their highest.The health ministry also said on Monday that at least 90 others have exceeded the original limit of 100mSv, including several who are nearing the 250mSv level.Experts believe that exposure to more than 250mSv increases the chances of a person developing cancer in their lifetime by 1%.Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for Japan's nuclear and safety agency, described the findings as \"extremely regrettable\".Tepco said none of those affected have showed signs of ill health, but added that they would need long-term monitoring.", "tags": ["Japan", "Japan disaster", "Nuclear power", "World news", "Pollution", "Energy", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Fukushima"], "title": "Japan cabinet approves Fukushima nuclear compensation"},{"date": "2011-08-29T19:46:15Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The man who will today become prime minister of the world's third largest economy compared himself yesterday to the dojo loach \u2013 an eel-like creature which scavenges in the mud for snails and leftovers.

The move is a rare admission of defeat by the grocer.[Japanese] Revenue of \u00a3476m last year was less than 1% of group sales. Book value is zero after full impairment last year and we expect the business is making losses. So there will be a book gain. It is good news that CEO Philip Clarke is able to make these tough decisions, not holding on to unnecessary activities. This might mean he will also sell Fresh & Easy if it is not viable, which should be positive for sentiment around the stock.Tesco is to sell its business in Japan with a full sale process to take place over the coming months. This is not a huge surprise given the company fully wrote-down the goodwill attributable to the business at the last results and had already said it wasn't going to allocate any more capital to it.Therefore without any scope to increase densities and drive profitability, it was always a disposal candidate under new CEO Phil Clarke, who is due to complete his review of the business before the interim results (4 October).Tesco operates 129 stores in Japan (small formats), over half of which are profitable. Sales in 2011 were \u00a3476m and we estimate the banner made a small loss (\u00a330m) so estimating likely proceeds is difficult and depends significantly on the buying synergies any strategic buyer feels it could extract.Proceeds aside, this should be taken positively as new CEO Phil Clarke is sticking to his 'no sacred cow' mantra and making pragmatic decisions whilst addressing the key investor concern of deteriorating returns on capital in the international business.While immaterial in Group terms, the strategic decision by Phil Clarke to finally dispose of its Japanese business will be welcomed by the market, for Tesco has never made an acceptable return from the business it acquired in 2004. It follows Carrefour, which swapped its Japanese assets for Tesco's Taiwanese asset in 2005, out of the country.

Yoshihiko Noda's self-depreciation was rhetorical but the quantity of muck he faces is real enough. He inherits a legacy that was enough to finish off five predecessors in as many years, and the list of problems only seems to grow as one failed leader hands over to the next. Mr Noda inherits a nuclear crisis, a north-eastern coastal area devastated by the tsunami, tens of thousands of people yet to be permanently rehoused, an economy in recession staggering under the weight of its public debt, soaring health and social security costs, a divided parliament, a party in crisis and a country that lost faith in its leaders to govern.Japan's debt, at 210 % of GDP \u2013 the highest in the industrialised world \u2013 may paradoxically be the least of his problems. First, because it is sustainable, 95% of it being held by the Japanese themselves. That and a combination of low interest rates means that the treasury has a ready source of cash to finance its debt. Last week's downgrading by Moody's may not have the same effect there as it has had on less indebted economies and could actually help in the long run by lowering the value of the yen. Reducing the debt is a political calculation about which generation bears the greater burden of financing it. The current generation is by European standards lightly taxed. The VAT rate is one-fourth of the British one. Mr Noda, who served as finance minister in the previous administration, has some leeway to raise taxes.The political waters Mr Noda has to navigate are less clear. He emerged the winner of the two-day contest to find the next leader of the governing Democrat party through a process of attrition. He started off as the favourite neither of fellow parliamentarians nor the popular vote. The problems of this party have nothing to do with what is going on in the rest of Japan, but centre on the divisive but still powerful figure of Ichiro Ozawa, a man who continues to control the party's biggest faction despite facing trial in a political funding scandal. The battle to stop the candidate backed by Mr Ozawa was paid for by the most popular candidate, the former foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, whose supporters backed Mr Noda. This is a political loss as Mr Maehara will undoubtedly one day make a strong leader. But the result is the choice of a man with no natural power base within the party.It could be that the man of whom so little is expected succeeds where others have failed. Mr Noda yesterday stressed his humble origins to a political class which hold seats as a matter of family tradition. But the enigma of Japan's inability to find a leader the country can rally around remains. For some analysts, the lack of an entity that can hold true authority over the bureaucrats and industrialists who run the country is a function of modern Japan's continued dependence on Pax Americana, which anyway is a commodity in short supply. But that does not wholly explain the emergence of popular leaders like Junichiro Koizumi who managed to struggle above the fray. For others, there are structural reasons why the office of prime minister is undervalued \u2013 its relatively low salary and short term. That Americans had no clear understanding of the dynamics of Japanese power that led to the Pacific war, and that a post-war country characterised by weak politicians and strong bureaucrats suited Washington's military interests, are not now sufficient explanations for the crisis of Japanese leadership.The prospects for Mr Noda's political longevity are not bright, but the first and most basic task he faces is to seize control of his party and his government.

But now local authorities are taking lessons from Japan on how to use popular culture, regional history and local produce to promote regions across the country.The Japan Local Government Centre, which boasts an office in central London, is working to share the lessons of Japanese local authority projects with their counterparts in the UK. Japan, the centre claims, is facing the same national and local problems as other westernised countries, including governance, public service reform, demographic change and creating a low carbon society.Recent schemes to connect local residents to their communities in Japan have sought to exploit regional strengths to create a new identity \u2013 including designing pop art characters to represent the area. It has been a success, with residents reporting a sense of ownership and pride in their city.Nerima city, a ward of Tokyo, is the birthplace of Japanese animation, one of the country's biggest cultural exports. With more than 90 production companies based in the region, it is the city in which anime masters Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki cut their teeth. Yet a 2009 survey found that half of local residents knew nothing about its history or cultural importance.In an attempt to revitalise the area through its biggest industry, the local authority launched an official anime homepage in 2010, describing the history of the industry and showcasing interviews with designers. It was so popular the council commissioned the design of a new anime character, named Nerimaru, as a city mascot.\"Pop culture such as manga and anime, and using them for local produce promotion, has been a tradition in Japan for a number of years,\" explains Keith Kelly, a researcher at the centre. \"Japan has a long tradition of pride in products and food. Wherever you go in Japan all areas have meibutsu (famous local products) so these products already have a well-known history. Cashing in on manga and anime has been a recent adapting of this tendency, another meibutsu for which to raise the presence of the area.The idea was so successful it spread. After a popular manga exhibition in 2000, the region of Iwate in the north-east of the country decided to launch its own manga anthology, published in January this year. It is published by the local authority, drawn by local artists to cover local issues, and is intended to showcase the region's most attractive features including dramatic scenery and Japan's famous hospitality.The lwate prefectural government had planned to press just 10,000 copies of the first volume, but pre-publication sales topped 13,000. The impact of the project in terms of \"soft power diplomacy\" and raised profile for the region was considerable.Now many areas of Japan have their own character, or pop culture identity, and the process of designing the character has involved residents. \"Other areas have asked the local community to get involved by suggesting ideas. Children have also been invited to come up with characters for adoption in a campaign. Very often the public will be asked to name the character,\" Kelly explains.Kelly says that there are key lessons for British councils by watching the success of pop culture campaigns. \"There is definitely something about local pride and identifying with local culture which works well in Japan,\" he says. \"Japanese local authorities tap into this more than most UK local authorities which have a very corporate identity.\"Creating a unique identity could help boost internal tourism in the UK, Kelly suggests. He admits there may be a \"Daily Mail test\" over the diversion of public funds to building a cultural identity. However, he says, this could be surmounted if local artists were involved, \"employed in the local economy to promote their area\". The economic benefits of attracting new people to the area to consume local culture are clear.There are risks. In the Nara region of Japan, a mascot called Sento-kun designed to represent the 1,200th anniversary of the area proved controversial. The Buddhist-style cartoon icon with deer antlers, intended to symbolise the animals Nara city is famous for, attracted a lot of criticism. However, local government officials said that the debate around the character attracted publicity worth billions of Yen.Kelly warns British authorities that deciding to invest in an identity may seem a difficult decision, but will pay off. \"It's a chicken and the egg situation,\" he says. \"If you don't invest in local identity as a way of investing in the local economy then there are not local products being sold on the markets to grow the local economy, in the form of job creation and getting people into the area and spending money.\"This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Every few months sees the release of a new set of figures, stats and stories trumpeting the same meme: today's Japanese men are unmanly \u2013 and worse, they don't seem bothered by it.Tagged in the domestic media over the past few years as hikikomori (socially withdrawn boys), soshoku danshi (grass-eating/herbivore men, uninterested in meat, fleshly sex and physical or workplace competition), or just generally feckless, Japan's Y-chromosomed youth today elicit shrugs of \"why?\", followed by heaving sighs of disappointment from their postwar elders and members of the opposite sex. With the country's economy stagnant at best, its geopolitical foothold rapidly slipping into the crevice between China and the United States, and its northeast coastline still struggling with the aftermath of disaster and an ongoing nuclear crisis, the reaction to a failure of Japan's men to take the reins, even symbolically, has evolved from whispers of curiosity to charges of incompetence.In the most recent government study, published at the end of last month, the percentage of unmarried men spiked 9.2 points from five years ago. More telling: 61% of those unwed men reported not having a girlfriend, and 45% said they couldn't care less about finding one.What gives? As anyone who has watched Japanese or Korean pop videos knows, the popular image of men in Asia, seen from a western perspective, is more effeminate than macho, rife with makeup, stylised hairdos and choreographed dance steps. Even so-called punks in Japan lean more to Vivienne Westwood than Malcolm McLaren \u2013 more familiar with fashion spreads than the spitting in the street.And yet Japan was rebuilt from the ashes of the second world war into an economic and technological powerhouse with historically unprecedented speed on the backs of labourers, mainly men, laying the rails of the nation's astonishing bullet train, for example.Why the generational malaise and indifference to sex? Theories abound. The most provocative to me, a Japanese-American and longtime Tokyo resident, is that Japanese women have become stronger socially and economically at the very same time that Japanese men have become more mole-ish and fully absorbed in virtual worlds, satiated by the very technological wizardry their forebears foisted upon them, and even preferring it to reality. \"I don't like real women,\" one bloke superciliously sniffed on Japan's 2channel, the world's largest and most active internet bulletin board site. \"They're too picky nowadays. I'd much rather have a virtual girlfriend.\"Virtual girlfriends became a sensation last summer, when Japanese game-maker Konami released its second-generation of its popular Love Plus, called, aptly, Love Plus +, for the Nintendo DS gaming system. Konami skillfully arranged for an otherwise deadbeat beach resort town called Atami to host a Love Plus + holiday weekend. Players were invited to tote their virtual girlfriends, via the gaming console, to the actual resort town to cavort for a weekend in romantic bliss. The promotion was absurdly successful, with local resort operators reporting that it was their best weekend in decades.I tried to explain the phenomenon via a TV interview for a US cable station: the men who spent their yen on a weekend of romance with a digital lover were a subset of a subculture many times removed from mainstream Japan. They are known as otaku, or hyper-obsessive and often asocial men who seek solace in imaginary worlds (not unlike many artists and writers, I should add). Nevertheless, these were clearly young Japanese man of a generation that found the imperfect or just unexpected demands of real-world relationships with women less enticing than the lure of the virtual libido. You can't have sex with a digital graphic, but you can get sexually excited, and maybe satisfied, by one.The phrase \"herbivore men\" was coined by a female Japanese journalist in 2006. By 2009, the Japanese male's lack of ambition, sexually or otherwise, had become a media meme. With the latest reports in Japan, of men who can't get it up for real women who won't get married or have kids, the mutual gender-chill phenomenon has become mainstream. It may be the future, but is it really Japanese?\"Maybe we're just advanced human beings,\" says a Japanese friend of mine over dinner this week in Tokyo, who won't let me use her real name. She is an attractive, 40-something editor at one of Japan's premier fashion magazines, and she is still single. \"Maybe,\" she adds, \"we've learned how to service ourselves.\"", "tags": ["Japan", "Sex", "Gender", "Virtual worlds", "Asia Pacific", "Life and style", "Games", "Technology", "World news", "Culture"], "title": "Japan leads the way in sexless love | Roland Kelts"},{"date": "2011-10-16T14:00:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Next week the Guardian's industrial editor, Dan Milmo, will be blogging each morning from Japan where he will be gauging the health of the country's manufacturing sector in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami.

Every few months sees the release of a new set of figures, stats and stories trumpeting the same meme: today's Japanese men are unmanly \u2013 and worse, they don't seem bothered by it.Tagged in the domestic media over the past few years as hikikomori (socially withdrawn boys), soshoku danshi (grass-eating/herbivore men, uninterested in meat, fleshly sex and physical or workplace competition), or just generally feckless, Japan's Y-chromosomed youth today elicit shrugs of \"why?\", followed by heaving sighs of disappointment from their postwar elders and members of the opposite sex. With the country's economy stagnant at best, its geopolitical foothold rapidly slipping into the crevice between China and the United States, and its northeast coastline still struggling with the aftermath of disaster and an ongoing nuclear crisis, the reaction to a failure of Japan's men to take the reins, even symbolically, has evolved from whispers of curiosity to charges of incompetence.In the most recent government study, published at the end of last month, the percentage of unmarried men spiked 9.2 points from five years ago. More telling: 61% of those unwed men reported not having a girlfriend, and 45% said they couldn't care less about finding one.What gives? As anyone who has watched Japanese or Korean pop videos knows, the popular image of men in Asia, seen from a western perspective, is more effeminate than macho, rife with makeup, stylised hairdos and choreographed dance steps. Even so-called punks in Japan lean more to Vivienne Westwood than Malcolm McLaren \u2013 more familiar with fashion spreads than the spitting in the street.And yet Japan was rebuilt from the ashes of the second world war into an economic and technological powerhouse with historically unprecedented speed on the backs of labourers, mainly men, laying the rails of the nation's astonishing bullet train, for example.Why the generational malaise and indifference to sex? Theories abound. The most provocative to me, a Japanese-American and longtime Tokyo resident, is that Japanese women have become stronger socially and economically at the very same time that Japanese men have become more mole-ish and fully absorbed in virtual worlds, satiated by the very technological wizardry their forebears foisted upon them, and even preferring it to reality. \"I don't like real women,\" one bloke superciliously sniffed on Japan's 2channel, the world's largest and most active internet bulletin board site. \"They're too picky nowadays. I'd much rather have a virtual girlfriend.\"Virtual girlfriends became a sensation last summer, when Japanese game-maker Konami released its second-generation of its popular Love Plus, called, aptly, Love Plus +, for the Nintendo DS gaming system. Konami skillfully arranged for an otherwise deadbeat beach resort town called Atami to host a Love Plus + holiday weekend. Players were invited to tote their virtual girlfriends, via the gaming console, to the actual resort town to cavort for a weekend in romantic bliss. The promotion was absurdly successful, with local resort operators reporting that it was their best weekend in decades.I tried to explain the phenomenon via a TV interview for a US cable station: the men who spent their yen on a weekend of romance with a digital lover were a subset of a subculture many times removed from mainstream Japan. They are known as otaku, or hyper-obsessive and often asocial men who seek solace in imaginary worlds (not unlike many artists and writers, I should add). Nevertheless, these were clearly young Japanese man of a generation that found the imperfect or just unexpected demands of real-world relationships with women less enticing than the lure of the virtual libido. You can't have sex with a digital graphic, but you can get sexually excited, and maybe satisfied, by one.The phrase \"herbivore men\" was coined by a female Japanese journalist in 2006. By 2009, the Japanese male's lack of ambition, sexually or otherwise, had become a media meme. With the latest reports in Japan, of men who can't get it up for real women who won't get married or have kids, the mutual gender-chill phenomenon has become mainstream. It may be the future, but is it really Japanese?\"Maybe we're just advanced human beings,\" says a Japanese friend of mine over dinner this week in Tokyo, who won't let me use her real name.

Or, more accurately, they want your kids to think they are. Every New Year's Eve, these anti-Santas visit homes to terrify children into promising to behave over the coming year. The parents, meanwhile, stand in mock shock as the monsters threaten to abduct their soon-traumatised offspring. Eventually the beasts (the Namahage, that is) are appeased with a healthy dose of sake. Would Supernanny approve? Does it matter? For those who can't make it on 31 December, the appropriately named Oga district has a museum and several Namahage re-enactments throughout the day. \u2022 Namahage Museum, Aza-Mizukuisawa, Shinzan, Kitaura, namahage.co.jp, adults \u00a34.20, children \u00a32.10There are hundreds of onsens \u2013 traditional, strictly naked Japanese spas \u2013 around the country, but they're of wildly varying quality. Some are little more then leisure centres with communal baths. The best are more like Nyutou Onsenkyo, deep in Akita prefecture. Once upon a time this was the kind of place where a ninja would have slipped through the low bamboo roof and tried to catch a samurai off-guard. Steam rises from milky volcanic water in tiny wooden huts with the sound of a stream running just outside the clouded window: altogether almost certainly enough to have distracted the other patrons as I wrestled awkwardly with the concept of my nakedness. \u2022 Nyutou Onsenkyo spa, tsurunoyu.com/english, \u00a34.20 for a day pass, 10am-3pmThe hour-long trek to the top of Mount Hakodate would be worth recommending at any time of the year. Within a few minutes of starting the trail, the noise of the city below drops off completely, and the views from the top are spectacular day and night. But at the end of summer, during the typhoon season, electrical storms are a fairly regular occurrence. Then the views become genuinely dramatic. We made it up just in time to see the start of a colossal cloud burst, lightning and all, before we were sent running for cover, giggling and trembling as the thunder shook the observation deck.There are plenty of towns and cities in Japan that are almost unbearably normal. Perhaps that's not surprising as the second world war effectively hit the reset button across the country. Initially, we'd worried that Towada City in the far north of Honshu might be crushingly functional, but then we were taken to the Towada Art Center. Sometime just before the global financial crisis (it's hard to imagine it getting the green light today) the city commissioned a very modern art gallery featuring works from Ron Mueck, Hans Op de Beeck and Yoko Ono, among others. The little white building hasn't been enough to contain it all, though, so dozens of works are out in the street too.To the mild disappointment of many people we meet on the road, despite being Scottish I don't actually like whisky. But that seems to be changing with my visit to Japan. It's not technically Scotch but Nikka whisky is as close as it gets: Masataka Taketsuru founded the company in the otherwise unremarkable town of Yoichi, after studying the distilling process in Glasgow. He picked Hokkaido as the site of his maiden factory as he thought it most like Scotland \u2013 the Glaswegian wife he brought back with him in 1920 agreed. How their union would have gone down in the Wee Smoke when razor gangs were ruling the streets I can only imagine, but years later the whisky and its visitors' centre are roaring successes. \u2022 Yoichi distillery, nikka.com/eng, +81 135 23 3131, self-guided tours free, 9am-5pmWith a plate of shark fin soup sitting next to a bamboo bowl of whale sashimi in Konnyaku Basho, we were getting ready to saddle the high horse when our guide explained that everything in the restaurant is made from miracle food konnyaku (also known as elephant yam). Nothing was as it seemed: the grilled chicken tasted like grilled chicken; the clam tasted like clam; the snozberries tasted like snozberries. Presumably the whale and shark were accurate representations too (neither were very nice) which meant our innocence was intact \u2013 and not just because konnyaku is said to be virtually fat-, calorie-, soy- and gluten-free.Even the locals aren't sure if Kurobe Gorge falls within what are known as the Japanese Alps or not. To us, it didn't'really matter: the train ride over rickety bridges, along tracks that wailed like perturbed banshees, was unforgettable. The half-dozen hydro-electric power stations that line the river below are, in light of the Fukushima disaster, probably more popular than ever. And when we looked up at the waterfalls, at the soaring pine trees that covered mountains beyond mountains, we didn't really notice them. The track was originally laid to transport workers further into the gorge for excavations \u2013 what a commute that must have been. \u2022 Kurobe Gorge train, kurotetu.co.jp/en, return fare from Unazuki to Kuronagi, adults \u00a35.65, children \u00a32.35It may reek of novelty tourism, but the \"cuckoo dumplings\" you can eat at the viewing platform for the Gembikei Gorge are worth the 400 yen (\u00a34.35). Patrons are invited to place their money in a basket which is then whisked away on a pulley system over the green waters below. All being well, a few seconds later it returns with three sticks of gooey rice dumplings covered in soy, sesame and sweet bean paste. They didn't sustain us all day, so I shelved my dignity for half an hour to indulge in the gluttonous practise of wanko soba, a speciality in Iwate. It sounds like a dare between students, but the idea is to eat as many small bowls of buckwheat noodles as you can. I got to 36 before nausea took over.All the carbohydrates in Hiraizumi were at least put to use walking around nearby Mount Kanzan, the centre of Japan's newest Unesco world heritage site. Full of tales of bloodthirsty warlords, disembowelments and deaths by blunt sword, it delivers on the fantasies of every baka gaijin (stupid foreigner) about feudal Japan. There are half a dozen pagodas, temples and shrines spread across the hill, the star of which is Chusonji, the Golden Hall. Unlike much of Iwate's coast, the site escaped any significant damage during the earthquake and was only added to Unesco's list in June. When so many other foreign bodies deserted this stricken prefecture, it's somehow reassuring to know that the UN had not.Less than 20 minutes away from the very worst of the tsunami zone, the Shiogama Nakaoroshi fish market was heavy damaged on 11 March. Six months later it was as though nothing happened: old men were elbow deep in enormous tuna heads while their wives tried to tempt us with writhing octopus. We walked around collecting the best offerings at knock-down prices, then sat down for a sashimi breakfast. Not all of it was good: uni (sea urchin) looks and tastes like a dolphin has sneezed on the plate. But the caught-that-morning tuna, mackerel, eel and scallops were oishii (delicious). Washed down with a can of cold coffee, it was the sort of breakfast that would have our grandparents grimacing in disgust.

In the climate change negotiations, Japan has consistently supported the expeditious adoption of a new, single and comprehensive, legally binding document which establishes a fair and effective international framework in which all major economies participate. Japan's position is that the new document should be adopted as early as possible. Until there is a new international framework, based on the Cancun agreements, Japan believes all countries should continue efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.Japan emphasises the importance of support for developing countries, in particular those vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change, and so far has implemented more than $11.3bn of $15bn that was pledged at Copenhagen (COP15) to this end. From now on, Japan will put into effect commitments it has announced, and from 2013 will provide help for vulnerable countries in concert with the international community. It will also give due consideration to adaptation to climate change, which is important to developing countries. As well as announcing this stance at the pre-COP meeting held in South Africa this October, Japan has officially handed its submission to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. COP17 is being held in Durban, South Africa, from 28 November to 9 December. It is important that the whole world agrees on the need for a legally binding document, and achieves significant progress in this regard. Japan is determined to join other countries in resolutely tackling this issue.Naoki ItoMinister\u00a0(economic), Embassy of Japan\u2022 John Ashton is right to say we need to at least \"commit to commit\" to tackle climate change (Comment, 15 November). The trouble is, most countries have done so but failed to spell out what that commitment means. This has allowed some to shrug off the idea that the global Contraction and Convergence framework is required, on the grounds that a grindingly slow step-by-step approach is what ensures buy-in. What this approach actually secures is a series of witheringly small advances in the face of an alarming acceleration of the problem. This is hailed by those involved as a success, in the pretence that action is being taken. Politicians can point to minute triumphs \u2013 for their negotiating positions, if nothing else \u2013 and life goes on, business as usual. The Poznan UN climate change summit, a year before Copenhagen and a year into the credit crunch, saw minister after minister hailing the green revolution response to climate change as our economy's saviour.

Not even a single grain from the patch is in circulation.\"Sato said: \"I can tell you that you don't have to worry at all about rice that has already been shipped.\" Last month, however, he had given assurances that rice from Fukushima was safe following tests on batches grown in 48 parts of the prefecture, including Onami, located about 40 miles (60km) from the plant.Onami accounted for 1.8% of Fukushima's total rice crop and the radiation levels, while above the government's safety threshold, did not pose a risk to health, reports said.But the discovery is certain to reignite concern over the safety of food from the Fukushima area and the authorities' ability to ensure tainted produce does not go on sale.In July the government banned all shipments of beef from the prefecture after meat from more than 500 cows that had been fed contaminated straw was sent to other parts of the country.Bans have been imposed on some vegetables and milk, and elevated levels of radiation have been found in green tea grown 250 miles from Fukushima Daiichi.Supermarkets in Tokyo are divided over whether to accept rice from Fukushima. Some stores and wholesalers have taken advantage of the grain's comparatively low price but only five supermarket chains are selling it in the capital.The radiation scare is unlikely to affect rice distribution in Japan.

In the climate change negotiations, Japan has consistently supported the expeditious adoption of a new, single and comprehensive, legally binding document which establishes a fair and effective international framework in which all major economies participate. Japan's position is that the new document should be adopted as early as possible. Until there is a new international framework, based on the Cancun agreements, Japan believes all countries should continue efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.Japan emphasises the importance of support for developing countries, in particular those vulnerable to the negative effects of climate change, and so far has implemented more than $11.3bn of $15bn that was pledged at Copenhagen (COP15) to this end. From now on, Japan will put into effect commitments it has announced, and from 2013 will provide help for vulnerable countries in concert with the international community. It will also give due consideration to adaptation to climate change, which is important to developing countries. As well as announcing this stance at the pre-COP meeting held in South Africa this October, Japan has officially handed its submission to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. COP17 is being held in Durban, South Africa, from 28 November to 9 December. It is important that the whole world agrees on the need for a legally binding document, and achieves significant progress in this regard. Japan is determined to join other countries in resolutely tackling this issue.Naoki ItoMinister\u00a0(economic), Embassy of Japan\u2022 John Ashton is right to say we need to at least \"commit to commit\" to tackle climate change (Comment, 15 November). The trouble is, most countries have done so but failed to spell out what that commitment means. This has allowed some to shrug off the idea that the global Contraction and Convergence framework is required, on the grounds that a grindingly slow step-by-step approach is what ensures buy-in. What this approach actually secures is a series of witheringly small advances in the face of an alarming acceleration of the problem. This is hailed by those involved as a success, in the pretence that action is being taken. Politicians can point to minute triumphs \u2013 for their negotiating positions, if nothing else \u2013 and life goes on, business as usual. The Poznan UN climate change summit, a year before Copenhagen and a year into the credit crunch, saw minister after minister hailing the green revolution response to climate change as our economy's saviour.

Not even a single grain from the patch is in circulation.\"Sato said: \"I can tell you that you don't have to worry at all about rice that has already been shipped.\" Last month, however, he had given assurances that rice from Fukushima was safe following tests on batches grown in 48 parts of the prefecture, including Onami, located about 40 miles (60km) from the plant.Onami accounted for 1.8% of Fukushima's total rice crop and the radiation levels, while above the government's safety threshold, did not pose a risk to health, reports said.But the discovery is certain to reignite concern over the safety of food from the Fukushima area and the authorities' ability to ensure tainted produce does not go on sale.In July the government banned all shipments of beef from the prefecture after meat from more than 500 cows that had been fed contaminated straw was sent to other parts of the country.Bans have been imposed on some vegetables and milk, and elevated levels of radiation have been found in green tea grown 250 miles from Fukushima Daiichi.Supermarkets in Tokyo are divided over whether to accept rice from Fukushima. Some stores and wholesalers have taken advantage of the grain's comparatively low price but only five supermarket chains are selling it in the capital.The radiation scare is unlikely to affect rice distribution in Japan.

Every few months sees the release of a new set of figures, stats and stories trumpeting the same meme: today's Japanese men are unmanly \u2013 and worse, they don't seem bothered by it.Tagged in the domestic media over the past few years as hikikomori (socially withdrawn boys), soshoku danshi (grass-eating/herbivore men, uninterested in meat, fleshly sex and physical or workplace competition), or just generally feckless, Japan's Y-chromosomed youth today elicit shrugs of \"why?\", followed by heaving sighs of disappointment from their postwar elders and members of the opposite sex. With the country's economy stagnant at best, its geopolitical foothold rapidly slipping into the crevice between China and the United States, and its northeast coastline still struggling with the aftermath of disaster and an ongoing nuclear crisis, the reaction to a failure of Japan's men to take the reins, even symbolically, has evolved from whispers of curiosity to charges of incompetence.In the most recent government study, published at the end of last month, the percentage of unmarried men spiked 9.2 points from five years ago. More telling: 61% of those unwed men reported not having a girlfriend, and 45% said they couldn't care less about finding one.What gives? As anyone who has watched Japanese or Korean pop videos knows, the popular image of men in Asia, seen from a western perspective, is more effeminate than macho, rife with makeup, stylised hairdos and choreographed dance steps. Even so-called punks in Japan lean more to Vivienne Westwood than Malcolm McLaren \u2013 more familiar with fashion spreads than the spitting in the street.And yet Japan was rebuilt from the ashes of the second world war into an economic and technological powerhouse with historically unprecedented speed on the backs of labourers, mainly men, laying the rails of the nation's astonishing bullet train, for example.Why the generational malaise and indifference to sex? Theories abound. The most provocative to me, a Japanese-American and longtime Tokyo resident, is that Japanese women have become stronger socially and economically at the very same time that Japanese men have become more mole-ish and fully absorbed in virtual worlds, satiated by the very technological wizardry their forebears foisted upon them, and even preferring it to reality. \"I don't like real women,\" one bloke superciliously sniffed on Japan's 2channel, the world's largest and most active internet bulletin board site. \"They're too picky nowadays. I'd much rather have a virtual girlfriend.\"Virtual girlfriends became a sensation last summer, when Japanese game-maker Konami released its second-generation of its popular Love Plus, called, aptly, Love Plus +, for the Nintendo DS gaming system. Konami skillfully arranged for an otherwise deadbeat beach resort town called Atami to host a Love Plus + holiday weekend. Players were invited to tote their virtual girlfriends, via the gaming console, to the actual resort town to cavort for a weekend in romantic bliss. The promotion was absurdly successful, with local resort operators reporting that it was their best weekend in decades.I tried to explain the phenomenon via a TV interview for a US cable station: the men who spent their yen on a weekend of romance with a digital lover were a subset of a subculture many times removed from mainstream Japan. They are known as otaku, or hyper-obsessive and often asocial men who seek solace in imaginary worlds (not unlike many artists and writers, I should add). Nevertheless, these were clearly young Japanese man of a generation that found the imperfect or just unexpected demands of real-world relationships with women less enticing than the lure of the virtual libido. You can't have sex with a digital graphic, but you can get sexually excited, and maybe satisfied, by one.The phrase \"herbivore men\" was coined by a female Japanese journalist in 2006. By 2009, the Japanese male's lack of ambition, sexually or otherwise, had become a media meme. With the latest reports in Japan, of men who can't get it up for real women who won't get married or have kids, the mutual gender-chill phenomenon has become mainstream. It may be the future, but is it really Japanese?\"Maybe we're just advanced human beings,\" says a Japanese friend of mine over dinner this week in Tokyo, who won't let me use her real name. She is an attractive, 40-something editor at one of Japan's premier fashion magazines, and she is still single. \"Maybe,\" she adds, \"we've learned how to service ourselves.\"", "tags": ["Japan", "Sex", "Gender", "Virtual worlds", "Asia Pacific", "Life and style", "Games", "Technology", "World news", "Culture"], "title": "Japan leads the way in sexless love | Roland Kelts"},{"date": "2011-10-03T11:55:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "A few weeks have passed since my fiancee Katy Morrison and I were selected ahead of nearly 2,000 other applicants from 85 countries to become travel volunteers in Japan.

Or, more accurately, they want your kids to think they are. Every New Year's Eve, these anti-Santas visit homes to terrify children into promising to behave over the coming year. The parents, meanwhile, stand in mock shock as the monsters threaten to abduct their soon-traumatised offspring. Eventually the beasts (the Namahage, that is) are appeased with a healthy dose of sake. Would Supernanny approve? Does it matter?

Some are little more then leisure centres with communal baths. The best are more like Nyutou Onsenkyo, deep in Akita prefecture. Once upon a time this was the kind of place where a ninja would have slipped through the low bamboo roof and tried to catch a samurai off-guard. Steam rises from milky volcanic water in tiny wooden huts with the sound of a stream running just outside the clouded window: altogether almost certainly enough to have distracted the other patrons as I wrestled awkwardly with the concept of my nakedness. \u2022 Nyutou Onsenkyo spa, tsurunoyu.com/english, \u00a34.20 for a day pass, 10am-3pmThe hour-long trek to the top of Mount Hakodate would be worth recommending at any time of the year. Within a few minutes of starting the trail, the noise of the city below drops off completely, and the views from the top are spectacular day and night. But at the end of summer, during the typhoon season, electrical storms are a fairly regular occurrence. Then the views become genuinely dramatic. We made it up just in time to see the start of a colossal cloud burst, lightning and all, before we were sent running for cover, giggling and trembling as the thunder shook the observation deck.There are plenty of towns and cities in Japan that are almost unbearably normal. Perhaps that's not surprising as the second world war effectively hit the reset button across the country. Initially, we'd worried that Towada City in the far north of Honshu might be crushingly functional, but then we were taken to the Towada Art Center. Sometime just before the global financial crisis (it's hard to imagine it getting the green light today) the city commissioned a very modern art gallery featuring works from Ron Mueck, Hans Op de Beeck and Yoko Ono, among others.

The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, has said, however, the country can survive the summer free of power cuts even without nuclear power.The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, believes Japan needs to retain a number of reactors while it develops alternative energy sources. The Fukushima crisis forced the country to abandon plans to generate more than 50% of its power from nuclear by 2030.Towns that host nuclear power plants have criticised the government for introducing the tests before the official investigation into the Fukushima accident is complete. Local approval is not legally required to restart a reactor, but few believe the government will bring plants back online without public support.In another measure designed to bolster public confidence in nuclear power, the cabinet on Tuesday approved legislation that will end the nuclear safety agency's organisational ties to the trade and industry ministry.The ministry has been criticised for failing to recognise the dangers posed by nuclear power and for its close ties to utilities.The bill would also limit a reactor's operational lifespan to 40 years, with a controversial one-time extension of 20 years for those that pass additional safety tests.

Notoriously difficult, the game allowed two players to play co-op together, ushering in a wave of multi-player shooting games that currently dominate computer consoles. The Nintendo home console version had the infamous Konami Code, a secret code that could be entered to give players much-needed extra lives. \u2022 Play ContraWhat Space Invaders was to shooting games, Street Fighter II was to fighting games. Taking inspiration from Hong Kong kung-fu flicks, Street Fighter II featured colourful characters and cool, complicated moves that made it a game of skill, speed and strategy. The game's success meant that arcades were dominated by fighting games throughout the 1990s, and rival studios made exciting brawlers of their own (such as SNK's The King of Fighters).

They included Yasuaki Uwabe, who was convicted of killing five people at a train station in 1999.The executions are the first since July 2010; none of the 132 people on death row was executed in 2011, the first time a year had passed without executions for 19 years.Their executions came as a blow to campaigners, who only this week welcomed Japan's apparent de facto moratorium on capital punishment. Hideki Wakabayashi, executive director of Amnesty International Japan, accused the Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) government of reneging on an earlier promise to look seriously at its use of the death penalty.\"We still need to have a national debate,\" Wakabayashi told the Guardian. \"But while we are doing that there has to be a moratorium on executions. The DPJ is supposed to support human rights. The executions also run against the international movement against he death penalty.

In the announcement, Amnesty's Catherine Baber did note that \"executions could resume at any time\".\"We continue to be concerned for the roughly 130 people on death row, including several prisoners with mental illnesses, and we call on the minister of justice not to resume executions but rather to work towards abolition.\"In September 2010 the then justice minister, Keiko Chiba, ordered a review of the death penalty.

Prisoners are not told when they will be executed until a few hours before they are led away to the gallows, and their relatives and lawyers are informed only after the execution has been carried out. In a report issued this week, Amnesty noted a rise in the number of executions worldwide in 2011 [PDF], mainly due to a significant increase in the Middle East.The US - the only G7 country to carry out executions last year - is one of 58 countries, including Japan, China and Iran, that retain capital punishment.

It was well prepared for the type of disaster that would happen once every 100 years, but not for a far greater one-in-a-1000-years one. No wonder the catastrophe overwhelmed Japan's well-laid plans for protecting people, buildings and infrastructure.Fail-safe measures to cope with a super-disaster are practically beyond the nation's wealth: the worst-case scenario is sequential or even simultaneous occurrence in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, the central Pacific coast and the southwestern Pacific coast.Alongside national and local government efforts to improve disaster preparations, individuals now have to consider the topographic, geological and social features of their homes and workplaces, and have less choice over where to live than in the past.The areas devastated on 3/11 need a new and comprehensive approach to urban planning and social programmes. In coastal areas, people may work on the seafront but have to live on high ground. The elderly in this rapidly greying society, who often live alone, need to move into regional hubs for better care and services, such as collective housing. And the highly concentrated population and functions of megalopolises, particularly Tokyo, will have to disperse to smaller hub cities in order to dissipate the risks involved in a super-disaster.The general sense of anxiety has been exacerbated by the continuation of the restrictions on the electricity supply caused by the shutdown of all the country's nuclear power plants for checks.The badly damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant discharged massive amounts of nuclear pollutants, endangering population in the immediate vicinity. As the only nation that has suffered an atomic bombing, Japan reacted sharply to the nuclear accident. However, its people were unknowingly exposed to a considerably higher level of radiation resulting from the nuclear test explosions that China conducted in the 1960s, and nowadays they commonly undergo radiation-based medical examinations such as X-raying and CT scanning.In order to make up the 30% drop in power supply caused by the shutdown, electricity companies have reactivated old thermal power plants, and businesses and individuals have conserved power. People wore fewer clothes in the summer to reduce the need for air conditioning, and wrapped up warmer in winter. And many businesses worked over weekends, shifting a weekend holiday to a week day, to ease peaks in power demand. Nonetheless, energy from fossil-fuels costs more than nuclear, so bills have been higher, which has damaged Japan's international competitiveness. As the sense of fear calms down, however, the public will probably learn to accept nuclear power again, though with a reduced dependence.All the nuclear plants withstood the 3/11 seismic shock, though the three damaged reactors at Fukushima did not survive the tsunami. And two of those three reactors used the old, defective US-built turn-key model, prior to the construction of Japanese-designed, modified ones.Protection against the tsunami threat can be improved; but if sufficient work cannot be done, the plants on the Pacific coast will have to be relocated to the opposite Sea-of-Japan coast that suffers far fewer earthquakes.This could all have been done even before 3/11. In this sense, the nuclear accident was attributable in part to intellectual arrogance and a longstanding but inadequate safety regime.With their loss of peace of mind, many Japanese people feel as if they have been expelled from a country close to paradise. Yet 3/11 has made the people far tougher and the nation more resilient. The postwar era is now over, and the post-disaster era is under way. Natural disaster, not war, will finally transform Japan's carefree cold-war era collective mind.\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Earthquakes"], "title": "After the earthquake: changing Japan | Masahiro Matsumura"},{"date": "2012-02-01T10:00:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The first arcades in Japan weren't video arcades, and they weren't even in game centres. In the decades following the second world war, gamers played electro-magnetic games in bowling alleys and on department store rooftops. Families would take shopping breaks, playing carnival-style shooting games or riding rinky-dink kiddy trains. Gradually, early analogue arcade games began popping up \u2013 driving games in which the road was on a rotating belt, and players had to steer a small car through obstacles. Companies like Namco and Sega started joining in, releasing magnet-powered cabinets that were the forerunners of the modern arcade game.In 1978, everything changed as Space Invaders enthralled the country \u2013 and the rest of the western world \u2013 spawning a slew of arcades and players dedicated solely to the new game. The game's release came just as Star Wars was hitting Japanese cinemas \u2013 and the timing could not have been better. Thanks to Space Invaders, for more than a decade Japanese arcades were dominated by shooting games, something that would not change until the release of Street Fighter II in 1991. Like Space Invaders, Street Fighter II, with its colourful characters and engaging gameplay, set the theme for the decade: if the 80s was about shooting, the 90s were for fighting.In the second half of the 90s, and for the bulk of the noughties, arcades opened up to an even wider audience thanks to female-aimed sticker picture machines, and rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution. The rhythm games unleashed a new type of spectacle in Japanese arcades \u2013 this wasn't about gameplay any more, but the act of playing. Complex dance performances were performed on DDR machines, and arcades started to feel more like dance clubs. In Shibuya, Tokyo's teens line up for blocks just to squeeze into clusters of photobooths with their friends \u2013 the images can be digitally customised after they're taken, like a touch-screen Photoshop. Japanese arcades are constantly evolving as the games change.As part of the Guardian's Tokyo City Guide, we've highlighed some of the best places in the city to play games and where to buy them. Here are the most influential games in the history of Japanese arcades \u2013 click on the links below to play them.The game that started it all. Space Invaders wasn't the first ever arcade game, but it was the first to capture Japan's imagination, as dedicated arcades, called \"Invader House\", sprang up all over the country.

Space Invaders inspired games like Galaxian and Galaga. \u2022 Play Space InvadersThe 1980s were dominated by shooting games, mostly set in space, the exception to the rule being Pac-Man, which became the biggest grossing arcade game ever.

The Senkakus are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits.Underlying the rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic and economic reasons are concerns in Tokyo about the size and opacity of China's military spending.In response, Japan has reaffirmed its postwar alliance with the US and is building closer military ties to other countries in the region, including Australia, the Philippines and South Korea.Japan has also sought to strengthen its claims to disputed territories by stealth. Its recent decision to give Japanese names to dozens of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, including the Senkakus \u2013 known in China as the Diaoyu \u2013 drew an angry response from Beijing.\"No matter what names Japan has given to the islands affiliated to Diaoyu island, it will not change the fact that these islands belong to China,\" China's foreign ministry said in a statement.Although Japan senses a more immediate threat from North Korea's nuclear missile programme, China will remain a cause for concern as long as its military spending, and the increasingly combative behaviour of its navy, continues.That was clear this month when the chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, called on China to improve transparency over spending after it announced a double-digit increase in its defence budget for the second year in a row.\"There are some parts in the breakdown of China's defence budget that are unclear, and it's desirable to boost the transparency in the defence budget and China's [overall] defence policies,\" he said.China's defence spending surpassed Japan's in 2007, making it the second largest spender after the US.To demonstrate the strength of the regional alliance now forming in response to China, Japanese self-defence forces will participate for the first time in joint annual military exercises with the US and the Philippines within the next few weeks.In addition, the coast guard is to be given new powers allowing it to investigate illegal landings on disputed islands, eject suspicious vessels without inspecting them and make arrests.And the proposed relocation of 8,000 US troops from Okinawa will only happen provided Washington is assured of the southern Japanese island's role as a forward-deployment base for its core contingent of marines.In a recent report, Japan's national institute for defence studies warned that China's naval build-up presented a challenge to the country's security (pdf).China's aim, the report said, was to project enough power to deter other countries, including Japan, from independently developing energy resources and put itself on an equal maritime footing with the US.\"China's increasing assertiveness has had a negative impact on the maritime security environment in the Asia-Pacific,\" the institute said. \"To date, peace and stability in the ocean have been maintained through co-operation between the United States, the only country that can deploy naval forces globally, and many countries that share interests.\"China's recent behaviour, as demonstrated by its advance into the surrounding waters\u00a0\u2026 is irreconcilable with the existing order in many ways.\"", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan"], "title": "Japan casts wary eye across East China Sea"},{"date": "2012-03-11T14:00:01Z", "country": "japan", "content": "On the first anniversary of the huge earthquake that hit Japan's northeastern Pacific coast, its people are still coming to terms with their grief and trying to work out what the disaster meant for the nation.Although 3/11, as it's become known, was a bolt from the blue, the country \u2013 located in one of the world's largest and most active volcanic zones \u2013 had long expected a great earthquake and tsunami to occur sooner or later.

In the decades following the second world war, gamers played electro-magnetic games in bowling alleys and on department store rooftops. Families would take shopping breaks, playing carnival-style shooting games or riding rinky-dink kiddy trains. Gradually, early analogue arcade games began popping up \u2013 driving games in which the road was on a rotating belt, and players had to steer a small car through obstacles. Companies like Namco and Sega started joining in, releasing magnet-powered cabinets that were the forerunners of the modern arcade game.In 1978, everything changed as Space Invaders enthralled the country \u2013 and the rest of the western world \u2013 spawning a slew of arcades and players dedicated solely to the new game. The game's release came just as Star Wars was hitting Japanese cinemas \u2013 and the timing could not have been better. Thanks to Space Invaders, for more than a decade Japanese arcades were dominated by shooting games, something that would not change until the release of Street Fighter II in 1991. Like Space Invaders, Street Fighter II, with its colourful characters and engaging gameplay, set the theme for the decade: if the 80s was about shooting, the 90s were for fighting.In the second half of the 90s, and for the bulk of the noughties, arcades opened up to an even wider audience thanks to female-aimed sticker picture machines, and rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution. The rhythm games unleashed a new type of spectacle in Japanese arcades \u2013 this wasn't about gameplay any more, but the act of playing. Complex dance performances were performed on DDR machines, and arcades started to feel more like dance clubs. In Shibuya, Tokyo's teens line up for blocks just to squeeze into clusters of photobooths with their friends \u2013 the images can be digitally customised after they're taken, like a touch-screen Photoshop. Japanese arcades are constantly evolving as the games change.As part of the Guardian's Tokyo City Guide, we've highlighed some of the best places in the city to play games and where to buy them. Here are the most influential games in the history of Japanese arcades \u2013 click on the links below to play them.The game that started it all. Space Invaders wasn't the first ever arcade game, but it was the first to capture Japan's imagination, as dedicated arcades, called \"Invader House\", sprang up all over the country. It was so successful that it triggered a national shortage of \u00a5100 coins as kids queued up to slot money into the new machines. Space Invaders inspired games like Galaxian and Galaga. \u2022 Play Space InvadersThe 1980s were dominated by shooting games, mostly set in space, the exception to the rule being Pac-Man, which became the biggest grossing arcade game ever. The circular character became a global icon that shifted millions of bits of yellow merchandise, inspired an animated television series and even cheesy top-ten single. The pellet popping character, famously inspired by a pizza, was originally named Puckman after \"paku paku\", the Japanese onomatopoeic phrase for eating. But it was changed because of the English word that puck unfortunately rhymes with, and the ease of vandalising a P into an F. \u2022 Play Pac-ManThe game that made Nintendo a gaming giant, featuring, among other innovations, the first appearance of Mario, then dubbed Jumpman. While other game companies were feverishly trying to emulate Space Invaders or clone Pac-Man, Nintendo released something totally different \u2013 even if Universal Studios unsuccessfully tried to sue for ripping off King Kong! This is the first video game to feature a story, movie-style cut scenes, and the subsequently much-imitated \"rescue the girl\" motif. \u2022 Play Donkey KongSure, this classic run-and-gun game (you run, you shoot) aimed to capitalise on Hollywood action flicks like Commando, but it did it so well. Notoriously difficult, the game allowed two players to play co-op together, ushering in a wave of multi-player shooting games that currently dominate computer consoles. The Nintendo home console version had the infamous Konami Code, a secret code that could be entered to give players much-needed extra lives. \u2022 Play ContraWhat Space Invaders was to shooting games, Street Fighter II was to fighting games. Taking inspiration from Hong Kong kung-fu flicks, Street Fighter II featured colourful characters and cool, complicated moves that made it a game of skill, speed and strategy. The game's success meant that arcades were dominated by fighting games throughout the 1990s, and rival studios made exciting brawlers of their own (such as SNK's The King of Fighters). Street Fighter II was so popular that Nintendo designed the Super Nintendo Controller with enough buttons to play the game's home version. \u2022 Play Street Fighter II\u2022 Brian Ashcraft is a senior contributing editor of the Kotaku gaming blog", "tags": ["Japan holidays", "Tokyo holidays", "Games", "Technology", "Cultural trips", "Culture"], "title": "The games that changed Japan"},{"date": "2012-01-31T08:15:07Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan's attempts to restart nuclear reactors that were shut down in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi accident were boosted after UN inspectors gave their backing to stress tests designed to confirm the reactors' safety.Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] said the reactor assessments were \"generally consistent\" with the body's own safety standards, despite concern among some experts that the tests are flawed.The IAEA's upbeat appraisal was expected, and does not guarantee that Japan's nuclear authorities will be able to put reactors back into service amid growing opposition from host communities in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.The team arrived in Japan nine days ago at the invitation of the Japanese government to review stress tests being conducted by the country's industrial and nuclear safety agency (Nisa).The tests, in which computer simulations are used to gauge the reactors' ability to withstand severe events such as earthquakes and tsunami, were ordered after a triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in March unleashed large amounts of radiation into the environment.The accident, the worst involving nuclear power since Chernobyl 25 years ago, forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 residents living within a 12-mile (20km) radius of the plant.Almost a year on from the disaster, none of the residents has been allowed to return home; some have been warned their old neighbourhoods may remain uninhabitable for years.James Lyons, the leader of the 10-member IAEA team, said: \"We concluded that Nisa's instructions to power plants and its review process for the comprehensive safety assessments are generally consistent with IAEA safety standards.\"Nisa officials said their first evaluation showed that two idle reactors at a plant in Oi, western Japan, were able to withstanding a disaster similar to the magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami that wrecked Fukushima Daiichi.But two experts who sit on a panel advising Nisa on the safety appraisal said the stress tests were too limited in scope and did not prove that nuclear reactors were safe, adding that the IAEA visit was simply a public relations exercise.\"It is obvious that a visit by an international organisation advocating nuclear power is part of a political agenda that is built into a story already finished in advance,\" Professor Hiromitsu Ino of Tokyo University and Masashi Goto, a former nuclear plant design engineer, said in a statement.Quake damage and scheduled safety checks prompted by the Fukushima accident mean that all but three of Japan's 54 reactors are out of service.Without approval for restarts, Japan will be without a single operating nuclear reactor by the end of April. The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, has said, however, the country can survive the summer free of power cuts even without nuclear power.The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, believes Japan needs to retain a number of reactors while it develops alternative energy sources. The Fukushima crisis forced the country to abandon plans to generate more than 50% of its power from nuclear by 2030.Towns that host nuclear power plants have criticised the government for introducing the tests before the official investigation into the Fukushima accident is complete. Local approval is not legally required to restart a reactor, but few believe the government will bring plants back online without public support.In another measure designed to bolster public confidence in nuclear power, the cabinet on Tuesday approved legislation that will end the nuclear safety agency's organisational ties to the trade and industry ministry.The ministry has been criticised for failing to recognise the dangers posed by nuclear power and for its close ties to utilities.The bill would also limit a reactor's operational lifespan to 40 years, with a controversial one-time extension of 20 years for those that pass additional safety tests.

They included Yasuaki Uwabe, who was convicted of killing five people at a train station in 1999.The executions are the first since July 2010; none of the 132 people on death row was executed in 2011, the first time a year had passed without executions for 19 years.Their executions came as a blow to campaigners, who only this week welcomed Japan's apparent de facto moratorium on capital punishment. Hideki Wakabayashi, executive director of Amnesty International Japan, accused the Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) government of reneging on an earlier promise to look seriously at its use of the death penalty.\"We still need to have a national debate,\" Wakabayashi told the Guardian. \"But while we are doing that there has to be a moratorium on executions. The DPJ is supposed to support human rights. The executions also run against the international movement against he death penalty. I don't know where Japan thinks it is going with this.\"There is speculation that the justice minister, Toshio Ogawa, has come under pressure from senior DPJ colleagues, including the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to sign off on executions while the party attempts to sell a controversial consumption tax rise to the public, which remains overwhelmingly in favour of the death penalty.\"Public support for Noda's cabinet is declining, so my personal feeling is that this was one of many steps aimed at boosting its approval ratings,\" Wakabayashi said.Earlier this week Amnesty International had singled out Japan for praise over the absence of executions in 2011, despite evidence that successive justice ministers had come under intense pressure to sign death warrants. In the announcement, Amnesty's Catherine Baber did note that \"executions could resume at any time\".\"We continue to be concerned for the roughly 130 people on death row, including several prisoners with mental illnesses, and we call on the minister of justice not to resume executions but rather to work towards abolition.\"In September 2010 the then justice minister, Keiko Chiba, ordered a review of the death penalty. Her four immediate successors refused to approve executions, but Ogawa, who was appointed to the post in January, said the review had reached an impasse.\"I don't really want to do it, but it is part of the justice minister's job description,\" he told journalists. \"With 130 inmates on death row and public opinion 85% in favour of the death sentence, it would be inexcusable of me not to sign off on executions.\"In a damning 2009 report, Amnesty accused the Japanese authorities of subjecting death row inmates to \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment\".Campaigners have also voiced concern over the safety of several convictions, including that of Masaru Okunishi, who has spent four decades on death row for poisoning five women in 1961. Prisoners are not told when they will be executed until a few hours before they are led away to the gallows, and their relatives and lawyers are informed only after the execution has been carried out. In a report issued this week, Amnesty noted a rise in the number of executions worldwide in 2011 [PDF], mainly due to a significant increase in the Middle East.The US - the only G7 country to carry out executions last year - is one of 58 countries, including Japan, China and Iran, that retain capital punishment. More than 140 countries, including all EU members, have abolished the death penalty in law or practice.", "tags": ["Japan", "Capital punishment", "Human rights", "Amnesty International", "World news"], "title": "Japan hangs three prisoners after 18-month stay of executions"},{"date": "2012-03-22T15:44:17Z", "country": "japan", "content": "When China eclipsed Japan as the world's second biggest economy in 2010, there was less gnashing of teeth in Tokyo than some had expected.Given China's size and dizzying growth over the last two decades, Japanese business leaders accepted long ago that a shift in the economic rankings was inevitable.Japan is more concerned about China's military growth: how it will affect long-running bilateral disputes over territory and access to energy sources, and where it will leave the regional balance of power in an era of post-US hegemony.The potential for bilateral discord was evident in 2010, when a Chinese trawler collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the Senkaku islands, an uninhabited archipelago in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but also claimed by China.The trawler's captain was released after a short detention, but the incident, and several less volatile encounters since, have reminded Japan that, strong economic ties aside, the potential remains for lasting friction with an increasingly formidable rival.There is much at stake for both countries. The Senkakus are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits.Underlying the rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic and economic reasons are concerns in Tokyo about the size and opacity of China's military spending.In response, Japan has reaffirmed its postwar alliance with the US and is building closer military ties to other countries in the region, including Australia, the Philippines and South Korea.Japan has also sought to strengthen its claims to disputed territories by stealth. Its recent decision to give Japanese names to dozens of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, including the Senkakus \u2013 known in China as the Diaoyu \u2013 drew an angry response from Beijing.\"No matter what names Japan has given to the islands affiliated to Diaoyu island, it will not change the fact that these islands belong to China,\" China's foreign ministry said in a statement.Although Japan senses a more immediate threat from North Korea's nuclear missile programme, China will remain a cause for concern as long as its military spending, and the increasingly combative behaviour of its navy, continues.That was clear this month when the chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, called on China to improve transparency over spending after it announced a double-digit increase in its defence budget for the second year in a row.\"There are some parts in the breakdown of China's defence budget that are unclear, and it's desirable to boost the transparency in the defence budget and China's [overall] defence policies,\" he said.China's defence spending surpassed Japan's in 2007, making it the second largest spender after the US.To demonstrate the strength of the regional alliance now forming in response to China, Japanese self-defence forces will participate for the first time in joint annual military exercises with the US and the Philippines within the next few weeks.In addition, the coast guard is to be given new powers allowing it to investigate illegal landings on disputed islands, eject suspicious vessels without inspecting them and make arrests.And the proposed relocation of 8,000 US troops from Okinawa will only happen provided Washington is assured of the southern Japanese island's role as a forward-deployment base for its core contingent of marines.In a recent report, Japan's national institute for defence studies warned that China's naval build-up presented a challenge to the country's security (pdf).China's aim, the report said, was to project enough power to deter other countries, including Japan, from independently developing energy resources and put itself on an equal maritime footing with the US.\"China's increasing assertiveness has had a negative impact on the maritime security environment in the Asia-Pacific,\" the institute said. \"To date, peace and stability in the ocean have been maintained through co-operation between the United States, the only country that can deploy naval forces globally, and many countries that share interests.\"China's recent behaviour, as demonstrated by its advance into the surrounding waters\u00a0\u2026 is irreconcilable with the existing order in many ways.\"", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan"], "title": "Japan casts wary eye across East China Sea"},{"date": "2012-03-13T16:29:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "For the past year, the Guardian has followed seven survivors of the Japanese tsunami as they attempt to put the 11 March tragedy behind them and rebuild their lives and communities. After the first anniversary of the disaster, they explain how their lives have changed, and why they draw strength from the memory of the tens of thousands of people who died that day.The sisters, who set up a makeshift kitchen for survivors in their temple refuge after the tsunami, are cooking again \u2013 this time, at their family-run restaurant, Morinoya, which reopened in a temporary mall earlier this year. For Sasaki, 61, being able to serve their signature dishes of soba noodles and tempura on rice to her old regulars is a big step for her family, if not for their city. \"After months of being in shock, there are signs of movement in the city again,\" she said. \"Many of our former customers eat at our place, and the atmosphere is a little like the old days.\" Sasaki runs Morinoya \u2013 the restaurant's original sign, recovered from the debris, hangs above the premises \u2013 with her sister, Niinuma, 59, her husband, Kazuyasu, and her 81-year-old mother, Takiko. She is more optimistic about the restaurant than she is about Kamaishi, an industrial city where the disaster left 1,200 of its 40,000 residents dead or missing. \"It's better than it was six months ago, but no decision has been made on where, or how, to rebuild,\" Sasaki says. The family marked the anniversary on Sunday at a memorial service, and then lit candles for friends and neighbours who were among the victims. She says: \"At that moment, I realised how important it was for me to go on \u2013 for them.\"Takahashi is continuing his personal mission to decontaminate his town, some of which lies inside the 12-mile nuclear evacuation zone. The Fukushima Daiichi accident sent tens of thousands of Minamisoma's 70,000 residents fleeing; a year on, about 20,000 have yet to return. \"Radiation levels are coming down, and if we can deal with the remaining hotspots then I think this will be a place in which it is safe for children to live again,\" Takahashi said from his gynaecology practice. \"About 95% of the people here who have had internal radiation checks showed no abnormalities, and the rest had very low, safe readings.\" Between March and May last year, just two children were born in Minamisoma, but since then there have been 42 births. The 73-year-old is now fighting a more personal battle, after being diagnosed with cancer in the middle of last year. \"I'm continuing with treatment and working at the same time, so I've been feeling tired lately,\" he said. On the tsunami anniversary, Takahashi and his neighbours lit candles sent from Kobe, where more than 6,000 people died in an earthquake in 1995. \"Last year's disaster suddenly came back to me,\" he said. \"For a moment, I was full of fear again.\"Shimizu's home, on a hill overlooking the city, was spared by last year's tsunami, but the impact has never been far away. Several of her dance students died, and she became a surrogate mother to a teenage brother and sister who were orphaned by the tsunami. The siblings live with their uncle in temporary housing, and are performing well at school, but Shimizu continues to play an important role in their recovery. \"Their uncle is quitting his job next month,\" she said. \"He says he no longer feels like working, and I worry about the effect that will have on them.\" The children visit Shimizu every afternoon, do their homework, and eat dinner before they go home. \"The boy mentions his parents a lot now,\" she said, \"but his sister has stopped talking about them.\" Last summer, Shimizu danced for the first time since the disaster at a local festival; she will do the same this year, alongside past and present pupils, whom her son has encouraged to get involved. \"It will take years for this place to be rebuilt,\" she says of Rikuzentakata. \"I tell the children that they have to think about that time in the future when I'll no longer be around. They are taking that in their stride. This time last year, they were just kids. They have had to grow up very fast.\"Kono's mission to rebuild his company is proceeding at a pace that surprises even him. This May, Yagisawa Shoten, the business his family has run for over 200 years, will reopen in its own factory in a town just outside its original location, in Rikuzentakata. For the past few months, another firm has been making Kono's products under licence, using recipes passed down through generations of his family. \"Having our own factory will help us rebuild our brand and our relationship with our customers,\" he said. \"It's a shame we can't reopen on the old site, but the damage there was so serious that it would take years. This way, we can keep the company going.\" On Sunday, Kono and his staff gathered to remember their head of sales, a 30-year-old volunteer firefighter who was killed while trying to close the harbour gates. \"It was an extremely sad day,\" he said. \"I told him that we would honour his memory by making our business work again.\"Within weeks of the tsunami, Yagi had started turning the frame of a convenience store in the town's Okirai district into the new headquarters of Sanriku Toretate (fresh from the sea) Market, his ruined online seafood business. A year later, he is paying rent on the property and has installed storage space and a state-of-the-art freezing unit that will mark the next step towards recovery. Local women who last year earned money making bracelets from damaged fishing nets will by the early summer be creating dishes using locally caught seafood. \"It will be the kind of thing that a typical fishing family eats around here,\" the 35-year-old said. The local catch will be sold directly to retailers and individual consumers; by selling less through wholesalers, Yagi reckons he will be able to deliver better profit margins to the fishermen he is working with. He also plans to build a processing facility where tourists can gain firsthand experience of the fisheries industry, and to open a restaurant. But the usually indomitable businessman admits he occasionally feels overwhelmed. \"To be honest, I am permanently worried about the future,\" he said. \"Many people around here don't see themselves as survivors, but as being forced to live on. \"But we owe it to those who died, and to ourselves, to make this work.\"On Monday, the day after his hometown, Ofunato, marked a year since it was engulfed by the tsunami, Kumagai launched a fisherman's association with the help of a 3m yen donation from South Korea. Later this year, Kumagai, who lost his boat in the disaster, will acquire a new vessel and start supplying Yagi's company with locally caught seafood. \"A few of us decided to get together because we stood to gain more as a group than as individuals,\" Kumagai said. \"But it's only a start. We still haven't bought any equipment ... and that's very expensive. We couldn't wait any longer, though ... I have to eat.\" For Kumagai, the anniversary was a time to look ahead. \"I see it as the start of year one; next 11 March, it will be the start of year two. My only goal now is to make things better year by year. The Okirai district's fishing fleet is much smaller, and its members much younger than before the disaster: at 53, Kumagai is the oldest in the new organisation. Many older fishermen have lost the will to rebuild, says Kumagai, who couldn't bring himself to stare at the sea in the aftermath of the tsunami. \"Ideally, I would like life to return to the way it was,\" he says. \"We've made a start. But it's only a start.\"", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news"], "title": "Japan tsunami survivors, one year on: 'we've made a start'"},{"date": "2012-03-11T14:00:01Z", "country": "japan", "content": "On the first anniversary of the huge earthquake that hit Japan's northeastern Pacific coast, its people are still coming to terms with their grief and trying to work out what the disaster meant for the nation.Although 3/11, as it's become known, was a bolt from the blue, the country \u2013 located in one of the world's largest and most active volcanic zones \u2013 had long expected a great earthquake and tsunami to occur sooner or later. It was well prepared for the type of disaster that would happen once every 100 years, but not for a far greater one-in-a-1000-years one. No wonder the catastrophe overwhelmed Japan's well-laid plans for protecting people, buildings and infrastructure.Fail-safe measures to cope with a super-disaster are practically beyond the nation's wealth: the worst-case scenario is sequential or even simultaneous occurrence in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, the central Pacific coast and the southwestern Pacific coast.Alongside national and local government efforts to improve disaster preparations, individuals now have to consider the topographic, geological and social features of their homes and workplaces, and have less choice over where to live than in the past.The areas devastated on 3/11 need a new and comprehensive approach to urban planning and social programmes. In coastal areas, people may work on the seafront but have to live on high ground. The elderly in this rapidly greying society, who often live alone, need to move into regional hubs for better care and services, such as collective housing. And the highly concentrated population and functions of megalopolises, particularly Tokyo, will have to disperse to smaller hub cities in order to dissipate the risks involved in a super-disaster.The general sense of anxiety has been exacerbated by the continuation of the restrictions on the electricity supply caused by the shutdown of all the country's nuclear power plants for checks.The badly damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant discharged massive amounts of nuclear pollutants, endangering population in the immediate vicinity. As the only nation that has suffered an atomic bombing, Japan reacted sharply to the nuclear accident. However, its people were unknowingly exposed to a considerably higher level of radiation resulting from the nuclear test explosions that China conducted in the 1960s, and nowadays they commonly undergo radiation-based medical examinations such as X-raying and CT scanning.In order to make up the 30% drop in power supply caused by the shutdown, electricity companies have reactivated old thermal power plants, and businesses and individuals have conserved power. People wore fewer clothes in the summer to reduce the need for air conditioning, and wrapped up warmer in winter. And many businesses worked over weekends, shifting a weekend holiday to a week day, to ease peaks in power demand. Nonetheless, energy from fossil-fuels costs more than nuclear, so bills have been higher, which has damaged Japan's international competitiveness. As the sense of fear calms down, however, the public will probably learn to accept nuclear power again, though with a reduced dependence.All the nuclear plants withstood the 3/11 seismic shock, though the three damaged reactors at Fukushima did not survive the tsunami. And two of those three reactors used the old, defective US-built turn-key model, prior to the construction of Japanese-designed, modified ones.Protection against the tsunami threat can be improved; but if sufficient work cannot be done, the plants on the Pacific coast will have to be relocated to the opposite Sea-of-Japan coast that suffers far fewer earthquakes.This could all have been done even before 3/11. In this sense, the nuclear accident was attributable in part to intellectual arrogance and a longstanding but inadequate safety regime.With their loss of peace of mind, many Japanese people feel as if they have been expelled from a country close to paradise. Yet 3/11 has made the people far tougher and the nation more resilient. The postwar era is now over, and the post-disaster era is under way.

Street Fighter II was so popular that Nintendo designed the Super Nintendo Controller with enough buttons to play the game's home version. \u2022 Play Street Fighter II\u2022 Brian Ashcraft is a senior contributing editor of the Kotaku gaming blog", "tags": ["Japan holidays", "Tokyo holidays", "Games", "Technology", "Cultural trips", "Culture"], "title": "The games that changed Japan"},{"date": "2012-01-31T08:15:07Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan's attempts to restart nuclear reactors that were shut down in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi accident were boosted after UN inspectors gave their backing to stress tests designed to confirm the reactors' safety.Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] said the reactor assessments were \"generally consistent\" with the body's own safety standards, despite concern among some experts that the tests are flawed.The IAEA's upbeat appraisal was expected, and does not guarantee that Japan's nuclear authorities will be able to put reactors back into service amid growing opposition from host communities in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.The team arrived in Japan nine days ago at the invitation of the Japanese government to review stress tests being conducted by the country's industrial and nuclear safety agency (Nisa).The tests, in which computer simulations are used to gauge the reactors' ability to withstand severe events such as earthquakes and tsunami, were ordered after a triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in March unleashed large amounts of radiation into the environment.The accident, the worst involving nuclear power since Chernobyl 25 years ago, forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 residents living within a 12-mile (20km) radius of the plant.Almost a year on from the disaster, none of the residents has been allowed to return home; some have been warned their old neighbourhoods may remain uninhabitable for years.James Lyons, the leader of the 10-member IAEA team, said: \"We concluded that Nisa's instructions to power plants and its review process for the comprehensive safety assessments are generally consistent with IAEA safety standards.\"Nisa officials said their first evaluation showed that two idle reactors at a plant in Oi, western Japan, were able to withstanding a disaster similar to the magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami that wrecked Fukushima Daiichi.But two experts who sit on a panel advising Nisa on the safety appraisal said the stress tests were too limited in scope and did not prove that nuclear reactors were safe, adding that the IAEA visit was simply a public relations exercise.\"It is obvious that a visit by an international organisation advocating nuclear power is part of a political agenda that is built into a story already finished in advance,\" Professor Hiromitsu Ino of Tokyo University and Masashi Goto, a former nuclear plant design engineer, said in a statement.Quake damage and scheduled safety checks prompted by the Fukushima accident mean that all but three of Japan's 54 reactors are out of service.Without approval for restarts, Japan will be without a single operating nuclear reactor by the end of April. The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, has said, however, the country can survive the summer free of power cuts even without nuclear power.The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, believes Japan needs to retain a number of reactors while it develops alternative energy sources. The Fukushima crisis forced the country to abandon plans to generate more than 50% of its power from nuclear by 2030.Towns that host nuclear power plants have criticised the government for introducing the tests before the official investigation into the Fukushima accident is complete. Local approval is not legally required to restart a reactor, but few believe the government will bring plants back online without public support.In another measure designed to bolster public confidence in nuclear power, the cabinet on Tuesday approved legislation that will end the nuclear safety agency's organisational ties to the trade and industry ministry.The ministry has been criticised for failing to recognise the dangers posed by nuclear power and for its close ties to utilities.The bill would also limit a reactor's operational lifespan to 40 years, with a controversial one-time extension of 20 years for those that pass additional safety tests.

They included Yasuaki Uwabe, who was convicted of killing five people at a train station in 1999.The executions are the first since July 2010; none of the 132 people on death row was executed in 2011, the first time a year had passed without executions for 19 years.Their executions came as a blow to campaigners, who only this week welcomed Japan's apparent de facto moratorium on capital punishment. Hideki Wakabayashi, executive director of Amnesty International Japan, accused the Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) government of reneging on an earlier promise to look seriously at its use of the death penalty.\"We still need to have a national debate,\" Wakabayashi told the Guardian. \"But while we are doing that there has to be a moratorium on executions. The DPJ is supposed to support human rights. The executions also run against the international movement against he death penalty. I don't know where Japan thinks it is going with this.\"There is speculation that the justice minister, Toshio Ogawa, has come under pressure from senior DPJ colleagues, including the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to sign off on executions while the party attempts to sell a controversial consumption tax rise to the public, which remains overwhelmingly in favour of the death penalty.\"Public support for Noda's cabinet is declining, so my personal feeling is that this was one of many steps aimed at boosting its approval ratings,\" Wakabayashi said.Earlier this week Amnesty International had singled out Japan for praise over the absence of executions in 2011, despite evidence that successive justice ministers had come under intense pressure to sign death warrants. In the announcement, Amnesty's Catherine Baber did note that \"executions could resume at any time\".\"We continue to be concerned for the roughly 130 people on death row, including several prisoners with mental illnesses, and we call on the minister of justice not to resume executions but rather to work towards abolition.\"In September 2010 the then justice minister, Keiko Chiba, ordered a review of the death penalty. Her four immediate successors refused to approve executions, but Ogawa, who was appointed to the post in January, said the review had reached an impasse.\"I don't really want to do it, but it is part of the justice minister's job description,\" he told journalists. \"With 130 inmates on death row and public opinion 85% in favour of the death sentence, it would be inexcusable of me not to sign off on executions.\"In a damning 2009 report, Amnesty accused the Japanese authorities of subjecting death row inmates to \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment\".Campaigners have also voiced concern over the safety of several convictions, including that of Masaru Okunishi, who has spent four decades on death row for poisoning five women in 1961. Prisoners are not told when they will be executed until a few hours before they are led away to the gallows, and their relatives and lawyers are informed only after the execution has been carried out. In a report issued this week, Amnesty noted a rise in the number of executions worldwide in 2011 [PDF], mainly due to a significant increase in the Middle East.The US - the only G7 country to carry out executions last year - is one of 58 countries, including Japan, China and Iran, that retain capital punishment. More than 140 countries, including all EU members, have abolished the death penalty in law or practice.", "tags": ["Japan", "Capital punishment", "Human rights", "Amnesty International", "World news"], "title": "Japan hangs three prisoners after 18-month stay of executions"},{"date": "2012-03-22T15:44:17Z", "country": "japan", "content": "When China eclipsed Japan as the world's second biggest economy in 2010, there was less gnashing of teeth in Tokyo than some had expected.Given China's size and dizzying growth over the last two decades, Japanese business leaders accepted long ago that a shift in the economic rankings was inevitable.Japan is more concerned about China's military growth: how it will affect long-running bilateral disputes over territory and access to energy sources, and where it will leave the regional balance of power in an era of post-US hegemony.The potential for bilateral discord was evident in 2010, when a Chinese trawler collided with two Japanese coastguard vessels near the Senkaku islands, an uninhabited archipelago in the East China Sea controlled by Japan but also claimed by China.The trawler's captain was released after a short detention, but the incident, and several less volatile encounters since, have reminded Japan that, strong economic ties aside, the potential remains for lasting friction with an increasingly formidable rival.There is much at stake for both countries. The Senkakus are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits.Underlying the rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic and economic reasons are concerns in Tokyo about the size and opacity of China's military spending.In response, Japan has reaffirmed its postwar alliance with the US and is building closer military ties to other countries in the region, including Australia, the Philippines and South Korea.Japan has also sought to strengthen its claims to disputed territories by stealth. Its recent decision to give Japanese names to dozens of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, including the Senkakus \u2013 known in China as the Diaoyu \u2013 drew an angry response from Beijing.\"No matter what names Japan has given to the islands affiliated to Diaoyu island, it will not change the fact that these islands belong to China,\" China's foreign ministry said in a statement.Although Japan senses a more immediate threat from North Korea's nuclear missile programme, China will remain a cause for concern as long as its military spending, and the increasingly combative behaviour of its navy, continues.That was clear this month when the chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, called on China to improve transparency over spending after it announced a double-digit increase in its defence budget for the second year in a row.\"There are some parts in the breakdown of China's defence budget that are unclear, and it's desirable to boost the transparency in the defence budget and China's [overall] defence policies,\" he said.China's defence spending surpassed Japan's in 2007, making it the second largest spender after the US.To demonstrate the strength of the regional alliance now forming in response to China, Japanese self-defence forces will participate for the first time in joint annual military exercises with the US and the Philippines within the next few weeks.In addition, the coast guard is to be given new powers allowing it to investigate illegal landings on disputed islands, eject suspicious vessels without inspecting them and make arrests.And the proposed relocation of 8,000 US troops from Okinawa will only happen provided Washington is assured of the southern Japanese island's role as a forward-deployment base for its core contingent of marines.In a recent report, Japan's national institute for defence studies warned that China's naval build-up presented a challenge to the country's security (pdf).China's aim, the report said, was to project enough power to deter other countries, including Japan, from independently developing energy resources and put itself on an equal maritime footing with the US.\"China's increasing assertiveness has had a negative impact on the maritime security environment in the Asia-Pacific,\" the institute said. \"To date, peace and stability in the ocean have been maintained through co-operation between the United States, the only country that can deploy naval forces globally, and many countries that share interests.\"China's recent behaviour, as demonstrated by its advance into the surrounding waters\u00a0\u2026 is irreconcilable with the existing order in many ways.\"", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan"], "title": "Japan casts wary eye across East China Sea"},{"date": "2012-03-13T16:29:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "For the past year, the Guardian has followed seven survivors of the Japanese tsunami as they attempt to put the 11 March tragedy behind them and rebuild their lives and communities. After the first anniversary of the disaster, they explain how their lives have changed, and why they draw strength from the memory of the tens of thousands of people who died that day.The sisters, who set up a makeshift kitchen for survivors in their temple refuge after the tsunami, are cooking again \u2013 this time, at their family-run restaurant, Morinoya, which reopened in a temporary mall earlier this year. For Sasaki, 61, being able to serve their signature dishes of soba noodles and tempura on rice to her old regulars is a big step for her family, if not for their city. \"After months of being in shock, there are signs of movement in the city again,\" she said. \"Many of our former customers eat at our place, and the atmosphere is a little like the old days.\" Sasaki runs Morinoya \u2013 the restaurant's original sign, recovered from the debris, hangs above the premises \u2013 with her sister, Niinuma, 59, her husband, Kazuyasu, and her 81-year-old mother, Takiko. She is more optimistic about the restaurant than she is about Kamaishi, an industrial city where the disaster left 1,200 of its 40,000 residents dead or missing. \"It's better than it was six months ago, but no decision has been made on where, or how, to rebuild,\" Sasaki says. The family marked the anniversary on Sunday at a memorial service, and then lit candles for friends and neighbours who were among the victims. She says: \"At that moment, I realised how important it was for me to go on \u2013 for them.\"Takahashi is continuing his personal mission to decontaminate his town, some of which lies inside the 12-mile nuclear evacuation zone. The Fukushima Daiichi accident sent tens of thousands of Minamisoma's 70,000 residents fleeing; a year on, about 20,000 have yet to return. \"Radiation levels are coming down, and if we can deal with the remaining hotspots then I think this will be a place in which it is safe for children to live again,\" Takahashi said from his gynaecology practice. \"About 95% of the people here who have had internal radiation checks showed no abnormalities, and the rest had very low, safe readings.\" Between March and May last year, just two children were born in Minamisoma, but since then there have been 42 births. The 73-year-old is now fighting a more personal battle, after being diagnosed with cancer in the middle of last year. \"I'm continuing with treatment and working at the same time, so I've been feeling tired lately,\" he said. On the tsunami anniversary, Takahashi and his neighbours lit candles sent from Kobe, where more than 6,000 people died in an earthquake in 1995. \"Last year's disaster suddenly came back to me,\" he said. \"For a moment, I was full of fear again.\"Shimizu's home, on a hill overlooking the city, was spared by last year's tsunami, but the impact has never been far away. Several of her dance students died, and she became a surrogate mother to a teenage brother and sister who were orphaned by the tsunami. The siblings live with their uncle in temporary housing, and are performing well at school, but Shimizu continues to play an important role in their recovery. \"Their uncle is quitting his job next month,\" she said. \"He says he no longer feels like working, and I worry about the effect that will have on them.\" The children visit Shimizu every afternoon, do their homework, and eat dinner before they go home. \"The boy mentions his parents a lot now,\" she said, \"but his sister has stopped talking about them.\" Last summer, Shimizu danced for the first time since the disaster at a local festival; she will do the same this year, alongside past and present pupils, whom her son has encouraged to get involved. \"It will take years for this place to be rebuilt,\" she says of Rikuzentakata. \"I tell the children that they have to think about that time in the future when I'll no longer be around. They are taking that in their stride. This time last year, they were just kids. They have had to grow up very fast.\"Kono's mission to rebuild his company is proceeding at a pace that surprises even him. This May, Yagisawa Shoten, the business his family has run for over 200 years, will reopen in its own factory in a town just outside its original location, in Rikuzentakata. For the past few months, another firm has been making Kono's products under licence, using recipes passed down through generations of his family. \"Having our own factory will help us rebuild our brand and our relationship with our customers,\" he said. \"It's a shame we can't reopen on the old site, but the damage there was so serious that it would take years. This way, we can keep the company going.\" On Sunday, Kono and his staff gathered to remember their head of sales, a 30-year-old volunteer firefighter who was killed while trying to close the harbour gates. \"It was an extremely sad day,\" he said. \"I told him that we would honour his memory by making our business work again.\"Within weeks of the tsunami, Yagi had started turning the frame of a convenience store in the town's Okirai district into the new headquarters of Sanriku Toretate (fresh from the sea) Market, his ruined online seafood business. A year later, he is paying rent on the property and has installed storage space and a state-of-the-art freezing unit that will mark the next step towards recovery. Local women who last year earned money making bracelets from damaged fishing nets will by the early summer be creating dishes using locally caught seafood. \"It will be the kind of thing that a typical fishing family eats around here,\" the 35-year-old said. The local catch will be sold directly to retailers and individual consumers; by selling less through wholesalers, Yagi reckons he will be able to deliver better profit margins to the fishermen he is working with. He also plans to build a processing facility where tourists can gain firsthand experience of the fisheries industry, and to open a restaurant. But the usually indomitable businessman admits he occasionally feels overwhelmed. \"To be honest, I am permanently worried about the future,\" he said. \"Many people around here don't see themselves as survivors, but as being forced to live on. \"But we owe it to those who died, and to ourselves, to make this work.\"On Monday, the day after his hometown, Ofunato, marked a year since it was engulfed by the tsunami, Kumagai launched a fisherman's association with the help of a 3m yen donation from South Korea. Later this year, Kumagai, who lost his boat in the disaster, will acquire a new vessel and start supplying Yagi's company with locally caught seafood. \"A few of us decided to get together because we stood to gain more as a group than as individuals,\" Kumagai said. \"But it's only a start. We still haven't bought any equipment ... and that's very expensive. We couldn't wait any longer, though ... I have to eat.\" For Kumagai, the anniversary was a time to look ahead. \"I see it as the start of year one; next 11 March, it will be the start of year two. My only goal now is to make things better year by year. The Okirai district's fishing fleet is much smaller, and its members much younger than before the disaster: at 53, Kumagai is the oldest in the new organisation. Many older fishermen have lost the will to rebuild, says Kumagai, who couldn't bring himself to stare at the sea in the aftermath of the tsunami. \"Ideally, I would like life to return to the way it was,\" he says. \"We've made a start. But it's only a start.\"", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news"], "title": "Japan tsunami survivors, one year on: 'we've made a start'"},{"date": "2012-03-11T12:52:53Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Millions of people in Japan have paid tribute to the thousands of victims of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country's north-east coast one year ago and sparked the world's worst nuclear crisis for 25 years.At 2.46pm local time (5.46am GMT), a year on from the moment the magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck, people across Japan bowed their heads and observed a minute's silence, while sirens sounded in the dozens of coastal communities still in mourning for the 15,800 people confirmed dead and 3,300 others still missing.In Tokyo, some train services came to a standstill, and the emperor, empress, prime minister, foreign dignitaries and hundreds of survivors attended a ceremony at the capital's national theatre.In Ishinomaki, where the tsunami left more than 5,700 people dead or missing, hundreds attended a service at Minato primary school, where some had taken refuge after the disaster.Many remained silent after the official silence, hands clasped in prayer as Buddhist monks chanted sutras before an altar laden with white chrysanthemums. As darkness fell, children lit paper lanterns bearing simple messages that resonate across the region: togetherness, hope and strength.The people of the city, almost half of which was submerged beneath waves of up to 10 metres in height, are torn between two overwhelming emotions: deep sadness at the loss of life, and a determination to look forward.Masaru Sasaki, a 71-year-old taxi driver, came to remember his wife, daughter and grandson, all swept away by the waves. \"In some ways, the last 12 months have passed quickly,\" he said. \"But when I think of my family, it seems like a lifetime.\"I am lucky enough to be able to work, and I gain strength each day from my passengers. If I didn't have that, I don't think I could go on living.\"The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, vowed that Japan would be \"reborn as en even better place\".\"Our predecessors who brought prosperity to have repeatedly risen up from crises, every time becoming stronger,\" he said. \"We will stand by the people from the disaster-hit areas and join hands to achieve the historic task of rebuilding.\"It is impossible to overstate the size of that task. Exactly a year after they were sent fleeing by waves of up to 20 metres in height, more than 320,000 displaced people are still living in temporary housing along the north-east coast. An estimated 23m tonnes of rubble has been removed and placed in piles, but only a fraction has been buried or incinerated.The cost of rebuilding dozens of cities, towns and villages on higher ground is expected to cost Japanese taxpayers $230bn (\u00a3145bn) over the next 10 years. Some of that will come from an expected doubling of the sales tax; rather less palatable, for many, are the tens of billions the government will spend to prop up the company at the centre of the nuclear crisis, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco).The sense of loss was tinged with bitterness at the slow pace of reconstruction and the government's handling of the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.On Friday, newly released government documents revealed that Japan's cabinet was aware of the imminent risk of a meltdown, but elected to suppress the information for weeks unless it sparked panic among the public. Tepco did not publicly acknowledge a partial meltdown in three reactors until May.\"I no longer trust the government,\" Ayumi Sato said as she left a memorial service in Ishinomaki cradling her baby daughter. \"This disaster has made me realise that the only people capable of looking after our daughter's future are me and my husband.\"Amid the solemnity came protest. In Fukushima prefecture and Tokyo, thousands turned out to demand the permanent closure of all of Japan's nuclear reactors. An estimated 12,000 protesters in the capital formed a human chain around the parliament building.All but two of the country's 54 reactors are currently closed for maintenance checks, and will not be permitted to restart unless they pass tests of their ability to withstand catastrophic events and win approval from host communities spooked by the Fukushima accident.The triple meltdown at Fukushima forced the immediate evacuation of 80,000 people living within 20km; a similar number have left other towns and villages outside the evacuation zone where high levels of radiation have been found.The operation to decontaminate the area is expected to last years, and neighbourhoods closest to the plant could remain uninhabitable for decades.In Tokyo, Emperor Akihito acknowledged the difficulties facing Fukushima's displaced residents. \"In order to make the area inhabitable again, we face the difficult problem of removing radiation,\" the 78-year-old, who has recently undergone heart surgery, said in a brief address.\"We shall not let our memory of the disasters fade, pay attention to disaster prevention and continue our effort to make this land an even safer place to live.\"After workers at Fukushima Daiichi observed a minute's silence, Tepco's president, Toshio Nishizawa, expressed his \"heartfelt sympathy\" to the victims of the disaster and apologised to residents living near the stricken plant.\"While always keeping in mind the tremendous responsibility we have to maintain stable conditions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, we will continue to safely work toward the mid- to long-term decommissioning of the reactors.\"The day of 11 March is forever etched on the hearts and minds of every Tepco employee.\"Many survivors chose to mark the day in private. Yuko Sugimoto, who became a symbol of the tsunami when she was photographed, draped in a blanket amid the wreckage, searching for her son, Raito, whose nursery was partly submerged.Sugimoto and Raito, who had been rescued by the military from the nursery roof, were reunited two days later. A year on, life was beginning to return to normal, she said, but for her son, the mental scars had yet to heal.\"He won't let me leave him, even for a minute,\" she said at her new home outside Ishinomaki. \"When we had tsunami warnings after 11 March he was physically sick. He's doing his best to appear normal, but I know that on the inside he is still in a great deal of pain.\"", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Fukushima", "Nuclear power", "Environment", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Ishinomaki"], "title": "Japan marks first anniversary of earthquake and tsunami"},{"date": "2012-03-11T14:00:01Z", "country": "japan", "content": "On the first anniversary of the huge earthquake that hit Japan's northeastern Pacific coast, its people are still coming to terms with their grief and trying to work out what the disaster meant for the nation.Although 3/11, as it's become known, was a bolt from the blue, the country \u2013 located in one of the world's largest and most active volcanic zones \u2013 had long expected a great earthquake and tsunami to occur sooner or later. It was well prepared for the type of disaster that would happen once every 100 years, but not for a far greater one-in-a-1000-years one. No wonder the catastrophe overwhelmed Japan's well-laid plans for protecting people, buildings and infrastructure.Fail-safe measures to cope with a super-disaster are practically beyond the nation's wealth: the worst-case scenario is sequential or even simultaneous occurrence in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, the central Pacific coast and the southwestern Pacific coast.Alongside national and local government efforts to improve disaster preparations, individuals now have to consider the topographic, geological and social features of their homes and workplaces, and have less choice over where to live than in the past.The areas devastated on 3/11 need a new and comprehensive approach to urban planning and social programmes. In coastal areas, people may work on the seafront but have to live on high ground. The elderly in this rapidly greying society, who often live alone, need to move into regional hubs for better care and services, such as collective housing. And the highly concentrated population and functions of megalopolises, particularly Tokyo, will have to disperse to smaller hub cities in order to dissipate the risks involved in a super-disaster.The general sense of anxiety has been exacerbated by the continuation of the restrictions on the electricity supply caused by the shutdown of all the country's nuclear power plants for checks.The badly damaged Fukushima Daiichi plant discharged massive amounts of nuclear pollutants, endangering population in the immediate vicinity. As the only nation that has suffered an atomic bombing, Japan reacted sharply to the nuclear accident. However, its people were unknowingly exposed to a considerably higher level of radiation resulting from the nuclear test explosions that China conducted in the 1960s, and nowadays they commonly undergo radiation-based medical examinations such as X-raying and CT scanning.In order to make up the 30% drop in power supply caused by the shutdown, electricity companies have reactivated old thermal power plants, and businesses and individuals have conserved power. People wore fewer clothes in the summer to reduce the need for air conditioning, and wrapped up warmer in winter. And many businesses worked over weekends, shifting a weekend holiday to a week day, to ease peaks in power demand. Nonetheless, energy from fossil-fuels costs more than nuclear, so bills have been higher, which has damaged Japan's international competitiveness. As the sense of fear calms down, however, the public will probably learn to accept nuclear power again, though with a reduced dependence.All the nuclear plants withstood the 3/11 seismic shock, though the three damaged reactors at Fukushima did not survive the tsunami. And two of those three reactors used the old, defective US-built turn-key model, prior to the construction of Japanese-designed, modified ones.Protection against the tsunami threat can be improved; but if sufficient work cannot be done, the plants on the Pacific coast will have to be relocated to the opposite Sea-of-Japan coast that suffers far fewer earthquakes.This could all have been done even before 3/11. In this sense, the nuclear accident was attributable in part to intellectual arrogance and a longstanding but inadequate safety regime.With their loss of peace of mind, many Japanese people feel as if they have been expelled from a country close to paradise. Yet 3/11 has made the people far tougher and the nation more resilient. The postwar era is now over, and the post-disaster era is under way. Natural disaster, not war, will finally transform Japan's carefree cold-war era collective mind.\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Earthquakes"], "title": "After the earthquake: changing Japan | Masahiro Matsumura"},{"date": "2012-02-01T10:00:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The first arcades in Japan weren't video arcades, and they weren't even in game centres. In the decades following the second world war, gamers played electro-magnetic games in bowling alleys and on department store rooftops. Families would take shopping breaks, playing carnival-style shooting games or riding rinky-dink kiddy trains. Gradually, early analogue arcade games began popping up \u2013 driving games in which the road was on a rotating belt, and players had to steer a small car through obstacles. Companies like Namco and Sega started joining in, releasing magnet-powered cabinets that were the forerunners of the modern arcade game.In 1978, everything changed as Space Invaders enthralled the country \u2013 and the rest of the western world \u2013 spawning a slew of arcades and players dedicated solely to the new game. The game's release came just as Star Wars was hitting Japanese cinemas \u2013 and the timing could not have been better. Thanks to Space Invaders, for more than a decade Japanese arcades were dominated by shooting games, something that would not change until the release of Street Fighter II in 1991. Like Space Invaders, Street Fighter II, with its colourful characters and engaging gameplay, set the theme for the decade: if the 80s was about shooting, the 90s were for fighting.In the second half of the 90s, and for the bulk of the noughties, arcades opened up to an even wider audience thanks to female-aimed sticker picture machines, and rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution. The rhythm games unleashed a new type of spectacle in Japanese arcades \u2013 this wasn't about gameplay any more, but the act of playing. Complex dance performances were performed on DDR machines, and arcades started to feel more like dance clubs. In Shibuya, Tokyo's teens line up for blocks just to squeeze into clusters of photobooths with their friends \u2013 the images can be digitally customised after they're taken, like a touch-screen Photoshop. Japanese arcades are constantly evolving as the games change.As part of the Guardian's Tokyo City Guide, we've highlighed some of the best places in the city to play games and where to buy them. Here are the most influential games in the history of Japanese arcades \u2013 click on the links below to play them.The game that started it all. Space Invaders wasn't the first ever arcade game, but it was the first to capture Japan's imagination, as dedicated arcades, called \"Invader House\", sprang up all over the country. It was so successful that it triggered a national shortage of \u00a5100 coins as kids queued up to slot money into the new machines. Space Invaders inspired games like Galaxian and Galaga. \u2022 Play Space InvadersThe 1980s were dominated by shooting games, mostly set in space, the exception to the rule being Pac-Man, which became the biggest grossing arcade game ever. The circular character became a global icon that shifted millions of bits of yellow merchandise, inspired an animated television series and even cheesy top-ten single. The pellet popping character, famously inspired by a pizza, was originally named Puckman after \"paku paku\", the Japanese onomatopoeic phrase for eating. But it was changed because of the English word that puck unfortunately rhymes with, and the ease of vandalising a P into an F. \u2022 Play Pac-ManThe game that made Nintendo a gaming giant, featuring, among other innovations, the first appearance of Mario, then dubbed Jumpman. While other game companies were feverishly trying to emulate Space Invaders or clone Pac-Man, Nintendo released something totally different \u2013 even if Universal Studios unsuccessfully tried to sue for ripping off King Kong! This is the first video game to feature a story, movie-style cut scenes, and the subsequently much-imitated \"rescue the girl\" motif. \u2022 Play Donkey KongSure, this classic run-and-gun game (you run, you shoot) aimed to capitalise on Hollywood action flicks like Commando, but it did it so well. Notoriously difficult, the game allowed two players to play co-op together, ushering in a wave of multi-player shooting games that currently dominate computer consoles. The Nintendo home console version had the infamous Konami Code, a secret code that could be entered to give players much-needed extra lives. \u2022 Play ContraWhat Space Invaders was to shooting games, Street Fighter II was to fighting games. Taking inspiration from Hong Kong kung-fu flicks, Street Fighter II featured colourful characters and cool, complicated moves that made it a game of skill, speed and strategy. The game's success meant that arcades were dominated by fighting games throughout the 1990s, and rival studios made exciting brawlers of their own (such as SNK's The King of Fighters). Street Fighter II was so popular that Nintendo designed the Super Nintendo Controller with enough buttons to play the game's home version. \u2022 Play Street Fighter II\u2022 Brian Ashcraft is a senior contributing editor of the Kotaku gaming blog", "tags": ["Japan holidays", "Tokyo holidays", "Games", "Technology", "Cultural trips", "Culture"], "title": "The games that changed Japan"},{"date": "2012-01-31T08:15:07Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan's attempts to restart nuclear reactors that were shut down in the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi accident were boosted after UN inspectors gave their backing to stress tests designed to confirm the reactors' safety.Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] said the reactor assessments were \"generally consistent\" with the body's own safety standards, despite concern among some experts that the tests are flawed.The IAEA's upbeat appraisal was expected, and does not guarantee that Japan's nuclear authorities will be able to put reactors back into service amid growing opposition from host communities in the wake of the Fukushima disaster.The team arrived in Japan nine days ago at the invitation of the Japanese government to review stress tests being conducted by the country's industrial and nuclear safety agency (Nisa).The tests, in which computer simulations are used to gauge the reactors' ability to withstand severe events such as earthquakes and tsunami, were ordered after a triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi in March unleashed large amounts of radiation into the environment.The accident, the worst involving nuclear power since Chernobyl 25 years ago, forced the evacuation of more than 80,000 residents living within a 12-mile (20km) radius of the plant.Almost a year on from the disaster, none of the residents has been allowed to return home; some have been warned their old neighbourhoods may remain uninhabitable for years.James Lyons, the leader of the 10-member IAEA team, said: \"We concluded that Nisa's instructions to power plants and its review process for the comprehensive safety assessments are generally consistent with IAEA safety standards.\"Nisa officials said their first evaluation showed that two idle reactors at a plant in Oi, western Japan, were able to withstanding a disaster similar to the magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami that wrecked Fukushima Daiichi.But two experts who sit on a panel advising Nisa on the safety appraisal said the stress tests were too limited in scope and did not prove that nuclear reactors were safe, adding that the IAEA visit was simply a public relations exercise.\"It is obvious that a visit by an international organisation advocating nuclear power is part of a political agenda that is built into a story already finished in advance,\" Professor Hiromitsu Ino of Tokyo University and Masashi Goto, a former nuclear plant design engineer, said in a statement.Quake damage and scheduled safety checks prompted by the Fukushima accident mean that all but three of Japan's 54 reactors are out of service.Without approval for restarts, Japan will be without a single operating nuclear reactor by the end of April. The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, has said, however, the country can survive the summer free of power cuts even without nuclear power.The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, believes Japan needs to retain a number of reactors while it develops alternative energy sources. The Fukushima crisis forced the country to abandon plans to generate more than 50% of its power from nuclear by 2030.Towns that host nuclear power plants have criticised the government for introducing the tests before the official investigation into the Fukushima accident is complete. Local approval is not legally required to restart a reactor, but few believe the government will bring plants back online without public support.In another measure designed to bolster public confidence in nuclear power, the cabinet on Tuesday approved legislation that will end the nuclear safety agency's organisational ties to the trade and industry ministry.The ministry has been criticised for failing to recognise the dangers posed by nuclear power and for its close ties to utilities.The bill would also limit a reactor's operational lifespan to 40 years, with a controversial one-time extension of 20 years for those that pass additional safety tests.

They included Yasuaki Uwabe, who was convicted of killing five people at a train station in 1999.The executions are the first since July 2010; none of the 132 people on death row was executed in 2011, the first time a year had passed without executions for 19 years.Their executions came as a blow to campaigners, who only this week welcomed Japan's apparent de facto moratorium on capital punishment. Hideki Wakabayashi, executive director of Amnesty International Japan, accused the Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) government of reneging on an earlier promise to look seriously at its use of the death penalty.\"We still need to have a national debate,\" Wakabayashi told the Guardian. \"But while we are doing that there has to be a moratorium on executions. The DPJ is supposed to support human rights. The executions also run against the international movement against he death penalty. I don't know where Japan thinks it is going with this.\"There is speculation that the justice minister, Toshio Ogawa, has come under pressure from senior DPJ colleagues, including the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, to sign off on executions while the party attempts to sell a controversial consumption tax rise to the public, which remains overwhelmingly in favour of the death penalty.\"Public support for Noda's cabinet is declining, so my personal feeling is that this was one of many steps aimed at boosting its approval ratings,\" Wakabayashi said.Earlier this week Amnesty International had singled out Japan for praise over the absence of executions in 2011, despite evidence that successive justice ministers had come under intense pressure to sign death warrants. In the announcement, Amnesty's Catherine Baber did note that \"executions could resume at any time\".\"We continue to be concerned for the roughly 130 people on death row, including several prisoners with mental illnesses, and we call on the minister of justice not to resume executions but rather to work towards abolition.\"In September 2010 the then justice minister, Keiko Chiba, ordered a review of the death penalty. Her four immediate successors refused to approve executions, but Ogawa, who was appointed to the post in January, said the review had reached an impasse.\"I don't really want to do it, but it is part of the justice minister's job description,\" he told journalists. \"With 130 inmates on death row and public opinion 85% in favour of the death sentence, it would be inexcusable of me not to sign off on executions.\"In a damning 2009 report, Amnesty accused the Japanese authorities of subjecting death row inmates to \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment\".Campaigners have also voiced concern over the safety of several convictions, including that of Masaru Okunishi, who has spent four decades on death row for poisoning five women in 1961. Prisoners are not told when they will be executed until a few hours before they are led away to the gallows, and their relatives and lawyers are informed only after the execution has been carried out. In a report issued this week, Amnesty noted a rise in the number of executions worldwide in 2011 [PDF], mainly due to a significant increase in the Middle East.The US - the only G7 country to carry out executions last year - is one of 58 countries, including Japan, China and Iran, that retain capital punishment.

The Senkakus are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and near potentially huge undersea oil and gas deposits.Underlying the rivalry between the countries over control of the East China Sea for strategic and economic reasons are concerns in Tokyo about the size and opacity of China's military spending.In response, Japan has reaffirmed its postwar alliance with the US and is building closer military ties to other countries in the region, including Australia, the Philippines and South Korea.Japan has also sought to strengthen its claims to disputed territories by stealth. Its recent decision to give Japanese names to dozens of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, including the Senkakus \u2013 known in China as the Diaoyu \u2013 drew an angry response from Beijing.\"No matter what names Japan has given to the islands affiliated to Diaoyu island, it will not change the fact that these islands belong to China,\" China's foreign ministry said in a statement.Although Japan senses a more immediate threat from North Korea's nuclear missile programme, China will remain a cause for concern as long as its military spending, and the increasingly combative behaviour of its navy, continues.That was clear this month when the chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, called on China to improve transparency over spending after it announced a double-digit increase in its defence budget for the second year in a row.\"There are some parts in the breakdown of China's defence budget that are unclear, and it's desirable to boost the transparency in the defence budget and China's [overall] defence policies,\" he said.China's defence spending surpassed Japan's in 2007, making it the second largest spender after the US.To demonstrate the strength of the regional alliance now forming in response to China, Japanese self-defence forces will participate for the first time in joint annual military exercises with the US and the Philippines within the next few weeks.In addition, the coast guard is to be given new powers allowing it to investigate illegal landings on disputed islands, eject suspicious vessels without inspecting them and make arrests.And the proposed relocation of 8,000 US troops from Okinawa will only happen provided Washington is assured of the southern Japanese island's role as a forward-deployment base for its core contingent of marines.In a recent report, Japan's national institute for defence studies warned that China's naval build-up presented a challenge to the country's security (pdf).China's aim, the report said, was to project enough power to deter other countries, including Japan, from independently developing energy resources and put itself on an equal maritime footing with the US.\"China's increasing assertiveness has had a negative impact on the maritime security environment in the Asia-Pacific,\" the institute said. \"To date, peace and stability in the ocean have been maintained through co-operation between the United States, the only country that can deploy naval forces globally, and many countries that share interests.\"China's recent behaviour, as demonstrated by its advance into the surrounding waters\u00a0\u2026 is irreconcilable with the existing order in many ways.\"", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan"], "title": "Japan casts wary eye across East China Sea"},{"date": "2012-03-13T16:29:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "For the past year, the Guardian has followed seven survivors of the Japanese tsunami as they attempt to put the 11 March tragedy behind them and rebuild their lives and communities. After the first anniversary of the disaster, they explain how their lives have changed, and why they draw strength from the memory of the tens of thousands of people who died that day.The sisters, who set up a makeshift kitchen for survivors in their temple refuge after the tsunami, are cooking again \u2013 this time, at their family-run restaurant, Morinoya, which reopened in a temporary mall earlier this year. For Sasaki, 61, being able to serve their signature dishes of soba noodles and tempura on rice to her old regulars is a big step for her family, if not for their city. \"After months of being in shock, there are signs of movement in the city again,\" she said. \"Many of our former customers eat at our place, and the atmosphere is a little like the old days.\" Sasaki runs Morinoya \u2013 the restaurant's original sign, recovered from the debris, hangs above the premises \u2013 with her sister, Niinuma, 59, her husband, Kazuyasu, and her 81-year-old mother, Takiko. She is more optimistic about the restaurant than she is about Kamaishi, an industrial city where the disaster left 1,200 of its 40,000 residents dead or missing. \"It's better than it was six months ago, but no decision has been made on where, or how, to rebuild,\" Sasaki says. The family marked the anniversary on Sunday at a memorial service, and then lit candles for friends and neighbours who were among the victims. She says: \"At that moment, I realised how important it was for me to go on \u2013 for them.\"Takahashi is continuing his personal mission to decontaminate his town, some of which lies inside the 12-mile nuclear evacuation zone. The Fukushima Daiichi accident sent tens of thousands of Minamisoma's 70,000 residents fleeing; a year on, about 20,000 have yet to return. \"Radiation levels are coming down, and if we can deal with the remaining hotspots then I think this will be a place in which it is safe for children to live again,\" Takahashi said from his gynaecology practice. \"About 95% of the people here who have had internal radiation checks showed no abnormalities, and the rest had very low, safe readings.\" Between March and May last year, just two children were born in Minamisoma, but since then there have been 42 births. The 73-year-old is now fighting a more personal battle, after being diagnosed with cancer in the middle of last year. \"I'm continuing with treatment and working at the same time, so I've been feeling tired lately,\" he said. On the tsunami anniversary, Takahashi and his neighbours lit candles sent from Kobe, where more than 6,000 people died in an earthquake in 1995. \"Last year's disaster suddenly came back to me,\" he said. \"For a moment, I was full of fear again.\"Shimizu's home, on a hill overlooking the city, was spared by last year's tsunami, but the impact has never been far away. Several of her dance students died, and she became a surrogate mother to a teenage brother and sister who were orphaned by the tsunami. The siblings live with their uncle in temporary housing, and are performing well at school, but Shimizu continues to play an important role in their recovery. \"Their uncle is quitting his job next month,\" she said. \"He says he no longer feels like working, and I worry about the effect that will have on them.\" The children visit Shimizu every afternoon, do their homework, and eat dinner before they go home. \"The boy mentions his parents a lot now,\" she said, \"but his sister has stopped talking about them.\" Last summer, Shimizu danced for the first time since the disaster at a local festival; she will do the same this year, alongside past and present pupils, whom her son has encouraged to get involved. \"It will take years for this place to be rebuilt,\" she says of Rikuzentakata. \"I tell the children that they have to think about that time in the future when I'll no longer be around. They are taking that in their stride. This time last year, they were just kids. They have had to grow up very fast.\"Kono's mission to rebuild his company is proceeding at a pace that surprises even him. This May, Yagisawa Shoten, the business his family has run for over 200 years, will reopen in its own factory in a town just outside its original location, in Rikuzentakata. For the past few months, another firm has been making Kono's products under licence, using recipes passed down through generations of his family. \"Having our own factory will help us rebuild our brand and our relationship with our customers,\" he said. \"It's a shame we can't reopen on the old site, but the damage there was so serious that it would take years. This way, we can keep the company going.\" On Sunday, Kono and his staff gathered to remember their head of sales, a 30-year-old volunteer firefighter who was killed while trying to close the harbour gates. \"It was an extremely sad day,\" he said. \"I told him that we would honour his memory by making our business work again.\"Within weeks of the tsunami, Yagi had started turning the frame of a convenience store in the town's Okirai district into the new headquarters of Sanriku Toretate (fresh from the sea) Market, his ruined online seafood business. A year later, he is paying rent on the property and has installed storage space and a state-of-the-art freezing unit that will mark the next step towards recovery. Local women who last year earned money making bracelets from damaged fishing nets will by the early summer be creating dishes using locally caught seafood. \"It will be the kind of thing that a typical fishing family eats around here,\" the 35-year-old said. The local catch will be sold directly to retailers and individual consumers; by selling less through wholesalers, Yagi reckons he will be able to deliver better profit margins to the fishermen he is working with. He also plans to build a processing facility where tourists can gain firsthand experience of the fisheries industry, and to open a restaurant. But the usually indomitable businessman admits he occasionally feels overwhelmed. \"To be honest, I am permanently worried about the future,\" he said. \"Many people around here don't see themselves as survivors, but as being forced to live on. \"But we owe it to those who died, and to ourselves, to make this work.\"On Monday, the day after his hometown, Ofunato, marked a year since it was engulfed by the tsunami, Kumagai launched a fisherman's association with the help of a 3m yen donation from South Korea. Later this year, Kumagai, who lost his boat in the disaster, will acquire a new vessel and start supplying Yagi's company with locally caught seafood. \"A few of us decided to get together because we stood to gain more as a group than as individuals,\" Kumagai said. \"But it's only a start. We still haven't bought any equipment ... and that's very expensive. We couldn't wait any longer, though ... I have to eat.\" For Kumagai, the anniversary was a time to look ahead. \"I see it as the start of year one; next 11 March, it will be the start of year two. My only goal now is to make things better year by year. The Okirai district's fishing fleet is much smaller, and its members much younger than before the disaster: at 53, Kumagai is the oldest in the new organisation. Many older fishermen have lost the will to rebuild, says Kumagai, who couldn't bring himself to stare at the sea in the aftermath of the tsunami. \"Ideally, I would like life to return to the way it was,\" he says. \"We've made a start. But it's only a start.\"", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news"], "title": "Japan tsunami survivors, one year on: 'we've made a start'"},{"date": "2012-03-11T12:52:53Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Millions of people in Japan have paid tribute to the thousands of victims of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated the country's north-east coast one year ago and sparked the world's worst nuclear crisis for 25 years.At 2.46pm local time (5.46am GMT), a year on from the moment the magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck, people across Japan bowed their heads and observed a minute's silence, while sirens sounded in the dozens of coastal communities still in mourning for the 15,800 people confirmed dead and 3,300 others still missing.In Tokyo, some train services came to a standstill, and the emperor, empress, prime minister, foreign dignitaries and hundreds of survivors attended a ceremony at the capital's national theatre.In Ishinomaki, where the tsunami left more than 5,700 people dead or missing, hundreds attended a service at Minato primary school, where some had taken refuge after the disaster.Many remained silent after the official silence, hands clasped in prayer as Buddhist monks chanted sutras before an altar laden with white chrysanthemums. As darkness fell, children lit paper lanterns bearing simple messages that resonate across the region: togetherness, hope and strength.The people of the city, almost half of which was submerged beneath waves of up to 10 metres in height, are torn between two overwhelming emotions: deep sadness at the loss of life, and a determination to look forward.Masaru Sasaki, a 71-year-old taxi driver, came to remember his wife, daughter and grandson, all swept away by the waves. \"In some ways, the last 12 months have passed quickly,\" he said. \"But when I think of my family, it seems like a lifetime.\"I am lucky enough to be able to work, and I gain strength each day from my passengers. If I didn't have that, I don't think I could go on living.\"The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, vowed that Japan would be \"reborn as en even better place\".\"Our predecessors who brought prosperity to have repeatedly risen up from crises, every time becoming stronger,\" he said. \"We will stand by the people from the disaster-hit areas and join hands to achieve the historic task of rebuilding.\"It is impossible to overstate the size of that task. Exactly a year after they were sent fleeing by waves of up to 20 metres in height, more than 320,000 displaced people are still living in temporary housing along the north-east coast. An estimated 23m tonnes of rubble has been removed and placed in piles, but only a fraction has been buried or incinerated.The cost of rebuilding dozens of cities, towns and villages on higher ground is expected to cost Japanese taxpayers $230bn (\u00a3145bn) over the next 10 years. Some of that will come from an expected doubling of the sales tax; rather less palatable, for many, are the tens of billions the government will spend to prop up the company at the centre of the nuclear crisis, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco).The sense of loss was tinged with bitterness at the slow pace of reconstruction and the government's handling of the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.On Friday, newly released government documents revealed that Japan's cabinet was aware of the imminent risk of a meltdown, but elected to suppress the information for weeks unless it sparked panic among the public. Tepco did not publicly acknowledge a partial meltdown in three reactors until May.\"I no longer trust the government,\" Ayumi Sato said as she left a memorial service in Ishinomaki cradling her baby daughter. \"This disaster has made me realise that the only people capable of looking after our daughter's future are me and my husband.\"Amid the solemnity came protest. In Fukushima prefecture and Tokyo, thousands turned out to demand the permanent closure of all of Japan's nuclear reactors. An estimated 12,000 protesters in the capital formed a human chain around the parliament building.All but two of the country's 54 reactors are currently closed for maintenance checks, and will not be permitted to restart unless they pass tests of their ability to withstand catastrophic events and win approval from host communities spooked by the Fukushima accident.The triple meltdown at Fukushima forced the immediate evacuation of 80,000 people living within 20km; a similar number have left other towns and villages outside the evacuation zone where high levels of radiation have been found.The operation to decontaminate the area is expected to last years, and neighbourhoods closest to the plant could remain uninhabitable for decades.In Tokyo, Emperor Akihito acknowledged the difficulties facing Fukushima's displaced residents. \"In order to make the area inhabitable again, we face the difficult problem of removing radiation,\" the 78-year-old, who has recently undergone heart surgery, said in a brief address.\"We shall not let our memory of the disasters fade, pay attention to disaster prevention and continue our effort to make this land an even safer place to live.\"After workers at Fukushima Daiichi observed a minute's silence, Tepco's president, Toshio Nishizawa, expressed his \"heartfelt sympathy\" to the victims of the disaster and apologised to residents living near the stricken plant.\"While always keeping in mind the tremendous responsibility we have to maintain stable conditions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, we will continue to safely work toward the mid- to long-term decommissioning of the reactors.\"The day of 11 March is forever etched on the hearts and minds of every Tepco employee.\"Many survivors chose to mark the day in private. Yuko Sugimoto, who became a symbol of the tsunami when she was photographed, draped in a blanket amid the wreckage, searching for her son, Raito, whose nursery was partly submerged.Sugimoto and Raito, who had been rescued by the military from the nursery roof, were reunited two days later. A year on, life was beginning to return to normal, she said, but for her son, the mental scars had yet to heal.\"He won't let me leave him, even for a minute,\" she said at her new home outside Ishinomaki. \"When we had tsunami warnings after 11 March he was physically sick. He's doing his best to appear normal, but I know that on the inside he is still in a great deal of pain.\"", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Fukushima", "Nuclear power", "Environment", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Ishinomaki"], "title": "Japan marks first anniversary of earthquake and tsunami"},{"date": "2012-03-09T15:56:20Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The Fukushima accident will achieve in the next few months what has eluded campaigners for decades: the closure of every one of Japan's nuclear reactors.The closures, prompted by the meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant a year ago, have continued as more reactors are taken offline for inspections. All must pass recently introduced two-stage \"stress tests\" and win local approval before they can be restarted.If, as expected, the last two working reactors are shut down for maintenance by the spring, Japan will be left without nuclear-generated power during the sweltering summer months, when electricity demand peaks.The question is when, or if, the reactors will restart amid a hardening of public attitudes towards nuclear energy in the aftermath of Fukushima, and a new enthusiasm for investment in renewable energy.Japan lost its most prominent anti-nuclear activist last summer with the resignation of Naoto Kan, the prime minister during the early days of the crisis, partly under pressure from other MPs angered by his green conversion in the wake of the Fukushima meltdown.Kan's successor, Yoshihiko Noda, has said only that Japan needs to gradually reduce its dependence on nuclear energy and improve safety. Under pressure from industry leaders who say a power crunch could damage productivity, Noda is known to want some idle reactors to go back online as soon as their safety has been confirmed.He has at least acknowledged that the government had been guilty of placing too much faith in the myth of safety surrounding nuclear power. \"We can no longer make the excuse that what happened was unpredictable and outside our imagination,\" he told foreign journalists last week. \"Crisis management requires us to imagine what may be outside our imagination.\"Japan, the world's third-largest industrialised country, is paying a heavy economic price for the de facto phasing out of nuclear power. This is in the form of a dramatic rise in imports of oil and gas that not only threaten Japan's climate change goals but were behind 2011 trade deficit, its first in more than three decades.If none of the closed reactors is restarted by early May, Japan's growing dependence on fossil fuels could add more than $30bn a year to its energy costs, according to the government.Before the Fukushima accident, a third of the country's energy came from nuclear, and there were plans - abandoned after Fukushima \u2013 to boost its share to more than 50% by 2030 with the construction of new reactors.But after the Fukushima accident passed its most critical phase, the government moved to address public criticism of the Tepco and industry regulators by announcing reforms to the utility's management structure and a new nuclear watchdog - separate from the trade industry - that will start work this spring.\"The first step towards more government involvement in the nuclear industry is turning steps required towards handling severe nuclear accidents into law and requiring utilities to adhere to them,\" the environment minister, Goshi Hosono, said last month.\"I don't think Japan will, or should, sacrifice the safety of nuclear power to ensure a stable source of electricity. Our stance needs to be that we will only allow the minimum number of nuclear reactors to operate under the extremely strict guidelines.\"But many are sceptical of claims that the Fukushima accident was an aberration. A poll by the public broadcaster NHK showed that nearly 70% of Japanese wanted to reduce or end the use of nuclear power, although another survey by the Nikkei media group showed support for the restart of reactors to meet short-term needs at 48%.Significantly, the Mainichi Shimbun this week became the first major newspaper to come out in favour of ditching nuclear power. \"The illusion of nuclear power safety has been torn out by the root,\" it said. \"The Fukushima nuclear disaster that followed the great waves of 11 March last year made sure of that.\"Tomas Kaberger, a member of the Swedish energy agency who was appointed to lead a renewable energy foundation set up by the Softbank chief executive, Masayoshi Son, believes the Fukushima accident has ruled out even a modest a return to nuclear power.\"There is a lot of resistance in the existing power structures, but the combined desire for economic competitiveness and the public opposition to continue as before and in favour of more sustainable and efficient energy supply, I think, will win in the end,\" he said. \"It is only a matter of time.\"Japan proved it could continue to function during the energy-saving regime enforced in the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima accident. If, as the environment minister Yukio Edano has suggested, it manages to last the summer without widespread disruption to the power, more people will be asking why the temporary nuclear shutdown can't be made permanent.", "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan disaster", "Nuclear power", "Renewable energy", "Energy", "World news", "Japan", "Environment"], "title": "How Fukushima is leading towards a nuclear-free Japan"},{"date": "2012-04-23T08:53:40Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I sometimes struggle with the intricacies of airport customs, especially after mind-crushing 11-hour flights.

In the morning, we'll be running workshops for local junior high school children. Last night, eating with friends who teach at universities in Kyoto, I asked them how much knowledge of Shakespeare I might expect from the kids. They were unsure and thought that while young people know Shakespeare \"the brand\", fewer today had much sense of the narratives of the plays. One colleague, who teaches Shakespeare to undergraduates, reports an increasing fascination, almost obsession, among her students with the authorship debate, perhaps only encouraged by the recent release in Japan of the film Anonymous.In fact, in the local Twittersphere, Conan Doyle appears to be outshining his compatriot so far. When I tweeted that Sherlock and Shakespeare were on their way, we were overwhelmed by the response, and decided to open up the embassy later in the week to allow enthusiastic local Sherlockians to have a glimpse of their master's manuscript.

She's a successful eye surgeon, with a private clinic, a stylish apartment, a Porsche and two pet pooches: Tinkerbell, a chihuahua, and Ginger, a poodle. \"Japanese dog owners think a dog is like a child,\" says Horikoshi. \"I have no children, so I really love my two dogs.\"Many Japanese women like Horikoshi prefer pets to parenthood. Startlingly, in a country panicking over its plummeting birthrate, there are now many more pets than children. While the birthrate has been falling dramatically and the average age of Japan's population has been steadily climbing, Japan has become a pet superpower. Official estimates put the pet population at 22 million or more, but there are only 16.6 million children under 15.Tinkerbell and Ginger have their own room and a wardrobe full of designer clothes. They have jumpers, dresses, coats and fancy dress outfits, neatly hung on jewelled hangers; hats, sunglasses and even tiny shoes. Horikoshi says she shops for her dogs most weekends and they get new clothes each season.In Japan designer labels such as Chanel, Dior, Herm\u00e8s and Gucci offer luxury dog products. This canine couture doesn't come cheap. A poodle pullover can cost $250 (around \u00a3160) or more. In many parts of Tokyo, it is easier to buy clothes for dogs than for children. Boutiques sell everything from frilly frocks to designer jeans, from nappies to organic nibbles, and smart \"doggie bags\" and buggies or pushchairs to transport them in.Japan has arguably the world's most pampered pooches. Tiny lapdogs such as miniature dachshunds, poodles and chihuahuas are particularly popular because most people in Tokyo \u2013 one of the most densely populated cities in the world \u2013 live in small apartments. And there's a growing market in services and treats for pets.The pet industry is estimated to be worth more than \u00a51tn a year (around \u00a38.2bn) and has expanded into gourmet dog food stores, hot spring resorts, yoga classes and restaurants where dogs sit on chairs to eat organic meals.In his one-room flat in a Tokyo suburb, Jiro Akiba feeds treats to his dog Kotaro, a miniature dachshund, weighing only 3.4kg. His name means \"first-born son\". \"He's like a first baby for us, so that's why we decided to call him Kotaro,\" says Akiba. \"It's good to have a dog if you don't have a baby, because it is quite fun to take care of him like a baby.\"Akiba, a cameraman, would have liked children, but his partner (a freelance editor) wants to keep working. \"In Japanese society, it's really hard for women to have a baby and keep a job \u2026 so my girlfriend decided against having a baby, and that's why we have a dog instead.\" Akiba says he thinks this makes economic sense, given the cost of living in Tokyo, high taxes and static salaries following two decades of recession.Despite the economic stagnation, people seem happy to spend any spare money on photo sessions, massages and treats for their four-legged \"babies\". The average fertility rate is now 1.39 children per woman \u2013 well below the number needed to keep the population stable. Japan has, in effect, a self-imposed one-child policy. Government projections show if current trends continue, today's population of 128 million will fall to 43 million over the next century.\"The most important reason for Japan's declining birthrate is less sex,\" says Dr Kunio Kitamara, director of Japan's Family Planning Research Centre. His annual surveys indicate that the nation's libido has been lagging in the last decade. The birthrate has declined, but fewer contraceptives are being used and there are fewer abortions and lower rate of sexually transmitted diseases. \"Why?\" asks Dr Kitamara: \"Less sex!\"His research shows that almost half of married couples have sex less than one a month, and \"young people dislike sexual intercourse\". His latest data from 2010 showed that 32% of young men dislike sex because \"they are afraid of failure and rejection by women.\" Sixty percent of women in their mid- to late 20s are single, and 70% of unmarried women don't have a boyfriend. In Japan marriage is still more or less a prerequisite for having children \u2013 only 2% of children are born outside wedlock.One young man we spoke to had dressed his dog up in a white hoodie and jeans, shoes and sunglasses because, he said, he wanted his dog to look \"cute, cool and tough\". His proud owner said he hoped his dog's look might attract young women, but so far he hadn't met anyone to share his life with. \"I wish I could meet someone like that,\" he said.Economic stagnation has hit young men particularly hard. More than 10 million people aged between 20 and 34 still live with their parents. They can't afford to get married and start a family, but for the odd luxury or treats for their dogs, they can \u2013 and do \u2013 splash out.Smart buggies and designer doggie bags are essential for any self-respecting dog like Kotaro. \"My dog really hates to go out with his feet,\" says Akiba. \"Kotaro doesn't like walking at all.\"For dogs in urgent need of exercise after a lifetime being pushed or carried around, there are spas and onsens (hot springs), which look identical to the ones for humans. For $100 (\u00a365) a session, an attendant in a wetsuit will give Kotaro one-to-one swimming lessons, relaxing bubble baths, body massages using aromatherapy oils, deep-pore cleansing and mud packs, and even flossing or manicure services. Many dogs are \"regulars\" who come at least once a week \u2013 running up annual bills of $5,000 (\u00a33,200) or more.In Tokyo, it is easier for Horikoshi to find a canine daycare centre for Tinkerbell and Ginger than it would be to find a nursery place for a child. If Akiba and his partner decide to go on holiday, they can pay $100 a night to leave Kotaro in a dog hotel.When the unthinkable happens, there are even temples where dead dogs are laid to rest with full Buddhist rites: a deluxe funeral and cremation ceremony can cost $8,000 (\u00a35,000) or more. \"I find these days people grieve more for their pets than for parents or grandparents,\" says a monk at a 1,000-year-old temple in a Tokyo suburb. \"It is because pets are just like their child, so it is like losing a child.\"Japan's population fell by a record number last year and in the wake of the earthquake and nuclear disasters, the National Institute of Population Research is expecting there to be a further decline in births this year, says deputy director Ryuichi Kaneko. \"We realised that we are living in dangerous times,\" he says. \"Many young people are even more hesitant to have children now.\"Akiba says that although the government has tried to encourage young couples to have babies, many of the incentives, such as child benefit, are too inconsistent and subject to frequent political change. Japan's population has the longest life expectancy in the world, which \u2013 coupled with the falling birth rate \u2013 means a pensions timebomb looms. \"We all \u2013 companies, the government, people young and old - need to think seriously about this problem,\" says Kaneko, \"or Japan will have a very hard time.\"One thing is certain: everything Japan has tried so far \u2013 introducing maternity leave, increasing child beneft, providing nursery places \u2013 has failed to arrest its demographic decline. Fresh thinking will be needed to persuade more Japanese people that in the long-term, man's best friend can be no substitute for man himself.\u2022 It's a Dog's Life is on BBC World Service on Saturday 9 June at 12.05pm BST.", "tags": ["Dogs", "Pets", "Family", "Life and style", "Japan", "Animals", "World news"], "title": "Why Japan prefers pets to parenthood"},{"date": "2012-04-23T08:53:40Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I sometimes struggle with the intricacies of airport customs, especially after mind-crushing 11-hour flights.

Last Christmas, I was almost refused entry to the United States for illicit citrus-running (I blame my wife; she made me her unknowing satsuma mule). But arriving in Tokyo last week, I had more on my mind than stray oranges. Landing at Narita airport at something like 4am UK time, I set to work on the customs paperwork. Definitely no fruit, plants, or cats; but value of objects being imported? Um \u2026 what's the Japanese for \"priceless\"?I am head of English and drama at the British Library, and came to Japan last week as part of the Great! campaign organized by the British Council, and in partnership with friends and colleagues at De Montfort University and the British embassy in Tokyo. Tagging along for the ride with me are travelling companions of the highest order: a handwritten Sherlock Holmes manuscript of The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter and an original First Folio of 1623, the first collected edition of Shakespeare's plays.Our press release talks, not unjustly, of the arrival of two great British literary icons in Japan (three, if you include me, I optimistically suggested to our press officer), and if you're thinking of the ways literary artefacts can embody a national sensibility, you'd be hard pushed to find better examples.Today, 23 April, is assumed to be Shakespeare's birthday \u2013 and to celebrate, we'll be hosting a number of special events at the British embassy in Tokyo \u2013 located next to the imperial palace, and one of the most impressive embassies in the city (and, I suspect, the world). In the morning, we'll be running workshops for local junior high school children. Last night, eating with friends who teach at universities in Kyoto, I asked them how much knowledge of Shakespeare I might expect from the kids. They were unsure and thought that while young people know Shakespeare \"the brand\", fewer today had much sense of the narratives of the plays. One colleague, who teaches Shakespeare to undergraduates, reports an increasing fascination, almost obsession, among her students with the authorship debate, perhaps only encouraged by the recent release in Japan of the film Anonymous.In fact, in the local Twittersphere, Conan Doyle appears to be outshining his compatriot so far. When I tweeted that Sherlock and Shakespeare were on their way, we were overwhelmed by the response, and decided to open up the embassy later in the week to allow enthusiastic local Sherlockians to have a glimpse of their master's manuscript. Although Japanese enthusiasm for Holmes is longstanding (he first appeared in a Japanese magazine in 1894), friends suggest the success of Guy Richie's franchise may have re-ignited interest in the detective. Perhaps Ritchie should tackle the Bard next: \"Oi! Tybalt! Yer farckin ratcatcher!\"After the schools workshops, later that evening, we'll be hosting a reception for key local leaders, from presidents of major Japanese multinationals to cabinet ministers, and a range of ambassadors. But the guest of honour, of course, will be the First Folio.Gathered besides these literary treasures, I'll be talking about some of the Shakespeare work we are leading at the British Library \u2013 including our recent CD of Shakespeare performed in the original pronunciation (OP) that his early audiences would have experienced. After that, Dominic Shellard, vice chancellor at De Montfort \u2013 who says that he can still remember his primary school teacher first impressing upon him the importance of the First Folio as the only record of Shakespeare's work (half of his plays appeared for the first time in the Folio) \u2013 will lecture on Shakespeare as part of a double-act with the UK ambassador to Japan, David Warren. Warren, in his time a member of the Oxford University Drama Society, is a keen theatre scholar, and will give an ambassador's personal view of Shakespeare.As courier, and guarantor, of the First Folio, I am however mindful of the diplomatic hot water that the RSC got into in 1964, when they took their own Folio to the Vatican for the Pope to bless. Something got lost in translation, and the pope understood he was being given the Folio as a gift. What could they do? It may not have been meant that way \u2013 but isn't the pope infallible?And so I won't be resting on my laurels in having successfully got the Folio out here \u2013 I have a feeling my CEO would like it back as well. I hope all those who come to see the Folio this week appreciate this greatest of literary treasures \u2026 but I also hope they let me have it back.", "tags": ["Books", "William Shakespeare", "Theatre", "Japan", "Culture"], "title": "Taking Shakespeare to Japan"},{"date": "2012-06-16T06:56:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is to resume the use of nuclear power for the first time since last year's triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi power plant after the government on Saturday approved the restart of two idled reactors.The decision to restart reactors three and four at Oi power plant in western Japan could pave the way for the resumption of operations at other atomic facilities, amid concern over power shortages during peak demand this summer.The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, announced the restart after securing support from the mayor of Oi and the governor of Fukui prefecture, where Oi is located.\"Having won local consent, reactivating [the reactors] is now the government's final decision,\" Noda said. \"We are determined to make further efforts to restore people's trust in nuclear policy and safety regulations.\"Japan's last working reactor was turned off in early May, leaving it without nuclear power for the first time in more than 40 years.Four reactors at Fukushima Daiichi were destroyed by the 11 March 2011 tsunami and another 50 around the country were taken offline for regular maintenance.

Over the next week we will discuss the present and future of an experiment that many have devoted several years of their lives to. An experiment that will forge a path into a new era of understanding the creation of our Universe.The Tokai to Kamioka experiment (T2K for short) restarted last month, a year after the massive eastern Japanese earthquake shut it down after just months of operation. The experiment is once again firing an intense beam of neutrino particles 295km through the crust of the Earth from Tokai-mura to the Japanese alps in the West. In looking at the particles at the start of their journey and again at their final destination we are looking for neutrinos changing their sense of exactly what they are. The method of character change that neutrinos undergo is called oscillation and is well understood. The exact changes however must themselves be measured directly from Nature. Recently the Daya Bay experiment, and shortly after the RENO experiment, measured the final unknown. We now have a complete but blurry picture of how neutrinos behave. The T2K, Daya Bay, RENO and future experiments will bring different aspects of this picture into focus. Once a sharp image is in place then the fun really begins. Once we know how neutrinos behave we will start pitching neutrinos against their opposite number; their antimatter versions called antineutrinos. If we understand them well enough we can look for subtle differences between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. Any difference between any types of matter and antimatter are important because it was exactly differences like these that created the Universe in which we live.The very slight preference in Nature for matter over antimatter left a residue of matter. This residue was the raw material from which, over 13 billions years later, forms the entire visible Universe. T2K will forge the path in looking for this difference and it is in this week where we discuss how to start on this journey.Ben Still is a neutrino physicist at Queen Mary, University of London, and a member of the T2K collaboration.

Anti-nuclear campaigners accused the prime minister of rushing into a decision and ignoring lingering concerns over safety. \"Prime minister Noda's rushed, dangerous approval of the Oi nuclear power plant restart ignores expert safety advice and public outcry, and needlessly risks the health of Japan's environment, its people and its economy,\" said Junichi Sato, executive director of Greenpeace Japan.\"Japan has already survived the peak summer and winter energy demand periods once with little nuclear power online, as well as a full month with none, and despite continued fear-mongering statements from industry and government about the need for restarting Oi, the economy has still grown remarkably well and there have been no significant energy shortages.\"The operator of the Oi plant, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco), had warned that the region would face a 15% electricity shortfall in July and August, and had urged consumers to make power savings.But the trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, warned against wastefulness, as it will take Kepco about six weeks to bring both reactors to full capacity. \"Safety is our main concern,\" he said. \"It will take some time for the reactors to begin generating electricity, and we request that people continue to save energy.

She's a successful eye surgeon, with a private clinic, a stylish apartment, a Porsche and two pet pooches: Tinkerbell, a chihuahua, and Ginger, a poodle. \"Japanese dog owners think a dog is like a child,\" says Horikoshi. \"I have no children, so I really love my two dogs.\"Many Japanese women like Horikoshi prefer pets to parenthood. Startlingly, in a country panicking over its plummeting birthrate, there are now many more pets than children. While the birthrate has been falling dramatically and the average age of Japan's population has been steadily climbing, Japan has become a pet superpower. Official estimates put the pet population at 22 million or more, but there are only 16.6 million children under 15.Tinkerbell and Ginger have their own room and a wardrobe full of designer clothes. They have jumpers, dresses, coats and fancy dress outfits, neatly hung on jewelled hangers; hats, sunglasses and even tiny shoes. Horikoshi says she shops for her dogs most weekends and they get new clothes each season.In Japan designer labels such as Chanel, Dior, Herm\u00e8s and Gucci offer luxury dog products. This canine couture doesn't come cheap. A poodle pullover can cost $250 (around \u00a3160) or more. In many parts of Tokyo, it is easier to buy clothes for dogs than for children. Boutiques sell everything from frilly frocks to designer jeans, from nappies to organic nibbles, and smart \"doggie bags\" and buggies or pushchairs to transport them in.Japan has arguably the world's most pampered pooches. Tiny lapdogs such as miniature dachshunds, poodles and chihuahuas are particularly popular because most people in Tokyo \u2013 one of the most densely populated cities in the world \u2013 live in small apartments. And there's a growing market in services and treats for pets.The pet industry is estimated to be worth more than \u00a51tn a year (around \u00a38.2bn) and has expanded into gourmet dog food stores, hot spring resorts, yoga classes and restaurants where dogs sit on chairs to eat organic meals.In his one-room flat in a Tokyo suburb, Jiro Akiba feeds treats to his dog Kotaro, a miniature dachshund, weighing only 3.4kg. His name means \"first-born son\". \"He's like a first baby for us, so that's why we decided to call him Kotaro,\" says Akiba. \"It's good to have a dog if you don't have a baby, because it is quite fun to take care of him like a baby.\"Akiba, a cameraman, would have liked children, but his partner (a freelance editor) wants to keep working. \"In Japanese society, it's really hard for women to have a baby and keep a job \u2026 so my girlfriend decided against having a baby, and that's why we have a dog instead.\" Akiba says he thinks this makes economic sense, given the cost of living in Tokyo, high taxes and static salaries following two decades of recession.Despite the economic stagnation, people seem happy to spend any spare money on photo sessions, massages and treats for their four-legged \"babies\". The average fertility rate is now 1.39 children per woman \u2013 well below the number needed to keep the population stable. Japan has, in effect, a self-imposed one-child policy. Government projections show if current trends continue, today's population of 128 million will fall to 43 million over the next century.\"The most important reason for Japan's declining birthrate is less sex,\" says Dr Kunio Kitamara, director of Japan's Family Planning Research Centre. His annual surveys indicate that the nation's libido has been lagging in the last decade. The birthrate has declined, but fewer contraceptives are being used and there are fewer abortions and lower rate of sexually transmitted diseases. \"Why?\" asks Dr Kitamara: \"Less sex!\"His research shows that almost half of married couples have sex less than one a month, and \"young people dislike sexual intercourse\". His latest data from 2010 showed that 32% of young men dislike sex because \"they are afraid of failure and rejection by women.\" Sixty percent of women in their mid- to late 20s are single, and 70% of unmarried women don't have a boyfriend. In Japan marriage is still more or less a prerequisite for having children \u2013 only 2% of children are born outside wedlock.One young man we spoke to had dressed his dog up in a white hoodie and jeans, shoes and sunglasses because, he said, he wanted his dog to look \"cute, cool and tough\". His proud owner said he hoped his dog's look might attract young women, but so far he hadn't met anyone to share his life with. \"I wish I could meet someone like that,\" he said.Economic stagnation has hit young men particularly hard. More than 10 million people aged between 20 and 34 still live with their parents. They can't afford to get married and start a family, but for the odd luxury or treats for their dogs, they can \u2013 and do \u2013 splash out.Smart buggies and designer doggie bags are essential for any self-respecting dog like Kotaro. \"My dog really hates to go out with his feet,\" says Akiba. \"Kotaro doesn't like walking at all.\"For dogs in urgent need of exercise after a lifetime being pushed or carried around, there are spas and onsens (hot springs), which look identical to the ones for humans. For $100 (\u00a365) a session, an attendant in a wetsuit will give Kotaro one-to-one swimming lessons, relaxing bubble baths, body massages using aromatherapy oils, deep-pore cleansing and mud packs, and even flossing or manicure services. Many dogs are \"regulars\" who come at least once a week \u2013 running up annual bills of $5,000 (\u00a33,200) or more.In Tokyo, it is easier for Horikoshi to find a canine daycare centre for Tinkerbell and Ginger than it would be to find a nursery place for a child. If Akiba and his partner decide to go on holiday, they can pay $100 a night to leave Kotaro in a dog hotel.When the unthinkable happens, there are even temples where dead dogs are laid to rest with full Buddhist rites: a deluxe funeral and cremation ceremony can cost $8,000 (\u00a35,000) or more. \"I find these days people grieve more for their pets than for parents or grandparents,\" says a monk at a 1,000-year-old temple in a Tokyo suburb. \"It is because pets are just like their child, so it is like losing a child.\"Japan's population fell by a record number last year and in the wake of the earthquake and nuclear disasters, the National Institute of Population Research is expecting there to be a further decline in births this year, says deputy director Ryuichi Kaneko. \"We realised that we are living in dangerous times,\" he says. \"Many young people are even more hesitant to have children now.\"Akiba says that although the government has tried to encourage young couples to have babies, many of the incentives, such as child benefit, are too inconsistent and subject to frequent political change. Japan's population has the longest life expectancy in the world, which \u2013 coupled with the falling birth rate \u2013 means a pensions timebomb looms. \"We all \u2013 companies, the government, people young and old - need to think seriously about this problem,\" says Kaneko, \"or Japan will have a very hard time.\"One thing is certain: everything Japan has tried so far \u2013 introducing maternity leave, increasing child beneft, providing nursery places \u2013 has failed to arrest its demographic decline. Fresh thinking will be needed to persuade more Japanese people that in the long-term, man's best friend can be no substitute for man himself.\u2022 It's a Dog's Life is on BBC World Service on Saturday 9 June at 12.05pm BST.", "tags": ["Dogs", "Pets", "Family", "Life and style", "Japan", "Animals", "World news"], "title": "Why Japan prefers pets to parenthood"},{"date": "2012-05-05T11:35:36Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is shutting down its last working nuclear reactor as part of the safety drive imposed after the March 2011 tsunami triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima plant.The closure of the third reactor at the Tomari plant in Hokkaido prefecture, northern Japan, means all of the country's 50 nuclear reactors have been taken offline, leaving the country with no nuclear-derived electricity for the first time since 1970.Hokkaido Electric said it started lowering output from the reactor at 5pm (8am GMT). The unit should be shut down completely by the early hours of Sunday.Hundreds of people marched through Tokyo waving banners to celebrate what they hope will be the end of nuclear power in Japan.Until last year's earthquake and tsunami triggered radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, Japan was the world's third-biggest user of atomic energy.All the reactors have been shut down for routine maintenance. They must withstand tests against earthquakes and tsunamis, and local authorities must give their consent in order for plants to restart.The trade minister, Yukio Edano, and three other ministers have been trying to win public backing to restart two reactors taken offline at Kansai Electric Power's Ohi nuclear plant to help ease expected power shortages of nearly 20% in the summer. The reactors are the first to be considered for reactivation by the government, but it faces an uphill battle to win public support.The last time Japan had no nuclear power was for five days in May 1970, when the only two existing reactors were shut for maintenance, according to the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan.", "tags": ["Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Energy", "Environment"], "title": "Japan shuts down last working nuclear reactor"},{"date": "2012-04-22T10:29:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Hundreds of particle physicists are descending once more on the sleepy village of Tokai-mura in Eastern Japan. Over the next week we will discuss the present and future of an experiment that many have devoted several years of their lives to. An experiment that will forge a path into a new era of understanding the creation of our Universe.The Tokai to Kamioka experiment (T2K for short) restarted last month, a year after the massive eastern Japanese earthquake shut it down after just months of operation. The experiment is once again firing an intense beam of neutrino particles 295km through the crust of the Earth from Tokai-mura to the Japanese alps in the West. In looking at the particles at the start of their journey and again at their final destination we are looking for neutrinos changing their sense of exactly what they are. The method of character change that neutrinos undergo is called oscillation and is well understood. The exact changes however must themselves be measured directly from Nature. Recently the Daya Bay experiment, and shortly after the RENO experiment, measured the final unknown. We now have a complete but blurry picture of how neutrinos behave. The T2K, Daya Bay, RENO and future experiments will bring different aspects of this picture into focus. Once a sharp image is in place then the fun really begins. Once we know how neutrinos behave we will start pitching neutrinos against their opposite number; their antimatter versions called antineutrinos. If we understand them well enough we can look for subtle differences between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. Any difference between any types of matter and antimatter are important because it was exactly differences like these that created the Universe in which we live.The very slight preference in Nature for matter over antimatter left a residue of matter. This residue was the raw material from which, over 13 billions years later, forms the entire visible Universe. T2K will forge the path in looking for this difference and it is in this week where we discuss how to start on this journey.Ben Still is a neutrino physicist at Queen Mary, University of London, and a member of the T2K collaboration.

Most residents of Okinawa want the base moved off their island altogether, but the government has failed to find a new host community.Up to 5,000 troops \u2013 about 3,000 fewer than envisaged in the original 2006 agreement \u2013 will be sent to Guam, according to a US defence official quoted by Associated Press in Washington. The remainder will move to Hawaii or rotate between Australia and other parts of the region.Kurt Campbell, the US assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, said the deal should satisfy congressional critics who had denounced the original plan as confused and expensive.\"We think it breaks a very long stalemate that has plagued our politics, that has clogged both of our systems,\" he said.", "tags": ["US military", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US news"], "title": "US to move marines out of Japan"},{"date": "2012-04-23T08:53:40Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I sometimes struggle with the intricacies of airport customs, especially after mind-crushing 11-hour flights.

This canine couture doesn't come cheap. A poodle pullover can cost $250 (around \u00a3160) or more. In many parts of Tokyo, it is easier to buy clothes for dogs than for children. Boutiques sell everything from frilly frocks to designer jeans, from nappies to organic nibbles, and smart \"doggie bags\" and buggies or pushchairs to transport them in.Japan has arguably the world's most pampered pooches. Tiny lapdogs such as miniature dachshunds, poodles and chihuahuas are particularly popular because most people in Tokyo \u2013 one of the most densely populated cities in the world \u2013 live in small apartments. And there's a growing market in services and treats for pets.The pet industry is estimated to be worth more than \u00a51tn a year (around \u00a38.2bn) and has expanded into gourmet dog food stores, hot spring resorts, yoga classes and restaurants where dogs sit on chairs to eat organic meals.In his one-room flat in a Tokyo suburb, Jiro Akiba feeds treats to his dog Kotaro, a miniature dachshund, weighing only 3.4kg. His name means \"first-born son\". \"He's like a first baby for us, so that's why we decided to call him Kotaro,\" says Akiba. \"It's good to have a dog if you don't have a baby, because it is quite fun to take care of him like a baby.\"Akiba, a cameraman, would have liked children, but his partner (a freelance editor) wants to keep working. \"In Japanese society, it's really hard for women to have a baby and keep a job \u2026 so my girlfriend decided against having a baby, and that's why we have a dog instead.\" Akiba says he thinks this makes economic sense, given the cost of living in Tokyo, high taxes and static salaries following two decades of recession.Despite the economic stagnation, people seem happy to spend any spare money on photo sessions, massages and treats for their four-legged \"babies\". The average fertility rate is now 1.39 children per woman \u2013 well below the number needed to keep the population stable. Japan has, in effect, a self-imposed one-child policy. Government projections show if current trends continue, today's population of 128 million will fall to 43 million over the next century.\"The most important reason for Japan's declining birthrate is less sex,\" says Dr Kunio Kitamara, director of Japan's Family Planning Research Centre. His annual surveys indicate that the nation's libido has been lagging in the last decade. The birthrate has declined, but fewer contraceptives are being used and there are fewer abortions and lower rate of sexually transmitted diseases. \"Why?\" asks Dr Kitamara: \"Less sex!\"His research shows that almost half of married couples have sex less than one a month, and \"young people dislike sexual intercourse\". His latest data from 2010 showed that 32% of young men dislike sex because \"they are afraid of failure and rejection by women.\" Sixty percent of women in their mid- to late 20s are single, and 70% of unmarried women don't have a boyfriend. In Japan marriage is still more or less a prerequisite for having children \u2013 only 2% of children are born outside wedlock.One young man we spoke to had dressed his dog up in a white hoodie and jeans, shoes and sunglasses because, he said, he wanted his dog to look \"cute, cool and tough\". His proud owner said he hoped his dog's look might attract young women, but so far he hadn't met anyone to share his life with. \"I wish I could meet someone like that,\" he said.Economic stagnation has hit young men particularly hard. More than 10 million people aged between 20 and 34 still live with their parents. They can't afford to get married and start a family, but for the odd luxury or treats for their dogs, they can \u2013 and do \u2013 splash out.Smart buggies and designer doggie bags are essential for any self-respecting dog like Kotaro. \"My dog really hates to go out with his feet,\" says Akiba. \"Kotaro doesn't like walking at all.\"For dogs in urgent need of exercise after a lifetime being pushed or carried around, there are spas and onsens (hot springs), which look identical to the ones for humans. For $100 (\u00a365) a session, an attendant in a wetsuit will give Kotaro one-to-one swimming lessons, relaxing bubble baths, body massages using aromatherapy oils, deep-pore cleansing and mud packs, and even flossing or manicure services. Many dogs are \"regulars\" who come at least once a week \u2013 running up annual bills of $5,000 (\u00a33,200) or more.In Tokyo, it is easier for Horikoshi to find a canine daycare centre for Tinkerbell and Ginger than it would be to find a nursery place for a child. If Akiba and his partner decide to go on holiday, they can pay $100 a night to leave Kotaro in a dog hotel.When the unthinkable happens, there are even temples where dead dogs are laid to rest with full Buddhist rites: a deluxe funeral and cremation ceremony can cost $8,000 (\u00a35,000) or more. \"I find these days people grieve more for their pets than for parents or grandparents,\" says a monk at a 1,000-year-old temple in a Tokyo suburb. \"It is because pets are just like their child, so it is like losing a child.\"Japan's population fell by a record number last year and in the wake of the earthquake and nuclear disasters, the National Institute of Population Research is expecting there to be a further decline in births this year, says deputy director Ryuichi Kaneko. \"We realised that we are living in dangerous times,\" he says. \"Many young people are even more hesitant to have children now.\"Akiba says that although the government has tried to encourage young couples to have babies, many of the incentives, such as child benefit, are too inconsistent and subject to frequent political change. Japan's population has the longest life expectancy in the world, which \u2013 coupled with the falling birth rate \u2013 means a pensions timebomb looms. \"We all \u2013 companies, the government, people young and old - need to think seriously about this problem,\" says Kaneko, \"or Japan will have a very hard time.\"One thing is certain: everything Japan has tried so far \u2013 introducing maternity leave, increasing child beneft, providing nursery places \u2013 has failed to arrest its demographic decline. Fresh thinking will be needed to persuade more Japanese people that in the long-term, man's best friend can be no substitute for man himself.\u2022 It's a Dog's Life is on BBC World Service on Saturday 9 June at 12.05pm BST.", "tags": ["Dogs", "Pets", "Family", "Life and style", "Japan", "Animals", "World news"], "title": "Why Japan prefers pets to parenthood"},{"date": "2012-05-05T11:35:36Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is shutting down its last working nuclear reactor as part of the safety drive imposed after the March 2011 tsunami triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima plant.The closure of the third reactor at the Tomari plant in Hokkaido prefecture, northern Japan, means all of the country's 50 nuclear reactors have been taken offline, leaving the country with no nuclear-derived electricity for the first time since 1970.Hokkaido Electric said it started lowering output from the reactor at 5pm (8am GMT). The unit should be shut down completely by the early hours of Sunday.Hundreds of people marched through Tokyo waving banners to celebrate what they hope will be the end of nuclear power in Japan.Until last year's earthquake and tsunami triggered radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, Japan was the world's third-biggest user of atomic energy.All the reactors have been shut down for routine maintenance. They must withstand tests against earthquakes and tsunamis, and local authorities must give their consent in order for plants to restart.The trade minister, Yukio Edano, and three other ministers have been trying to win public backing to restart two reactors taken offline at Kansai Electric Power's Ohi nuclear plant to help ease expected power shortages of nearly 20% in the summer. The reactors are the first to be considered for reactivation by the government, but it faces an uphill battle to win public support.The last time Japan had no nuclear power was for five days in May 1970, when the only two existing reactors were shut for maintenance, according to the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan.", "tags": ["Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Energy", "Environment"], "title": "Japan shuts down last working nuclear reactor"},{"date": "2012-04-22T10:29:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Hundreds of particle physicists are descending once more on the sleepy village of Tokai-mura in Eastern Japan. Over the next week we will discuss the present and future of an experiment that many have devoted several years of their lives to. An experiment that will forge a path into a new era of understanding the creation of our Universe.The Tokai to Kamioka experiment (T2K for short) restarted last month, a year after the massive eastern Japanese earthquake shut it down after just months of operation. The experiment is once again firing an intense beam of neutrino particles 295km through the crust of the Earth from Tokai-mura to the Japanese alps in the West. In looking at the particles at the start of their journey and again at their final destination we are looking for neutrinos changing their sense of exactly what they are. The method of character change that neutrinos undergo is called oscillation and is well understood. The exact changes however must themselves be measured directly from Nature. Recently the Daya Bay experiment, and shortly after the RENO experiment, measured the final unknown. We now have a complete but blurry picture of how neutrinos behave. The T2K, Daya Bay, RENO and future experiments will bring different aspects of this picture into focus. Once a sharp image is in place then the fun really begins. Once we know how neutrinos behave we will start pitching neutrinos against their opposite number; their antimatter versions called antineutrinos. If we understand them well enough we can look for subtle differences between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. Any difference between any types of matter and antimatter are important because it was exactly differences like these that created the Universe in which we live.The very slight preference in Nature for matter over antimatter left a residue of matter. This residue was the raw material from which, over 13 billions years later, forms the entire visible Universe. T2K will forge the path in looking for this difference and it is in this week where we discuss how to start on this journey.Ben Still is a neutrino physicist at Queen Mary, University of London, and a member of the T2K collaboration.

Most residents of Okinawa want the base moved off their island altogether, but the government has failed to find a new host community.Up to 5,000 troops \u2013 about 3,000 fewer than envisaged in the original 2006 agreement \u2013 will be sent to Guam, according to a US defence official quoted by Associated Press in Washington. The remainder will move to Hawaii or rotate between Australia and other parts of the region.Kurt Campbell, the US assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, said the deal should satisfy congressional critics who had denounced the original plan as confused and expensive.\"We think it breaks a very long stalemate that has plagued our politics, that has clogged both of our systems,\" he said.", "tags": ["US military", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US news"], "title": "US to move marines out of Japan"},{"date": "2012-06-08T09:49:40Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Political analysts have long warned that Japan has fallen prey to widespread popular discontent with the democratic process. But this week, the country succumbed to an outbreak of election fever focused on what, for many, was by far the most pressing issue of the day.Watched by millions on TV, the victors took to a stage in central Tokyo to deliver tearful acceptance speeches, as analysts offered interpretations of the vote's wider meaning.But this was not politics as usual. There was no place for greying, middle-aged men in dark suits - the candidates were dozens of teenagers and women in their early 20s, all vying for the title of president of the J-pop phenomenon AKB48.In a contest that has gripped Japan for weeks, Yuko Oshima \u2013 a relatively mature singer at the age of 23 \u2013 emerged as the most popular member of the band, whose sugar-coated refrains have rivalled their Korean counterparts for the affections of Asian pop fans.Japan's broadcasters spent weeks trailing the vote, culminating in three hours of live coverage from the Nippon Budokan venue in Tokyo on Wednesday night.Images of Oshima, who will lead the group for the next year, were plastered over the following day's newspapers and generated hours of analysis on daytime TV shows. Even the normally staid broadsheets recognised that her election, with 108,000 votes \u2013 putting her well ahead of her closest rival \u2013 was a significant moment in J-pop history.Likening herself to a flower bud about to come into full bloom, she told her fans: \"You have given me water and light. But flowers wither eventually. Please be my sunshine forever.\"Oshima and 15 other performers earned enough votes among the 1.4 million cast to guarantee them a place in the lineup for the group's 27th single, to be released in August. The group's 90 members appear in rotation depending on their popularity with the public.The marketing brilliance did not end there: the public could only secure votes by buying a copy of the group's latest single, a Japanese and English track about the joys of summer. Each copy came with a code number enabling consumers to cast their votes online.With the most devout snapping up multiple CDs to boost the prospects of their favourite singer, the single sold a record 1.62m copies in its first week. One fan reportedly spent US$6,700 to secure 2,700 votes in online auctions.Since their debut in 2005, AKB48 have built up a huge following among girls in Japan and, more recently, other parts of Asia, as well as salarymen who flock to concerts and publicity events for the chance to shake hands and exchange a few words with their idols.The group, named after the geeky Akihabara district of Tokyo, have had a succession of million-selling singles and generated sales of more than US$200m in CD and DVD sales last year alone. Members appear in commercials for everything from chocolate to mobile phones, and they were recently enlisted in campaigns to sell Japanese government bonds and prevent teenage suicides.Their performances owe more to a heightened sense of kawaii cuteness than overt sexuality, but AKB48 members courted controversy over a recent confectionary commercial that some conservative commentators deemed inappropriate. But neither that, nor the arrest of one singer's mother for allegedly having sex with a minor, has slowed the group's rise to J-pop's apex.Together, the 48 stable has more than 230 members comprising four main groups and several smaller offshoots. Just as K-pop has outgrown its South Korean roots, sister groups have emerged in Jakarta, Taipei and Shanghai.This week's election fever has been attributed to discontent with conventional elections, with one expert even drawing an improbable comparison with the Arab spring. Hidetomi Tanaka, a professor at Jobu University, offered a more prosaic explanation. \"These girls start from the amateur level with few singing and dancing skills,\" he told Reuters. \"But the thing is they grow up with their fans.\"While some heralded the election as a popular challenge to the authority of the AKB48 impresario Yasushi Akimoto, the vote left some fans feeling disillusioned. \"It's supposed to be a general election, but it's the people with money who determine the result,\" a 16-year-old high school pupil told the Asahi Shimbun. \"It's like shareholders who have a bigger say if they invest more. It's not a genuine election.\"", "tags": ["Japan", "Pop and rock", "Television", "Asia Pacific", "Music", "Culture", "World news"], "title": "Japan gripped by TV election of pop group AKB48"},{"date": "2012-04-23T08:53:40Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I sometimes struggle with the intricacies of airport customs, especially after mind-crushing 11-hour flights. Last Christmas, I was almost refused entry to the United States for illicit citrus-running (I blame my wife; she made me her unknowing satsuma mule). But arriving in Tokyo last week, I had more on my mind than stray oranges. Landing at Narita airport at something like 4am UK time, I set to work on the customs paperwork. Definitely no fruit, plants, or cats; but value of objects being imported? Um \u2026 what's the Japanese for \"priceless\"?I am head of English and drama at the British Library, and came to Japan last week as part of the Great! campaign organized by the British Council, and in partnership with friends and colleagues at De Montfort University and the British embassy in Tokyo. Tagging along for the ride with me are travelling companions of the highest order: a handwritten Sherlock Holmes manuscript of The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter and an original First Folio of 1623, the first collected edition of Shakespeare's plays.Our press release talks, not unjustly, of the arrival of two great British literary icons in Japan (three, if you include me, I optimistically suggested to our press officer), and if you're thinking of the ways literary artefacts can embody a national sensibility, you'd be hard pushed to find better examples.Today, 23 April, is assumed to be Shakespeare's birthday \u2013 and to celebrate, we'll be hosting a number of special events at the British embassy in Tokyo \u2013 located next to the imperial palace, and one of the most impressive embassies in the city (and, I suspect, the world). In the morning, we'll be running workshops for local junior high school children. Last night, eating with friends who teach at universities in Kyoto, I asked them how much knowledge of Shakespeare I might expect from the kids. They were unsure and thought that while young people know Shakespeare \"the brand\", fewer today had much sense of the narratives of the plays. One colleague, who teaches Shakespeare to undergraduates, reports an increasing fascination, almost obsession, among her students with the authorship debate, perhaps only encouraged by the recent release in Japan of the film Anonymous.In fact, in the local Twittersphere, Conan Doyle appears to be outshining his compatriot so far. When I tweeted that Sherlock and Shakespeare were on their way, we were overwhelmed by the response, and decided to open up the embassy later in the week to allow enthusiastic local Sherlockians to have a glimpse of their master's manuscript. Although Japanese enthusiasm for Holmes is longstanding (he first appeared in a Japanese magazine in 1894), friends suggest the success of Guy Richie's franchise may have re-ignited interest in the detective. Perhaps Ritchie should tackle the Bard next: \"Oi! Tybalt! Yer farckin ratcatcher!\"After the schools workshops, later that evening, we'll be hosting a reception for key local leaders, from presidents of major Japanese multinationals to cabinet ministers, and a range of ambassadors. But the guest of honour, of course, will be the First Folio.Gathered besides these literary treasures, I'll be talking about some of the Shakespeare work we are leading at the British Library \u2013 including our recent CD of Shakespeare performed in the original pronunciation (OP) that his early audiences would have experienced. After that, Dominic Shellard, vice chancellor at De Montfort \u2013 who says that he can still remember his primary school teacher first impressing upon him the importance of the First Folio as the only record of Shakespeare's work (half of his plays appeared for the first time in the Folio) \u2013 will lecture on Shakespeare as part of a double-act with the UK ambassador to Japan, David Warren. Warren, in his time a member of the Oxford University Drama Society, is a keen theatre scholar, and will give an ambassador's personal view of Shakespeare.As courier, and guarantor, of the First Folio, I am however mindful of the diplomatic hot water that the RSC got into in 1964, when they took their own Folio to the Vatican for the Pope to bless. Something got lost in translation, and the pope understood he was being given the Folio as a gift. What could they do? It may not have been meant that way \u2013 but isn't the pope infallible?And so I won't be resting on my laurels in having successfully got the Folio out here \u2013 I have a feeling my CEO would like it back as well. I hope all those who come to see the Folio this week appreciate this greatest of literary treasures \u2026 but I also hope they let me have it back.", "tags": ["Books", "William Shakespeare", "Theatre", "Japan", "Culture"], "title": "Taking Shakespeare to Japan"},{"date": "2012-06-16T06:56:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is to resume the use of nuclear power for the first time since last year's triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi power plant after the government on Saturday approved the restart of two idled reactors.The decision to restart reactors three and four at Oi power plant in western Japan could pave the way for the resumption of operations at other atomic facilities, amid concern over power shortages during peak demand this summer.The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, announced the restart after securing support from the mayor of Oi and the governor of Fukui prefecture, where Oi is located.\"Having won local consent, reactivating [the reactors] is now the government's final decision,\" Noda said. \"We are determined to make further efforts to restore people's trust in nuclear policy and safety regulations.\"Japan's last working reactor was turned off in early May, leaving it without nuclear power for the first time in more than 40 years.Four reactors at Fukushima Daiichi were destroyed by the 11 March 2011 tsunami and another 50 around the country were taken offline for regular maintenance. Oi is the first plant to pass simulation \"stress tests\" introduced last year to address public concern over safety.Noda has pushed hard for the Oi restart under pressure from the powerful business lobby, which feared disruption to manufacturers. He was expected to give approval after the mayor of Oi, Shinobu Tokioka, gave his backing to the move earlier this week. Tokioka said nuclear safety experts had convinced him the plant could withstand a natural catastrophe similar to the one that struck Fukushima Daiichi.He added that he was concerned about the effect prolonged closure would have on the local economy and the prospect of power shortages in the Kansai region of western Japan, home to 24 million people and with an economy the size of Australia's.About 10,000 demonstrators gathered outside Noda's office on Friday night in last-ditch attempt to derail the restart. Anti-nuclear campaigners accused the prime minister of rushing into a decision and ignoring lingering concerns over safety. \"Prime minister Noda's rushed, dangerous approval of the Oi nuclear power plant restart ignores expert safety advice and public outcry, and needlessly risks the health of Japan's environment, its people and its economy,\" said Junichi Sato, executive director of Greenpeace Japan.\"Japan has already survived the peak summer and winter energy demand periods once with little nuclear power online, as well as a full month with none, and despite continued fear-mongering statements from industry and government about the need for restarting Oi, the economy has still grown remarkably well and there have been no significant energy shortages.\"The operator of the Oi plant, Kansai Electric Power (Kepco), had warned that the region would face a 15% electricity shortfall in July and August, and had urged consumers to make power savings.But the trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, warned against wastefulness, as it will take Kepco about six weeks to bring both reactors to full capacity. \"Safety is our main concern,\" he said. \"It will take some time for the reactors to begin generating electricity, and we request that people continue to save energy. If there are safety problems, the process could be delayed.\"The government did not require local approval, but Noda and a small team of ministers have spent weeks attempting to win support from residents amid widespread fears over safety and a loss of trust in the nuclear industry in the wake of the Fukushima accident.The Japanese public remains divided over nuclear power, more than a year after the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown sent radioactive materials into the atmosphere and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents.According to a nationwide poll by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper earlier this month, 71% of people cautioned against a rush to restart the Oi reactors, while 25% supported Noda's stance.Noda has vowed to lessen Japan's dependence on nuclear power and increase the role of renewables. Nuclear once provided about a third of Japan's electricity, but plans to increase that share to more than 50% with the construction of more reactors was scrapped after the Fukushima Daiichi meltdown.", "tags": ["Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Fukushima", "Environment", "World news"], "title": "Japan nuclear restart gets PM's approval"},{"date": "2012-06-08T10:57:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "In a smart and expensive neighbourhood of Tokyo, Toshiko Horikoshi relaxes by playing her grand piano.

Startlingly, in a country panicking over its plummeting birthrate, there are now many more pets than children. While the birthrate has been falling dramatically and the average age of Japan's population has been steadily climbing, Japan has become a pet superpower. Official estimates put the pet population at 22 million or more, but there are only 16.6 million children under 15.Tinkerbell and Ginger have their own room and a wardrobe full of designer clothes. They have jumpers, dresses, coats and fancy dress outfits, neatly hung on jewelled hangers; hats, sunglasses and even tiny shoes. Horikoshi says she shops for her dogs most weekends and they get new clothes each season.In Japan designer labels such as Chanel, Dior, Herm\u00e8s and Gucci offer luxury dog products.

His name means \"first-born son\". \"He's like a first baby for us, so that's why we decided to call him Kotaro,\" says Akiba. \"It's good to have a dog if you don't have a baby, because it is quite fun to take care of him like a baby.\"Akiba, a cameraman, would have liked children, but his partner (a freelance editor) wants to keep working. \"In Japanese society, it's really hard for women to have a baby and keep a job \u2026 so my girlfriend decided against having a baby, and that's why we have a dog instead.\" Akiba says he thinks this makes economic sense, given the cost of living in Tokyo, high taxes and static salaries following two decades of recession.Despite the economic stagnation, people seem happy to spend any spare money on photo sessions, massages and treats for their four-legged \"babies\". The average fertility rate is now 1.39 children per woman \u2013 well below the number needed to keep the population stable. Japan has, in effect, a self-imposed one-child policy. Government projections show if current trends continue, today's population of 128 million will fall to 43 million over the next century.\"The most important reason for Japan's declining birthrate is less sex,\" says Dr Kunio Kitamara, director of Japan's Family Planning Research Centre. His annual surveys indicate that the nation's libido has been lagging in the last decade.

His latest data from 2010 showed that 32% of young men dislike sex because \"they are afraid of failure and rejection by women.\" Sixty percent of women in their mid- to late 20s are single, and 70% of unmarried women don't have a boyfriend. In Japan marriage is still more or less a prerequisite for having children \u2013 only 2% of children are born outside wedlock.One young man we spoke to had dressed his dog up in a white hoodie and jeans, shoes and sunglasses because, he said, he wanted his dog to look \"cute, cool and tough\". His proud owner said he hoped his dog's look might attract young women, but so far he hadn't met anyone to share his life with. \"I wish I could meet someone like that,\" he said.Economic stagnation has hit young men particularly hard. More than 10 million people aged between 20 and 34 still live with their parents. They can't afford to get married and start a family, but for the odd luxury or treats for their dogs, they can \u2013 and do \u2013 splash out.Smart buggies and designer doggie bags are essential for any self-respecting dog like Kotaro. \"My dog really hates to go out with his feet,\" says Akiba. \"Kotaro doesn't like walking at all.\"For dogs in urgent need of exercise after a lifetime being pushed or carried around, there are spas and onsens (hot springs), which look identical to the ones for humans. For $100 (\u00a365) a session, an attendant in a wetsuit will give Kotaro one-to-one swimming lessons, relaxing bubble baths, body massages using aromatherapy oils, deep-pore cleansing and mud packs, and even flossing or manicure services. Many dogs are \"regulars\" who come at least once a week \u2013 running up annual bills of $5,000 (\u00a33,200) or more.In Tokyo, it is easier for Horikoshi to find a canine daycare centre for Tinkerbell and Ginger than it would be to find a nursery place for a child. If Akiba and his partner decide to go on holiday, they can pay $100 a night to leave Kotaro in a dog hotel.When the unthinkable happens, there are even temples where dead dogs are laid to rest with full Buddhist rites: a deluxe funeral and cremation ceremony can cost $8,000 (\u00a35,000) or more. \"I find these days people grieve more for their pets than for parents or grandparents,\" says a monk at a 1,000-year-old temple in a Tokyo suburb. \"It is because pets are just like their child, so it is like losing a child.\"Japan's population fell by a record number last year and in the wake of the earthquake and nuclear disasters, the National Institute of Population Research is expecting there to be a further decline in births this year, says deputy director Ryuichi Kaneko. \"We realised that we are living in dangerous times,\" he says. \"Many young people are even more hesitant to have children now.\"Akiba says that although the government has tried to encourage young couples to have babies, many of the incentives, such as child benefit, are too inconsistent and subject to frequent political change. Japan's population has the longest life expectancy in the world, which \u2013 coupled with the falling birth rate \u2013 means a pensions timebomb looms. \"We all \u2013 companies, the government, people young and old - need to think seriously about this problem,\" says Kaneko, \"or Japan will have a very hard time.\"One thing is certain: everything Japan has tried so far \u2013 introducing maternity leave, increasing child beneft, providing nursery places \u2013 has failed to arrest its demographic decline. Fresh thinking will be needed to persuade more Japanese people that in the long-term, man's best friend can be no substitute for man himself.\u2022 It's a Dog's Life is on BBC World Service on Saturday 9 June at 12.05pm BST.", "tags": ["Dogs", "Pets", "Family", "Life and style", "Japan", "Animals", "World news"], "title": "Why Japan prefers pets to parenthood"},{"date": "2012-05-05T11:35:36Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is shutting down its last working nuclear reactor as part of the safety drive imposed after the March 2011 tsunami triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima plant.The closure of the third reactor at the Tomari plant in Hokkaido prefecture, northern Japan, means all of the country's 50 nuclear reactors have been taken offline, leaving the country with no nuclear-derived electricity for the first time since 1970.Hokkaido Electric said it started lowering output from the reactor at 5pm (8am GMT). The unit should be shut down completely by the early hours of Sunday.Hundreds of people marched through Tokyo waving banners to celebrate what they hope will be the end of nuclear power in Japan.Until last year's earthquake and tsunami triggered radiation leaks at Tokyo Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, Japan was the world's third-biggest user of atomic energy.All the reactors have been shut down for routine maintenance. They must withstand tests against earthquakes and tsunamis, and local authorities must give their consent in order for plants to restart.The trade minister, Yukio Edano, and three other ministers have been trying to win public backing to restart two reactors taken offline at Kansai Electric Power's Ohi nuclear plant to help ease expected power shortages of nearly 20% in the summer. The reactors are the first to be considered for reactivation by the government, but it faces an uphill battle to win public support.The last time Japan had no nuclear power was for five days in May 1970, when the only two existing reactors were shut for maintenance, according to the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan.", "tags": ["Japan", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Energy", "Environment"], "title": "Japan shuts down last working nuclear reactor"},{"date": "2012-04-22T10:29:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Hundreds of particle physicists are descending once more on the sleepy village of Tokai-mura in Eastern Japan. Over the next week we will discuss the present and future of an experiment that many have devoted several years of their lives to. An experiment that will forge a path into a new era of understanding the creation of our Universe.The Tokai to Kamioka experiment (T2K for short) restarted last month, a year after the massive eastern Japanese earthquake shut it down after just months of operation. The experiment is once again firing an intense beam of neutrino particles 295km through the crust of the Earth from Tokai-mura to the Japanese alps in the West. In looking at the particles at the start of their journey and again at their final destination we are looking for neutrinos changing their sense of exactly what they are. The method of character change that neutrinos undergo is called oscillation and is well understood. The exact changes however must themselves be measured directly from Nature. Recently the Daya Bay experiment, and shortly after the RENO experiment, measured the final unknown. We now have a complete but blurry picture of how neutrinos behave. The T2K, Daya Bay, RENO and future experiments will bring different aspects of this picture into focus. Once a sharp image is in place then the fun really begins. Once we know how neutrinos behave we will start pitching neutrinos against their opposite number; their antimatter versions called antineutrinos. If we understand them well enough we can look for subtle differences between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. Any difference between any types of matter and antimatter are important because it was exactly differences like these that created the Universe in which we live.The very slight preference in Nature for matter over antimatter left a residue of matter. This residue was the raw material from which, over 13 billions years later, forms the entire visible Universe. T2K will forge the path in looking for this difference and it is in this week where we discuss how to start on this journey.Ben Still is a neutrino physicist at Queen Mary, University of London, and a member of the T2K collaboration.

Most residents of Okinawa want the base moved off their island altogether, but the government has failed to find a new host community.Up to 5,000 troops \u2013 about 3,000 fewer than envisaged in the original 2006 agreement \u2013 will be sent to Guam, according to a US defence official quoted by Associated Press in Washington. The remainder will move to Hawaii or rotate between Australia and other parts of the region.Kurt Campbell, the US assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, said the deal should satisfy congressional critics who had denounced the original plan as confused and expensive.\"We think it breaks a very long stalemate that has plagued our politics, that has clogged both of our systems,\" he said.", "tags": ["US military", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "US news"], "title": "US to move marines out of Japan"},{"date": "2012-06-08T09:49:40Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Political analysts have long warned that Japan has fallen prey to widespread popular discontent with the democratic process. But this week, the country succumbed to an outbreak of election fever focused on what, for many, was by far the most pressing issue of the day.Watched by millions on TV, the victors took to a stage in central Tokyo to deliver tearful acceptance speeches, as analysts offered interpretations of the vote's wider meaning.But this was not politics as usual. There was no place for greying, middle-aged men in dark suits - the candidates were dozens of teenagers and women in their early 20s, all vying for the title of president of the J-pop phenomenon AKB48.In a contest that has gripped Japan for weeks, Yuko Oshima \u2013 a relatively mature singer at the age of 23 \u2013 emerged as the most popular member of the band, whose sugar-coated refrains have rivalled their Korean counterparts for the affections of Asian pop fans.Japan's broadcasters spent weeks trailing the vote, culminating in three hours of live coverage from the Nippon Budokan venue in Tokyo on Wednesday night.Images of Oshima, who will lead the group for the next year, were plastered over the following day's newspapers and generated hours of analysis on daytime TV shows. Even the normally staid broadsheets recognised that her election, with 108,000 votes \u2013 putting her well ahead of her closest rival \u2013 was a significant moment in J-pop history.Likening herself to a flower bud about to come into full bloom, she told her fans: \"You have given me water and light. But flowers wither eventually. Please be my sunshine forever.\"Oshima and 15 other performers earned enough votes among the 1.4 million cast to guarantee them a place in the lineup for the group's 27th single, to be released in August. The group's 90 members appear in rotation depending on their popularity with the public.The marketing brilliance did not end there: the public could only secure votes by buying a copy of the group's latest single, a Japanese and English track about the joys of summer. Each copy came with a code number enabling consumers to cast their votes online.With the most devout snapping up multiple CDs to boost the prospects of their favourite singer, the single sold a record 1.62m copies in its first week. One fan reportedly spent US$6,700 to secure 2,700 votes in online auctions.Since their debut in 2005, AKB48 have built up a huge following among girls in Japan and, more recently, other parts of Asia, as well as salarymen who flock to concerts and publicity events for the chance to shake hands and exchange a few words with their idols.The group, named after the geeky Akihabara district of Tokyo, have had a succession of million-selling singles and generated sales of more than US$200m in CD and DVD sales last year alone. Members appear in commercials for everything from chocolate to mobile phones, and they were recently enlisted in campaigns to sell Japanese government bonds and prevent teenage suicides.Their performances owe more to a heightened sense of kawaii cuteness than overt sexuality, but AKB48 members courted controversy over a recent confectionary commercial that some conservative commentators deemed inappropriate. But neither that, nor the arrest of one singer's mother for allegedly having sex with a minor, has slowed the group's rise to J-pop's apex.Together, the 48 stable has more than 230 members comprising four main groups and several smaller offshoots. Just as K-pop has outgrown its South Korean roots, sister groups have emerged in Jakarta, Taipei and Shanghai.This week's election fever has been attributed to discontent with conventional elections, with one expert even drawing an improbable comparison with the Arab spring. Hidetomi Tanaka, a professor at Jobu University, offered a more prosaic explanation. \"These girls start from the amateur level with few singing and dancing skills,\" he told Reuters. \"But the thing is they grow up with their fans.\"While some heralded the election as a popular challenge to the authority of the AKB48 impresario Yasushi Akimoto, the vote left some fans feeling disillusioned. \"It's supposed to be a general election, but it's the people with money who determine the result,\" a 16-year-old high school pupil told the Asahi Shimbun. \"It's like shareholders who have a bigger say if they invest more. It's not a genuine election.\"", "tags": ["Japan", "Pop and rock", "Television", "Asia Pacific", "Music", "Culture", "World news"], "title": "Japan gripped by TV election of pop group AKB48"},{"date": "2012-05-10T11:48:03Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Harry Potter is heading off to Japan following the announcement that a new theme park attraction based on JK Rowling's famous boy wizard is to open at Universal Studios' Osaka site in 2014.This Japanese attraction will be the third of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme parks.

At stake is a slice of a book market estimated to be worth $23.5bn (\u00a315bn).Rakuten's chief executive, Hiroshi Mikitani, has made no secret of his desire to take on Amazon. During a recent e-book fair in Tokyo, the 49-year-old entrepreneur brandished a T-shirt bearing the message: \"Destroy Amazon.\"To do so, he has enlisted hitherto sceptical Japanese publishers who appear to have overcome their fear of dramatic falls in physical book sales once Japanese consumers have made the shift to digital.\"In the last two months their attitude has completely changed,\" Mikitani said. \"Before, they were sceptical or worried about the negative impact on their business.

I know they're a con; I know groceries last about 100 years longer than supermarkets pretend they do. I know throwing perfectly edible food away is an obscenity \u2013 doubly so if it's part of an animal that was butchered for your convenience. I know that. But it's still hard for me to ingest anything I even vaguely suspect might be \"on the turn\".Imagine my surprise, then, to find myself cheerfully shaving bits off a six-month-old chunk of desiccated tuna in order to make soup. Nevertheless, that's what happened to me in Kyoto.If you ever visit Japan, make room for a few days in Kyoto if at all possible. Tokyo can feel like a gigantic over-stimulating pachinko machine if you don't stick your head out for air now and then. Another advantage is that you can take the bullet train.Given its nickname, I'd expected my journey on the high-speed Tokyo-Kyoto Shinkansen service to feel like some kind of terrifying vertical freefall; to be pinned to my seat by the G-force, my cheeks shearing backwards and flapping behind me like the ears of a basset hound fired from a cannon. The reality is almost underwhelmingly sedate. The train is as quiet as it is fast \u2013 so there's no rickety clatter \u2013 and for the majority of the journey the track is raised above ground level, which means you don't see trees whipping past the window, increasing the illusion of speed. What I'm saying is a Virgin Train to Birmingham New Street actually packs more of a thrill. Where the Shinkansen wins is on sheer gliding efficiency. It's like travelling on Valium, and I mean that in a good way.Once you're clear of the boxy downtown area, Kyoto coughs up picture-postcard back streets and around 2,000 ancient shrines and temples: the cherry-blossom Japan of your imagination. But I hadn't come just for the sights. I was here for a cookery lesson. This is a tourist \"experience\" offered by the Women's Association of Kyoto: the lessons take place in the real homes of real housewives with real arms and legs and everything, in real Japan. The Japanese rarely invite strangers into their homes. In fact, they rarely invite anyone into their homes \u2013 it's an honour chiefly reserved for close friends. What, exactly, are they hiding? We were going to find out.First we had to shop for ingredients. This meant a guided tour of Nishiki market, a narrow covered parade of stalls and shops selling fresh produce and local delicacies, the majority of which are visually incomprehensible to the untrained western eye. And by \"untrained western eye\", I mean me. I didn't have a clue what I was looking at, but almost everything seemed to fall into one of two categories: mouth-watering or menacing. There were baffling vegetables that looked like the kind of thing Captain James T Kirk might negotiate with over a long-range scanner. There were pickled objects of unfathomable origin. There were mahogany-brown smoked eggs. And there was katsuobushi, which is the only thing I've mentioned so far that you may well have already eaten, probably without having the faintest idea what it actually is.It won't help if I explain that katsuobushi looks and feels like a piece of ancient water-worn timber, like a chunk of Tudor warship slowly rendered pebble-smooth by centuries of undersea friction. But it isn't. It's a fish.Specifically, it's a skipjack tuna that has been filleted, smoked for the best part of a month, placed in a humid environment until it develops a fine layer of mould, taken out and dried, put back in the humidifier for more mould-growing, dried again, re-humidified, and so on, until eventually it's declared ready. In summary: it's a dry, mouldy fish that has been sitting around for months. And like I say, you've probably eaten it \u2013 in some form \u2013 if you've ever had miso soup. Because when you grate katsuobushi, the resultant shavings are known as bonito flakes, which \u2013 bursting with distinctive umami flavour \u2013 are one of the primary ingredients in the stock that forms the bulk of every bowl of miso soup you've ever slurped. Most miso soup is made with instant dashi these days, but still: desiccated mould-encrusted tuna. That's the source. Sorry to break that to you. Especially if you're a vegetarian.On the plus side, bonito flakes smell delicious, as I discovered during the eventual cookery lesson, in a small house on the outskirts of Kyoto. And what was the mysterious forbidden interior of a Japanese home like? Tatami flooring? Low tables? Fragile origami furniture? No. Nothing to hide. In fact it seemed virtually identical to a British home. Our friendly hostess, Kiyoko Obase, even had an apron with the London tube map on it and a newspaper article about The King's Speech pinned to the fridge. And it was raining outside, thereby completing the impression that we could have been in Dudley. The scent of the food we made was the giveaway.As well as fresh miso soup, we made rolled sushi, with a side dish of horenso no goma-ae (that's spinach with sesame dressing to you). I ate a lot of unfamiliar things in Japan \u2013 raw prawns, raw chicken, raw God-knows-what \u2013 but in a way this meal was the most startling. Despite being straightforward stuff \u2013 the most complex element, the rolled sushi, was surprisingly simple to make \u2013 it was powerfully satisfying, partly due to the glow of DIY achievement, but also because it was the first time Japanese food struck me as comfort food. And as home cooking, to be prepared and eaten at home. Albeit someone else's home. On the other side of the planet.\u2022 The trip was provided by Inside Japan (0117-370 9764, insidejapantours.com). A nine-night self-guided Cooking on the Golden Route tour, including B&B accommodation in Tokyo, Hakone and Kyoto, two evening meals, transport between destinations including rail passes, airport transfers, a day trip to Osaka, shopping and cooking class in Kyoto, and private guiding in Tokyo and Kyoto, costs \u00a31,749pp; with upgrades to the Hyatt Regency Kyoto (kyoto.regency.hyatt.com) and Hoshinoya Kyoto (global.hoshinoresort.com) it costs \u00a32,249. Flights from Heathrow to Tokyo were provided by Virgin Atlantic (0844 2092 770, virgin-atlantic.com) and cost from around \u00a3655 return. Further information: seejapan.co.ukThis northern region is famous for its abundant snowfall, and powderhound-friendly ski resorts. Intrepid off-pisters can book a day's back country ski tour to combine snow-shoeing, powder skiing and wildlife spotting (\u00a3145pp, welovesnow.com). The ski season is between November and May, but the resort is beautiful in summer too. Fly from Tokyo to Sapporo with Jetstar for around \u00a340. Niseko's ski-in ski-out Greenleaf Hotel (thegreenleafhotel.com) has doubles from \u00a3280. Lift-passes cost around \u00a330pp a day.Many travellers have become familiar with Tokyo's bizarre cat cafes and maid cafes, but the latest development in the city's zany cafe culture is Ra.a.g.f. Cafe (raagf.com) in Megami street in the Jiyugaoka area, where animal-loving locals meet to enjoy a drink while playing with the resident cute rabbits. Art lovers looking for some time away from the frenzied pace of the city should visit Naoshima island in the Inland Sea. The island is entirely dedicated to art, with two main museums, quirky art projects and both indoor and outdoor pieces wherever you look. It takes about five hours to get here from Tokyo \u2013 bullet train to Okayama, then a 45 minute train and 20 minute ferry to Naoshima. Rooms at the gorgeous English-speaking Hotel Benesse (benesse-artsite.jp), which is both a hotel and a museum, from around \u00a3280. The city combines urbanism, technology and modernity with beautiful old landmarks such as Osaka Castle (osakacastle.net), built in 1583, and now ultramodern on the inside after being revamped several times due to war, lightning and age. During cherry blossom season, from March to May, travellers can join Japanese groups who sit in the parks to watch then spectacle, then dine in Dotonbori, a street full of great restaurants serving local delicacies such as takoyaki (fried octopus balls). Those feeling brave can try the fugu fish \u2013 delicious, but fatal if not prepared correctly.

In return, the LDP would have to vote for plans to shrink the number of seats in the lower house and address the disparity in the weight of rural and urban votes.\"We have to achieve that as soon as possible,\" Noda said. \"We must make a decision and set a deadline. Let's do it.\"In reply, Abe said: \"Is that a promise? You're sure, right? Absolutely sure?\" adding, \"We'll let the people decide which of us is more qualified to lead the country out of deflation and get the economy back on track.\"Noda's Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) has a comfortable majority in the lower house but depends on other parties to push legislation through the upper house.That arrangement has resulted in political deadlock, just as Japan's economy risks slipping back into recession and while the country attempts to repair relations with China in its dispute over the Senkaku islands .Speculation over the election date has swirled around since the summer, adding to a lengthy period of political instability in which six prime ministers have been installed since Junichiro Koizumi's resignation in September 2006. Noda, who became leader last September, is the third DPJ prime minister since 2009.\"There's a real failure of leadership,\" Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo, told Associated Press. \"That's in part because Japan's expectations for leadership are unrealistic. But also because the quality of leadership in Japan is really low.\"Noda's decision was greeted with dismay by many DPJ lawmakers who had urged him to wait until the party's fortunes had improved.

Rising Chinese military power, a historic multilateral dispute involving at least six sovereign nations, potentially vast oil and gas reserves, and the busiest shipping lanes in the world are all combining to form one large low-pressure centre. So the election of a Japanese prime minister on a ticket of getting tough in the territorial dispute might appear to be a further cause for concern.China's Xinhua agency lost no time in seeking to extract gain from Japan's lurch to the right. It reminded its neighbour of its second world war record and its ability to upset the status quo once more. This is grossly unfair to a modern-day Japan that, under left or rightwing control, has eschewed militarism to the point of exasperating its western allies. But this is not to say that Tokyo is immune from populist lures. If the Liberal Democratic party went ahead with a pledge to build on a group of islands it knows as the Senkakus but which China calls the Diaoyu, it would mark an unnecessary escalation. Japan's sovereignty over this group of rocks is longstanding, and China's renewed claim to them is by comparison recent, although this too is disputed. But as neither side has done anything to assert their rival claims, an uneasy peace, broken only by fishing squalls, has prevailed.It is often forgotten that a third power is involved in the dispute \u2013 Taiwan. This is the land to which the islands are closest and with which they are geologically linked. Japan's relationship with Taiwan has none of the prickliness of its relations with the Chinese mainland.

This is the best solution but, being reasonable and internationalist, it is one that could all too easily get drowned out. Japan's purchase of the islands from their private owners was an attempt to stop nationalists from staging provocative acts. But that in turn provoked waves of attacks on Japanese businesses in China.It would not be the first time that an incoming prime minister abandons an election pledge but that is what Shinzo Abe should now do. China is Japan's biggest trading partner, and, if he wants to last longer than he did the first time he was premier, Mr Abe should play the long game.

But the lion's share of skiing in Japan goes on at local hangouts where, although the slopes aren't always steep, the runs are cheap and it's possible, if you time it right, to find your own personal powder hill.The Japanese did to ski resorts what they did to cars, cameras and computers: miniaturised them. During Japan's postwar boom, the new middle-class wealth fuelled a ski craze and developers began cutting down trees and putting up ski lifts anywhere they thought they could. Which in Japan is almost everywhere \u2013 three-quarters of the country is mountainous and it is blessed with some of the most reliable and heavy snowfall in the world. Even the smallest hills, some just a few hundred metres above sea level, can offer skiing come winter.Hundreds of these micro ski areas sprang up all over the country, from the sub-arctic island of Hokkaido all the way down to the subtropical island of Kyushu. Many were family-run, and often consisted of little more than a one-man chairlift, a gentle 200m slope and a shed selling tickets. Yet such was the thirst for snowsport that these micro resorts were inundated with eager skiers.Long queues and short runs were a common complaint, but times have changed. The runs haven't grown any longer, but the queues are much shorter. In fact, in many of Japan's micro resorts, the crowds have disappeared altogether. When Japan's economy faltered in the early 1990s, the ski industry suffered. While the largest ski areas found a new market with western skiers, Japan's smallest resorts began to struggle.Micro resorts are basic, but have everything you need for a day on the slopes: a rental shop and restaurant at the base serving no-frills hot meals, such as yakisoba or katsu curry along with snacks and bottled beer. Most don't have bars on site, so apr\u00e8s-ski tends to take place in nearby towns, at izikayas (where food is served) or in cosy bars. Local sushi-ya (sushi bars) are also worth visiting \u2013 sit up at the bar and watch the \"sushi samurai\" dice hunks of tuna and octopus and serve it to you with a big ball of wasabi paste and a dish of soy. Wash it all down with a glass of local nihonshu \u2013 rice wine. And if you want to relax after your day on the slopes, take a dip in an onsen \u2013 a\u00a0traditional hot bath, which can be found at or near many resorts. Be sure to strip naked and thoroughly wash yourself before entering the steaming waters.Many micro resorts offer floodlit skiing, or \"night game\" as it's known locally, from around 6pm to 10pm. With famously long working hours, weekday evenings are a popular time to get to the slopes. On my first night at the tiny ski area of Kadohara in Fukui prefecture, I felt like an Arctic explorer as I excitedly braved the storm when few others dared leave their homes. The slopes were bathed in the sodium glow of floodlights, and muffled Japanese J-pop floated from the ski area's PA system.I asked the young lift attendant where everyone was, but he just shrugged. So I clambered aboard the rickety two-man lift which rumbled to the top through ever-falling flakes. As I stepped off and sat down to strap on my board, I saw that not a\u00a0single track was marked on the slope before me. The snow was completely untouched; the entire mountain was mine. I set off through the deep snow, my board hissing as it glided over the surface, parting the crystals and spurting smoky waves of snow into the air as I made big, slow turns in the pillow-soft powder.While it's a dream come true to have an entire ski area to yourself, it's obviously bad for business, and the future of many micro resorts is uncertain. They were always local hills for local people. Many of the smallest have gone out of business; two I used to frequent have recently closed their doors for good. But hundreds still survive, and if you want to experience skiing like a true local, with no crowds, no queues and no frills, then try a visit to a Japanese micro resort. There are hundreds to choose from and you are rarely far from a ski area. While they are not generally places you would spend more than a day, it's easy to sample several over a few days which makes for an epic road trip.Rokuroshi Kogen, Fukui During the Second World war, Rokuroshi was used as a POW camp, now there is a small terrain park with wide pistes and empty areas.

Yet such was the thirst for snowsport that these micro resorts were inundated with eager skiers.Long queues and short runs were a common complaint, but times have changed. The runs haven't grown any longer, but the queues are much shorter. In fact, in many of Japan's micro resorts, the crowds have disappeared altogether. When Japan's economy faltered in the early 1990s, the ski industry suffered. While the largest ski areas found a new market with western skiers, Japan's smallest resorts began to struggle.Micro resorts are basic, but have everything you need for a day on the slopes: a rental shop and restaurant at the base serving no-frills hot meals, such as yakisoba or katsu curry along with snacks and bottled beer. Most don't have bars on site, so apr\u00e8s-ski tends to take place in nearby towns, at izikayas (where food is served) or in cosy bars. Local sushi-ya (sushi bars) are also worth visiting \u2013 sit up at the bar and watch the \"sushi samurai\" dice hunks of tuna and octopus and serve it to you with a big ball of wasabi paste and a dish of soy. Wash it all down with a glass of local nihonshu \u2013 rice wine. And if you want to relax after your day on the slopes, take a dip in an onsen \u2013 a\u00a0traditional hot bath, which can be found at or near many resorts. Be sure to strip naked and thoroughly wash yourself before entering the steaming waters.Many micro resorts offer floodlit skiing, or \"night game\" as it's known locally, from around 6pm to 10pm. With famously long working hours, weekday evenings are a popular time to get to the slopes. On my first night at the tiny ski area of Kadohara in Fukui prefecture, I felt like an Arctic explorer as I excitedly braved the storm when few others dared leave their homes. The slopes were bathed in the sodium glow of floodlights, and muffled Japanese J-pop floated from the ski area's PA system.I asked the young lift attendant where everyone was, but he just shrugged. So I clambered aboard the rickety two-man lift which rumbled to the top through ever-falling flakes. As I stepped off and sat down to strap on my board, I saw that not a\u00a0single track was marked on the slope before me. The snow was completely untouched; the entire mountain was mine. I set off through the deep snow, my board hissing as it glided over the surface, parting the crystals and spurting smoky waves of snow into the air as I made big, slow turns in the pillow-soft powder.While it's a dream come true to have an entire ski area to yourself, it's obviously bad for business, and the future of many micro resorts is uncertain. They were always local hills for local people. Many of the smallest have gone out of business; two I used to frequent have recently closed their doors for good. But hundreds still survive, and if you want to experience skiing like a true local, with no crowds, no queues and no frills, then try a visit to a Japanese micro resort. There are hundreds to choose from and you are rarely far from a ski area. While they are not generally places you would spend more than a day, it's easy to sample several over a few days which makes for an epic road trip.Rokuroshi Kogen, Fukui During the Second World war, Rokuroshi was used as a POW camp, now there is a small terrain park with wide pistes and empty areas.

It was, however, a chilling reminder of the 9.0 quake that struck the area in March 2011, triggering a tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people and a triple meltdown at the nearby Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Initially, the appearance on TV screens of a tsunami warning, and repeated announcements to remember last year's tragedy and flee the coast, prompted fears of a second disaster in less than two years in the worst-affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima.Less than an hour later, a tsunami washed ashore in Ishinomaki, one of the hardest-hit towns in last year's tragedy, where the rebuilding process has barely begun. Mercifully, this time the wave was just a metre high. Two hours after the quake struck 150 miles offshore at 5:18pm local time, the meteorological agency cancelled its tsunami warning.Narita airport closed briefly for safety checks and phone lines were temporarily jammed by the large volume of calls. Several, much smaller, tsunamis lashed other parts of the coast, including Soma city, which lies just outside the 12-mile (20km) evacuation zone imposed around the Fukushima plant.On Friday, as on 11 March 2011, the earthquake appeared to have cause minimal damage \u2013 testimony to the unrivalled ability of specially designed Japanese buildings to withstand violent seismic activity that could potentially kill thousands in many other countries.Buildings swayed for several minutes as far away as Tokyo; nearer the epicentre, where coastal towns and villages are largely deserted swaths of flattened land, people fled to higher ground. For all the relief that catastrophe had been diverted, Friday's earthquake would have added to the anxieties of the 325,000 people in the region still living in temporary accommodation.\"I was in the centre of the city the very moment the earthquake struck,\" Chikako Iwai, a resident of Ishinomaki, told Reuters. \"I immediately jumped into the car and started running towards the mountains. I'm still hiding inside the car. I have the radio on and they say the cars are still stuck in the traffic. I'm planning to stay here for the next couple of hours.\"Thoughts quickly turned to the Fukushima plant, declared stable by authorities a year ago but where workers have yet to begin the dangerous task of removing molten fuel from damaged reactors and the long, costly process of decommissioning.The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, said workers had been ordered to shelter inside buildings around the plant, but added that there was no sign of damage or radiation leaks.Police reported that five people had been injured, including a 75-year-old woman who fell while heading for higher ground.Thanks to Japan's warning system, people in the area had up to six minutes to take precautions between the first estimate of the quake's intensity and the moment it struck.The earthquake measured a lower five in Miyagi prefecture on Japan's scale of one to seven, which measures the amount of shaking a quake causes rather than its intensity.Earthquakes of that strength can damage older buildings and roads, which do not have the strict quake-resistant features introduced after more than 6,000 people died in an earthquake in Kobe, in January 1995.", "tags": ["Japan", "Earthquakes", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Fukushima", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "title": "Japan earthquake and tsunami triggers Fukushima fears"},{"date": "2012-12-17T20:33:01Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The dispute over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea and the extent of Beijing's claims in the South China Sea are, by common consent, typhoons gathering off shore. Rising Chinese military power, a historic multilateral dispute involving at least six sovereign nations, potentially vast oil and gas reserves, and the busiest shipping lanes in the world are all combining to form one large low-pressure centre. So the election of a Japanese prime minister on a ticket of getting tough in the territorial dispute might appear to be a further cause for concern.China's Xinhua agency lost no time in seeking to extract gain from Japan's lurch to the right. It reminded its neighbour of its second world war record and its ability to upset the status quo once more. This is grossly unfair to a modern-day Japan that, under left or rightwing control, has eschewed militarism to the point of exasperating its western allies. But this is not to say that Tokyo is immune from populist lures. If the Liberal Democratic party went ahead with a pledge to build on a group of islands it knows as the Senkakus but which China calls the Diaoyu, it would mark an unnecessary escalation. Japan's sovereignty over this group of rocks is longstanding, and China's renewed claim to them is by comparison recent, although this too is disputed. But as neither side has done anything to assert their rival claims, an uneasy peace, broken only by fishing squalls, has prevailed.It is often forgotten that a third power is involved in the dispute \u2013 Taiwan. This is the land to which the islands are closest and with which they are geologically linked. Japan's relationship with Taiwan has none of the prickliness of its relations with the Chinese mainland. Taiwan's re-elected President Ma Ying-jeou recently proposed an initiative to shelve the sovereignty dispute and jointly develop the resources that lie around and below the islands. This is the best solution but, being reasonable and internationalist, it is one that could all too easily get drowned out. Japan's purchase of the islands from their private owners was an attempt to stop nationalists from staging provocative acts. But that in turn provoked waves of attacks on Japanese businesses in China.It would not be the first time that an incoming prime minister abandons an election pledge but that is what Shinzo Abe should now do. China is Japan's biggest trading partner, and, if he wants to last longer than he did the first time he was premier, Mr Abe should play the long game. That means not upsetting the status quo whereby Japanese sovereignty is maintained by nothing more threatening than coastguard vessels.

Analysts expect the country to stay in recession in the final quarter of the year, ratcheting up the pressure on the government to take steps to boost the economy in the runup to the general election on 16 December.Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute in Tokyo, said: \"There have been some positive indicators out in October but there is still a good chance that Japan's economy will suffer another contraction in the October-December quarter.\"The eurozone crisis, a strong yen that has weakened exports and a diplomatic row with major trade partner China have harmed Japan's economy, dampening hopes of a strong recovery after the 2011 tsunami.Last month, Tokyo approved $10.7bn (\u00a36.67bn) of spending to boost the economy, more than double a package announced in October. But polls suggest it will not be enough for the prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, and his Democratic party to avoid defeat at the elections on 16 December. Japan's main opposition party has promised to spend heavily on public works and push the Bank of Japan to launch measures to boost growth if it wins. Recent polls suggest the party will win a solid majority and return to power for the first time since 2009.The deputy governor of the Bank of Japan said last week that the central bank will debate whether further stimulus is needed to support the economy, the strongest signal yet that it may loosen policy again at its next rate review on 19-20 December in the face of growing political pressure.", "tags": ["Japan", "Global recession", "Economics", "Global economy", "Business", "Asia Pacific", "Yen", "World news"], "title": "Japan falls into recession"},{"date": "2012-12-03T04:23:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Nine people have been found dead inside a motorway tunnel near Tokyo that collapsed and caught fire on Sunday morning (video), police said, as officials attempted to establish the cause of the accident.The victims include three men and two women, all in their 20s, who were travelling in the same vehicle, Japanese media said. A woman who had been travelling with the group when the accident occurred managed to escape and was being treated for minor injuries.Police said the bodies of a man and two women had been found in a second vehicle, while the ninth victim was confirmed as Tatsuya Nakagawa, a 50-year-old lorry driver who had called his company asking for help after the tunnel's ceiling collapsed.Reports said as many as 150 concrete slabs, each weighing 1.2 tonnes, had crashed to the ground along a 110-metre-long stretch of the Tokyo-bound lane inside the tunnel, which connects Tokyo with central Japan.Firefighters discovered five bodies inside a white van after battling through thick smoke on Sunday afternoon. The rescue operation was halted temporarily amid fears of another collapse.Police said they did not know what had caused the section of the 2.5-mile tunnel, located along a busy stretch of the Chuo expressway about 50 miles west of Tokyo, to cave in.Motorway officials believe that one of the metal rods used to secure the concrete panels to the tunnel's inner walls may have become loose, triggering a chain reaction that rained concrete onto the vehicles below.Another theory is that the structure may have been weakened by a 4.9 earthquake that shook the Tokyo area on 24 November, or by a landslide inside the mountain through which the tunnel passes. The motorway's operator said a routine safety check conducted as recently as October had not revealed any structural faults.Closed circuit TV footage showed rescue workers attempting to remove large chunks of concrete in a frantic effort to reach vehicles trapped beneath. More than a dozen fire engines were lined up outside both entrances to the tunnel, while fleets of ambulances waited to treat the injured.People who were able to drive or walk out of the tunnel said panicked motorists had started driving the wrong way down the motorway after the collapse began; others said they heard people trapped beneath the concrete calling out for help.\"While I was driving through the tunnel, concrete pieces suddenly started falling from the ceiling,\" one man told public broadcaster NHK. \"I saw a crushed car catch fire. I was scared, so I left my car and walked for about an hour to get out of the tunnel.\"Earlier, firefighters had struggled to reach the scene of the accident \u2013 about a mile inside the tunnel \u2013 because falling concrete had ignited petrol leaking from trapped cars, sparking a blaze that sent thick black smoke billowing from the tunnel entrance.Another survivor told TV Asahi he had witnessed the cave-in before calling police, who told him to flee. \"A few seconds later and my car would have been right in the middle of it,\" he said.Yoshio Goto, an NHK reporter who was driving through the tunnel when the roof began to cave in, said he had put his foot on the accelerator as soon as he felt pieces of concrete falling on to the roof of his car. \"I was a bit too late and pieces of the roof fell on my car,\" Goto said. \"I kept pressing the pedal and managed to get out. Then, when I looked around, I saw that half of the top of my car had been crushed.\"It is not clear if emergency workers expect to find more bodies beneath the rubble. Officials had initially said seven people were feared missing inside the tunnel, which opened to traffic in 1977.The accident, on one of Japan's busiest motorways, will inevitably raise questions about the safety of the country's large network of tunnels \u2013 motorists' quickest route through its mountainous topography.Sunday's accident was the worst of its kind since 1996, when a tunnel in northern Japan collapsed and falling rocks crushed cars and a bus, killing 20 people.", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Japan tunnel collapse kills nine"},{"date": "2012-11-14T14:24:33Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda is poised to call a general election for next month, in a move that could see his party thrown out of office just three years after it was elected by a landslide.Noda, who is expected to dissolve the lower house of parliament by the end of the week, agreed to an early election in return for opposition support for electoral reform and an urgent budget-financing bill.After months of speculation, he is also making good on a promise to go to the polls early in exchange for opposition support this summer for a rise in the sales tax.In a heated exchange on Wednesday, Noda told Shinzo Abe, leader of the main opposition Liberal Democratic party (LDP), he would call an election for 16 December. In return, the LDP would have to vote for plans to shrink the number of seats in the lower house and address the disparity in the weight of rural and urban votes.\"We have to achieve that as soon as possible,\" Noda said. \"We must make a decision and set a deadline. Let's do it.\"In reply, Abe said: \"Is that a promise? You're sure, right? Absolutely sure?\" adding, \"We'll let the people decide which of us is more qualified to lead the country out of deflation and get the economy back on track.\"Noda's Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) has a comfortable majority in the lower house but depends on other parties to push legislation through the upper house.That arrangement has resulted in political deadlock, just as Japan's economy risks slipping back into recession and while the country attempts to repair relations with China in its dispute over the Senkaku islands .Speculation over the election date has swirled around since the summer, adding to a lengthy period of political instability in which six prime ministers have been installed since Junichiro Koizumi's resignation in September 2006. Noda, who became leader last September, is the third DPJ prime minister since 2009.\"There's a real failure of leadership,\" Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo, told Associated Press. \"That's in part because Japan's expectations for leadership are unrealistic. But also because the quality of leadership in Japan is really low.\"Noda's decision was greeted with dismay by many DPJ lawmakers who had urged him to wait until the party's fortunes had improved. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun released this week showed support for the Noda cabinet at just 18%; Abe, meanwhile, is the most popular choice as leader.Abe has said he would take a tougher stance against China over territorial disputes, and suggested he would revise a 1995 statement issued by the then socialist prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, apologising for Japan's wartime conduct. He also wants to revise the constitution to give Japan's military a bigger role.But Abe and his party's traditional ally, New Komeito, could fall short of an overall majority. That could open the door to a coalition involving smaller parties on the right led by the former governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, and the mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto.Ishihara, who launched the party of the Sun on Tuesday, has been discussing a possible election alliance with Hashimoto's Japan Restoration party.\"The most prevalent view among the public is that this country will sink if things remain as they are,\" Ishihara told reporters.", "tags": ["Japan", "Yoshihiko Noda", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Japan set for December elections"},{"date": "2012-12-16T00:05:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan boasts some 600 ski resorts and the top sites, such as Niseko, are now well known to an international client\u00e8le.

I'm planning to stay here for the next couple of hours.\"Thoughts quickly turned to the Fukushima plant, declared stable by authorities a year ago but where workers have yet to begin the dangerous task of removing molten fuel from damaged reactors and the long, costly process of decommissioning.The plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power, said workers had been ordered to shelter inside buildings around the plant, but added that there was no sign of damage or radiation leaks.Police reported that five people had been injured, including a 75-year-old woman who fell while heading for higher ground.Thanks to Japan's warning system, people in the area had up to six minutes to take precautions between the first estimate of the quake's intensity and the moment it struck.The earthquake measured a lower five in Miyagi prefecture on Japan's scale of one to seven, which measures the amount of shaking a quake causes rather than its intensity.Earthquakes of that strength can damage older buildings and roads, which do not have the strict quake-resistant features introduced after more than 6,000 people died in an earthquake in Kobe, in January 1995.", "tags": ["Japan", "Earthquakes", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Fukushima", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "title": "Japan earthquake and tsunami triggers Fukushima fears"},{"date": "2012-11-30T08:17:05Z", "country": "japan", "content": "More Japanese people support their country's whaling expeditions than oppose them, despite the unpopularity of whale meat, according to a survey released just before the whaling fleet is expected to sail to the Antarctic for this year's hunt.The survey for the International Fund for Animal Welfare found that 26.8% of people agreed with Japan's slaughter of about 900 whales each winter in the name of scientific research, 18.5% opposed the hunts, and the rest were undecided.The fund said 88.8% of those polled had not bought whale meat in the past 12 months.\"The people of Japan are taking whale meat off the menu,\" said Patrick Ramage, director of the fund's global whale programme. \"This is great news for whales and one of the clearest signals yet that the whaling industry is in its death throes.\"The fund attempted to put a positive spin on the results, even though they showed opposition to whaling in Japan was far from widespread. \"As this new, nationwide survey clearly shows, Japan fisheries agency bureaucrats' claims of public support for whaling are as wrong and outdated as the practice they seek to defend,\" Ramage said. \"The next government of Japan should join its people in supporting responsible whale watching, a better use of whales that benefits coastal communities.\"Speculation that the industry's poor financial situation would lead to a cancellation of this year's hunt weakened after the agriculture minister, Akira Gunji, said it would go ahead as planned. Japan \"would like to go ahead with it with the same schedule\", Gunji said.He refused to comment on the precise timing amid fears the fleet will again be harassed by the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd. The fleet usually leaves Japan in early December.Sea Shepherd said it hoped to head off the whalers before they reached the Southern Ocean. The group has committed four vessels and more than 100 crew to the campaign, including its founder, Paul Watson, who is on an Interpol wanted list in connection with a shark-finning incident in 2002.\"The plan is for our fleet to meet the whaling fleet in the north Pacific off Japan,\" said Peter Hammarstedt, skipper of one of the vessels. \"We are planning to take the battle pretty much up to Japan itself.\"Commercial whaling was banned by the International Whaling Commission in 1986, but a clause in the moratorium allows Japan to kill more than 900 whales, mainly minke, every winter for \"research\" and to sell their meat on the open market.This March the Antarctic whaling fleet returned to port with just 30% of its planned haul. The fisheries agency blamed the poor catch on bad weather and \"sabotage\" by Sea Shepherd, which has confronted the whalers every year since 2005.Declining consumer interest has created a huge stockpile of unsold produce that, campaigners say, proves the industry is in terminal decline. Three-quarters of meat from whales caught in the north-west Pacific last summer went unsold, according to a report this year by Junko Sakuma, a freelance journalist.Sakuma said the body responsible for selling meat from Japan's whaling programme had failed to shift 908 tonnes of the 1,211-tonne catch, despite holding 13 public auctions since October 2011.The Institute of Cetacean Research, a quasi-governmental body that oversees the hunts, had hoped to use sales from the meat to cover the costs of the whaling fleet's expeditions, she said.\"The market for whale meat has all but disappeared,\" said Junichi Sato, executive director of Greenpeace Japan. \"Every year this industry sinks further into unmanageable debt and the mountain of whale meat in frozen storage increases.\"According to Greenpeace Japan, the country's whaling industry receives 800m yen (\u00a36m) in government subsidies a year, but is saddled with debts totalling about 1.9bn yen (\u00a314m).In an attempt to reduce the stockpile and secure funding for the hunts, Japan's fisheries agency will start selling whale meat directly to individuals and restaurants from next year, the Mainichi Shimbun reported, adding that the quantity of meat provided for school lunches would double from the current 100 tonnes a year. Until now, meat from the scientific hunts has been sold only to a small group of traders.New Zealand has joined Australia in attempting to block Japan's whaling expeditions in the Antarctic following the failure of diplomatic efforts.

But in fact the UK has much in common with the Japanese, another island race. Respect flows both ways in business.Business reports from Japan tend to focus heavily on the negative. The country's \"lost decades\" of economic decline, which began in the early 1990s, are often referred to. More recently, the earthquakes of 2011, and their effect on the country's nuclear energy infrastructure, added fear to a tale of decline. But entrepreneurs looking to enter this huge and profitable market would be best advised not to dwell upon such issues. For Japan is still the world's third largest economy and a big importer. It has a population of 128 million people, high living standards and a taste for British goods and brands. Therefore, for exporters of premium and quality goods it can be an excellent place to do business.FormalitiesJapan's business culture is very formalised and subject to many protocols. It's easy for an outsider unaware of the appropriate etiquette to cause offence accidentally. Gaining advice in advance is a sensible precaution. Greg McCray is the chief executive of Acal Energy, a hydrogen fuel cell company based in Cheshire, which is expanding into Japan. McCray also spent over a decade trading with Japan at a previous company and has learned much about doing business there. \"Japanese businesses are very formal, you don't walk in and start telling jokes. You wear a suit and tie, follow protocol and respect the hierarchy of the business,\" he says.RelationshipsJapanese businesses like to get to know their partners well. In the past, the keiretsu system \u2013 which referred to the tight-knit relationship between connected companies \u2013 dominated the economy. This is not so much the case any more, but its legacy continues. \"Relationships are important in any business, but none more so than in Japan,\" advises McCray. Entrepreneurs will need to spend a lot of time getting to know their buyers and partners, who will ask many questions, far more than is usually the case between British companies. Introductions should be considered as a compliment and a vital first step to making a deal. Nonetheless, the pace of agreeing and signing a contract can be slow.ConsensusSeniority is an important part of Japanese culture and this is particuarly true in business. The head of the company must be treated with respect. But while Japanese businesses are hierarchical, they also like to operate with the approval of the majority. Nick Hines is the chief executive of the Institute of Diplomacy and Business, which advises companies on trading overseas. He says Japanese businesses combine a mixture of hierarchical leadership with consensus. \"Japanese businesses are hierarchal by nature, but there is also culture of consensus which can involve many people,\" he says. Therefore, it is important for entrepreneurs to pay the boss his dues, but then to wait while he convinces his own people.PolitenessRather like the British, the Japanese place a lot of value on politeness. During discussions with trading partners, they are especially keen not to offend the other party. The concept of \"loss of face\" is important to understand. Rather than saying 'No', the Japanese are more likely to say something would be 'difficult'. While they are happy to tell you what they like, they also tend to avoid outright criticism.Entrepreneurs have been known to fail spectacularly in Japan by inadvertently causing offence. Here's a few faux pas to be aware of:1. Business cardsReceiving and giving business cards is taken very seriously, so don't just stick them in your pocket or drop them on the table. Ensure you take time to look at them and thank the provider.2. Nose blowingPeople from Japan are particularly sensitive about nasal discharge. Nose blowing in the boardroom could cause outright revulsion. The habit of putting a used tissue back in your pocket is also beyond the pale for the Japanese. If you have a cold, then cancel the meeting.3. Yes and NoThe polite Japanese often say \"yes\" but rarely \"no\". So don't mistake politeness for a confirmation of an order and understand that the worst thing they can say really is \"no\".4. Closing the dealPressure selling is not appreciated, so allow the Japanese to take their time. However, once a deal is made, it can last for years, if not decades.5. Loss of faceAlways show your contact true respect, avoid causing embarrassment and never go behind their back even when progress in negotiations is slow. Causing loss of face can poison relations indefinitely.Hannah Beaumont founded organic clothing company Beaumont Organic in 2008 at the age of 24. She began trading with Japan the following year. Sales to Japan now represent around 50% of its revenues.\"We won best textile product at the National Organic Awards and gained a lot of press attention. A Japanese buyer who was in the country at the time contacted us and wanted to sell our products,\" Beaumont says.After the products had been tried, Beaumont went out to Japan to get to know her contacts better and meet key staff at the department stores. UK Trade and Investment, the government agency that supports British exporters, also assured her the distributor had a good reputation and she agreed to an exclusive deal. \"The distributor is responsible for everything in Japan from pricing to sales and marketing. We basically contact them to tell them the goods are ready, they buy off us in bulk and take them to Japan.\"Beaumont enjoys working with her Japanese distributor, but says that Japanese business culture is very formal, efficient. Initially, there tend to be many questions. \"As long as you are prepared to communicate with them it is fine.

I will make Japan a country resilient to disasters and stand with the people who were affected,\" he said.Two years on, more than 300,000 people are still living in temporary accommodation, and practically no rebuilding has taken place near areas where whole communities once stood, now flattened swaths of land blanketed in grass and weeds.The earthquake, so powerful it was \"heard\" by an orbiting satellite 162 miles above Earth, destroyed or damaged 400,000 homes and other buildings. So far, only 10% of permanent homes for displaced survivors have been built.Among the displaced are 160,000 people from Fukushima prefecture, where radiation levels near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi power plant are still too high for them to return home.Decontamination work is behind schedule, while some residents have accepted they may never return to neighbourhoods that were irradiated when three reactors went into meltdown, sparking the world's worst nuclear crisis for a quarter of a century.Tsunami survivors are attempting to put the events of 11 March behind them as they struggle to regain some semblance of normal civic life. \"It's scary living here when there is an earthquake \u2026 but I don't plan to go anywhere else. I want to give my very best, somehow, towards rebuilding this city,\" Kenichi Oi, 75, a fisherman in the city of Kesennuma, told Associated Press.As the country marked the anniversary, the search continued for 2,668 people still missing. More than 2,300 of the recorded deaths have been attributed to the stress of living in evacuation shelters after the disaster or temporary housing.In Fukushima, frustration is mounting over the lack of progress decontaminating communities at the outer edges of the 12-mile exclusion zone established around the crippled nuclear power plant.A partial, phased return to some neighbourhoods is under way, but most people who were forced to flee radiation at the height of the crisis have no idea when, or if, their former homes will be fit for human inhabitation.The mayor of Kawauchi, Yuko Endo, said further delays in work to reduce radiation levels could deter residents from ever returning and put his village's future in doubt. \"If I were told to wait for two more years, I might explode,\" Endo said. \"After spending a huge amount of money, with the vegetable patches all cleaned up and ready for farming, we may end up with nobody willing to return.\"Expert opinion is inconclusive on the impact long-term exposure to low-level radiation could have on human health. In a recent report, the World Health Organisation said Fukushima residents faced only a tiny increased risk of developing cancer during their lifetimes.A more immediate threat to health comes from the stress caused by life in small temporary shelters, few job opportunities and the long, complicated process of applying for compensation from the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power.On Monday, 800 evacuees said they were suing the utility, demanding 50,000 yen a month each until radiation levels are brought down to normal levels \u2013 a process that authorities conceded could take decades.", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Tsunamis", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Fukushima", "Nuclear power", "Japan disaster", "Environment"], "title": "Japan marks tsunami anniversary"},{"date": "2013-03-12T14:02:31Z", "country": "japan", "content": "In the mountains of Shima Onsen, three hours north of Tokyo, the night is quiet, cold and starless. The sun dropped behind the wooded peaks hours ago, leaving behind a biting wind and snow flurries that have dragged the temperature down below -5C.The region's name explains its attraction: shima means \"forty thousand\"; and onsen means \"hot springs\". I have come here to experience old-school hospitality and bathing at a traditional Japanese inn, or ryokan.It's my first time at an onsen, but fortunately a large poster lists all the do's and don'ts. The pictures and captions explain the importance of washing thoroughly, leaving no room for ambiguity.After scrubbing my skin pink in a steamy communal bathroom, I slip on my cotton yukata robe and wooden-soled sandals and head outside, up a narrow wooden staircase that climbs the steep hillside to a small onsen overlooking the ryokan.I deposit my yukata, towel and sandals in a wicker basket in the changing room, as onsen must be enjoyed naked. I arrive at the edge of the small, rectangular pool, desperate to escape the cold. But as I dip my quickly numbing foot in, I recoil: the water is insanely hot.Tiny snowflakes melt on my skin as I hesitate awkwardly, unable to advance or retreat. The intense heat stuns my mind and body and I remain stone-still for a minute, clasping my knees. Only my eyes move, tracing the falling snowflakes as they disappear into the clouds of steam on the water's surface.I soon acclimatise to the water temperature, and feel comfortable enough to stretch out my limbs, deepen my breathing and let my muscles relax. All day I have been looking forward to this unique feeling of heat in the cold, and as I savour the all-enveloping warmth my thoughts drift back to the 12-course Japanese dinner I am still digesting.But the heat overwhelms me, after five minutes my body can no longer cope. As I stand up, I sway light-headedly for a second before stepping carefully from the pool. Retracing my steps towards the changing room I know the memory of the nocturnal onsen will linger long after the heat subsides, but for now I just want to be back indoors.\u2022 Every week Guardian Weekly publishes a Letter from one of its readers from around the world.

But in fact the UK has much in common with the Japanese, another island race. Respect flows both ways in business.Business reports from Japan tend to focus heavily on the negative. The country's \"lost decades\" of economic decline, which began in the early 1990s, are often referred to. More recently, the earthquakes of 2011, and their effect on the country's nuclear energy infrastructure, added fear to a tale of decline. But entrepreneurs looking to enter this huge and profitable market would be best advised not to dwell upon such issues. For Japan is still the world's third largest economy and a big importer. It has a population of 128 million people, high living standards and a taste for British goods and brands. Therefore, for exporters of premium and quality goods it can be an excellent place to do business.FormalitiesJapan's business culture is very formalised and subject to many protocols. It's easy for an outsider unaware of the appropriate etiquette to cause offence accidentally. Gaining advice in advance is a sensible precaution. Greg McCray is the chief executive of Acal Energy, a hydrogen fuel cell company based in Cheshire, which is expanding into Japan. McCray also spent over a decade trading with Japan at a previous company and has learned much about doing business there. \"Japanese businesses are very formal, you don't walk in and start telling jokes. You wear a suit and tie, follow protocol and respect the hierarchy of the business,\" he says.RelationshipsJapanese businesses like to get to know their partners well. In the past, the keiretsu system \u2013 which referred to the tight-knit relationship between connected companies \u2013 dominated the economy. This is not so much the case any more, but its legacy continues. \"Relationships are important in any business, but none more so than in Japan,\" advises McCray. Entrepreneurs will need to spend a lot of time getting to know their buyers and partners, who will ask many questions, far more than is usually the case between British companies. Introductions should be considered as a compliment and a vital first step to making a deal. Nonetheless, the pace of agreeing and signing a contract can be slow.ConsensusSeniority is an important part of Japanese culture and this is particuarly true in business. The head of the company must be treated with respect. But while Japanese businesses are hierarchical, they also like to operate with the approval of the majority. Nick Hines is the chief executive of the Institute of Diplomacy and Business, which advises companies on trading overseas. He says Japanese businesses combine a mixture of hierarchical leadership with consensus. \"Japanese businesses are hierarchal by nature, but there is also culture of consensus which can involve many people,\" he says. Therefore, it is important for entrepreneurs to pay the boss his dues, but then to wait while he convinces his own people.PolitenessRather like the British, the Japanese place a lot of value on politeness. During discussions with trading partners, they are especially keen not to offend the other party. The concept of \"loss of face\" is important to understand. Rather than saying 'No', the Japanese are more likely to say something would be 'difficult'. While they are happy to tell you what they like, they also tend to avoid outright criticism.Entrepreneurs have been known to fail spectacularly in Japan by inadvertently causing offence. Here's a few faux pas to be aware of:1. Business cardsReceiving and giving business cards is taken very seriously, so don't just stick them in your pocket or drop them on the table. Ensure you take time to look at them and thank the provider.2. Nose blowingPeople from Japan are particularly sensitive about nasal discharge. Nose blowing in the boardroom could cause outright revulsion. The habit of putting a used tissue back in your pocket is also beyond the pale for the Japanese. If you have a cold, then cancel the meeting.3. Yes and NoThe polite Japanese often say \"yes\" but rarely \"no\". So don't mistake politeness for a confirmation of an order and understand that the worst thing they can say really is \"no\".4. Closing the dealPressure selling is not appreciated, so allow the Japanese to take their time. However, once a deal is made, it can last for years, if not decades.5. Loss of faceAlways show your contact true respect, avoid causing embarrassment and never go behind their back even when progress in negotiations is slow. Causing loss of face can poison relations indefinitely.Hannah Beaumont founded organic clothing company Beaumont Organic in 2008 at the age of 24. She began trading with Japan the following year. Sales to Japan now represent around 50% of its revenues.\"We won best textile product at the National Organic Awards and gained a lot of press attention. A Japanese buyer who was in the country at the time contacted us and wanted to sell our products,\" Beaumont says.After the products had been tried, Beaumont went out to Japan to get to know her contacts better and meet key staff at the department stores. UK Trade and Investment, the government agency that supports British exporters, also assured her the distributor had a good reputation and she agreed to an exclusive deal. \"The distributor is responsible for everything in Japan from pricing to sales and marketing. We basically contact them to tell them the goods are ready, they buy off us in bulk and take them to Japan.\"Beaumont enjoys working with her Japanese distributor, but says that Japanese business culture is very formal, efficient. Initially, there tend to be many questions. \"As long as you are prepared to communicate with them it is fine. Japanese businesses are quite demanding and there were lots of emails and questions to answer.\"Finally, Beaumont says there's a great market in Japan for British businesses that sell quality products. \" They do value quality and British products as well as brands that look British sell well over there.\"This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

One of the condemned men, Kaoru Kobayashi, had been sentenced to death for the abduction, sexual assault and murder of a seven-year-old schoolgirl in 2004. He sent a photograph of the murdered girl to her mother.The executions, the first since September 2012, could signal a return to more regular hangings under the current justice minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki.\"I ordered the executions after giving them careful consideration,\" Tanigaki told reporters. \"These were extremely cruel cases in which the victims had their precious lives taken away for very selfish reasons.\"Amnesty International Japan condemned the executions. \"The Japanese government cannot be excused from abiding by international human rights standards, just by citing opinion among the public,\" it said in a statement. Opinion polls put support for capital punishment among the Japanese at about 80%.Earlier this year Tanigaki indicated he would have no hesitation in signing execution orders; some previous holders of the post had refused to approve them, leading to a de facto moratorium.\"I will have to do what needs to be done according to the rule of law,\" he told journalists, adding that the secrecy surrounding hangings would continue. Inmates are given very little notice before they are led to the gallows and their families are informed only after the executions have taken place.\"Even death row inmates have guarantees of privacy and we have to consider the feelings of their relatives,\" Tanigaki said. \"I don't think it is necessarily a good idea to release more information.\"At the end of last year Japan had 133 inmates on death row, the highest number since records were first kept in 1949. They include Shoko Asahara, leader of the doomsday cult behind the 1995 sarin gas attacks on the Tokyo subway in which 13 people died and thousands were made ill.The previous government, led by the left-of centre Democratic party of Japan (DPJ), executed nine people during its three years and three months in office. That included an 18-month period from July 2010 in which no hangings took place. In the three years to 2008 there were 28 executions under LDP administrations.The DPJ raised hopes among abolitionists in 2010 when it established a panel to look into Japan's use of capital punishment but the body was disbanded without reaching a conclusion in January 2012.Japan, which along with the US is the only major industrialised country to retain the death penalty, has come under mounting pressure to abandon it.In December the UN adopted a resolution calling on Japan and other countries to impose a moratorium on capital punishment and to be more transparent about executions.In a recent open letter campaigners called on Tanigaki to \"immediately introduce a moratorium on executions and initiate a national public debate aimed at promoting full abolition of the death penalty in Japan\".A 2008 report by Amnesty was highly critical of Japan's treatment of its death row inmates, claiming they were being driven insane and exposed to \"cruel, inhuman and degrading\" treatment.", "tags": ["Shinzo Abe", "Japan", "Capital punishment", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Japan executions resume with three hangings"},{"date": "2013-05-30T08:19:54Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Police in Japan have launched a search for a British businessman who disappeared on his way to a meeting in Tokyo more than a week ago.Garin Dart, 40, chief executive of the event management firm Bluesilver, has not been heard from since the early afternoon of Wednesday 22 May.Dart, a former chef who moved to Japan 10 years ago, sent several texts to colleagues on his way to a work event at the Hilton hotel in the Tokyo district of Shinjuku.

A fall is generally considered a good thing. A five-year low even better. No one wants to see businesses go bust, and besides, a decline must be a good indicator of an economy that is, to use George Osborne's favoured phrase, \"healing\".Alan Hudson, head of restructuring at Ernst & Young, thinks so.The 3,619 business insolvencies in the first quarter of 2013, which is a decrease of 15.8% compared with the same quarter in 2012, should be considered \"another sign that the UK economy is finally starting to move in the right direction\".However, there is another way of looking at the figures. Stewart Baird, director of SME investment firm, Stone Ventures, says that while it is encouraging, \"a relatively benign insolvency landscape should not be mistaken for an economy in a state of good health\".He points out that the average liquidation rate over the past 25 years has been 1.2% of all active registered companies against a rate over the last 12 months of 0.7%.\"Given the weakness of the economy, this simply doesn't stack up and could suggest the worst is yet to come,\" he saysWhy would there be worse to come? The answer relates to the UK's zombie companies. These are the multitude of firms weighed down by pre-crash debts that only survive because banks roll over their debts from one year to the next.Often with hundreds of employees, they have no money to invest, can't emply more staff and stagger along spending most of their time worrying about the monthly cashflow figures.This is the Japanese conundrum. Taxpayers, via the state-owned banks, keep thousands of small and medium-sized companies afloat in the hope that the rising tide of economic good fortune will allow them to set sail again.The trouble is that while this situation is ongoing investors refuse to inject fresh funds into the affected businesses.

The decision by the top UN court will be final, as there is no appeals process. Japan is expected to challenge the court's jurisdiction to hear the case, but details of that challenge have yet to be disclosed.\"Japan seeks to cloak its ongoing commercial whaling in the lab coat of science,\" Australia's agent to the court, Bill Campbell, told the 16-judge panel.Opponents of Japan's Antarctic whale hunts say research into the animals' migratory, reproductive and other habits can be conducted without killing them.Japan, however, claims that lethal research is necessary to acquire the data needed to re-examine the International Whaling Commission's ban and possibly return to sustainable commercial whaling.It uses a provision in the IWC's 1986 ban on commercial whaling to kill more than 900 minke whales every winter, although recent hauls have been far smaller following clashes with the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd.Meat from the Antarctic hunts is sold legally in Japanese shops and restaurants \u2013 a practice that campaigners say proves the research hunts are a cover for commercial whaling.\"You don't kill 935 whales in a year to conduct scientific research.

The Japanese and the ADB's board seem to have ignored the emerging international consensus favouring competition in electing the heads of multilateral banks.Just last summer the board of the World Bank, representatives of most world governments, decided it would be good practice to finally have a competition for their new president. There had been a little reluctance at first in Washington, but later the US felt it would be too embarrassing to refuse an open election for the World Bank presidency, though the man for the job happened to be another American.The same arguments should have worked for the ADB. Competitive elections have become the practice in the other regional development banks, with recent examples being the African (AfDB) and European banks. The same western governments represent a key voting bloc on the ADB board, so why not the same practice there? Japan is an important but far from dominant member, contributing 12.8% the bank's capital. Several other developing Asian countries could have provided strong candidates for president of Asia's core multilateral financial institution.The ADB's board has been slow to modernise. Members, both western and regional have missed the opportunity to create a more inclusive leadership and align the with the emerging global powers in Asia. In contrast, the western heads of state are flocking to China, India, Indonesia and other Asian countries to promote trade and investment. But even that doesn't seem to have impressed the ADB board.There are Asian countries with strong leadership candidates waiting in the wings. One is China, which in recent years passed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy. Another is India, closing in fast economically on Japan and full of world-class expertise in the ADB's core business of development and poverty reduction. Even Thailand and Vietnam are not lacking talented leaders. It is not clear why none of them pressed for the open election which the bank's rule-book formally permits.So what has happened in the meanwhile? Japan almost immediately announced its candidate, Takehiko Nakao, an experienced finance ministry official specialising in currency issues, hardly the core developmental challenges for today's ADB. By the closing date for nominations no other candidate had been proposed. Other member countries were seemingly too polite or politically hesitant to create a real competition, leaving the process as a ritual confirmatory vote, a Japanese coronation.In stark contrast, the World Bank presidential election last year saw three strong candidates, two from developing countries. Formal board interviews and their informal campaigns focused on which of them would be best skilled at understanding the development challenges linked to poverty and then having the managerial experience to deliver programmes in areas such as health, job creation and infrastructure.Did Japan miss a leadership opportunity? As a leading voice in the ADB, it had a great opportunity to promote it (and themselves) as modernising forces in a rapidly changing Asia. Taking the initiative to propose an open selection process would have gained it respect and prestige in the region at a time when it is looking increasingly to its Asian neighbours, countries such as China and India, for markets and business partners. There are few if any direct financial benefits to lose. Japan would still have had major influence through its nationals in the many key ADB positions, and there would be important political gains.Developing Asia seems to have been equally hesitant. Was their inaction strategic or simply an inability to compromise on a single candidate? They have complained bitterly at their lack of an equitable voice in the World Bank and the IMF boards but in their own backyard they chose to sit on their hands. In practical terms to defeat a Japanese candidate, likely to be supported by most western board members, they would have needed to agree on a single candidate.There would be important gains from an open ADB election. While the president is not a dictator, a developing Asia face at the top would likely change the tone and some important priorities in the institution. The need for both infrastructure and social services would not fundamentally change, but poverty reduction would likely be more central to its agenda.New faces might appear in senior operational and policy positions, bringing new ideas and experience into the bank's operations. Commitments to country leadership would likely be stronger, with programming more directly shaped by the bank's borrowing partners, as opposed to its financiers. Most democracies find important merit in simply changing the face at the top to open up their power structures to new ideas. The same would be true for the ADB.There is another possible factor at play. Is the developing south in the ADB, explicitly or not, saying something more fundamental? Are they deliberately exploring another path, one not so closely shared with the west? They are clearly aware of the steps among Latin Americans towards creating their own development bank, despite already controlling the Inter-American Development Bank. By coincidence just days after the ADB closing date for nominations was past, the Brics, the obvious rival to the old G7, met in South Africa for their fifth summit and took the first practical steps to creating a new development bank. Such new approaches point to a possible developing Asian preference for finding their own solutions rather than depending on institutions heavily influenced by western economies. A competitive ADB election would not necessarily change that preference for parallelism over better partnership. But it could help.What of the immediate future? The formal election to confirm the new ADB president is due by 24 April. The bank will again have a president from Japan. It might be a timely gesture for the board and/or Japan to simultaneously announce that the rules for the next election would require at least two candidates to be presented, including at least one from a developing Asian member country.John Sinclair is a former official of the World Bank and Cida.

A fall is generally considered a good thing. A five-year low even better. No one wants to see businesses go bust, and besides, a decline must be a good indicator of an economy that is, to use George Osborne's favoured phrase, \"healing\".Alan Hudson, head of restructuring at Ernst & Young, thinks so.The 3,619 business insolvencies in the first quarter of 2013, which is a decrease of 15.8% compared with the same quarter in 2012, should be considered \"another sign that the UK economy is finally starting to move in the right direction\".However, there is another way of looking at the figures. Stewart Baird, director of SME investment firm, Stone Ventures, says that while it is encouraging, \"a relatively benign insolvency landscape should not be mistaken for an economy in a state of good health\".He points out that the average liquidation rate over the past 25 years has been 1.2% of all active registered companies against a rate over the last 12 months of 0.7%.\"Given the weakness of the economy, this simply doesn't stack up and could suggest the worst is yet to come,\" he saysWhy would there be worse to come? The answer relates to the UK's zombie companies. These are the multitude of firms weighed down by pre-crash debts that only survive because banks roll over their debts from one year to the next.Often with hundreds of employees, they have no money to invest, can't emply more staff and stagger along spending most of their time worrying about the monthly cashflow figures.This is the Japanese conundrum. Taxpayers, via the state-owned banks, keep thousands of small and medium-sized companies afloat in the hope that the rising tide of economic good fortune will allow them to set sail again.The trouble is that while this situation is ongoing investors refuse to inject fresh funds into the affected businesses. Without fresh shareholder funds, and in the absence of further bank lending, the businesses are unable to invest.There are benefits. Workers are, on average happier, because we can estimate that around 1-to-1.5 million people remain employed who might otherwise have suffered redundancy from bust businesses.That is the chief benefit for the Japanese since the big property crash in the late 1980s. But as Tokyo has found, 20 years can quickly pass and the situation stays the same.Baird decribes the UK's situation as \"artificial\".He says: \"Over the past five years many of Britain's businesses have been in a protracted agony. In many cases, because of their financial position, banks haven't pulled the plug but this may change in the short to medium-term as their balance sheets strengthen.\"Like many, he recommends loosening the constraints on bank lending. The Treasury makes a similar argument and the Funding for Lending scheme is supposed to make a difference. yet it is working against some fundamental forces, not least the new financial regulator, which appears to approve of strict lending rules to prevent a bank collapse that is unlikely for another decade. While this situation persists, banks will continue to keep the zombies on their feet staggering on, and on.", "tags": ["Small business", "Business", "Japan", "Banking"], "title": "Lessons from Japan for UK's struggling SMEs"},{"date": "2013-04-22T16:53:52Z", "country": "japan", "content": "When Japan recalled president of the Asian Development Bank, Haruhiko Kuroda, to head up its central bank, it seems to have missed an opportunity to promote openness. The Japanese and the ADB's board seem to have ignored the emerging international consensus favouring competition in electing the heads of multilateral banks.Just last summer the board of the World Bank, representatives of most world governments, decided it would be good practice to finally have a competition for their new president. There had been a little reluctance at first in Washington, but later the US felt it would be too embarrassing to refuse an open election for the World Bank presidency, though the man for the job happened to be another American.The same arguments should have worked for the ADB. Competitive elections have become the practice in the other regional development banks, with recent examples being the African (AfDB) and European banks. The same western governments represent a key voting bloc on the ADB board, so why not the same practice there? Japan is an important but far from dominant member, contributing 12.8% the bank's capital. Several other developing Asian countries could have provided strong candidates for president of Asia's core multilateral financial institution.The ADB's board has been slow to modernise. Members, both western and regional have missed the opportunity to create a more inclusive leadership and align the with the emerging global powers in Asia. In contrast, the western heads of state are flocking to China, India, Indonesia and other Asian countries to promote trade and investment. But even that doesn't seem to have impressed the ADB board.There are Asian countries with strong leadership candidates waiting in the wings. One is China, which in recent years passed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy. Another is India, closing in fast economically on Japan and full of world-class expertise in the ADB's core business of development and poverty reduction. Even Thailand and Vietnam are not lacking talented leaders. It is not clear why none of them pressed for the open election which the bank's rule-book formally permits.So what has happened in the meanwhile? Japan almost immediately announced its candidate, Takehiko Nakao, an experienced finance ministry official specialising in currency issues, hardly the core developmental challenges for today's ADB. By the closing date for nominations no other candidate had been proposed. Other member countries were seemingly too polite or politically hesitant to create a real competition, leaving the process as a ritual confirmatory vote, a Japanese coronation.In stark contrast, the World Bank presidential election last year saw three strong candidates, two from developing countries. Formal board interviews and their informal campaigns focused on which of them would be best skilled at understanding the development challenges linked to poverty and then having the managerial experience to deliver programmes in areas such as health, job creation and infrastructure.Did Japan miss a leadership opportunity? As a leading voice in the ADB, it had a great opportunity to promote it (and themselves) as modernising forces in a rapidly changing Asia. Taking the initiative to propose an open selection process would have gained it respect and prestige in the region at a time when it is looking increasingly to its Asian neighbours, countries such as China and India, for markets and business partners. There are few if any direct financial benefits to lose. Japan would still have had major influence through its nationals in the many key ADB positions, and there would be important political gains.Developing Asia seems to have been equally hesitant. Was their inaction strategic or simply an inability to compromise on a single candidate? They have complained bitterly at their lack of an equitable voice in the World Bank and the IMF boards but in their own backyard they chose to sit on their hands. In practical terms to defeat a Japanese candidate, likely to be supported by most western board members, they would have needed to agree on a single candidate.There would be important gains from an open ADB election. While the president is not a dictator, a developing Asia face at the top would likely change the tone and some important priorities in the institution. The need for both infrastructure and social services would not fundamentally change, but poverty reduction would likely be more central to its agenda.New faces might appear in senior operational and policy positions, bringing new ideas and experience into the bank's operations. Commitments to country leadership would likely be stronger, with programming more directly shaped by the bank's borrowing partners, as opposed to its financiers. Most democracies find important merit in simply changing the face at the top to open up their power structures to new ideas. The same would be true for the ADB.There is another possible factor at play. Is the developing south in the ADB, explicitly or not, saying something more fundamental? Are they deliberately exploring another path, one not so closely shared with the west? They are clearly aware of the steps among Latin Americans towards creating their own development bank, despite already controlling the Inter-American Development Bank. By coincidence just days after the ADB closing date for nominations was past, the Brics, the obvious rival to the old G7, met in South Africa for their fifth summit and took the first practical steps to creating a new development bank. Such new approaches point to a possible developing Asian preference for finding their own solutions rather than depending on institutions heavily influenced by western economies. A competitive ADB election would not necessarily change that preference for parallelism over better partnership. But it could help.What of the immediate future? The formal election to confirm the new ADB president is due by 24 April. The bank will again have a president from Japan. It might be a timely gesture for the board and/or Japan to simultaneously announce that the rules for the next election would require at least two candidates to be presented, including at least one from a developing Asian member country.John Sinclair is a former official of the World Bank and Cida.

Of course we're hopeful of getting the result that we want,\" he said.Bill Campbell, the Australian agent who will present the opening case against Japan, told the Guardian: \"We have taken this case because we believe the whaling being done by Japan is blatantly commercial whaling and is not for any scientific purpose. It is in breach of the international convention.\"There's no higher court than the ICJ. Both Japan and Australia have said that if there's a decision they will abide by it. We hope they will decide to outlaw it before the next whaling decision. Our focus is whaling in the southern hemisphere.\"Japan is the only country in the world who carries on whaling on the basis of scientific research. Norway and Iceland do it on a different basis.\"The hearing will end on 16 July and a ruling is expected by the end of the year.Japan is permitted to catch a certain number of whales every winter for research under a clause in the International Whaling Commission's (IWC) 1986 ban on commercial whaling. Meat from whales caught during the hunts is processed for legal sale in Japanese supermarkets and restaurants.Critics say Japan is using the IWC provision to conduct commercial whaling under the guise of scientific research, adding that the mammals' migratory, reproduction and other habits can be observed without slaughtering them.Japan is expected to challenge the court's jurisdiction to hear the case, and to insist that its whaling program is purely scientific and so does not violate the IWC ban.\"Japan believes it has a strong case because it complies with the international convention for the regulation of whaling,\" said a foreign ministry official in Tokyo who did not wish to be named. \"Japanese whaling is a lawful activity, conducted in accordance with those international regulations.\"Japan's whaling activities are conducted purely to enhance science for conservation and sustainable use, and we'll make our case based on those facts.\"Japan has killed more than 10,000 whales since the IWC ban went into force in 1986, according to the Australian government.Australia will argue that Japan is in breach of the ban on commercial whaling and of international obligations to preserve marine animals and the marine environment. In written submissions, it has asked the court to withdraw all whaling permits from the Japanese fleet.Don Rothwell, an expert on international laws relating to whaling at the Australian National University, believes Australia will struggle to win the case. \"If it was an easy case to make, previous Australian governments would have no doubt explored these options,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\"The arguments that Australia will be making are ones that have never before been litigated or decided before by any international court, let alone the international court of justice.\"The Antarctic hunts have divided opinion in Japan. While many Japanese believe their country has a right to continue its tradition of hunting and eating the animals, a significant number oppose the Southern Ocean hunts because they rely on huge government subsidies.Japanese activists also point to plummeting consumption of whale meat.\"It doesn't sell in Japan, and I don't see that changing any time soon,\" said Nanami Kurasawa of the Dolphin and Whale Action Network, a Tokyo-based pressure group.According to a recent study by the Nippon Research Group, whale meat consumption has fallen to about 1% of its 1960s peak. Current stockpiles of unsold whale meat have increased to nearly 5,000 tonnes, about four times greater than they were 15 years ago.\"Selling meat on the open market has been a total failure,\" Kurasawa said. \"If the court rules in Australia's favour, it will be a good opportunity for Japan to stop the Antarctic hunts. It would be the intelligent thing to do.\"Japan's whalers have struggled to meet their quota in recent years amid clashes with the maritime conservation group Sea Shepherd. Earlier this year it returned with a record low catch of 103 minke whales and no fin whales, blaming \"unforgivable sabotage\" by activists.Japan's delegation at the ICJ will be led by the deputy foreign minister, Koji Tsuruoka, who is chief negotiator over Japan's possible participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a region-wide free trade agreement that includes Australia.The foreign ministry official declined to speculate about the outcome of the legal bid, but added: \"Japan and Australia have different opinions about whaling, but we enjoy strong bilateral ties and I do not expect the whaling issue to undermine our relationship.\"Dreyfus said both countries agreed that the ICJ was the \"best place\" to resolve their differences over whaling. \"Both countries value our strong bilateral relationship and the friendship forged between our nations over many years,\" he said.", "tags": ["Whaling", "Japan", "Australia news", "Law", "International court of justice", "Environment"], "title": "It's Australia v Japan over whaling in the Antarctic"},{"date": "2013-05-30T08:19:54Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Police in Japan have launched a search for a British businessman who disappeared on his way to a meeting in Tokyo more than a week ago.Garin Dart, 40, chief executive of the event management firm Bluesilver, has not been heard from since the early afternoon of Wednesday 22 May.Dart, a former chef who moved to Japan 10 years ago, sent several texts to colleagues on his way to a work event at the Hilton hotel in the Tokyo district of Shinjuku.

That would be \"catastrophic\" for whale populations, he told the court.Campaigners applauded Australia's unprecedented legal action, which has been more than three years in the making.\"Japan's whaling subverts international will to protect these animals from commercial slaughter,\" said Kitty Block, vice president of the Humane Society International.\"Whaling under the guise of the scientific exemption to the moratorium is an abuse of rights and a breach of conservation obligations as Japan is a member of the International Whaling Commission.\"Wendy Elliot, of WWF International's species programme, said: \"WWF is fully opposed to so-called scientific whaling in the Southern Ocean, one of the most important areas for whales on this planet, and the site of previous relentless and devastating slaughters, from which most Southern Ocean whales are still far from recovered.\"\"WWF commends the Australian government for taking this case to the international court of justice, and hopes that it heralds the end of whaling in the Southern Ocean.\"Australian officials say Japan has killed more than 10,000 whales since the IWC ban went into effect.", "tags": ["Whaling", "Wildlife", "Conservation", "Animals", "Marine life", "Whales", "Environment", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Australia news", "International court of justice", "Law", "Cetaceans"], "title": "Australia censures Japan for 'scientific' whaling"},{"date": "2013-05-03T13:51:27Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The first three months of the year brought a 5.3% fall in the number of corporate bankruptcies. A fall is generally considered a good thing. A five-year low even better. No one wants to see businesses go bust, and besides, a decline must be a good indicator of an economy that is, to use George Osborne's favoured phrase, \"healing\".Alan Hudson, head of restructuring at Ernst & Young, thinks so.The 3,619 business insolvencies in the first quarter of 2013, which is a decrease of 15.8% compared with the same quarter in 2012, should be considered \"another sign that the UK economy is finally starting to move in the right direction\".However, there is another way of looking at the figures. Stewart Baird, director of SME investment firm, Stone Ventures, says that while it is encouraging, \"a relatively benign insolvency landscape should not be mistaken for an economy in a state of good health\".He points out that the average liquidation rate over the past 25 years has been 1.2% of all active registered companies against a rate over the last 12 months of 0.7%.\"Given the weakness of the economy, this simply doesn't stack up and could suggest the worst is yet to come,\" he saysWhy would there be worse to come? The answer relates to the UK's zombie companies. These are the multitude of firms weighed down by pre-crash debts that only survive because banks roll over their debts from one year to the next.Often with hundreds of employees, they have no money to invest, can't emply more staff and stagger along spending most of their time worrying about the monthly cashflow figures.This is the Japanese conundrum. Taxpayers, via the state-owned banks, keep thousands of small and medium-sized companies afloat in the hope that the rising tide of economic good fortune will allow them to set sail again.The trouble is that while this situation is ongoing investors refuse to inject fresh funds into the affected businesses. Without fresh shareholder funds, and in the absence of further bank lending, the businesses are unable to invest.There are benefits. Workers are, on average happier, because we can estimate that around 1-to-1.5 million people remain employed who might otherwise have suffered redundancy from bust businesses.That is the chief benefit for the Japanese since the big property crash in the late 1980s. But as Tokyo has found, 20 years can quickly pass and the situation stays the same.Baird decribes the UK's situation as \"artificial\".He says: \"Over the past five years many of Britain's businesses have been in a protracted agony. In many cases, because of their financial position, banks haven't pulled the plug but this may change in the short to medium-term as their balance sheets strengthen.\"Like many, he recommends loosening the constraints on bank lending. The Treasury makes a similar argument and the Funding for Lending scheme is supposed to make a difference. yet it is working against some fundamental forces, not least the new financial regulator, which appears to approve of strict lending rules to prevent a bank collapse that is unlikely for another decade.

The Japanese and the ADB's board seem to have ignored the emerging international consensus favouring competition in electing the heads of multilateral banks.Just last summer the board of the World Bank, representatives of most world governments, decided it would be good practice to finally have a competition for their new president. There had been a little reluctance at first in Washington, but later the US felt it would be too embarrassing to refuse an open election for the World Bank presidency, though the man for the job happened to be another American.The same arguments should have worked for the ADB. Competitive elections have become the practice in the other regional development banks, with recent examples being the African (AfDB) and European banks. The same western governments represent a key voting bloc on the ADB board, so why not the same practice there? Japan is an important but far from dominant member, contributing 12.8% the bank's capital. Several other developing Asian countries could have provided strong candidates for president of Asia's core multilateral financial institution.The ADB's board has been slow to modernise. Members, both western and regional have missed the opportunity to create a more inclusive leadership and align the with the emerging global powers in Asia. In contrast, the western heads of state are flocking to China, India, Indonesia and other Asian countries to promote trade and investment. But even that doesn't seem to have impressed the ADB board.There are Asian countries with strong leadership candidates waiting in the wings. One is China, which in recent years passed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy. Another is India, closing in fast economically on Japan and full of world-class expertise in the ADB's core business of development and poverty reduction. Even Thailand and Vietnam are not lacking talented leaders. It is not clear why none of them pressed for the open election which the bank's rule-book formally permits.So what has happened in the meanwhile? Japan almost immediately announced its candidate, Takehiko Nakao, an experienced finance ministry official specialising in currency issues, hardly the core developmental challenges for today's ADB. By the closing date for nominations no other candidate had been proposed. Other member countries were seemingly too polite or politically hesitant to create a real competition, leaving the process as a ritual confirmatory vote, a Japanese coronation.In stark contrast, the World Bank presidential election last year saw three strong candidates, two from developing countries. Formal board interviews and their informal campaigns focused on which of them would be best skilled at understanding the development challenges linked to poverty and then having the managerial experience to deliver programmes in areas such as health, job creation and infrastructure.Did Japan miss a leadership opportunity? As a leading voice in the ADB, it had a great opportunity to promote it (and themselves) as modernising forces in a rapidly changing Asia. Taking the initiative to propose an open selection process would have gained it respect and prestige in the region at a time when it is looking increasingly to its Asian neighbours, countries such as China and India, for markets and business partners. There are few if any direct financial benefits to lose. Japan would still have had major influence through its nationals in the many key ADB positions, and there would be important political gains.Developing Asia seems to have been equally hesitant. Was their inaction strategic or simply an inability to compromise on a single candidate? They have complained bitterly at their lack of an equitable voice in the World Bank and the IMF boards but in their own backyard they chose to sit on their hands. In practical terms to defeat a Japanese candidate, likely to be supported by most western board members, they would have needed to agree on a single candidate.There would be important gains from an open ADB election. While the president is not a dictator, a developing Asia face at the top would likely change the tone and some important priorities in the institution. The need for both infrastructure and social services would not fundamentally change, but poverty reduction would likely be more central to its agenda.New faces might appear in senior operational and policy positions, bringing new ideas and experience into the bank's operations. Commitments to country leadership would likely be stronger, with programming more directly shaped by the bank's borrowing partners, as opposed to its financiers. Most democracies find important merit in simply changing the face at the top to open up their power structures to new ideas. The same would be true for the ADB.There is another possible factor at play. Is the developing south in the ADB, explicitly or not, saying something more fundamental? Are they deliberately exploring another path, one not so closely shared with the west? They are clearly aware of the steps among Latin Americans towards creating their own development bank, despite already controlling the Inter-American Development Bank. By coincidence just days after the ADB closing date for nominations was past, the Brics, the obvious rival to the old G7, met in South Africa for their fifth summit and took the first practical steps to creating a new development bank. Such new approaches point to a possible developing Asian preference for finding their own solutions rather than depending on institutions heavily influenced by western economies. A competitive ADB election would not necessarily change that preference for parallelism over better partnership. But it could help.What of the immediate future? The formal election to confirm the new ADB president is due by 24 April. The bank will again have a president from Japan. It might be a timely gesture for the board and/or Japan to simultaneously announce that the rules for the next election would require at least two candidates to be presented, including at least one from a developing Asian member country.John Sinclair is a former official of the World Bank and Cida.

in 2003, he praised the country's 1910-1945 colonisation of the Korean peninsula and has refused to apologise for his family firm's past use of Korean forced labourers and allied prisoners of war.Aso, a former prime minister, wants class-A war criminals \"delisted\" from Yasukuni, thereby removing the biggest obstacle to members of the imperial family resuming their annual visits.On Sunday, he bowed in the Shinto shrine's worship hall and left without speaking to reporters.The other visitors included Keiji Furuya, a state minister in charge of resolving the abduction of Japanese nationals by North Korea during the cold war. \"It is natural for a lawmaker to offer heartfelt condolences for spirits of the war dead who sacrificed their lives for the nation,\" he said.Abe visited the shrine in 2012 while leader of the then main opposition Liberal Democratic party, drawing criticism from China.In late March, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the objections over Yasukuni centred on a desire for Japan to \"face up to and reflect on its history of aggression and respect the feelings of people from the victimised countries, including China\".", "tags": ["Japan", "South Korea", "China", "Senkaku Islands", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan shrine visit angers South Korea"},{"date": "2013-06-25T03:52:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Australia is hoping to put a permanent end to Japan's annual slaughter of hundreds of whales in the Southern Ocean, in a landmark legal challenge that begins this week.Australia, a vocal opponent of Japan's annual \"scientific\" hunts in the Antarctic, says it is confident that the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague will outlaw the hunts at the end of a highly anticipated case that is due to start on Wednesday.The whaling fleet attempts to kill 935 minke whales and 50 fin whales every year in the Southern Ocean \u2013 which Australia declared a whale sanctuary in 1999 \u2013 amid protests from conservation groups and countries in the region.Australia's attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said he was confident that the ICJ would ban the hunts before the next expedition begins at the end of this year.\"We want commercial whaling to stop and that includes the so-called scientific whaling programme that Japan has been carrying on for many years,\" Dreyfus, who will make Australia's case at The Hague, told reporters.\"There's no appeal from the decisions of the international court of justice. Of course we're hopeful of getting the result that we want,\" he said.Bill Campbell, the Australian agent who will present the opening case against Japan, told the Guardian: \"We have taken this case because we believe the whaling being done by Japan is blatantly commercial whaling and is not for any scientific purpose. It is in breach of the international convention.\"There's no higher court than the ICJ. Both Japan and Australia have said that if there's a decision they will abide by it. We hope they will decide to outlaw it before the next whaling decision. Our focus is whaling in the southern hemisphere.\"Japan is the only country in the world who carries on whaling on the basis of scientific research. Norway and Iceland do it on a different basis.\"The hearing will end on 16 July and a ruling is expected by the end of the year.Japan is permitted to catch a certain number of whales every winter for research under a clause in the International Whaling Commission's (IWC) 1986 ban on commercial whaling. Meat from whales caught during the hunts is processed for legal sale in Japanese supermarkets and restaurants.Critics say Japan is using the IWC provision to conduct commercial whaling under the guise of scientific research, adding that the mammals' migratory, reproduction and other habits can be observed without slaughtering them.Japan is expected to challenge the court's jurisdiction to hear the case, and to insist that its whaling program is purely scientific and so does not violate the IWC ban.\"Japan believes it has a strong case because it complies with the international convention for the regulation of whaling,\" said a foreign ministry official in Tokyo who did not wish to be named. \"Japanese whaling is a lawful activity, conducted in accordance with those international regulations.\"Japan's whaling activities are conducted purely to enhance science for conservation and sustainable use, and we'll make our case based on those facts.\"Japan has killed more than 10,000 whales since the IWC ban went into force in 1986, according to the Australian government.Australia will argue that Japan is in breach of the ban on commercial whaling and of international obligations to preserve marine animals and the marine environment. In written submissions, it has asked the court to withdraw all whaling permits from the Japanese fleet.Don Rothwell, an expert on international laws relating to whaling at the Australian National University, believes Australia will struggle to win the case. \"If it was an easy case to make, previous Australian governments would have no doubt explored these options,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\"The arguments that Australia will be making are ones that have never before been litigated or decided before by any international court, let alone the international court of justice.\"The Antarctic hunts have divided opinion in Japan. While many Japanese believe their country has a right to continue its tradition of hunting and eating the animals, a significant number oppose the Southern Ocean hunts because they rely on huge government subsidies.Japanese activists also point to plummeting consumption of whale meat.\"It doesn't sell in Japan, and I don't see that changing any time soon,\" said Nanami Kurasawa of the Dolphin and Whale Action Network, a Tokyo-based pressure group.According to a recent study by the Nippon Research Group, whale meat consumption has fallen to about 1% of its 1960s peak. Current stockpiles of unsold whale meat have increased to nearly 5,000 tonnes, about four times greater than they were 15 years ago.\"Selling meat on the open market has been a total failure,\" Kurasawa said. \"If the court rules in Australia's favour, it will be a good opportunity for Japan to stop the Antarctic hunts. It would be the intelligent thing to do.\"Japan's whalers have struggled to meet their quota in recent years amid clashes with the maritime conservation group Sea Shepherd. Earlier this year it returned with a record low catch of 103 minke whales and no fin whales, blaming \"unforgivable sabotage\" by activists.Japan's delegation at the ICJ will be led by the deputy foreign minister, Koji Tsuruoka, who is chief negotiator over Japan's possible participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a region-wide free trade agreement that includes Australia.The foreign ministry official declined to speculate about the outcome of the legal bid, but added: \"Japan and Australia have different opinions about whaling, but we enjoy strong bilateral ties and I do not expect the whaling issue to undermine our relationship.\"Dreyfus said both countries agreed that the ICJ was the \"best place\" to resolve their differences over whaling. \"Both countries value our strong bilateral relationship and the friendship forged between our nations over many years,\" he said.", "tags": ["Whaling", "Japan", "Australia news", "Law", "International court of justice", "Environment"], "title": "It's Australia v Japan over whaling in the Antarctic"},{"date": "2013-06-11T14:00:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Jeremy Hunt's recent visit to Japan passed almost unnoticed in Britain. Yet the issues he discussed with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, and the health minister, Norihisa Tamura, touched on a problem that is likely to dominate social policy in the next decade: dementia care.\u00a0One in four of the Japanese population is over 65. By 2050, the proportion will be 40%. There are already 4.6\u00a0million people with dementia in Japan. Britain, with 10 million people over 65, has 800,000 people living with dementia, at an annual direct cost to the Treasury of more than \u00a310.2bn pounds. By 2050, Britain is expected to have around 1.7 million dementia sufferers.Not surprisingly, the condition has been a prominent concern to past and current policymakers. In 2009, the Labour government unveiled an ambitious dementia strategy, which aimed to improve the quality of life for people with dementia and their carers through greater understanding within society and improved services. Last year, the coalition government also emphasised the need to improve dementia care, with David Cameron launching his \"challenge on dementia\", which identified three major goals: better health and care, fostering \"dementia-friendly\" communities, and improved research.Initial successes included a substantial increase in primary care trust funding for dementia care, but subsequent cuts in government spending resulted in reduced funding for the condition (although involving less reliance on the controversial use of antipsychotic drugs). Discussions in Whitehall about finding new, yet cost-effective, initiatives have been informed by Japan's experience. There, politicians and policymakers have focused on educating the public (even the term \"dementia\" was outlawed) by recruiting and mobilising volunteer dementia \"supporters\", and implementing a new national compulsory long-term care insurance system, offering enhanced services for people with dementia.In Japan, within seven years of its inception in 2005, nearly 4 million people had already completed training as volunteer supporters for the country's dementia-affected population. The aim is to have 6\u00a0million supporters by 2017.The long-term care insurance system introduced in 2000 attempted to cater for as many people with dementia as possible, with the aim of meeting their social as much as their medical needs. Ringfenced additional funding for the new system \u2013\u00a0from taxation and insurance contributions \u2013 was intended to guarantee improved, and theoretically fairer, access to care for eligible dementia patients, who pay a flat-rate 10% user fee. So-called group homes, seen as promoting active living in a supported environment \u2013 similar to an extended family \u2013 are common. Pivotal to this system is the \"care navigator\", who is responsible for co-ordinating integrated health and social care, and for ensuring access to round-the-clock home care, nursing visits, day centres, group homes, respite care and rehabilitation. Reinforcing the entire system is a well-developed network of day centres (the world's best per capita provision), including dedicated facilities for dementia care.Both Labour and the coalition government have attempted to borrow aspects of Japan's approach. The search for a cheap means of buttressing dementia care has arguably been the greatest attraction of Cameron's \"befriending\" scheme \u2013 clearly modelled on the Japanese dementia supporters. Unveiled last February, the scheme aims to recruit 1 million volunteer \"dementia friends\" by 2015. Himself an early volunteer, Cameron sees the initiative as being at the heart of \"dementia-friendly communities\", one of the three pillars of his dementia challenge.But professionals question how relevant volunteer \"friends\" are to British needs. Many prefer the existing system of Admiral nurses (analogous to Macmillan nurses specialising in cancer care), who give specialist care to dementia sufferers and back-up to their carers. Highly trained, and so relatively expensive, these nurses are employed by the NHS, but their numbers have been affected by public spending cuts.\u00a0Assumptions that Japan can provide a model for Britain in managing the dementia timebomb may be misplaced. Crucially, Japan has not evolved a robust system of evaluating the quality of care. In contrast, Britain's approach has emphasised rigorous inspection. Organisations such as Dementia UK and the Carers Trust repeatedly stress the need for adequate support for dementia carers in order to guarantee a good quality of life for patients. Significantly, Japan has not yet produced any comparable networks of support for carers.On the other hand, the Japanese voter typically expresses mature views on how care should be funded. The assumption is that high-quality services must be paid for. The high degree of consensus on this question is reflected in widespread support for the mandatory insurance system. But in Britain, successive governments have avoided increases in direct taxation to fund the social elements that form such an important part of care for dementia sufferers. Equally, it is taken as read in Japan that the entire system of accessible care should be properly funded and the cost shared between government (through taxation) and society at large (through insurance contributions). It is a lesson that Britain might usefully consider.\u2022 Mayumi Hayashi is a Leverhulme early career fellow at King's College London", "tags": ["Older people", "Dementia", "Social care", "Health", "Mental health", "Society", "Health policy", "Politics", "Japan", "UK news"], "title": "The lessons Japan has for the UK on dementia"},{"date": "2013-08-09T16:11:14Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Hometown: Guildford.

This Wednesday will mark the one-year anniversary of the purchase.On Monday Japan scrambled an unspecified number of fighter jets after an unmanned aerial vehicle flew within 130 miles of the islands. The drone, which did not bear a national flag, circled the islands before flying north-west towards China, according to Japan's defence ministry. It did not enter Japanese airspace.\"Japan will enforce increased security to protect our land, sea, and airspace around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea,\" Japan's chief cabinet secretary and top government spokesperson, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters on Tuesday, according to Kyodo News International.

A radiation dose of that size is big enough to kill an unprotected person nearby in about four hours. Tepco said the radiation was emitted in the form of beta rays \u2013 which travel only short distances and can be easily shut out \u2013 and that workers had not been put at risk.The government's decision to step in is widely seen as a safety appeal just days before the International Olympic Committee chooses between Tokyo, Istanbul and Madrid on which city will host the 2020 Olympics.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the government would take a more active role in the biggest nuclear cleanup in history, amid mounting concern that Tepco is no longer able to cope alone.\"The world is watching to see if we can carry out the decommissioning of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, including addressing the contaminated water issues,\" Abe reportedly told cabinet ministers.Reports said that about 32bn yen of the 47bn yen in new funding would be spent on constructing a 1.4km-long underground frozen wall around four damaged reactors \u2013 an untested and expensive technique. The wall would prevent groundwater from mixing with coolant water that becomes contaminated after it comes into contact with melted nuclear fuel.A further 15bn yen will be spent on improving technology to remove all radioactive particles \u2013 except tritium \u2013 from the water, or to least reduce them to legally accepted levels.The head of Japan's nuclear watchdog, Shunichi Tanaka, confirmed on Monday that discharging treated water into the ocean is one option under consideration.Given the large volumes involved, experts say that Tepco will soon run out of storage space and will have no choice than to discharge or evaporate the contaminated water.Last month, Tepco belatedly confirmed reports that coolant water was mixing with groundwater and flowing into the sea at a rate of about 300 tons a day.In a separate incident, the utility, which was effectively nationalised last year when it was saved from collapse with a 1tn yen injection of public funds, said a storage tank had sprung a serious leak. Smaller amounts of tainted water are thought to have breached other tanks and pipes.The new funding was announced days before the International Olympic Committee [IOC] is due to select the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Concern is growing that the water crisis could harm Tokyo's chances of being chosen ahead of Madrid and Istanbul.But Japanese Olympic officials said the Fukushima crisis should not affect Tokyo's prospects. \"There is no risk from Fukushima,\" Tsunekazu Takeda, who is leading the city's bid, told AFP. \"Day-to-day life in Tokyo carries on as normal for its 35 million people.\"The air and water quality is safe. Also the data shows that the radiation level is the same as most cities, like Paris, London and New York. Our main focus is to deliver a great and safe Games.\"Abe will deliver Japan's final pitch to the IOC ahead of the decision in Buenos Aires on Saturday evening.The emergency measures announced on Tuesday do not address the wider problem created by the need to constantly cool the damaged reactors and the resulting buildup of contaminated water. In addition, the new funding represents only a tiny potion of the tens of billions of dollars experts estimate it will cost to decommission the plant, an operation that is likely to last at least 40 years.No decision has been taken on who will foot the bill \u2013 the state or Tepco.\"This is a matter of public safety, so the country has to take the lead on this issue and respond as quickly as possible. Figuring out who to bill for the costs can come later,\" Akira Amari, the economics minister, told reporters.Public criticism of Tepco has intensified in recent months. It initially denied reports of groundwater leaks, and was found to have employed just two workers to conduct twice-daily inspections of more than 1,000 storage tanks containing an estimated 330,000 tons of contaminated water.To compound Tepco's problems, sources familiar with the situation at the plant say the firm is struggling to hire new workers, as others resign or are forced to leave because they have reached their radiation exposure threshold.Critics of the nuclear industry, even inside the governing Liberal Democratic party, are beginning to ask why no Tepco executives have been held accountable for the latest string of accidents.\"Is anyone at Tepco taking responsibility for these mistakes?\" Reuters quoted Taro Kono, an LDP deputy secretary general, as saying. \"I haven't heard of anyone stepping down or being fired.

The building, constructed of reinforced concrete arches and glass, is a dramatic symbol of the university's commitment to the spirit of 'freedom and will' which we see underpinning all creative art. Hisui Sugiura \u2013 the founding president of our university in 1935 \u2013 was a leading figure in advertising design and dedicated to a new style of art education, which has continued today in the university's commitment to project based learning, combining the study of art theory and history with studio and practical work.Buildings encourage creativity A university library has a special role to play in an art university, where staff and students think about and create artworks in a wide variety of media. It is a place where people come to relax, to contemplate, to search for materials and ideas. In the case of the Hachioji library, the building also serves as an inspiration to members of the university community. Glass walls seem to float from the concrete arches, which shape both the outer and inner structures of the building. While the design creates great open spaces throughout the building, constructing that space required technical innovation.The building itself is a learning site for students who can see how a master architect created a building that would complement its location. Fujie Kazuko, who designed the furniture for the new library building, also faced many technical and aesthetic challenges. Toyo Ito wanted the building to follow the natural slope of the land, so Kazuko had to design sofas and benches for the first floor that would sit comfortably on the sloping surface. She also designed library shelves that reflected the arch design of the building.Collecting specalised materialsOne of the main tasks of the library is collecting and providing materials for academic staff and students. The university's collection of 146,000 volumes is not so large by the standards of many university libraries, but much of its collection consists of specialised materials in the fields of art and design. The library has spent time, effort and money creating a comprehensive collection of illustrated volumes, including a large collection of catalogues from art exhibitions and catalogues of the works of individual Japanese and international artists working in many different media.For the students and academic staff of an arts university, creative work is at the centre of everyday life, and the library provides space for art and design exhibitions. The arcade gallery is used for exhibitions, but also for evaluation sessions where the work of staff and students is displayed for group evaluation. Students and staff are still experimenting to find the best ways to make full use of all features. As they move beyond the functions of a traditional library, the Tama Art University community is learning to live in and fully exploit the resources of itslibrary space.A space to relaxThe library serves the university community in various other ways as well. When Toyo Ito designed the library, he wanted students to find space where they could relax. At one end of the library he created an open space where students could sit, recline, or even sleep, if that is what they wanted to do. The open space and feeling of freedom in the library has met this goal. In 2006, the old library had 38,000 visitors, while in 2012 the new library recorded 86,000 visits.And what kind of problems does the library staff face working in a library designed by one of the world's leading architects? Aside from learning to be careful when posting notices and posters to avoid damaging the building or distracting from its sweeping lines, there's also the problem of an increasing number of visitors. While the library was designed to serve the university community, its beauty has attracted visitors who want to see a building that has been featured in architectural magazines.Hidemi Kondo is professor of art history and head of the library at Tama Art University This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Last autumn a senior People's Liberation Army colonel told state media that the drones would be used to monitor the islands.\"Around the Diaoyu Islands, the Japanese authority is able to identify vessels approaching the area very quickly, and this is exactly what we lack,\" Senior Colonel Du Wenlong told the state-run broadcaster China Radio International.", "tags": ["Japan", "Senkaku Islands", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "Japan considers stationing workers on disputed islands"},{"date": "2013-09-04T01:39:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan's government is to spend almost $500m (\u00a3320m) in an attempt to contain leaks and decontaminate highly toxic water at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.The measures come as the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), struggles to prevent leaks into the Pacific Ocean and to find a way to contain and treat the huge volume of water that has accumulated at the site since it was hit by a tsunami in March 2011.Last weekend, workers recorded radiation levels of up to 1,800 millisieverts an hour near one storage tank for the contaminated water. A radiation dose of that size is big enough to kill an unprotected person nearby in about four hours. Tepco said the radiation was emitted in the form of beta rays \u2013 which travel only short distances and can be easily shut out \u2013 and that workers had not been put at risk.The government's decision to step in is widely seen as a safety appeal just days before the International Olympic Committee chooses between Tokyo, Istanbul and Madrid on which city will host the 2020 Olympics.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the government would take a more active role in the biggest nuclear cleanup in history, amid mounting concern that Tepco is no longer able to cope alone.\"The world is watching to see if we can carry out the decommissioning of the Fukushima nuclear power plant, including addressing the contaminated water issues,\" Abe reportedly told cabinet ministers.Reports said that about 32bn yen of the 47bn yen in new funding would be spent on constructing a 1.4km-long underground frozen wall around four damaged reactors \u2013 an untested and expensive technique. The wall would prevent groundwater from mixing with coolant water that becomes contaminated after it comes into contact with melted nuclear fuel.A further 15bn yen will be spent on improving technology to remove all radioactive particles \u2013 except tritium \u2013 from the water, or to least reduce them to legally accepted levels.The head of Japan's nuclear watchdog, Shunichi Tanaka, confirmed on Monday that discharging treated water into the ocean is one option under consideration.Given the large volumes involved, experts say that Tepco will soon run out of storage space and will have no choice than to discharge or evaporate the contaminated water.Last month, Tepco belatedly confirmed reports that coolant water was mixing with groundwater and flowing into the sea at a rate of about 300 tons a day.In a separate incident, the utility, which was effectively nationalised last year when it was saved from collapse with a 1tn yen injection of public funds, said a storage tank had sprung a serious leak. Smaller amounts of tainted water are thought to have breached other tanks and pipes.The new funding was announced days before the International Olympic Committee [IOC] is due to select the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Concern is growing that the water crisis could harm Tokyo's chances of being chosen ahead of Madrid and Istanbul.But Japanese Olympic officials said the Fukushima crisis should not affect Tokyo's prospects. \"There is no risk from Fukushima,\" Tsunekazu Takeda, who is leading the city's bid, told AFP. \"Day-to-day life in Tokyo carries on as normal for its 35 million people.\"The air and water quality is safe. Also the data shows that the radiation level is the same as most cities, like Paris, London and New York. Our main focus is to deliver a great and safe Games.\"Abe will deliver Japan's final pitch to the IOC ahead of the decision in Buenos Aires on Saturday evening.The emergency measures announced on Tuesday do not address the wider problem created by the need to constantly cool the damaged reactors and the resulting buildup of contaminated water. In addition, the new funding represents only a tiny potion of the tens of billions of dollars experts estimate it will cost to decommission the plant, an operation that is likely to last at least 40 years.No decision has been taken on who will foot the bill \u2013 the state or Tepco.\"This is a matter of public safety, so the country has to take the lead on this issue and respond as quickly as possible. Figuring out who to bill for the costs can come later,\" Akira Amari, the economics minister, told reporters.Public criticism of Tepco has intensified in recent months. It initially denied reports of groundwater leaks, and was found to have employed just two workers to conduct twice-daily inspections of more than 1,000 storage tanks containing an estimated 330,000 tons of contaminated water.To compound Tepco's problems, sources familiar with the situation at the plant say the firm is struggling to hire new workers, as others resign or are forced to leave because they have reached their radiation exposure threshold.Critics of the nuclear industry, even inside the governing Liberal Democratic party, are beginning to ask why no Tepco executives have been held accountable for the latest string of accidents.\"Is anyone at Tepco taking responsibility for these mistakes?\" Reuters quoted Taro Kono, an LDP deputy secretary general, as saying. \"I haven't heard of anyone stepping down or being fired. Tepco needs to go down and the government needs to take over.\"Senior LDP officials have said that liquidating Tepco is not under consideration.", "tags": ["Fukushima", "Japan", "Japan disaster", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Environment", "International Olympic Committee", "Olympics"], "title": "Japan earmarks \u00a3300m+ for Fukushima cleanup"},{"date": "2013-08-07T11:31:23Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Tama Art University's new Hachioji library designed by Toyo Ito, winner of the 2013 Pritzker Prize, was completed in 2007. The building, constructed of reinforced concrete arches and glass, is a dramatic symbol of the university's commitment to the spirit of 'freedom and will' which we see underpinning all creative art. Hisui Sugiura \u2013 the founding president of our university in 1935 \u2013 was a leading figure in advertising design and dedicated to a new style of art education, which has continued today in the university's commitment to project based learning, combining the study of art theory and history with studio and practical work.Buildings encourage creativity A university library has a special role to play in an art university, where staff and students think about and create artworks in a wide variety of media. It is a place where people come to relax, to contemplate, to search for materials and ideas. In the case of the Hachioji library, the building also serves as an inspiration to members of the university community. Glass walls seem to float from the concrete arches, which shape both the outer and inner structures of the building. While the design creates great open spaces throughout the building, constructing that space required technical innovation.The building itself is a learning site for students who can see how a master architect created a building that would complement its location. Fujie Kazuko, who designed the furniture for the new library building, also faced many technical and aesthetic challenges. Toyo Ito wanted the building to follow the natural slope of the land, so Kazuko had to design sofas and benches for the first floor that would sit comfortably on the sloping surface. She also designed library shelves that reflected the arch design of the building.Collecting specalised materialsOne of the main tasks of the library is collecting and providing materials for academic staff and students. The university's collection of 146,000 volumes is not so large by the standards of many university libraries, but much of its collection consists of specialised materials in the fields of art and design. The library has spent time, effort and money creating a comprehensive collection of illustrated volumes, including a large collection of catalogues from art exhibitions and catalogues of the works of individual Japanese and international artists working in many different media.For the students and academic staff of an arts university, creative work is at the centre of everyday life, and the library provides space for art and design exhibitions. The arcade gallery is used for exhibitions, but also for evaluation sessions where the work of staff and students is displayed for group evaluation. Students and staff are still experimenting to find the best ways to make full use of all features. As they move beyond the functions of a traditional library, the Tama Art University community is learning to live in and fully exploit the resources of itslibrary space.A space to relaxThe library serves the university community in various other ways as well. When Toyo Ito designed the library, he wanted students to find space where they could relax. At one end of the library he created an open space where students could sit, recline, or even sleep, if that is what they wanted to do. The open space and feeling of freedom in the library has met this goal. In 2006, the old library had 38,000 visitors, while in 2012 the new library recorded 86,000 visits.And what kind of problems does the library staff face working in a library designed by one of the world's leading architects? Aside from learning to be careful when posting notices and posters to avoid damaging the building or distracting from its sweeping lines, there's also the problem of an increasing number of visitors. While the library was designed to serve the university community, its beauty has attracted visitors who want to see a building that has been featured in architectural magazines.Hidemi Kondo is professor of art history and head of the library at Tama Art University This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

For all their fiercely lo-fi ethos, their songwriting has an undeniable power to make people swoon, lovestruck, and yet they've never quite been able to capitalise on the goodwill their charm and sweet, sweet tunes have brought them in the Tokyo indie scene through which they have for the past few years drifted like ghosts. The announcement that their newly released cassette album will be their last gives an extra bite to the 60s girl group melancholy of songs like Goodbye to You.A lot of bands (the Vivian Girls have obvious parallels here) use the aesthetics of lo-fi and indie fanzine culture, and as mainstream pop music becomes ever more corporatised and alien, the appeal of something more wilfully down-to-earth in its production values and tunesmithery is obvious, but with Puffyshoes, you get the sense that it goes deeper: that the band exists as a kind of window into a faintly dysfunctional private world, like the \"Fourth World\" of Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme in Peter Jackson's \"Heavenly Creatures\". In that sense, the goodbye that the duo bid in this song could be read as both a heartwrenching farewell to each other, and to a future that they deserved but never seemed to really want.More from Clear and RefreshingBiS-Kaidan \u2013 Suki SukiDaisuki: New music from Japan", "tags": ["Music", "Culture"], "title": "Puffyshoes \u2013 Goodbye to You: New music from Japan"},{"date": "2013-12-12T08:31:58Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has carried out another round of \"secret\" executions, bringing to eight the number of inmates sent to the gallows under the year-old administration of Shinzo Abe.Media reports said two men had been hanged in the fourth round of executions since Abe took office last December.

We are in close consultation with our allies and partners in the region, including Japan. We remain steadfast in our commitments.\"Hagel reminded Beijing that the remote Senkaku islands, known as Diaoyu in China, are covered by the 1952 US-Japan security treaty, under which the US is committed to fighting alongside Japan to repel any \"common danger\".On Monday China's foreign ministry said it had complained to the US about its \"irresponsible remarks\". Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement China had asked the US through its ambassador, Gary Locke, \"to correct its mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks on China\".Defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said the ministry had complained to the US embassy's military attache on Sunday evening.Japan's deputy chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters on Monday that China's declaration had escalated a tense situation.\"It can invite an unexpected occurrence and it is a very dangerous thing as well,\" he said. \"The step just announced unjustly interferes with the freedom to fly above the open sea, which is a general principle under the international law. The measure is not enforceable to our country.\"Washington's swift intervention showed just how easily a little local difficulty in the volatile east Asian region could potentially trigger a superpower clash. The Senkaku stand-off is but one of several similar disputes pitting a more assertive China against its less powerful neighbours.Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan (all US allies) are \u2013 like Japan \u2013 enmeshed in arguments with Beijing over relatively obscure but potentially strategic bits of maritime real estate.These numerous flashpoints have led the Japanese government to describe the regional security environment as \"increasingly severe\". In response, Tokyo has been busily building up mutual defence and security ties across south-east Asia, and with Australia and India, as a hedge against Beijing.For its part, China has sought to enlist Laos, Cambodia, North Korea and Myanmar as de facto buffer states while projecting itself as a rival to the US as a \"blue-water\" Pacific power.Japan has denounced the zone set up by China on Saturday as \"totally unacceptable\", and indicated that aircraft from its self-defence force would ignore Beijing's attempt to oblige aeroplanes to obtain its permission before entering.Fumio Kishida, foreign minister, warned that China's action \"could well lead to an unforeseen situation\". He called the development \"very dangerous\". Hagel said that US forces in the Pacific theatre, including those based in Japan and South Korea, would also ignore China's strictures.China's foreign ministry called Japan's objections \"absolutely groundless and unacceptable\". It said it had made solemn representations to the Japanese embassy in Beijing.The Chinese government-run Xinhua news agency published map co-ordinates for what it called the \"East China sea air defence identification zone\" covering most of the sea and the skies over the islands. It said China's armed forces would take \"defensive emergency measures\" against aircraft that failed to identify themselves properly or follow its radio instructions.Xinhua claimed the \"air zone could contribute to regional peace and security by curbing the increasing rampancy of Japan's right-wing forces, as well as the continuous and dangerous provocations of Japanese politicians, which even Washington should be vigilant against\".The statement was an apparent reference to Shinzo Abe, Japan's conservative prime minister, who was elected last December on a platform of standing up for Japan's rights. Abe, who says he is intent on making a \"proactive contribution to peace\", has been denounced in China and South Korea as a reckless nationalist and historical revisionist.Although China and Japan share two-way trade worth $250bn (\u00a3150bn) a year and maintain many other bilateral links, Abe and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, have yet to hold a summit meeting, and other high-level contacts remain frozen.The dispute over the Senkakus, situated south-west of the Japanese mainland, dates back to 1971 when China claimed sovereignty. Up to that point, the islands had been under unchallenged Japanese control since the 19th century, although Taiwan also has a claim.The row escalated last year when Tokyo effectively nationalised some of the chain, purchasing two islands from private owners. The takeover provoked street protests in China and furious official condemnation. Since then there have been almost daily incursions by Chinese fishing boats and other non-military vessels.Although tiny in size, the Senkakus are thought to sit on top of valuable energy deposits. But analysts say the outcome has broad implications for regional security, given that an ever more assertive China is prosecuting similar disputes with several other neighbours.Akio Takahara, professor of international relations and law at Tokyo university, said: \"[Senkaku] must be viewed as an international issue, not just a bilateral issue... and it is very, very dangerous. They [China] must stop the provocations. If Japan did buckle, it would send a very bad message.\"In a foretaste of what could happen in the weeks ahead, China sent an air patrol into the zone shortly after the official announcement.

Up to that point, the islands had been under unchallenged Japanese control since the 19th century, although Taiwan also has a claim.The row escalated last year when Tokyo effectively nationalised some of the chain, purchasing two islands from private owners. The takeover provoked street protests in China and furious official condemnation. Since then there have been almost daily incursions by Chinese fishing boats and other non-military vessels.Although tiny in size, the Senkakus are thought to sit on top of valuable energy deposits.

Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement China had asked the US through its ambassador, Gary Locke, \"to correct its mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks on China\".Defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said the ministry had complained to the US embassy's military attache on Sunday evening.Japan's deputy chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters on Monday that China's declaration had escalated a tense situation.\"It can invite an unexpected occurrence and it is a very dangerous thing as well,\" he said. \"The step just announced unjustly interferes with the freedom to fly above the open sea, which is a general principle under the international law. The measure is not enforceable to our country.\"Washington's swift intervention showed just how easily a little local difficulty in the volatile east Asian region could potentially trigger a superpower clash. The Senkaku stand-off is but one of several similar disputes pitting a more assertive China against its less powerful neighbours.Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan (all US allies) are \u2013 like Japan \u2013 enmeshed in arguments with Beijing over relatively obscure but potentially strategic bits of maritime real estate.These numerous flashpoints have led the Japanese government to describe the regional security environment as \"increasingly severe\". In response, Tokyo has been busily building up mutual defence and security ties across south-east Asia, and with Australia and India, as a hedge against Beijing.For its part, China has sought to enlist Laos, Cambodia, North Korea and Myanmar as de facto buffer states while projecting itself as a rival to the US as a \"blue-water\" Pacific power.Japan has denounced the zone set up by China on Saturday as \"totally unacceptable\", and indicated that aircraft from its self-defence force would ignore Beijing's attempt to oblige aeroplanes to obtain its permission before entering.Fumio Kishida, foreign minister, warned that China's action \"could well lead to an unforeseen situation\". He called the development \"very dangerous\". Hagel said that US forces in the Pacific theatre, including those based in Japan and South Korea, would also ignore China's strictures.China's foreign ministry called Japan's objections \"absolutely groundless and unacceptable\". It said it had made solemn representations to the Japanese embassy in Beijing.The Chinese government-run Xinhua news agency published map co-ordinates for what it called the \"East China sea air defence identification zone\" covering most of the sea and the skies over the islands. It said China's armed forces would take \"defensive emergency measures\" against aircraft that failed to identify themselves properly or follow its radio instructions.Xinhua claimed the \"air zone could contribute to regional peace and security by curbing the increasing rampancy of Japan's right-wing forces, as well as the continuous and dangerous provocations of Japanese politicians, which even Washington should be vigilant against\".The statement was an apparent reference to Shinzo Abe, Japan's conservative prime minister, who was elected last December on a platform of standing up for Japan's rights. Abe, who says he is intent on making a \"proactive contribution to peace\", has been denounced in China and South Korea as a reckless nationalist and historical revisionist.Although China and Japan share two-way trade worth $250bn (\u00a3150bn) a year and maintain many other bilateral links, Abe and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, have yet to hold a summit meeting, and other high-level contacts remain frozen.The dispute over the Senkakus, situated south-west of the Japanese mainland, dates back to 1971 when China claimed sovereignty. Up to that point, the islands had been under unchallenged Japanese control since the 19th century, although Taiwan also has a claim.The row escalated last year when Tokyo effectively nationalised some of the chain, purchasing two islands from private owners. The takeover provoked street protests in China and furious official condemnation. Since then there have been almost daily incursions by Chinese fishing boats and other non-military vessels.Although tiny in size, the Senkakus are thought to sit on top of valuable energy deposits. But analysts say the outcome has broad implications for regional security, given that an ever more assertive China is prosecuting similar disputes with several other neighbours.Akio Takahara, professor of international relations and law at Tokyo university, said: \"[Senkaku] must be viewed as an international issue, not just a bilateral issue... and it is very, very dangerous. They [China] must stop the provocations.

Listen to Umez on Soundcloud hereUmez are a noise-pop Japanese duo consisting of vocalist/bassist Sachiko Fukuda and guitarist Koichi \u201cNiiyan\u201d Niizato. Originally formed in London in 2012, the group have since moved back to Japan, and have recently become active in Tokyo.The pair\u2019s music has just as much duality as their stage presence: Fukuda hardly moves as she sings simple, but catchy melodies, while Niiyan wears a gas mask and goes all out, climbing on top of equipment and letting his guitar wail. Their music ranges from catchy, shoegaze-influenced pop to disgusting, chaotic, walls of noise. Many times they have both elements present in their songs.Rainbow is featured on their compilation, International Pop Underground Sounds (Sickness of a Fourteen Year Old Girl) Vol. 1, which was released in September. The compilation is released from Fukuda\u2019s label, 14 Years Records, and features artists from around the world, such as Brutes from the UK, and a solo track from Taigen Kawabe of Bo Ningen. Rainbow is a fine example of the duality found of Umez, with its lo-fi beats and Niyan\u2019s soaring guitars, fronted by Fukuda\u2019s calm vocals, a breakdown in the middle featuring a playful keyboard part, the whole bookended by the main guitar riff and vocal melody.

It is time for people in China and Japan to turn down the volume of simplistic nationalist rhetoric and to pursue pragmatic dialogue.", "tags": ["Senkaku Islands", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Japan", "China"], "title": "Japan and China: collision course | Editorial"},{"date": "2013-11-25T04:35:00Z", "country": "japan", "content": "A simmering territorial and maritime dispute in Asia erupted at the weekend as Washington warned Beijing it would back Japan militarily in any confrontation arising from China's latest unilateral assertion of its claims.The Obama administration weighed in after China moved to in effect \"rope off\" the seas and skies around the disputed Japanese-administered Senkaku islands in the east China Sea.In a tough statement reflecting the surprise and alarm felt in Washington and Tokyo at China's perceived sudden escalation of the dispute, Chuck Hagel, defence secretary, said the US was \"deeply concerned\" at the development, in which China appears to be trying to control who can enter and leave the area.The imposition of the zone was a \"destabilising attempt to alter the status quo in the region\", Hagel said. \"This unilateral action increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations\u00a0... We are in close consultation with our allies and partners in the region, including Japan. We remain steadfast in our commitments.\"Hagel reminded Beijing that the remote Senkaku islands, known as Diaoyu in China, are covered by the 1952 US-Japan security treaty, under which the US is committed to fighting alongside Japan to repel any \"common danger\".On Monday China's foreign ministry said it had complained to the US about its \"irresponsible remarks\". Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in a statement China had asked the US through its ambassador, Gary Locke, \"to correct its mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks on China\".Defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said the ministry had complained to the US embassy's military attache on Sunday evening.Japan's deputy chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters on Monday that China's declaration had escalated a tense situation.\"It can invite an unexpected occurrence and it is a very dangerous thing as well,\" he said. \"The step just announced unjustly interferes with the freedom to fly above the open sea, which is a general principle under the international law. The measure is not enforceable to our country.\"Washington's swift intervention showed just how easily a little local difficulty in the volatile east Asian region could potentially trigger a superpower clash. The Senkaku stand-off is but one of several similar disputes pitting a more assertive China against its less powerful neighbours.Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan (all US allies) are \u2013 like Japan \u2013 enmeshed in arguments with Beijing over relatively obscure but potentially strategic bits of maritime real estate.These numerous flashpoints have led the Japanese government to describe the regional security environment as \"increasingly severe\". In response, Tokyo has been busily building up mutual defence and security ties across south-east Asia, and with Australia and India, as a hedge against Beijing.For its part, China has sought to enlist Laos, Cambodia, North Korea and Myanmar as de facto buffer states while projecting itself as a rival to the US as a \"blue-water\" Pacific power.Japan has denounced the zone set up by China on Saturday as \"totally unacceptable\", and indicated that aircraft from its self-defence force would ignore Beijing's attempt to oblige aeroplanes to obtain its permission before entering.Fumio Kishida, foreign minister, warned that China's action \"could well lead to an unforeseen situation\". He called the development \"very dangerous\". Hagel said that US forces in the Pacific theatre, including those based in Japan and South Korea, would also ignore China's strictures.China's foreign ministry called Japan's objections \"absolutely groundless and unacceptable\". It said it had made solemn representations to the Japanese embassy in Beijing.The Chinese government-run Xinhua news agency published map co-ordinates for what it called the \"East China sea air defence identification zone\" covering most of the sea and the skies over the islands. It said China's armed forces would take \"defensive emergency measures\" against aircraft that failed to identify themselves properly or follow its radio instructions.Xinhua claimed the \"air zone could contribute to regional peace and security by curbing the increasing rampancy of Japan's right-wing forces, as well as the continuous and dangerous provocations of Japanese politicians, which even Washington should be vigilant against\".The statement was an apparent reference to Shinzo Abe, Japan's conservative prime minister, who was elected last December on a platform of standing up for Japan's rights. Abe, who says he is intent on making a \"proactive contribution to peace\", has been denounced in China and South Korea as a reckless nationalist and historical revisionist.Although China and Japan share two-way trade worth $250bn (\u00a3150bn) a year and maintain many other bilateral links, Abe and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, have yet to hold a summit meeting, and other high-level contacts remain frozen.The dispute over the Senkakus, situated south-west of the Japanese mainland, dates back to 1971 when China claimed sovereignty. Up to that point, the islands had been under unchallenged Japanese control since the 19th century, although Taiwan also has a claim.The row escalated last year when Tokyo effectively nationalised some of the chain, purchasing two islands from private owners. The takeover provoked street protests in China and furious official condemnation. Since then there have been almost daily incursions by Chinese fishing boats and other non-military vessels.Although tiny in size, the Senkakus are thought to sit on top of valuable energy deposits. But analysts say the outcome has broad implications for regional security, given that an ever more assertive China is prosecuting similar disputes with several other neighbours.Akio Takahara, professor of international relations and law at Tokyo university, said: \"[Senkaku] must be viewed as an international issue, not just a bilateral issue... and it is very, very dangerous. They [China] must stop the provocations. If Japan did buckle, it would send a very bad message.\"In a foretaste of what could happen in the weeks ahead, China sent an air patrol into the zone shortly after the official announcement. Later on Saturday afternoon, Japan scrambled fighter jets after two Chinese reconnaissance planes appeared over the East China sea.", "tags": ["US news", "China", "Senkaku Islands", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Chuck Hagel", "World news"], "title": "China escalates islands dispute with Japan"},{"date": "2013-11-08T06:00:11Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Reading on mobile? Listen to Umez on Soundcloud hereUmez are a noise-pop Japanese duo consisting of vocalist/bassist Sachiko Fukuda and guitarist Koichi \u201cNiiyan\u201d Niizato. Originally formed in London in 2012, the group have since moved back to Japan, and have recently become active in Tokyo.The pair\u2019s music has just as much duality as their stage presence: Fukuda hardly moves as she sings simple, but catchy melodies, while Niiyan wears a gas mask and goes all out, climbing on top of equipment and letting his guitar wail. Their music ranges from catchy, shoegaze-influenced pop to disgusting, chaotic, walls of noise. Many times they have both elements present in their songs.Rainbow is featured on their compilation, International Pop Underground Sounds (Sickness of a Fourteen Year Old Girl) Vol. 1, which was released in September. The compilation is released from Fukuda\u2019s label, 14 Years Records, and features artists from around the world, such as Brutes from the UK, and a solo track from Taigen Kawabe of Bo Ningen. Rainbow is a fine example of the duality found of Umez, with its lo-fi beats and Niyan\u2019s soaring guitars, fronted by Fukuda\u2019s calm vocals, a breakdown in the middle featuring a playful keyboard part, the whole bookended by the main guitar riff and vocal melody.

Crowned by the Japanese as \"the prince of British gardening\", Paul Hervey Brooks won gold and the prize for best planting for his garden entitled What We Are. The garden, which features a sweeping mixed herbaceous borders and a nectar bar with traditional beehives, takes inspiration from classic English gardens and is designed to be a space to sit and contemplate.With other designers from all over the world submitting designs every year, it is especially exciting to see up-and-coming talent gaining formal awards and admiring views from the gardening public. Bayley LuuTomes of New Zealand designed a what he calls a fusion garden, combining aspects of his Asian heritage and his love of the outdoors from the country he calls home, New Zealand. The main structural element is constructed from glass bottles, which create a space to retreat into, sit in and relax with friends around a fire, perhaps while having a glass of your favourite wine - then the bottle could be added to the wall.Lim In Chong from Malaysia, took the inspiration from the Japanese garden style called Hako Niwa, which takes a very small garden and turns it into an entire world, created to be looked at from several points. The garden, named Introspection, was surrounded by a tall split bamboo enclosure that only had two entrances: this approach was unique (at least to western eyes) and made the garden feel much larger than it actually was. This little jewel box of plants won gold and the top award of best in show. The show's venue, Dutch theme park of Huis Ten Bosh, is located close to the southern tip of Japan, just south of Nagasaki. Huis Ten Bosch is a residential-style resort built after a mediaeval 17th century Dutch town. This spacious 152-hectare resort, roughly the same size as Monaco, is striving to become the top flower resort in the world and flowers in full bloom can be found all throughout the year. \u2022 Jonathan Ward is founder of Ginger Horticulture and an RHS Trials Committee member", "tags": ["Gardens", "Life and style"], "title": "A little slice of England - in Japan"},{"date": "2014-03-05T13:02:58Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The Japanese cabinet is to consider how best to apply the country\u2019s existing laws to bitcoin \u2013 with a view to taxing the currency.The authorities will look at taxing transactions, but have yet to crack the problem of bitcoin\u2019s much-vaunted anonymity.

The word for this Japanese, cabbage-based pancake loosely translates as \"what you like, grilled\". As its name suggests, okonomiyaki is a flexible dish. There is a batter base, an obligatory cabbage filling and quite strict garnishes \u2013 but otherwise, the rest of the ingredients come down to what's at hand. Shrimp and octopus are popular fillings. Pork is also a common choice, usually in the form of pork belly cut into very thin strips, so it looks more like bacon.When it comes to cooking okonomiyaki, there are two styles \u2013 \"Hiroshima style\", where the plain pancake is grilled, then topped with the chosen cooked ingredients, or \"Osaka style\", where all the ingredients are mixed into the batter, then cooked more like a frittata. The recipe below is Osaka style, which is most common in Japan's okonomiyaki bars.The main technicalities surrounding okonomiyaki come down to the garnish. Okonomiyaki sauce is quite hard to track down in Britain \u2013 it is similar to a brown sauce in taste, texture and appearance, but the addition of soy or shiitake mushrooms imparts distinctive Japanese umami flavours. Specialist shops may stock the Otafuku brand of okonomiyaki sauce, but failing that, HP brown sauce shares its tomato-vinegar base and makes a good substitute. Japan's brand of Kewpie mayonnaise is thicker and creamier than its western counterpart, but again, British mayonnaise makes a decent substitute. The best type of seaweed to use is \"aonori\" flakes, but most dried seaweed can be ground in a pestle and mortar.The final topping is bonito fish flakes, which are parmesan-thin flakes shaved off dried, fermented tuna. The heat emanating from a just-cooked okonomiyaki makes the bonito flakes \"dance\" over the pancake, but aside from decoration, their main purpose is to impart big umami notes. Bonito flakes can be found in Japanese specialist shops and are traditional, but not compulsory.When it comes to cooking okonomiyaki, it is important that the pan is not blindingly hot. Stray pieces of cabbage blacken easily, and the result will be a crispy, dark outside and an undercooked centre. Keep the pan at a moderate temperature, and use a lid to trap the heat and encourage cooking on the sides, top and middle, not just the bottom.(Serves 1)1 egg50g plain flour 50g stock, cooled15g raw potato, grated \u00bd tsp crispy onions1-2 tsp spring onions, chopped\u00bd tsp fresh ginger, grated (or Japanese pickled ginger, diced)125g cabbage, thinly shredded (ideally pointed or sweetheart)OilTo garnish Kewpie mayonnaise (or regular)Okonomiyaki sauce (or HP sauce)Bonito fish flakesPowdered seaweedOptionalPrawn, octopus, squid or thinly-sliced pork bellyMix together the egg and flour, then stir in the cooled stock, making sure that there are no lumps.Add the grated potato to the batter, then stir in the crispy onions, spring onions, ginger and cabbage, plus the seafood or pork belly, if using.Heat a thin layer of oil in a frying pan on a medium heat.

The material would be enough to build about 40 nuclear warheads.Japan's stock of weapons-grade material has been a source of friction with China, particularly after rightwing Japanese politicians suggested that it may have value as a deterrent, even though the country ruled out development of nuclear weapons in 1967.The radioactive material is only a small proportion of Japan's stock, but is in a form that would make it easy to use in a nuclear warhead.The agreement with Japan was hailed by US officials as the greatest success so far resulting from President Obama's 2009 initiative.A 2013 deadline \"to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years\" has been missed. Since 2010, when the first of three nuclear security summits was held in Washington, 10 countries have rid themselves completely of plutonium and HEU: Chile, Serbia, Turkey, Austria, Mexico, Sweden, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Vietnam. The deadline was extended with the announcement there would be a fourth summit in Washington in 2016.The two-day meeting in The Hague, involving 53 world leaders, will focus on improving security for global stocks of other radiological isotopes including cobalt 60 and caesium 137 which are used in industry, research and medicine but which could be used in a \"dirty bomb\" to irradiate a large urban area.Despite the advances made in the past four years, a former US senator, Sam Nunn, the chief executive officer of a Washington-based thinktank called the Nuclear Threat Initiative, warned in a report published before the Hague summit that \"nearly 2,000 metric [tonnes] of weapons-usable nuclear materials remain spread across hundreds of sites around the globe \u2013 some of it poorly secured\".The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yukiya Amano, said last year there were a hundred reported thefts on nuclear and radioactive materials on average each year, although such incidents so far have involved very small quantities.\"We are going in the right direction,\" said Joe Cirincione, the head of the Ploughshares Fund, which promotes disarmament and non-proliferation initiatives. But he added: \"When you are fleeing a forest fire, however, it is not a question of direction but of speed. Can we get to safety before disaster overwhelms us?

Victims and their families are understandably angry to see Abe visit the Yasukuni shrine, which honours Japanese war dead, including several convicted war criminals.Nor are Communist leaders simply using this view of history cynically: it affects their own attitudes, emotions, judgment and understanding.The frictions with Japan in part reflect a similar message on Abe's part of a return to historical greatness.

The word for this Japanese, cabbage-based pancake loosely translates as \"what you like, grilled\". As its name suggests, okonomiyaki is a flexible dish. There is a batter base, an obligatory cabbage filling and quite strict garnishes \u2013 but otherwise, the rest of the ingredients come down to what's at hand. Shrimp and octopus are popular fillings. Pork is also a common choice, usually in the form of pork belly cut into very thin strips, so it looks more like bacon.When it comes to cooking okonomiyaki, there are two styles \u2013 \"Hiroshima style\", where the plain pancake is grilled, then topped with the chosen cooked ingredients, or \"Osaka style\", where all the ingredients are mixed into the batter, then cooked more like a frittata. The recipe below is Osaka style, which is most common in Japan's okonomiyaki bars.The main technicalities surrounding okonomiyaki come down to the garnish. Okonomiyaki sauce is quite hard to track down in Britain \u2013 it is similar to a brown sauce in taste, texture and appearance, but the addition of soy or shiitake mushrooms imparts distinctive Japanese umami flavours. Specialist shops may stock the Otafuku brand of okonomiyaki sauce, but failing that, HP brown sauce shares its tomato-vinegar base and makes a good substitute. Japan's brand of Kewpie mayonnaise is thicker and creamier than its western counterpart, but again, British mayonnaise makes a decent substitute. The best type of seaweed to use is \"aonori\" flakes, but most dried seaweed can be ground in a pestle and mortar.The final topping is bonito fish flakes, which are parmesan-thin flakes shaved off dried, fermented tuna. The heat emanating from a just-cooked okonomiyaki makes the bonito flakes \"dance\" over the pancake, but aside from decoration, their main purpose is to impart big umami notes. Bonito flakes can be found in Japanese specialist shops and are traditional, but not compulsory.When it comes to cooking okonomiyaki, it is important that the pan is not blindingly hot. Stray pieces of cabbage blacken easily, and the result will be a crispy, dark outside and an undercooked centre. Keep the pan at a moderate temperature, and use a lid to trap the heat and encourage cooking on the sides, top and middle, not just the bottom.(Serves 1)1 egg50g plain flour 50g stock, cooled15g raw potato, grated \u00bd tsp crispy onions1-2 tsp spring onions, chopped\u00bd tsp fresh ginger, grated (or Japanese pickled ginger, diced)125g cabbage, thinly shredded (ideally pointed or sweetheart)OilTo garnish Kewpie mayonnaise (or regular)Okonomiyaki sauce (or HP sauce)Bonito fish flakesPowdered seaweedOptionalPrawn, octopus, squid or thinly-sliced pork bellyMix together the egg and flour, then stir in the cooled stock, making sure that there are no lumps.Add the grated potato to the batter, then stir in the crispy onions, spring onions, ginger and cabbage, plus the seafood or pork belly, if using.Heat a thin layer of oil in a frying pan on a medium heat.

He said a conflict between the two countries would be disastrous, but refused to rule it out. \"Trust, not tension, is crucial for peace and prosperity in Asia, and in the rest of the world,\" he said. \"This can only be achieved through dialogue and the rule of law, and not through force or coercion.\"We must restrain military expansion in Asia, which could otherwise go unchecked.

About a quarter of its 127 million people are already aged 65 or over, but that is expected to swell to about 40% by the middle of the century.", "tags": ["Japan", "Health", "Society", "Health & wellbeing"], "title": "World's oldest person celebrates 116th birthday in Japan"},{"date": "2014-06-30T10:03:49Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Legoland will open its first park in Japan, as the kingdom of tiny bricks spreads around the globe.A \u00a3185m theme park will open its doors in 2017 in Nagoya, mostly replicating the Lego pirates, vikings and miniature cities that enthral children and exhaust parents in six other Legolands in five countries.While Legoland Japan raises the possibility of Lego bullet trains or Lego sakura cherry blossom trees, a company spokesperson said no decisions had been taken about specific details for the Japanese market.The first Legoland opened in 1968 in Billund, the small Danish town where a master carpenter fashioned the first Lego brick in the 1930s.

Grass and weeds grow where homes once stood. On the beach, a man digs for shellfish near the remains of a solitary gutted building.No one will return to live in the low-lying neighbourhood of Koizumi in Miyagi prefecture, home to 60% of the 19,000 people who died in the disaster. But if the government gets its way, this abandoned strip of land will be made tsunami-proof as part of a \u00a35bn plan to defend 230 miles of coastline with hundreds of towering concrete walls.The scale of the project, referred to by detractors as the Great Wall of Japan, is staggering even by the standards of a country where much of the coastline is already protected against storms and erosion by concrete walls.Under government plans, hatched months after the disaster, 440 walls are to be built in the worst-hit prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate. But while Japan's construction industry relishes the prospect of a huge payday courtesy of its allies in the governing Liberal Democratic party, opposition among residents is gathering momentum.\"We want the government to change the shape of the coast, and redesign it so a tsunami would have minimal impact, not just build a lot of walls,\" said Abe, a primary school teacher in Koizumi who moved his family to a hilltop 20 years ago in anticipation of a deadly tsunami.Debate over the sea wall has proved so divisive among the village's 1,800 residents \u2013 now spread out among eight temporary housing complexes \u2013 that some fear it will derail attempts to revive the village three years after the disaster wiped it from the map. \"I don't want the sea wall issue to divide people here,\" said Yoshitaka Oikawa, a local assembly member. \"I can see the debate is already weakening their determination to rebuild their village together.\"By the end of the year, Koizumi's displaced will have moved into homes being built in an area carved into a mountaintop two miles from the coast. The 14.7-metre (48ft) wall below will do little more than protect rice paddies, at a cost of $230m. \"It's madness,\" said Abe, who wants the area to be an eco park.Yet many of his former neighbours appear content to leave tsunami defences in the hands of the authorities. \"The attitude seems to be that if the walls have already been planned and budgeted for, why interfere?\" Abe said.Christian Dimmer, an assistant professor in the urban studies department at Tokyo University, shares Abe's concerns, but believes many residents were left with little choice when offered premium rates for their land by the government. \"In Koizumi there are people who are happy to sell their land for seawall construction,\" he said. \"[They thought] they couldn't do anything else with their land and needed the money to rebuild their lives elsewhere.\"Those campaigning against the wall have few allies. Yoshihiro Murai, the governor of Miyagi, is in favour, while the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, told a recent residents' forum that walls offered the best protection against a tsunami. His wife, Akie, has cautiously allied herself with the sceptics, warning of the damage so much concrete could do to ecosystems and tourism.The 3,000 people of Fudai village owe their lives to a 15-metre wall that was dismissed as a waste of money when it was built, at the then mayor's insistence, in the 1980s. But it was the exception. Most sea walls provided inadequate protection against the March 2011 tsunami. In Kamaishi, the waves simply smashed through the city's sea wall, then the largest in the world. Concrete barriers offered little or no resistance, and may even have caused deaths among people lulled into thinking they were safe.\"Sea walls have the potential to save lives wherever they are built, provided the tsunami does not exceed the simulated height and runup pressures,\" said Dimmer. \"The problem is that you can't predict how high the next tsunami will be, so sea walls can never give you 100% security. There will always be a risk, no matter how high you build them.\"Campaigners estimate that it will take Japan's taxpayers a quarter of a century to pay the bill for sea wall construction, which could eventually cover 9,000 miles of the country's coastline. But the debate is about more than cost. Until each locality decides whether to proceed with the plan, no construction can begin on sites considered vulnerable to tsunamis.\"I don't want the rest of the world to think of Japan as a concrete fortress,\" said Abe. \"The tsunami was a force of nature, so I can forgive it for the destruction and misery it caused.

They bought the two-acre farm and set about shaking off their urban selves, farming sustainably and organically, drawing on centuries of rural Japanese wisdom.

It's called aigamo nohou, duck-farming, Everett later told us. \"The ducks eat weeds (they can't reach the rice seedlings), their droppings act as fertiliser, and their paddling feet work it into the soil.\" Across the paddy, the ducks' house looks like a New England clapboard church, a nod to Everett's US east coast upbringing.So far, so delightful. Then Yosuke showed us the toilets, which are of the composting variety. You wash your hands in harvested rainwater, using only in the biodegradable toiletries provided. Bedrooms are bare and functional, futons and duvets rolled in one corner. Chickens, dogs and interns (students and Wwoofing volunteers) were busy around the ramshackle-looking main farmhouse. Macrobiotic meals are eaten communally \u2013 family, staff, volunteers and guests elbow to elbow at a long table.But what about comfort? What if you prefer contemporary to basic? With such visitors in mind, Everett bought a big old house a short walk from Brown's Field, and opened it last year as a six-bedroom \"country inn\". Its name, Jiji no Ie, means \"grandpa's house\", though this would have been a very sophisticated grandfather. Five of the rooms are Japanese in style, with beautiful organic tatami on the floors, bright cushions at low tables, exquisite carving round the doors and futons hidden inside hand-painted cupboards. (A sixth room has a western bed, with billowing drapes.) There are sliding paper screens between the rooms and the corridor, a dining room with built-in woodburner, \u00a0normal flushing loos and a garden bathhouse.Everett, who has long silver hair, and a wise manner, told us how he sought out sustainable architects and designers to make the house from local timber, earth, bamboo and straw. (This baffled the local planning authorities, who \u2013 typically, said Everett \u2013 couldn't see why he eschewed factory-made materials.) In one corner of Jiji's garden is a suikinkitsu, or water harp, a feature dating from Japan's Edo era (1603-1867) \u2013 a large ceramic jar buried upside-down in the earth. Water overflowing from a stone basin trickles through the hole in its base and makes a surprising ringing sound \u2013 the unpredictability of the drops forming sweet natural music.Inside, Deco, who is as tiny as her smile is huge, was preparing dinner. Meals at Jiji no Ie are mostly vegan, but with some local cheese and fish. After an aperitif of plum wine, we sat at a long, polished table made from a single length of tree trunk for an exquisite 10-course tasting menu that included homegrown red rice crisps with hummus; carrot tempura with leek flowers; a brown rice and walnut timbale with turmeric, tomato, seaweed and pumpkin seeds; and cabbage leaves stuffed with millet and cashew nuts. Macrobiotic isn't scary, said Deco, it's just a balanced diet of natural ingredients, eaten in season, with traditional fermented foods such as tofu with koji (which gives the curd a cheesy tastiness). Fermentation, she told us, produces probiotics that help us absorb more nutrients. We drank unfiltered sake made by a friend of theirs \u2013 chock-full of good yeasts and enzymes, they assured me. Can't go wrong then, I said, accepting a refill. \u00a0We'd been introduced to Everett by Bristol-based Inside Japan Tours, which now recommends Jiji's for a relaxing few days at the beginning or end of a trip (it's less than an hour from Narita airport). After frenetic Tokyo, we relished the laid-back vibe of Chiba province, and there is plenty to fill a couple of days: cycling wooded hills; surfing at long, uncrowded Kujukuri beach; or taking tea at a 1,200-year-old Buddhist monastery.You can help out at the farm \u2013 digging, milking goats, planting rice in spring \u2013 but we left that to gnarlier types. Jiji's offers less hardcore visitors a glimpse of the rustic and traditional, exquisite surroundings \u2013 and a deeper appreciation of the intense umami notes in a delicious shoyu sauce.\u2022 Accommodation was provided by Brown's Field (brownsfield-jp.com), which charges \u00a387pp half-board.

Many students have to walk several miles to school. A road to the village was built only 15 years ago and there are no cars or buses. Most people are indigenous Quechua peasant farmers.Half of the students go on to secondary school, of whom half again go to university in Santa Cruz. A few years ago, an ecological toilet was installed; the children are now teaching their parents and grandparents about the advantages of using such toilets. The school building was small and dishevelled compared with the smart ecological toilets (built by Unicef). There was a big football field and the grass is kept short by goats. I had just missed the afternoon break, but the headteacher said it would be fine to give the kids another 10 minutes outside. The entire school came out; the boys played football while the girls played tug of war.Likoni school for the blindLikoni, Mombasa, Kenya, photographed 25 March 2011This school has 166 students. Many of them were born with albinism, a condition that often leads to visual impairments. Some sighted students who also have albinism are sent to the school to protect them from kidnapping by agents of witch doctors in Tanzania, where it is believed that body parts of people with the condition can bring wealth. The students go home to their villages for a visit every three months. The school tries to allow students to move at their own pace and not force them to leave when they get to a certain age. Blind people receive no support once they leave school. A friendly head teacher welcomed us in. Hearing about the trade in body parts, I felt shocked and sad as we sat with the intrigued pupils, who wanted to touch our faces and camera. It was a particularly bright, hot day and the kids had only hats for protection. The boys played boisterous games, spinning the merry-go-round as fast as they could, trying to fling people off it, and feeling their way around the climbing frames.Nativity SchoolSouth Central Los Angeles, US, photographed 10 November 2011Founded by the Sisters of Loretto in 1924, this Catholic school has 330 students and is in a low-income area with a high crime rate. There have been several drive-by shootings nearby and once a stray bullet went through a wall. The school is private and charges $210 a month, but 65% of the students are unable to pay the full amount. It is a struggle to get enough money to pay the teachers. When I was 16, living in tranquil north Oxford in the UK, NWA released Straight Outta Compton. LA sounded like a pretty scary place. I wondered what Ice Cube\u2019s school would have been like. So we set out to find schools in South Central Los Angeles; Nativity was the only one that said yes. The area has seen an influx of Latinos, who seemed to be the majority at the school. In the break, a group played dodgeball, a game I loved at school. Next to me some kids sold nachos to other students, raising money for the school. Bhakta Vidyashram schoolKathmandu, Nepal, photographed 5 December 2011The school\u2019s two classrooms are on the ground floor of the building on the right. There are about 100 pupils, many from outside Kathmandu. The classroom amenities are basic and the children often can\u2019t afford books and pencils.Education in Nepal was traditionally based on home schooling for the elites. In 1950, only 5% of the population was literate; now it is over 60%, but barriers to education for lower castes remain.Most of the schools we found in Kathmandu had no playgrounds. We stumbled on this school by chance. The kids were unsupervised at break time. Their playground was actually a public square with a temple; an elderly man whose job seemed to be to look after it seemed oblivious to the noise as the kids screamed around him. They had no toys, but a lot of fun pulling each other around on cardboard. Aida boys\u2019 schoolAida refugee camp, Bethlehem, photographed 8 September 2013 This camp was set up in 1950 for Palestinians who had been displaced from their villages, and the school was built shortly after. There are 395 students. During the first intifada, the school was close to the confrontation line between the Israelis and Palestinians, and the classroom walls were thickened to protect against bullets. In 2004, the Israelis built a wall right outside the entrance. As I entered Bethlehem, the road ran next to the wall, which was often covered in graffiti and art, including a Banksy dove. The third and fourth graders watch the towers to see if the soldiers are looking and, if not, they throw stones at them. When hostilities flare up, the smell of teargas can be so strong that the headteacher has to send the students home. The boys in the playground were pretty rowdy; the headteacher later told me that the school used to be next to a convent, but the nuns complained that the boys made so much noise at break, they couldn\u2019t concentrate on their prayers. I asked him what he thought the boys made of the wall. He described it as \u201ca humiliation in front of them every day, a restriction on their future\u201d. Outside his office was a pin board of photos of the school riddled with bullet holes, from the first intifada. Seishin Joshi Gakuin (Sacred Heart) schoolTokyo, Japan, photographed 7 September 2011This is one of the most prestigious schools in Tokyo; the empress of Japan is an ex-student. The school was founded in 1908 by four nuns from Australia; students have daily prayer and philosophy studies. Discipline is important and student responsibilities include organising committees, voluntary services and working in the library. Twice a week all students have to clean the classrooms and the toilets. You enter the school through a wooded area. It has two main playgrounds, an athletics track and tennis courts.When we first went to the school, it was closed for the holidays, but we had a formal meeting with the deputy head in his office. After several minutes I began to feel itchy. I looked at the deputy head and could make out fleas walking on his shirt and fleas climbing on our translator\u2019s face. It didn\u2019t seem appropriate to say anything as the Japanese are so polite. As soon as we said goodbye, I rushed to the bathroom and took off my trousers to try to get rid of them. We returned the next week and found the school spotlessly clean. St Augustine schoolMontserrat, photographed 18 May 2012Since its foundation in 1875, St Augustine school has faced several natural disasters. The building was twice destroyed by hurricanes. After hurricane Hugo, a major fundraising effort resulted in a modern multistorey building , consecrated in 1991. The 1995 volcanic eruption forced the school to evacuate and eventually engulfed that new building. The school moved to a private house in a safe zone, to which new buildings and playgrounds have been added. There are 135 pupils, from families ranging from affluent to poor. Most of the boys spent the break playing cricket, while the girls chatted enthusiastically. The picture is centred around a moment when a girl who was running tripped over, making her classmates laugh. There were only two white kids, and the boy spent the break wandering around on his own. Holtz high schoolTel Aviv, Israel, photographed 12 September 2013The high school and technical college is affiliated to the Israeli air force; it has 850 pupils. Conscription exists for all Israeli citizens over 18 (Arab-Israelis are exempted) and nearly all the pupils will be drafted into the air force, as computer or electronics engineers and mechanics. They come from all over the country, either because they want a military career, or because their parents want their kids to have discipline.We arrived on a parade day, welcomed by the jovial headteacher. I watched students practise military drills. The photograph was taken just afterwards. As well as chess and ping-pong tables, the playground had a few old military aircraft; I wasn\u2019t sure if they were a kind of museum or for lessons. The school couldn\u2019t have been more different from the arts school I visited in Jerusalem the day before, where girls had dyed hair and there was even the occasional goth. The Royal Ballet school Richmond Park, London, photographed 13 May 2010 The school is split between Richmond Park and Covent Garden; its mission is to train outstanding classical ballet dancers. Every year there are 3,000 applications for just 25 places, and students come from mixed backgrounds: 89% currently rely on state scholarships. The students often have to run to their next class to allow time to change into the right kit. Boys and girls keep to their separate groups.Getting access to the school took months of negotiation. When we finally did, arriving there was quite magical, entering Richmond Park with all its deer, and then the beautiful grounds of the White Lodge, originally a hunting lodge for George II. The school doesn\u2019t have break times, but they do have a bit of time after lunch. The school had suggested bringing a choreographer for the photo, but I wanted it to be as natural as possible.\u2022 James Mollison\u2019s photographs will be published next year by Aperture in a new book, Playground.

If you are a mother, I think it is a kind of feeling that everyone has,\" Obuchi said soon after being appointed as Japan's first female industry minister. \"The central government must offer a full explanation to these sentiments.\"Obuchi has highlighted the importance of earning the \"understanding of hosting communities\" who may be hostile to the prospect of firing up nearby reactors, despite beefed up safety rules.The minister has reportedly dispatched five central government officials to help local bodies in Kagoshima draw up evacuation plans in case of an accident.Communities living right next door to nuclear plants, who often enjoy grants from utility companies and depend on the power stations for employment, are frequently sympathetic to restarts.However, there is often hostility from those living further afield who enjoy no direct benefits but see themselves as in the firing line in the event of another accident like Fukushima.Greenpeace Japan, which is campaigning for Tokyo to abandon nuclear power completely, said the government of the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, appeared to be glossing over the last year, in which Japan has survived without nuclear power.\"The government\u00a0\u2026 is ignoring the lessons of Fukushima and attempting to prevent the renewable energy revolution, trying to take the nation back to its dependence on dangerous and unreliable nuclear power,\" said Kazue Suzuki for the organisation.Abe has been trying to persuade a wary public that the world's third largest economy must return to an energy source that once supplied more than a quarter of its power.Obuchi visited Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant on Sunday, wearing a protective jacket and face mask to observe work at the crippled facility.", "tags": ["Japan", "Fukushima", "Nuclear power", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Energy", "Environment", "Japan disaster"], "title": "Japan to restart nuclear reactors"},{"date": "2014-09-18T11:39:17Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has responded to a non-binding International Whaling Commission (IWC) vote to impose strict limits on its \u2018scientific whaling\u2019 programme, by announcing that it will proceed with a new round of culls in the Southern Ocean next year regardless.The 65th meeting of the world\u2019s whale conservation body voted by 35 to 20 with five abstentions in favour of a resolution by New Zealand, requiring members to put future scientific whaling programmes to the IWC\u2019s scientific committee and the biennial commission itself for guidance.Had Japan respected the vote, it would have extended until 2016 a one year moratorium that Tokyo declared after the International Court of Justice judged it in breach of IWC rules on scientific whaling.But Japanese diplomats at the summit in Slovenia said that they would not be bound by the resolution because they took a different interpretation of the ICJ ruling, and would proceed with the new round of research whaling in the Southern Ocean that they had already declared.\u201cWe are disappointed with their announcement,\u201d Gerard Van Bohemen, the leader of the New Zealand delegation told the Guardian. \u201cWe thought it important that there was a strong statement agreed about the interpretation and application of the court\u2019s decision but in the end it wasn\u2019t possible to reach consensus on that.\u201d\u201cWe urge Japan to abide by the decision of the IWC and to refrain from launching more hunts outside of the process set up today,\u201d said WWF\u2019s Aimee Leslie. \u201cIf Japan truly wants to advance whale conservation as it says it does, then it should not circumvent these new IWC rules.\u201dAmid heated wrangling between pro- and anti-whaling nations, a beefed-up version of the original resolution was submitted with provisions for whale sanctuaries, added by Chile.

Many students have to walk several miles to school. A road to the village was built only 15 years ago and there are no cars or buses. Most people are indigenous Quechua peasant farmers.Half of the students go on to secondary school, of whom half again go to university in Santa Cruz. A few years ago, an ecological toilet was installed; the children are now teaching their parents and grandparents about the advantages of using such toilets. The school building was small and dishevelled compared with the smart ecological toilets (built by Unicef). There was a big football field and the grass is kept short by goats. I had just missed the afternoon break, but the headteacher said it would be fine to give the kids another 10 minutes outside. The entire school came out; the boys played football while the girls played tug of war.Likoni school for the blindLikoni, Mombasa, Kenya, photographed 25 March 2011This school has 166 students. Many of them were born with albinism, a condition that often leads to visual impairments. Some sighted students who also have albinism are sent to the school to protect them from kidnapping by agents of witch doctors in Tanzania, where it is believed that body parts of people with the condition can bring wealth. The students go home to their villages for a visit every three months. The school tries to allow students to move at their own pace and not force them to leave when they get to a certain age. Blind people receive no support once they leave school. A friendly head teacher welcomed us in. Hearing about the trade in body parts, I felt shocked and sad as we sat with the intrigued pupils, who wanted to touch our faces and camera. It was a particularly bright, hot day and the kids had only hats for protection. The boys played boisterous games, spinning the merry-go-round as fast as they could, trying to fling people off it, and feeling their way around the climbing frames.Nativity SchoolSouth Central Los Angeles, US, photographed 10 November 2011Founded by the Sisters of Loretto in 1924, this Catholic school has 330 students and is in a low-income area with a high crime rate. There have been several drive-by shootings nearby and once a stray bullet went through a wall. The school is private and charges $210 a month, but 65% of the students are unable to pay the full amount. It is a struggle to get enough money to pay the teachers. When I was 16, living in tranquil north Oxford in the UK, NWA released Straight Outta Compton. LA sounded like a pretty scary place. I wondered what Ice Cube\u2019s school would have been like. So we set out to find schools in South Central Los Angeles; Nativity was the only one that said yes. The area has seen an influx of Latinos, who seemed to be the majority at the school. In the break, a group played dodgeball, a game I loved at school. Next to me some kids sold nachos to other students, raising money for the school. Bhakta Vidyashram schoolKathmandu, Nepal, photographed 5 December 2011The school\u2019s two classrooms are on the ground floor of the building on the right. There are about 100 pupils, many from outside Kathmandu. The classroom amenities are basic and the children often can\u2019t afford books and pencils.Education in Nepal was traditionally based on home schooling for the elites. In 1950, only 5% of the population was literate; now it is over 60%, but barriers to education for lower castes remain.Most of the schools we found in Kathmandu had no playgrounds. We stumbled on this school by chance. The kids were unsupervised at break time. Their playground was actually a public square with a temple; an elderly man whose job seemed to be to look after it seemed oblivious to the noise as the kids screamed around him. They had no toys, but a lot of fun pulling each other around on cardboard. Aida boys\u2019 schoolAida refugee camp, Bethlehem, photographed 8 September 2013 This camp was set up in 1950 for Palestinians who had been displaced from their villages, and the school was built shortly after. There are 395 students. During the first intifada, the school was close to the confrontation line between the Israelis and Palestinians, and the classroom walls were thickened to protect against bullets. In 2004, the Israelis built a wall right outside the entrance. As I entered Bethlehem, the road ran next to the wall, which was often covered in graffiti and art, including a Banksy dove. The third and fourth graders watch the towers to see if the soldiers are looking and, if not, they throw stones at them. When hostilities flare up, the smell of teargas can be so strong that the headteacher has to send the students home. The boys in the playground were pretty rowdy; the headteacher later told me that the school used to be next to a convent, but the nuns complained that the boys made so much noise at break, they couldn\u2019t concentrate on their prayers. I asked him what he thought the boys made of the wall. He described it as \u201ca humiliation in front of them every day, a restriction on their future\u201d. Outside his office was a pin board of photos of the school riddled with bullet holes, from the first intifada. Seishin Joshi Gakuin (Sacred Heart) schoolTokyo, Japan, photographed 7 September 2011This is one of the most prestigious schools in Tokyo; the empress of Japan is an ex-student. The school was founded in 1908 by four nuns from Australia; students have daily prayer and philosophy studies. Discipline is important and student responsibilities include organising committees, voluntary services and working in the library. Twice a week all students have to clean the classrooms and the toilets. You enter the school through a wooded area. It has two main playgrounds, an athletics track and tennis courts.When we first went to the school, it was closed for the holidays, but we had a formal meeting with the deputy head in his office. After several minutes I began to feel itchy. I looked at the deputy head and could make out fleas walking on his shirt and fleas climbing on our translator\u2019s face. It didn\u2019t seem appropriate to say anything as the Japanese are so polite. As soon as we said goodbye, I rushed to the bathroom and took off my trousers to try to get rid of them. We returned the next week and found the school spotlessly clean. St Augustine schoolMontserrat, photographed 18 May 2012Since its foundation in 1875, St Augustine school has faced several natural disasters. The building was twice destroyed by hurricanes. After hurricane Hugo, a major fundraising effort resulted in a modern multistorey building , consecrated in 1991. The 1995 volcanic eruption forced the school to evacuate and eventually engulfed that new building. The school moved to a private house in a safe zone, to which new buildings and playgrounds have been added. There are 135 pupils, from families ranging from affluent to poor. Most of the boys spent the break playing cricket, while the girls chatted enthusiastically. The picture is centred around a moment when a girl who was running tripped over, making her classmates laugh. There were only two white kids, and the boy spent the break wandering around on his own. Holtz high schoolTel Aviv, Israel, photographed 12 September 2013The high school and technical college is affiliated to the Israeli air force; it has 850 pupils. Conscription exists for all Israeli citizens over 18 (Arab-Israelis are exempted) and nearly all the pupils will be drafted into the air force, as computer or electronics engineers and mechanics. They come from all over the country, either because they want a military career, or because their parents want their kids to have discipline.We arrived on a parade day, welcomed by the jovial headteacher. I watched students practise military drills. The photograph was taken just afterwards. As well as chess and ping-pong tables, the playground had a few old military aircraft; I wasn\u2019t sure if they were a kind of museum or for lessons. The school couldn\u2019t have been more different from the arts school I visited in Jerusalem the day before, where girls had dyed hair and there was even the occasional goth. The Royal Ballet school Richmond Park, London, photographed 13 May 2010 The school is split between Richmond Park and Covent Garden; its mission is to train outstanding classical ballet dancers. Every year there are 3,000 applications for just 25 places, and students come from mixed backgrounds: 89% currently rely on state scholarships. The students often have to run to their next class to allow time to change into the right kit. Boys and girls keep to their separate groups.Getting access to the school took months of negotiation. When we finally did, arriving there was quite magical, entering Richmond Park with all its deer, and then the beautiful grounds of the White Lodge, originally a hunting lodge for George II. The school doesn\u2019t have break times, but they do have a bit of time after lunch. The school had suggested bringing a choreographer for the photo, but I wanted it to be as natural as possible.\u2022 James Mollison\u2019s photographs will be published next year by Aperture in a new book, Playground.

The government appears to be backtracking from its election promise to construct 12 vessels in South Australia at a cost of about $40bn.But the cost of building the vessels in Japan would be about half of that.\u201cWell we haven\u2019t made a decision yet on where the submarines will be built, but we want to make sure we have the best value for money and the best submarines available based on the best advice from the defence department,\u201d MacFarlane told the ABC\u2019s Radio National program on Tuesday morning.\u201cWe will go through that process, and South Australia is still in the mix.\u201dHe would not say when a decision would be made, but it will be announced in the defence white paper to be released by next June.Ahead of the 2013 federal election, defence minister David Johnston, then the shadow minister, promised on a visit to defence contractor ASC in Adelaide that the new submarines would be built \u201cright here in South Australia\u201d.But Labor leader Bill Shorten said giving the contract to Japan would be another \u201ckick in the guts\u201d for South Australia after the decision by carmaker Holden to stop production in Adelaide later this decade.Shorten, who will visit ASC headquarters in Adelaide on Tuesday, also warned that such a decision would \u201cput our national security at risk as a maritime nation\u201d.The government has indicated any Australian modifications of the Soryu subs - including installation of the computer combat system and ongoing maintenance - will be carried out in Adelaide.The Australian Industry Group says local supply chain companies will be looking for guidance from the government as soon as possible.\u201cThere\u2019s been long-held belief and signals from governments of both sides that submarines would be built in Australia,\u201d chief executive Innes Willox told ABC Radio.The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union has warned that thousands of jobs will be at risk if the contract goes offshore.The speculation over where the submarines will be built has concerned manufacturers and unions.The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said local supply chain companies had made investment decisions on expectations the submarines would be built in Adelaide and needed clarity.\u201cCompanies have acted in good faith here and there\u2019s been a long held belief and signals from governments of both sides that submarines would be built in Australia,\u201d he told ABC Radio on Tuesday.\u201cIndustry would be looking for guidance as soon as possible.\u201dAustralian Manufacturing Workers Union national president Paul Bastian said building the submarines in Japan would cause a ripple effect for industry.\u201cI think there will be thousands of jobs in the shipbuilding sector that will be put at risk,\u201d he told ABC Radio.Opposition assistant minister for defence, David Feeney, said giving the contract to Japan could lead to the loss of thousands of skilled jobs.\u201cThe Abbott government has already excluded Australian companies from tendering for two new Royal Australian Navy supply ships, sending that work overseas,\u201d he said in a statement.\u201cIt\u2019s time the Coalition kept its promises to South Australia and recommitted to building Australia\u2019s future submarines in Adelaide.\u201d", "tags": ["Australia news", "Australian defence force", "Australian politics", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Coalition denies plan to give submarine contract to Japan"},{"date": "2014-08-28T20:25:01Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Science plays a crucial role in the face of intractable problems, such as global warming, energy shortages, pandemics and large-scale technological accidents. But it is not easy for nations and international organisations to maintain effective systems for scientific advice. Sometimes, scientists can be exposed to political pressures; governments may not be able to identify the right experts; uncertainties accompanying scientific information may not be properly interpreted; and communication between scientists and policy makers can fail in times of crisis.Such problems were poignantly felt in Japan after the Great East Japan earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011. Many experts appeared in the media and spoke out about evacuation, food safety and other issues, but there was no mechanism to integrate their views for the benefit of the public and policymakers. At the same time, many people lost confidence in the words of scientists who were working closely with the government or the nuclear industry. Public trust in both science and policymaking was severely damaged.In the three years since these disasters hit Japan, politicians, government officials, prominent scientists, journalists and citizen representatives have had several opportunities to exchange views in a series of symposia on the prospects for scientific advice in Japan. These were organised by institutions such as the Science Council of Japan (SCJ, which is Japan\u2019s national academy of sciences), the Center for Research and Development Strategy (CRDS, a semi-public think-tank) at the Japan Science and Technology Agency, and the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS, an academic institution). Science advisers from overseas, including Sir John Beddington, the former UK government chief scientific adviser, and Bruce Alberts, the former president of the US National Academy of Sciences, joined those discussions.In the meantime, the Japanese government began moving forward with reform of the nation\u2019s scientific advisory structure. An expert study group issued a report in December 2011, calling for the appointment of science, technology and innovation advisers for the prime minister and other ministers. This report also called for a strengthening of the secretariat and think-tank functions of scientific advisory bodies, and for closer liaison between the government and the Science Council of Japan.In March 2012, one year after the cataclysm, CRDS issued a set of proposals for strengthening scientific advice in Japan. These included securing the independence of scientific advisers, ensuring transparency of the scientific advisory process, and proper handling of uncertainty and diversity of scientific views. While similar guidelines already existed in the UK, US and some other nations, CRDS\u2019s guidelines took into consideration Japan\u2019s particular political and cultural context, and factored in a wide range of stakeholders\u2019 views through workshops, symposia and personal exchanges.The Science Council of Japan also took action. In May 2012, it started discussing how to create new guidelines for scientific advice, taking notice of the principles proposed by CRDS. This resulted in January 2013, in SCJ\u2019s Statement on the Code of Conduct for Scientists, which included clauses on scientific advice and dialogue with society. More recently, however, Japan\u2019s efforts at reconstructing its scientific advisory system have been losing momentum. The proposal to appoint new science advisers has not been acted upon, partly because of a change of government in Japan. The Council for Science and Technology Policy, the highest policy-making body in this field, has been busy launching new policies to boost innovation and revitalise Japan\u2019s economy, which seems a more urgent priority for Japan under the current administration. Hopefully, the Japanese government and scientific community will soon refocus their attention on issues of scientific advice and the relationships between science and society.We sit at a crossroads in modern science. A redefinition and reconstruction of science and society relations is an urgent task. And a critical aspect of that is to effectively mediate between science and policymaking. Failure to address these issues will impede wider efforts to rebuild public trust in science, and hold back other innovations to address social challenges.Meanwhile, international efforts to strengthen scientific advice have accelerated. In April 2013, the Global Science Forum of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established an expert group, co-chaired by the Netherlands, Japan, Germany and Italy, to examine the roles and responsibilities of scientists in policy-making. And in October 2013, the United Nations announced the creation of a Scientific Advisory Board for its Secretary General, with a first meeting taking place in Berlin in January 2014.Japan has participated in all of these international forums. In particular, in October 2013, Japan hosted a two-day OECD-GSF workshop in Tokyo, attended by representatives from 20 nations. It was agreed in the workshop that, while each nation\u2019s scientific advisory system depends on its historical and cultural contexts, international dialogue is extremely useful and beneficial in building common ground for scientific advice. The OECD Global Science Forum is now aiming to publish its report in early 2015. The result will be discussed at a ministerial meeting, to be held on 20-21 October 2015 in Korea.As well as discussing what constitutes a sound and effective scientific advisory system, the OECD report will deal with issues as scientific advice in crisis situations, the responsibility and legal liability of scientific advisory bodies and individuals, international collaboration in scientific advice, and the growing involvement of civil society in processes of scientific advice. All of these issues are also on the agenda at the Auckland summit on science advice, taking place this week.Such developments clearly indicate the international community\u2019s growing commitment to sound and effective scientific advice. This consensus will steadily propel individual nations and international organisations, such as the UN, to further improve that their scientific advisory systems. At the same time, the UN, OECD, the International Council for Science and other bodies should work towards global coordination mechanisms, a \u201csystem of systems for scientific advice\u201d. The need for such efforts will continue, as social and environmental challenges demand closer collaboration between scientists and policymakers on a global scale.Tateo Arimoto is director of the Innovation, Science and Technology Program of the Graduate Institute of Policy Studies, Tokyo.

The streets twinkle with lights, and you\u2019ll even hear festive music, but it is not Christmas as we know it.Christmas in Japan is all about love or, more precisely, about lovers. Come Christmas Eve, you\u2019ll find every smart hotel and restaurant fully booked with couples on what is the most important date of the year as far as impressing your other half goes. For Japanese young people, there is immense pressure to find a girlfriend or boyfriend before 24 December, even if it is just for Christmas.I had been in Tokyo for about a week. I had spent hours enjoying the outlandish Japanese youth culture and fashion in Harajuku district, nibbled on potentially fatally poisonous fugu (pufferfish) and had sung, badly, in a stylish karaoke bar.Because I was travelling alone, staying in Tokyo for a romantic Christmas wasn\u2019t all that appealing. I decided to try something completely different. I took the bullet train to Kyoto.There, I stared in wonder at the Kinkaku-ji golden temple, its reflection shimmering gloriously on the frozen pond beside it. I strolled reverently through the dry rock garden at Ry\u014dan-ji, one of the finest examples of Zen landscaping, and then lost myself in Gion, the city\u2019s historic geisha district. I walked through the maze of Gion\u2019s narrow streets, clutching an address a friend had given me, and arrived at a simple wooden building. It was a respected house of geisha. An old woman bowed, wished me \u201cMeri Kurisumasu\u201d and waved me upstairs.Two trainee geisha \u2013 maiko \u2013 greeted me and, with little ceremony, peeled off my clothes. Moments later I was shivering in a thin slip. A thick white paste was adeptly applied to my face and neck \u2013 I was thankful that modern geishas no longer use nightingale guano to whiten their faces.Two hours later, I emerged transformed, though bewildered and barely able to breathe or walk. The white paste had hardened like a mask, my torso was as tightly bound as an Egyptian mummy, and I was draped in an extraordinarily heavy silk kimono. On my head was an enormous, unwieldy wig-cum-helmet, complete with braids and baubles. I couldn\u2019t have looked more festive. (Then, over a decade ago, I was lucky to have a friend with connections: to be allowed into the world of the geisha for a day was a chance of a lifetime. Now, a \u201ctransformation experience\u201d can be booked online.)Later that evening, my face scrubbed and breathing easier back in my own clothes, I joined the throng at KFC for another modern Japanese tradition: Christmas Day fried chicken.

But what if another country then said that only a small number of women could wear kimono?\u201dHe added that Japan had responded adequately to ICJ criticisms in a revised scientific whaling program revealed last week, adding that he fully expected the country\u2019s fleet would leave for the Antarctic at the end of next year.Under the 1986 IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, Japan was permitted to kill almost 1,000 mainly minke whales a year for \u201cscientific research\u201d. Meat from the slaughtered whales is sold on the open market, although a dramatic drop in demand in recent decades means thousands of tonnes of meat has been left unsold.The world court withdrew Japan\u2019s whaling licence in the Antarctic, forcing officials in Tokyo to devise a new program that they say has solid scientific foundations.\u201cSome countries won\u2019t allow any whale hunting under any circumstances,\u201d Morishita said on Wednesday, a week after Japan unveiled its new scientific whaling proposal.\u201cThey have a zero-tolerance policy. But it\u2019s time to end that paradigm. If we don\u2019t, there is no reason for the IWC to exist.\u201dIn its revised program, Japan says it will kill 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean next year, and a total of 3,996 over 12 years. The quota is significantly lower than the 850 minke whales it targeted each year until Australia\u2019s legal challenge at The Hague put a temporary halt to the hunt.Australia has been the most vocal opponent of Japan\u2019s lethal research hunts in an area of the Southern Ocean that Canberra regards as a whale sanctuary.Environmental groups condemned the new plans. \u201cJapan\u2019s new whaling proposal for the Southern Ocean sanctuary is neither new nor improved,\u201d said Kitty Block, vice-president of the Humane Society International.\u201cDespite the ICJ decision condemning the nation\u2019s so-called scientific program, Japan is still trying to explain the inexplicable and defend the indefensible. The hunt is for commercial purposes \u2013 not science.\u201dMorishita accused Australia and other countries of offering only \u201cemotional\u201d arguments in defence of an animal that had come to be seen as \u201ccharismatic\u201d.Japan, by contrast, was only interested in scientific proof that sustainable use of an \u201cordinary marine resource\u201d was possible. He said weak demand for whale meat among Japanese consumers was no reason to end the slaughter.\u201cYes, if you ask ordinary Japanese people they say they don\u2019t eat whale meat, but at the same time they say they don\u2019t like the idea of being told not to eat it by people who eat, say, beef.\u201cPeople in India don\u2019t eat beef, but what if they started a campaign against McDonald\u2019s in other countries, perhaps imposing economic sanctions? You can see the stupidity of the [anti-whaling] argument when you apply it to beef. But what is the difference between cows and whales?\u201dThe resumption of whaling in the Antarctic could be short-lived. From 2016, \u201cscientific\u201d whale hunts must first be reviewed and approved by the general membership of the IWC, the majority of which is anti-whaling.The next hunt will not be subject to the requirement because it is due to start a year before the IWC\u2019S next meeting.", "tags": ["Whaling", "Whales", "Conservation", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Australia news", "Environment", "Japan", "Marine life", "New Zealand"], "title": "Japan likens anti-whaling campaign to attempt to ban kimono"},{"date": "2014-12-16T04:19:07Z", "country": "japan", "content": "First came a hitch to butter supplies just as millions of Japanese prepare to tuck into Christmas cake.

But what if another country then said that only a small number of women could wear kimono?\u201dHe added that Japan had responded adequately to ICJ criticisms in a revised scientific whaling program revealed last week, adding that he fully expected the country\u2019s fleet would leave for the Antarctic at the end of next year.Under the 1986 IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, Japan was permitted to kill almost 1,000 mainly minke whales a year for \u201cscientific research\u201d. Meat from the slaughtered whales is sold on the open market, although a dramatic drop in demand in recent decades means thousands of tonnes of meat has been left unsold.The world court withdrew Japan\u2019s whaling licence in the Antarctic, forcing officials in Tokyo to devise a new program that they say has solid scientific foundations.\u201cSome countries won\u2019t allow any whale hunting under any circumstances,\u201d Morishita said on Wednesday, a week after Japan unveiled its new scientific whaling proposal.\u201cThey have a zero-tolerance policy. But it\u2019s time to end that paradigm. If we don\u2019t, there is no reason for the IWC to exist.\u201dIn its revised program, Japan says it will kill 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean next year, and a total of 3,996 over 12 years. The quota is significantly lower than the 850 minke whales it targeted each year until Australia\u2019s legal challenge at The Hague put a temporary halt to the hunt.Australia has been the most vocal opponent of Japan\u2019s lethal research hunts in an area of the Southern Ocean that Canberra regards as a whale sanctuary.Environmental groups condemned the new plans. \u201cJapan\u2019s new whaling proposal for the Southern Ocean sanctuary is neither new nor improved,\u201d said Kitty Block, vice-president of the Humane Society International.\u201cDespite the ICJ decision condemning the nation\u2019s so-called scientific program, Japan is still trying to explain the inexplicable and defend the indefensible. The hunt is for commercial purposes \u2013 not science.\u201dMorishita accused Australia and other countries of offering only \u201cemotional\u201d arguments in defence of an animal that had come to be seen as \u201ccharismatic\u201d.Japan, by contrast, was only interested in scientific proof that sustainable use of an \u201cordinary marine resource\u201d was possible. He said weak demand for whale meat among Japanese consumers was no reason to end the slaughter.\u201cYes, if you ask ordinary Japanese people they say they don\u2019t eat whale meat, but at the same time they say they don\u2019t like the idea of being told not to eat it by people who eat, say, beef.\u201cPeople in India don\u2019t eat beef, but what if they started a campaign against McDonald\u2019s in other countries, perhaps imposing economic sanctions? You can see the stupidity of the [anti-whaling] argument when you apply it to beef. But what is the difference between cows and whales?\u201dThe resumption of whaling in the Antarctic could be short-lived. From 2016, \u201cscientific\u201d whale hunts must first be reviewed and approved by the general membership of the IWC, the majority of which is anti-whaling.The next hunt will not be subject to the requirement because it is due to start a year before the IWC\u2019S next meeting.", "tags": ["Whaling", "Whales", "Conservation", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Australia news", "Environment", "Japan", "Marine life", "New Zealand"], "title": "Japan likens anti-whaling campaign to attempt to ban kimono"},{"date": "2014-11-28T14:57:33Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japanese officials will evaluate the possible impact on health of smoking e-cigarettes after researchers found that devices bought in Japan contain up to 10 times more formaldehyde - a cancer-causing substance - than conventional cigarettes.The findings, announced this week, have re-ignited the debate over whether e-cigarettes are a risk-free alternative to tobacco smoking, as more young people take up the vaping habit.Researchers at Japan\u2019s National Institute for Public Health said they had found two carcinogens - formaldehyde and acetaldehyde \u2013 in vapour produced by several types of e-cigarettes during a study commissioned by the country\u2019s health ministry.One brand of e-cigarette produced 10 times more formaldehyde \u2013 a substance used in embalming that has also been linked to sick building syndrome \u2013 than a regular cigarette, said Naoki Kunugita, who led the research.\u201cEspecially when the wire (which vapourises the liquid) gets overheated, higher amounts of those harmful substances seemed to be produced,\u201d he told AFP. He added: \u201cWe need to be aware that some makers are selling such products for dual use (with tobacco) or as a gateway for young people [to start smoking].\u201dThe experts analysed several cartridges of e-cigarette fluid using a machine that \u201cinhaled\u201d 10 sets of 15 puffs. One new brand of e-cigarette, whose name has not been made public, showed a more than 10-fold increase in formaldehyde levels in nine out of every 10 sets. The device produced 1,600 micrograms of formaldehyde per 15 puffs.Health ministry officials acknowledged that the elevated formaldehyde levels found in a single brand of e-cigarette was not proof in itself that vaping posed an increased cancer risk.\u201cThe most important finding is that the vapour contained recognised carcinogens,\u201d Hiroyuki Noda, of the health ministry\u2019s tobacco-free initiative, told the Guardian. \u201cOur panel of experts will now look into what possible effects those substances could have on the health of e-cigarette users.\u201dSome experts said the findings offered no proof that e-cigarettes could harm papers\u2019 health.Writing on the e-cigarette research website, the Greek cardiologist Konstantinos Farsalinos said the offending device tested by Kunugita was \u201ca single extreme case out of the many products he tested,\u201d adding that the high formaldehyde reading may have been caused by several factors, including a faulty e-cigarette.\u201cObviously, we have to realise that focusing the discussion on one of the tens of carcinogens present in tobacco cigarette smoke is misleading,\u201d Farsalinos said.\u201cEven if e-cigarettes contained similar, or higher, levels of formaldehyde, they do not contain the majority of other toxic and carcinogenic substances present in cigarette smoke. Overall, any residual risk from e-cigarette use is orders of magnitude lower than smoking. This is exactly what smokers need (and deserve) to know.\u201dKunugita said officials would evaluate vaping\u2019s possible impact on health before discussing whether or not to regulate the sale and use of e-cigarettes in Japan.Vaping is quickly gaining popularity in Japan, where cigarette smoking is still tolerated in many enclosed and public spaces, even though the smoking rate among adults is at an all-time low. Like many other countries, Japan does not regulate e-cigarettes, but they have yet to become widely available in shops. Most Japanese users order e-cigarettes and flavoured liquids online.Until recently, e-cigarettes were hailed around the world as a safer alternative to smoking, and have been credited with helping tobacco smokers quit their old habit.The number of young people in the US who have tried e-cigarettes tripled from 2011 to 2013, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, adding that more than a quarter of a million young people who had never smoked a cigarette used e-cigarettes last year.In August, the World Health Organisation called on governments to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, warning that they posed a serious threat to the health of children and unborn babies. Authorities in the Australian state of Queensland, meanwhile, have announced restrictions on the sale and advertising of e-cigarettes from next January.But some health professionals have criticised attempts to restrict the availability of e-cigarettes, citing evidence that they are an effective smoking cessation aid.Writing in the British Journal of General Practice, Prof Robert West and Dr Jamie Brown from University College London said that for every million smokers who switch from tobacco to e-cigarettes, more than 6,000 premature deaths would be prevented in the UK every year.If all 9 million smokers took up e-cigarettes instead, 54,000 lives could be saved, they said.", "tags": ["E-cigarettes", "Smoking", "Society", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Health"], "title": "Japan to investigate e-cigarette safety after formaldehyde findings"},{"date": "2014-12-16T04:19:07Z", "country": "japan", "content": "First came a hitch to butter supplies just as millions of Japanese prepare to tuck into Christmas cake. Now the country\u2019s fast food lovers are contending with a shortage of french fries due to a labour dispute taking place on the other side of the Pacific.More than 3,000 McDonald\u2019s restaurants in Japan \u2013 the biggest Asian market for US frozen potato products \u2013 said on Tuesday they would sell only small-sized portions of fries for the foreseeable future amid severe delays in imports of thousands of tonnes of the chain\u2019s staple accompaniment to a Big Mac.The long transit times, which have more than doubled to between two and four weeks, have been blamed on a protracted dispute between 20,000 dockworkers and terminal operators and shipping lines at 29 ports on the US west coast.The supply line has been further disrupted by a shortage of equipment to handle cargo, as well as rail service delays and the introduction of super-sized cargo vessels, reports said.

Tokyo). This four-day event brought together both international and Japanese leaders across politics and business. I was impressed by the real sense of urgency in working together to increase women\u2019s active role in economies worldwide \u2013 and by the efforts of prime minister Shinzo Abe to champion the need for women to play a vital role in reinvigorating the Japanese economy.Organised by the government of Japan, along with other Japanese organisations and institutions, the focus of the event was the link between female participation in the workforce and economic growth. This is particularly pertinent to Japan, which has an increasingly ageing population and a very great need for higher labour force participation rates among women. Even though Japanese women graduates are among the best qualified in the world, they face huge discrimination in the workforce \u2013 and this is despite the Equal Opportunity Employment law which came to effect in the country in 1986. Increasing the level of women\u2019s participation in the labour market to that of men\u2019s could see 7.1m people join Japan\u2019s shrinking workforce, potentially increasing the country\u2019s GDP by nearly 13%. While female representation on Japanese company boards is a mere 1%.While women in north America and Europe have been vital participants in the workforce since the 1960s, going from housewives, to clerical workers and finally to top executives, Japan has lagged behind. Now about 60% of women quit their jobs when their first child is born.Prime minister Abe believes that in order to modernise the Japanese economy, the country needs to start \u201ctapping into its most underutilised resource: Japanese women\u201d. Abe insists that his policies are all about empowering women and is actively trying to promote higher participation rates with his goal for Japan to have 30% of all leadership positions filled by women by 2020.During the opening session of Waw! I joined Japan\u2019s first lady Akie Abe in conversation on stage. In a country where first ladies are considered best when seen but not heard, Mrs Abe\u2019s public appearance at a government-sponsored women\u2019s conference was anything but conventional. Mrs Abe is a huge supporter of her husband\u2019s policy of promoting women\u2019s advancement, which has been described as \u201cwomenomics\u201d. In a light hearted exchange with her husband on stage, she revealed that he undertakes domestic chores, something that may seem unremarkable, but given that only 2.6% of men take paternity leave in Japan for fear of harming their career prospects, her message was clear albeit subtle, that men have a part to play in helping women take their place in the workforce.2015 is the 20th anniversary of the Beijing declaration and Platform for Action, and the 59th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) will be held in March.

But what if another country then said that only a small number of women could wear kimono?\u201dHe added that Japan had responded adequately to ICJ criticisms in a revised scientific whaling program revealed last week, adding that he fully expected the country\u2019s fleet would leave for the Antarctic at the end of next year.Under the 1986 IWC moratorium on commercial whaling, Japan was permitted to kill almost 1,000 mainly minke whales a year for \u201cscientific research\u201d. Meat from the slaughtered whales is sold on the open market, although a dramatic drop in demand in recent decades means thousands of tonnes of meat has been left unsold.The world court withdrew Japan\u2019s whaling licence in the Antarctic, forcing officials in Tokyo to devise a new program that they say has solid scientific foundations.\u201cSome countries won\u2019t allow any whale hunting under any circumstances,\u201d Morishita said on Wednesday, a week after Japan unveiled its new scientific whaling proposal.\u201cThey have a zero-tolerance policy. But it\u2019s time to end that paradigm. If we don\u2019t, there is no reason for the IWC to exist.\u201dIn its revised program, Japan says it will kill 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean next year, and a total of 3,996 over 12 years. The quota is significantly lower than the 850 minke whales it targeted each year until Australia\u2019s legal challenge at The Hague put a temporary halt to the hunt.Australia has been the most vocal opponent of Japan\u2019s lethal research hunts in an area of the Southern Ocean that Canberra regards as a whale sanctuary.Environmental groups condemned the new plans. \u201cJapan\u2019s new whaling proposal for the Southern Ocean sanctuary is neither new nor improved,\u201d said Kitty Block, vice-president of the Humane Society International.\u201cDespite the ICJ decision condemning the nation\u2019s so-called scientific program, Japan is still trying to explain the inexplicable and defend the indefensible. The hunt is for commercial purposes \u2013 not science.\u201dMorishita accused Australia and other countries of offering only \u201cemotional\u201d arguments in defence of an animal that had come to be seen as \u201ccharismatic\u201d.Japan, by contrast, was only interested in scientific proof that sustainable use of an \u201cordinary marine resource\u201d was possible. He said weak demand for whale meat among Japanese consumers was no reason to end the slaughter.\u201cYes, if you ask ordinary Japanese people they say they don\u2019t eat whale meat, but at the same time they say they don\u2019t like the idea of being told not to eat it by people who eat, say, beef.\u201cPeople in India don\u2019t eat beef, but what if they started a campaign against McDonald\u2019s in other countries, perhaps imposing economic sanctions? You can see the stupidity of the [anti-whaling] argument when you apply it to beef. But what is the difference between cows and whales?\u201dThe resumption of whaling in the Antarctic could be short-lived. From 2016, \u201cscientific\u201d whale hunts must first be reviewed and approved by the general membership of the IWC, the majority of which is anti-whaling.The next hunt will not be subject to the requirement because it is due to start a year before the IWC\u2019S next meeting.", "tags": ["Whaling", "Whales", "Conservation", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Australia news", "Environment", "Japan", "Marine life", "New Zealand"], "title": "Japan likens anti-whaling campaign to attempt to ban kimono"},{"date": "2014-11-28T14:57:33Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japanese officials will evaluate the possible impact on health of smoking e-cigarettes after researchers found that devices bought in Japan contain up to 10 times more formaldehyde - a cancer-causing substance - than conventional cigarettes.The findings, announced this week, have re-ignited the debate over whether e-cigarettes are a risk-free alternative to tobacco smoking, as more young people take up the vaping habit.Researchers at Japan\u2019s National Institute for Public Health said they had found two carcinogens - formaldehyde and acetaldehyde \u2013 in vapour produced by several types of e-cigarettes during a study commissioned by the country\u2019s health ministry.One brand of e-cigarette produced 10 times more formaldehyde \u2013 a substance used in embalming that has also been linked to sick building syndrome \u2013 than a regular cigarette, said Naoki Kunugita, who led the research.\u201cEspecially when the wire (which vapourises the liquid) gets overheated, higher amounts of those harmful substances seemed to be produced,\u201d he told AFP. He added: \u201cWe need to be aware that some makers are selling such products for dual use (with tobacco) or as a gateway for young people [to start smoking].\u201dThe experts analysed several cartridges of e-cigarette fluid using a machine that \u201cinhaled\u201d 10 sets of 15 puffs. One new brand of e-cigarette, whose name has not been made public, showed a more than 10-fold increase in formaldehyde levels in nine out of every 10 sets. The device produced 1,600 micrograms of formaldehyde per 15 puffs.Health ministry officials acknowledged that the elevated formaldehyde levels found in a single brand of e-cigarette was not proof in itself that vaping posed an increased cancer risk.\u201cThe most important finding is that the vapour contained recognised carcinogens,\u201d Hiroyuki Noda, of the health ministry\u2019s tobacco-free initiative, told the Guardian. \u201cOur panel of experts will now look into what possible effects those substances could have on the health of e-cigarette users.\u201dSome experts said the findings offered no proof that e-cigarettes could harm papers\u2019 health.Writing on the e-cigarette research website, the Greek cardiologist Konstantinos Farsalinos said the offending device tested by Kunugita was \u201ca single extreme case out of the many products he tested,\u201d adding that the high formaldehyde reading may have been caused by several factors, including a faulty e-cigarette.\u201cObviously, we have to realise that focusing the discussion on one of the tens of carcinogens present in tobacco cigarette smoke is misleading,\u201d Farsalinos said.\u201cEven if e-cigarettes contained similar, or higher, levels of formaldehyde, they do not contain the majority of other toxic and carcinogenic substances present in cigarette smoke. Overall, any residual risk from e-cigarette use is orders of magnitude lower than smoking. This is exactly what smokers need (and deserve) to know.\u201dKunugita said officials would evaluate vaping\u2019s possible impact on health before discussing whether or not to regulate the sale and use of e-cigarettes in Japan.Vaping is quickly gaining popularity in Japan, where cigarette smoking is still tolerated in many enclosed and public spaces, even though the smoking rate among adults is at an all-time low. Like many other countries, Japan does not regulate e-cigarettes, but they have yet to become widely available in shops. Most Japanese users order e-cigarettes and flavoured liquids online.Until recently, e-cigarettes were hailed around the world as a safer alternative to smoking, and have been credited with helping tobacco smokers quit their old habit.The number of young people in the US who have tried e-cigarettes tripled from 2011 to 2013, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, adding that more than a quarter of a million young people who had never smoked a cigarette used e-cigarettes last year.In August, the World Health Organisation called on governments to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, warning that they posed a serious threat to the health of children and unborn babies. Authorities in the Australian state of Queensland, meanwhile, have announced restrictions on the sale and advertising of e-cigarettes from next January.But some health professionals have criticised attempts to restrict the availability of e-cigarettes, citing evidence that they are an effective smoking cessation aid.Writing in the British Journal of General Practice, Prof Robert West and Dr Jamie Brown from University College London said that for every million smokers who switch from tobacco to e-cigarettes, more than 6,000 premature deaths would be prevented in the UK every year.If all 9 million smokers took up e-cigarettes instead, 54,000 lives could be saved, they said.", "tags": ["E-cigarettes", "Smoking", "Society", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Health"], "title": "Japan to investigate e-cigarette safety after formaldehyde findings"},{"date": "2014-11-18T11:00:03Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has unveiled a plan to kill 333 minke whales in the Southern Ocean next year as part of its push to resume whaling following a legal setback instigated by Australia.The plan, released by the Japanese government on Tuesday, sets out a 12-year program that would result in the slaughter of a total of 3,996 whales. The whales will be hunted in a vast sweep of Antarctic waters, including ocean claimed by Australia.The 333 annual figure is a sharp reduction in the previous quota Japan awarded itself last year, when it aimed to take 855 minke whales, 50 humpback whales and 10 fin whales. Japan ended up harpooning far fewer than this amount, however, due to the disruptive tactics of anti-whaling activists Sea Shepherd.Japan suspended its annual whale hunt following an adverse ruling at the international court of justice in March. The case brought by Australia and supported by New Zealand successfully argued that Japan\u2019s program was not scientific and was simply a fa\u00e7ade for commercial whaling.However, Japan has committed to starting a new whaling program in the Southern Ocean at the end of 2015. This is despite a non-binding vote at a International Whaling Commission meeting in September, which demanded strict limits upon Japan\u2019s whaling activities.At the September meeting, Greg Hunt, Australia\u2019s environment minister, said his country\u2019s opposition to whaling remained.\u201cAustralia is of the view that lethal scientific research is not necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cAll information necessary for the contemporary conservation and management of whales can be obtained non-lethally.\u201dDarren Kindleysides, director of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the new plan was merely a \u201crepackaging\u201d of the previous JARPA II, the official name of the Japanese whaling program.\u201cWe can collect all the information we need from whales using non-lethal means and the ICJ said Japan needs to look at those non-lethal means,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cAnd yet the bottom line is that Japan wants to kill more than 300 minke whales.\u201cJapan is trying its best to push through what it has done in the past. They are thumbing their nose to the ICJ and the international community.\u201cThe onus is on our prime minister to tell his Japanese counterpart that Australia won\u2019t stand idly by and watch whalers return to the Southern Ocean. We need to tell Japan we are deeply unhappy they have put forward a so-called scientific plan so soon after such a damning judgment against them.\u201dPatrick Ramage, the global whale program director for International Fund for Animal Welfare, said: \u201cThis plan should be dead on arrival when it arrives at the IWC scientific committee next year.\u201cIt is time for Japan to finally end its outdated, cruel and unscientific killing of whales.\u201d", "tags": ["Whaling", "Animals", "Conservation", "Marine life", "Whales", "Cetaceans", "Wildlife", "Fishing", "Food", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "United Nations", "Environment"], "title": "Japan cuts Antarctic whale quota after UN court ruling"},{"date": "2015-02-23T22:59:02Z", "country": "japan", "content": "It is 140 years old, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies and a much-loved Japanese national institution.

Conservation groups have revealed that Norwegian exports of minke whale to Japan contained damaging levels of toxic pesticides, making that meat unfit for human consumption. It\u2019s a discovery that could cue a swifter decline in the appetite for whale. The news emerged this month, when the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) revealed documents showing that the Japanese government rejected imports of Norwegian whale meat because tests showed samples contained pesticides at twice the limit Japan imposes on its imports. The meat harboured chemicals such as aldrin, dieldrin, and chlordane, thought to play a role in causing birth defects, neurological harm, and some cancers if humans consume them in high quantities. Norway continues to run a large scale whaling industry\u2014the country took a record catch of 736 minke whales in 2014\u2014but surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t exist for Norwegians. \u201cFewer than five percent [of Norwegians] eat whale meat regularly,\u201d says Kate O\u2019Connell, a marine wildlife consultant from the AWI, explaining that they see it as old-fashioned fare. By comparison, Japan is a much bigger market. \u201cJapan has always been the main consumer of whale products,\u201d says Clare Perry, the head of the EIA\u2019s oceans campaign. But even there, it\u2019s losing its appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s not fashionable at all. There\u2019s an older generation in Japan that have a nostalgia about eating it, but it\u2019s not in any way a staple diet,\u201d she says. Nevertheless, a chunk of the Norwegian catch is still exported there annually: 137 tonnes of Norwegian minke have entered Japan in the last two years.Proof of pesticide poisoning may somewhat sour that appetite, something that even a global hunting ban hasn\u2019t been able to quash. There are three remaining countries that continue to hunt and eat whale commercially \u2014 Norway, Japan, and Iceland\u2014and each one ignores the worldwide ruling against this activity.In 1982 the International Whaling Commission completely outlawed commercial whale hunting. \u201cThat applies to all countries that are members of the IWC. Japan, Norway, and Iceland are all members of the IWC,\u201d Perry emphasizes. The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) also bans the trade in minke meat to protect the species, which isn\u2019t endangered but has experienced a dramatic population dive since whaling began. \u201cThere\u2019s concern over whether the hunt is sustainable,\u201d Perry notes. (Norway insists that it is, which explains why it still awards itself an annual catch quota of more than 1000 whales, one the IWC doesn\u2019t acknowledge.)When the international moratorium came into force in the 80s, Norway objected to it, which afforded the country a legal loophole that allows it to continue the hunt while maintaining its IWC membership. Norway, Iceland, and Japan also reject the CITES ban, a move that technically permits them to continue with the trade. \u201cFrom our perspective Norway should be abiding by those treaties,\u201d Perry says.Until that happens, it seems like pesticide contamination is the whales\u2019 best defence\u2014though it\u2019s also bound to harm the whales. The chemicals identified in the minkes\u2019 meat are agriculture products that would most likely have entered the ocean via agricultural run-off. Some of the pesticides, like dieldrin and chlordane, have been banned in the European Union and the United States because of their toxic effects. Because they\u2019re persistent pollutants, however, they\u2019ve lingered in the ocean. By entering the food chain and bioaccumulating within it, the chemicals eventually find their way into the bodies of larger mammals like whales. \u201cIf we think it\u2019s potentially dangerous for us to eat, you can imagine it\u2019s not particularly healthy for a whale,\u201d Perry says. As Norway\u2019s appetite for the meat dwindles, it continues to pursue markets elsewhere for its whales. But that may grow more challenging, especially since the recent meat scare isn\u2019t the first the country has caused. In fact, in the past, shipments of Norwegian whale meat have been found to be infested with bacteria and also to contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury.Within Norway, there are ongoing efforts to try and revive the meat\u2019s appeal, and there are even generous government subsidies in place to try and support the industry and keep this historical practice alive. \u201cIt is clear, however, that without an export market, the Norwegian whaling industry will continue to struggle,\u201d O\u2019Connell says. In that sense, perhaps for whales the pesticides are a morbid kind of defence against the minority that still has a taste for their meat.", "tags": ["Environment"], "title": "Japan refuses Norway's toxic whale meat"},{"date": "2015-02-23T22:59:02Z", "country": "japan", "content": "It is 140 years old, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies and a much-loved Japanese national institution.

Somewhere in the mix of childhood influences ranging from You Only Live Twice and Shogun, to Tenko and those Clive James shows, came an impression of a complex, frenzied, contradictory and quietly beautiful culture that fascinated me. There\u2019s one thing all the guidebooks agree on, though: don\u2019t go in August. Go in springtime, when the cherry blossom blooms. Or in autumn, when the copious greenery turns a blazing copper. But avoid hot and humid August. So, on 9 August last year, my friend Emma and I depart.Tokyo, when we get there, has caught the tail end of a super-typhoon. After a long flight, it\u2019s genuinely refreshing to walk through the sweeping curtains of rain. Itchy-eyed and numbed with jet lag, we nevertheless manage to shuffle around the excellent Tokyo National Museum, everything feeling slightly unreal and accompanied by a constant clip-clop refrain as though someone were following us around with a glockenspiel. It turns out to be a young couple in exquisite his & hers kimonos and those dazzlingly white, slightly sinister bifurcated socks, their chunky wooden sandals beating the distinctive tattoo as they traipse around.Struggling to stay awake, we find a nice little place to eat. There\u2019s much pointing and laughter as we negotiate our way around the menus, but the waiters are kind and helpful. Though we\u2019re screened from our fellow diners by laminated curtains, the smoke from their scandalous-seeming cigarettes drifts through on to our delicious raw quail. It\u2019s quite nostalgic. We drive back through a violent storm, Tokyo now bursting into blurry neon life: the cab driver in white gloves, the car with whispering automatic doors, like something from the future as envisioned in the 1970s.The next day, after a fantastic sleep, there\u2019s an apologetic waitress at breakfast: \u201cSorry for keeping you waiting.\u201d She bows and smiles and smiles and bows, though she hasn\u2019t kept us waiting at all. We go down on to the amazingly clean, efficient tube system, which is fairly quiet during this holiday period, with none of the fabled pushing and shoving. First stop: the famous Tsukiji fish market; a strange mix of working atmosphere and tourist attraction. Octopus suckers writhe in smashed ice. Men with hooks slice at giant frozen tuna, like medieval artisans carving pink alabaster pillars. Tuna flakes skitter to the floor, though whether they\u2019re thrown away or headed for Sainsbury\u2019s, it\u2019s impossible to know.Next, we visit the first of many (many) shrines. One was erected to the memory of the great reforming Emperor Meiji, with beautifully laid-out forest trails leading to purification areas and little booths where you can make a wish for the spirits to answer. It soon becomes clear that all the shrines have these, like concessions in a department store, flogging benedictions. Is it any different, though, I wonder, to the little shops in cathedrals selling CDs of plainsong? The rituals involve washing both hands and the mouth, then writing down a wish that is hung up on a wooden plaque. There is something a bit relentless about the commercialisation of this, and about the sheer number of shrines you traipse through.One fascinating aspect of the Meiji temple are the strange indentations that cover the great wooden pillars and doors. With more than 3 million visitors a year, it can get very busy. Pilgrims have taken simply to hurling coins towards the shrine from a great distance, pockmarking the woodwork. They do offer, though, oases of calm in the sometimes overwhelming bustle. Most have been lovingly rebuilt after total destruction during the war.We plunge back into a crazier, ultra-fashionable, teen-centred Tokyo \u2013 though, as always in a strange city, I fear that I\u2019m actually standing in the middle of the equivalent of London\u2019s Camden Town. Fashions are mysterious and charming. Many women wear a sun-shunning outfit of broad-brimmed hat, long gloves and pretty lacy parasol of dusty pink or grey. They look like Victorian ghosts in surgical masks, keeping to the hard shadows or cycling past on the thronged pavement.Next day we leave for Hiroshima and our first experience of the bullet train. It is filled with impossibly cute children and super-efficient staff who bow as they enter and leave each carriage: the levels of courtesy and friendliness are so staggeringly different from Britain, it\u2019s shaming.Hiroshima is a quietly devastating place. Now a bustling modern city, it\u2019s nevertheless entirely defined by the events of 6 August 1945, and signs everywhere show what used to stand or how far you are from the \u201chypocentre\u201d of the atomic explosion. The shattered dome above which the A-bomb detonated stands within the Peace Park, where the accompanying museum pulls no punches. Inside are displays of melted spectacles, watches all stopped at 8.15am, burned and bloodied children\u2019s clothing, dropped-out hair, fingernails. We emerge, humbled and moved, into a balmy red evening, scores of people sitting in quiet contemplation.Later, down a back street, we find a tiny place for dinner. It has linen curtains and fat lanterns outside, and an atmosphere of slightly seedy congeniality with more, nicely rowdy smokers within. I jab a finger at the all-Japanese menu in the hope of ordering beer. Two tumblers of pale liquid arrive. \u201cIt looks like whisky!\u201d I laugh. It is whisky. But, again, the staff are incredibly helpful, beaming, fun. We get by with a little Japanese and a little English, and enjoy huge grilled peppers with fish flakes on top and delicious sea bass with sticky rice.A short train and ferry ride from Hiroshima is Miyajima Island, a Unesco world heritage site, where deer roam freely, nudging at tourists, tripping in and out of streams. Sadly, they\u2019ve gone the way of all creatures closely exposed to humans, scavenging for food and, like ravenous goats, even eating paper maps. But if you get away from the heavily commercialised harbour, the island becomes more serene and attractive. There\u2019s an unexpectedly brilliant aquarium full of delights: otters, sharks, porpoises. Moon jellyfish that change colour from white to blue to pink to green. Up the hills, through verdant gardens, are more temples with sun dazzling off their tin roofs, sonorous tolling bells and dozens of smiling buddhas wearing little knitted\u2248hats and bibs, most old and weathered, like grave goods. It transpires that there\u2019s to be a fireworks display later and suddenly the whole island is thronged with visitors, most of them courting young couples, again in gorgeous kimonos. Apparently it\u2019s become very fashionable for the young to wear these traditional clothes again, especially on dates. It\u2019s touching to see boys and girls both looking splendid and in love. We dine, cross-legged, on oysters and eel, then watch the fireworks bloom over the island.Another super-efficient bullet train takes us to Fukuoka \u2013 the \u201cgateway to southern Japan\u201d. As we race through the countryside, the landscape can suddenly transform. Breathtaking mists creep over the mountains. A shaft of sun on a powder-blue tiled roof, or the broad white wings of cranes in wet fields, suddenly illuminate quite how different this place is. We\u2019re on a whistlestop tour, including a video of an extraordinary local carnival \u2013 which we\u2019ve just missed \u2013 in which hundreds of trouserless men in white shirts carry massive floats on six poles. It\u2019s like the running of the bulls, but with buttocks. It turns out the shirts are a fairly recent addition, because people thought the near-nakedness was offensive. Why they didn\u2019t think to put trousers on is beyond me.In the evening, with much fanfare, we\u2019re taken to a two-star Michelin restaurant to eat the infamous fugu fish. It\u2019s an intoxicating prospect (with the emphasis on the toxic), because the flesh of the puffer fish is more deadly than cyanide. Only a small part is edible. The restaurant is wonderfully minimal, plain, cedar-scented, paper-walled, just as you\u2019d hope it to be. We\u2019re given a short tour of the kitchens and see the fugu, which arrives pre-prepared in a box, like shoes. We\u2019re closely observed as we eat, like royal food-tasters under the eye of a wary monarch. The fugu itself is curiously bland. It comes in razor-thin slivers and has a rainbow hue, like petrol in the road. But the accompanying flavours into which we dip the fish (tiny leeks, spring onions, risotto) are delicious, and one course, unexpectedly, comes in batter. Just like Harry Ramsden\u2019s, but with the frisson of potential death.Still alive, next day we take the train to Nagasaki: a very different prospect to Hiroshima. As (almost) the only port open to the west during Japan\u2019s 200-year period of isolation, it has a ramshackle mix of influences. There are lovely clapboard colonial houses from the Dutch and Portuguese settlements, and a proper neon maze of a Chinatown. Walking into town by the canal-side, you catch dark, scuttling shapes out of the corner of the eye. Astonishingly, they\u2019re crabs, hiding in the grates and drains. Loud firecrackers start to go off \u2013 it\u2019s Obon, the Japanese festival of the dead. As the humid air breaks into driving rain, there\u2019s a strange, warm calm. An off-key bell tolls as families carry huge, lantern-covered \u201cships of the dead\u201d down the winding streets in memory of lost loved ones, including, delightfully, a photo of Elvis. Firecrackers burst and spark in the rain, and gunpowder drifts across us in clouds. As we get back to the hotel, teams of men with witch brooms and surgical masks sweep up the soggy remains of the fireworks. Next morning, there\u2019s not a trace. Curiously, while Japanese cities are quite grubby-looking and industrialised, litter is virtually nonexistent. It simply doesn\u2019t occur to people to drop rubbish.Next stop: Kagoshima. It\u2019s a hot and cloudy day, and the volcano is smothered in cloud when we arrive. The resort in Ibusuki is beautifully designed, with luxurious, cool rooms in traditional Japanese style, as unlike a western spa as you can imagine. Men and women (segregated into different areas) walk about happily naked. There are plunge pools and steam baths and the famous sand baths, warmed by natural springs. We change into kimonos and Emma and I are buried up to our necks in the soft, grey, alien-looking sand by stringy young men with rakes. It\u2019s a strangely pleasant sensation, not too hot. We last about 15 minutes, the sweat beading our faces like raindrops. Only Boris Yeltsin, apparently, has managed to last more than half an hour entombed like this. We\u2019re soon hysterical as our host, the extraordinarily kind Mr Shimotakehara, asks us which parasol we want planting into the sand over our heads, like bathing belles on an Edwardian postcard.A long train journey gets us into Kyoto, back in the central region of Honshu island, which is immediately very different from anywhere else we\u2019ve been. Charming, winding streets and lots of older buildings not flattened in the war. There are shrines, of course, but also genuinely lovely shops and cafes. We have a gorgeous (and very cheap) sushi lunch with green tea ice-cream, and then there\u2019s much excitement as a couple of genuine geishas \u2013 apparently a rare sight \u2013 stroll by. It really is something to see them: the death mask faces, the fantastically elaborate hair, the tiny strip of exposed skin at the nape of the neck.Dusk shows Kyoto at its best. There\u2019s a low-key quality to the atmosphere, subtle and quiet, especially in the charming Pontocho Alley with its half-turned-down lamps, where we eat the justly famous black beef.Next day, we visit the Shogun\u2019s palace with its extraordinary sprung \u201cnightingale\u201d floors designed to squeak in order to warn of assassins and then, farther afield, to the Fushimi shrine with its endless orange tunnel. It\u2019s undeniably spectacular, but we\u2019re shrined-out by now. Then it\u2019s on to the towering bamboo forest, with a swollen, muddy yellow river close by, and fit men doing rickshaw rides with the same swagger as lads on waltzers, cocky and rough.We\u2019re sad to leave Kyoto \u2013 the undoubted hit of the trip \u2013 but one last night in Tokyo affords an astonishing view of the city. Railways stretching under motorways, cars blurring into a sea of light as we head for the Golden Gai \u2013 an extraordinary district of tiny, themed bars, each holding about 10 people. The strains of the Specials\u2019 Ghost Town lead us to a sort of 1979 punk bar with a new wave soundtrack. There\u2019s a fantastic incongruity to listening to Sparks and Blondie in the smoky atmosphere. We drink too much sake, happy.Above all, it\u2019s the people who make Japan. I\u2019ve never been met with such extraordinary kindness, courtesy and friendliness. There\u2019s far more English spoken than people lead you to think, and signage is bilingual \u2013 especially on the trains. I plan to return \u2013 in the spring, of course, or the autumn \u2013 as soon as I can. If this sounds evangelical, it is. Even in sultry August, Japan is a wonder. Go.Flights were provided by Finnair, which flies to Japan via Helsinki from \u00a3590 return, including taxes. Rail passes were provided by Japanese National Tourist Board; they cost \u00a3159 for a seven-day pass. Accommodation was provided by Hyatt Regency Kyoto (doubles from \u00a3122, room-only); Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo (doubles from \u00a3276 per night B&B); and Ibsuki Hakusuikan, a Japanese inn with an onsen hot spring spa (doubles from \u00a3188, half-board). Set fugu-tasting menus are available at two-Michelin-starred Hakata Izumi (the website is in Japanese only): lunch from \u00a320, dinner from \u00a356 \u2013 book through your Fukuoka hotel\u2019s concierge.

And soon, investors will have the opportunity to claim a stake of their own.Plans to float part of Japan Post\u2019s business, which were announced in December, represent the culmination of a lengthy process with much at stake politically. The holding company, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies, and two of its four subsidiaries \u2013 tasked with banking and insurance \u2013 will be opened to investors.The holding company will continue to manage postal services and mail delivery, to which the Japanese are very attached due to the extensive network reaching even the most remote corners of the archipelago.The project will be submitted to the Tokyo stock exchange in June, with the goal of organising an initial public offering between August and December. \u201cThe law on privatisation of Japan Post requires us to bring in private equity as soon as possible,\u201d said CEO Taizo Nishimuro, adding that listing the three parts of the business at the same time \u201cwas the best way to ensure fair valuation\u201d. Eleven banks, including JP Morgan and Nomura Holdings, will manage the operation.Privatisation will involve several steps. The first phase should raise \u00a51tn to \u00a52tn ($8.4bn to $16.8bn) according to Japan\u2019s ministry of finance, which has given the go-ahead for the initial public offering. The proceeds will be used to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake, tidal wave and subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster that hit Japan in March 2011.The holding company \u2013 in which the state can legally retain a 30% share \u2013 will gradually divest itself of its interests in banking and insurance, until it owns only 50% of the whole. The two activities will thus gain a degree of independence, opening the way for diversification.The banking division manages deposits worth \u00a5178tn, consisting mainly of pensioners\u2019 savings. The funds are used to buy low-yield treasury bonds, which finance public debt and infrastructure spending in Japan.Under the changes, the banking division hopes to be permitted to make loans to big business and issue mortgages. Its distribution network will be enlarged and there are plans for partnerships with regional bodies. One of the objectives is to offer financial services in areas where there are few banks.The insurance division, which has so far concentrated on life insurance, is also keen to diversify.The question is whether investors, particularly from abroad, will find the offering attractive. Between April and September Japan Post generated \u00a5217bn in profits, but its postal services division is running at a loss.

Though we\u2019re screened from our fellow diners by laminated curtains, the smoke from their scandalous-seeming cigarettes drifts through on to our delicious raw quail. It\u2019s quite nostalgic. We drive back through a violent storm, Tokyo now bursting into blurry neon life: the cab driver in white gloves, the car with whispering automatic doors, like something from the future as envisioned in the 1970s.The next day, after a fantastic sleep, there\u2019s an apologetic waitress at breakfast: \u201cSorry for keeping you waiting.\u201d She bows and smiles and smiles and bows, though she hasn\u2019t kept us waiting at all. We go down on to the amazingly clean, efficient tube system, which is fairly quiet during this holiday period, with none of the fabled pushing and shoving. First stop: the famous Tsukiji fish market; a strange mix of working atmosphere and tourist attraction. Octopus suckers writhe in smashed ice. Men with hooks slice at giant frozen tuna, like medieval artisans carving pink alabaster pillars. Tuna flakes skitter to the floor, though whether they\u2019re thrown away or headed for Sainsbury\u2019s, it\u2019s impossible to know.Next, we visit the first of many (many) shrines. One was erected to the memory of the great reforming Emperor Meiji, with beautifully laid-out forest trails leading to purification areas and little booths where you can make a wish for the spirits to answer. It soon becomes clear that all the shrines have these, like concessions in a department store, flogging benedictions. Is it any different, though, I wonder, to the little shops in cathedrals selling CDs of plainsong? The rituals involve washing both hands and the mouth, then writing down a wish that is hung up on a wooden plaque. There is something a bit relentless about the commercialisation of this, and about the sheer number of shrines you traipse through.One fascinating aspect of the Meiji temple are the strange indentations that cover the great wooden pillars and doors. With more than 3 million visitors a year, it can get very busy. Pilgrims have taken simply to hurling coins towards the shrine from a great distance, pockmarking the woodwork. They do offer, though, oases of calm in the sometimes overwhelming bustle. Most have been lovingly rebuilt after total destruction during the war.We plunge back into a crazier, ultra-fashionable, teen-centred Tokyo \u2013 though, as always in a strange city, I fear that I\u2019m actually standing in the middle of the equivalent of London\u2019s Camden Town. Fashions are mysterious and charming. Many women wear a sun-shunning outfit of broad-brimmed hat, long gloves and pretty lacy parasol of dusty pink or grey. They look like Victorian ghosts in surgical masks, keeping to the hard shadows or cycling past on the thronged pavement.Next day we leave for Hiroshima and our first experience of the bullet train. It is filled with impossibly cute children and super-efficient staff who bow as they enter and leave each carriage: the levels of courtesy and friendliness are so staggeringly different from Britain, it\u2019s shaming.Hiroshima is a quietly devastating place. Now a bustling modern city, it\u2019s nevertheless entirely defined by the events of 6 August 1945, and signs everywhere show what used to stand or how far you are from the \u201chypocentre\u201d of the atomic explosion. The shattered dome above which the A-bomb detonated stands within the Peace Park, where the accompanying museum pulls no punches. Inside are displays of melted spectacles, watches all stopped at 8.15am, burned and bloodied children\u2019s clothing, dropped-out hair, fingernails. We emerge, humbled and moved, into a balmy red evening, scores of people sitting in quiet contemplation.Later, down a back street, we find a tiny place for dinner. It has linen curtains and fat lanterns outside, and an atmosphere of slightly seedy congeniality with more, nicely rowdy smokers within. I jab a finger at the all-Japanese menu in the hope of ordering beer. Two tumblers of pale liquid arrive. \u201cIt looks like whisky!\u201d I laugh. It is whisky. But, again, the staff are incredibly helpful, beaming, fun. We get by with a little Japanese and a little English, and enjoy huge grilled peppers with fish flakes on top and delicious sea bass with sticky rice.A short train and ferry ride from Hiroshima is Miyajima Island, a Unesco world heritage site, where deer roam freely, nudging at tourists, tripping in and out of streams. Sadly, they\u2019ve gone the way of all creatures closely exposed to humans, scavenging for food and, like ravenous goats, even eating paper maps. But if you get away from the heavily commercialised harbour, the island becomes more serene and attractive. There\u2019s an unexpectedly brilliant aquarium full of delights: otters, sharks, porpoises. Moon jellyfish that change colour from white to blue to pink to green. Up the hills, through verdant gardens, are more temples with sun dazzling off their tin roofs, sonorous tolling bells and dozens of smiling buddhas wearing little knitted\u2248hats and bibs, most old and weathered, like grave goods. It transpires that there\u2019s to be a fireworks display later and suddenly the whole island is thronged with visitors, most of them courting young couples, again in gorgeous kimonos. Apparently it\u2019s become very fashionable for the young to wear these traditional clothes again, especially on dates. It\u2019s touching to see boys and girls both looking splendid and in love. We dine, cross-legged, on oysters and eel, then watch the fireworks bloom over the island.Another super-efficient bullet train takes us to Fukuoka \u2013 the \u201cgateway to southern Japan\u201d. As we race through the countryside, the landscape can suddenly transform. Breathtaking mists creep over the mountains. A shaft of sun on a powder-blue tiled roof, or the broad white wings of cranes in wet fields, suddenly illuminate quite how different this place is. We\u2019re on a whistlestop tour, including a video of an extraordinary local carnival \u2013 which we\u2019ve just missed \u2013 in which hundreds of trouserless men in white shirts carry massive floats on six poles. It\u2019s like the running of the bulls, but with buttocks. It turns out the shirts are a fairly recent addition, because people thought the near-nakedness was offensive. Why they didn\u2019t think to put trousers on is beyond me.In the evening, with much fanfare, we\u2019re taken to a two-star Michelin restaurant to eat the infamous fugu fish. It\u2019s an intoxicating prospect (with the emphasis on the toxic), because the flesh of the puffer fish is more deadly than cyanide. Only a small part is edible. The restaurant is wonderfully minimal, plain, cedar-scented, paper-walled, just as you\u2019d hope it to be. We\u2019re given a short tour of the kitchens and see the fugu, which arrives pre-prepared in a box, like shoes. We\u2019re closely observed as we eat, like royal food-tasters under the eye of a wary monarch. The fugu itself is curiously bland. It comes in razor-thin slivers and has a rainbow hue, like petrol in the road. But the accompanying flavours into which we dip the fish (tiny leeks, spring onions, risotto) are delicious, and one course, unexpectedly, comes in batter. Just like Harry Ramsden\u2019s, but with the frisson of potential death.Still alive, next day we take the train to Nagasaki: a very different prospect to Hiroshima. As (almost) the only port open to the west during Japan\u2019s 200-year period of isolation, it has a ramshackle mix of influences. There are lovely clapboard colonial houses from the Dutch and Portuguese settlements, and a proper neon maze of a Chinatown. Walking into town by the canal-side, you catch dark, scuttling shapes out of the corner of the eye. Astonishingly, they\u2019re crabs, hiding in the grates and drains. Loud firecrackers start to go off \u2013 it\u2019s Obon, the Japanese festival of the dead. As the humid air breaks into driving rain, there\u2019s a strange, warm calm. An off-key bell tolls as families carry huge, lantern-covered \u201cships of the dead\u201d down the winding streets in memory of lost loved ones, including, delightfully, a photo of Elvis. Firecrackers burst and spark in the rain, and gunpowder drifts across us in clouds. As we get back to the hotel, teams of men with witch brooms and surgical masks sweep up the soggy remains of the fireworks. Next morning, there\u2019s not a trace. Curiously, while Japanese cities are quite grubby-looking and industrialised, litter is virtually nonexistent. It simply doesn\u2019t occur to people to drop rubbish.Next stop: Kagoshima. It\u2019s a hot and cloudy day, and the volcano is smothered in cloud when we arrive. The resort in Ibusuki is beautifully designed, with luxurious, cool rooms in traditional Japanese style, as unlike a western spa as you can imagine. Men and women (segregated into different areas) walk about happily naked. There are plunge pools and steam baths and the famous sand baths, warmed by natural springs. We change into kimonos and Emma and I are buried up to our necks in the soft, grey, alien-looking sand by stringy young men with rakes. It\u2019s a strangely pleasant sensation, not too hot. We last about 15 minutes, the sweat beading our faces like raindrops. Only Boris Yeltsin, apparently, has managed to last more than half an hour entombed like this. We\u2019re soon hysterical as our host, the extraordinarily kind Mr Shimotakehara, asks us which parasol we want planting into the sand over our heads, like bathing belles on an Edwardian postcard.A long train journey gets us into Kyoto, back in the central region of Honshu island, which is immediately very different from anywhere else we\u2019ve been. Charming, winding streets and lots of older buildings not flattened in the war. There are shrines, of course, but also genuinely lovely shops and cafes. We have a gorgeous (and very cheap) sushi lunch with green tea ice-cream, and then there\u2019s much excitement as a couple of genuine geishas \u2013 apparently a rare sight \u2013 stroll by. It really is something to see them: the death mask faces, the fantastically elaborate hair, the tiny strip of exposed skin at the nape of the neck.Dusk shows Kyoto at its best. There\u2019s a low-key quality to the atmosphere, subtle and quiet, especially in the charming Pontocho Alley with its half-turned-down lamps, where we eat the justly famous black beef.Next day, we visit the Shogun\u2019s palace with its extraordinary sprung \u201cnightingale\u201d floors designed to squeak in order to warn of assassins and then, farther afield, to the Fushimi shrine with its endless orange tunnel. It\u2019s undeniably spectacular, but we\u2019re shrined-out by now. Then it\u2019s on to the towering bamboo forest, with a swollen, muddy yellow river close by, and fit men doing rickshaw rides with the same swagger as lads on waltzers, cocky and rough.We\u2019re sad to leave Kyoto \u2013 the undoubted hit of the trip \u2013 but one last night in Tokyo affords an astonishing view of the city. Railways stretching under motorways, cars blurring into a sea of light as we head for the Golden Gai \u2013 an extraordinary district of tiny, themed bars, each holding about 10 people. The strains of the Specials\u2019 Ghost Town lead us to a sort of 1979 punk bar with a new wave soundtrack. There\u2019s a fantastic incongruity to listening to Sparks and Blondie in the smoky atmosphere. We drink too much sake, happy.Above all, it\u2019s the people who make Japan. I\u2019ve never been met with such extraordinary kindness, courtesy and friendliness. There\u2019s far more English spoken than people lead you to think, and signage is bilingual \u2013 especially on the trains. I plan to return \u2013 in the spring, of course, or the autumn \u2013 as soon as I can. If this sounds evangelical, it is. Even in sultry August, Japan is a wonder. Go.Flights were provided by Finnair, which flies to Japan via Helsinki from \u00a3590 return, including taxes. Rail passes were provided by Japanese National Tourist Board; they cost \u00a3159 for a seven-day pass. Accommodation was provided by Hyatt Regency Kyoto (doubles from \u00a3122, room-only); Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo (doubles from \u00a3276 per night B&B); and Ibsuki Hakusuikan, a Japanese inn with an onsen hot spring spa (doubles from \u00a3188, half-board). Set fugu-tasting menus are available at two-Michelin-starred Hakata Izumi (the website is in Japanese only): lunch from \u00a320, dinner from \u00a356 \u2013 book through your Fukuoka hotel\u2019s concierge.

Her son said: \u201cReconstruction hasn\u2019t really progressed very much (in the four years) but everyone\u2019s doing the best they can so we have to too.\u201dBut work to house tens of thousands of displaced residents has made slow progress amid administrative holdups, rising construction costs and the challenge of rebuilding on high ground away from the vulnerable coastline.Just 15% of the 29,000 permanent homes planned for survivors and nuclear evacuees have been completed in the three worst affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima.The long wait has taken its toll on the health of displaced survivors.In the four years since the disaster, more than 3,200 people, many of them elderly, have died of illnesses exacerbated by their living conditions, suicide and other causes, according to government records.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is expected to respond to criticism of the slow rate of recovery by announcing a new five-year plan this summer to boost the reconstruction of ruined costal communities and decontaminate residential areas affected by the Fukushima meltdown.\u201cReconstruction is shifting to a new stage,\u201d Abe said, adding that he hoped rebuilding work would be completed by the time Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics in 2020. \u201cWe will help disaster victims become self-sustaining. As the government, we will provide the best possible support.\u201dAlthough some families have been allowed to return to their homes on the outskirts of the 20km (12 mile) evacuation zone, almost 120,000 people are still living in nuclear limbo.Japan has spent more than $15bn on lowering atmospheric radiation levels in residential areas near the stricken power plant, creating mountains of radioactive waste that is stored in 88,000 temporary sites in the area.\u201cA large number of workers have been brought in to decontaminate the village, so that residents can return, but when I look at what they are doing, the situation seems hopeless,\u201d said Nobuyoshi Ito, an environment specialist who carries out independent radiation tests on crops in the evacuated village of Iitate.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much it will cost, and even if the work is completed, it won\u2019t be clean enough for villagers to return and resume their lives.\u201dYoung families with children, fearing the possible effects of long-term exposure to radiation to their health, are scattered across Fukushima prefecture and elsewhere in Japan, leaving mainly elderly evacuees behind in cramped temporary housing units.Michihito Endo, a retired teacher from Tomioka, a deserted town near the plant, does not believe he will ever go home. \u201cWe used to be able to walk in the mountains and drink the water, to enjoy ourselves without a care in the world,\u201d Endo said.\u201cThat\u2019s no longer possible. It\u2019s very hard to take. I get very angry when I think about how Tepco and the government promoted the construction of so many nuclear power plants.\u201dAt Fukushima Daiichi \u2013 scene of the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl \u2013 optimism following the removal of more than 1,300 spent fuel assemblies from one damaged reactor building has been tempered by recent reports of yet more leaks of highly contaminated water. That is in addition to the 200,000 tonnes of toxic water already being stored in hundreds of tanks blanketing the site.Workers have yet to begin the removal of melted fuel from the three reactors that suffered meltdown, a process that will take four decades and cost tens of billions of yen.Abe also faces criticism of his push to restart idled nuclear reactors while so little progress has been made in the area affected by the Fukushima crisis.All of Japan\u2019s 48 working reactors were shut down to undergo stringent new safety checks in the wake of the disaster.The country\u2019s nuclear watchdog has approved the restart of two reactors in south-west Japan, but local opposition could frustrate Abe\u2019s plans to have them generating power again in the next few months.The pro-nuclear lobby insists that at least some reactors must go back online if Japan is to tackle the mounting cost of importing fossil fuels and make progress towards meeting its climate change commitments.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Shinzo Abe", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment"], "title": "Japan remembers the 18,000 victims of 2011's triple disaster"},{"date": "2015-02-23T22:59:02Z", "country": "japan", "content": "It is 140 years old, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies and a much-loved Japanese national institution. And soon, investors will have the opportunity to claim a stake of their own.Plans to float part of Japan Post\u2019s business, which were announced in December, represent the culmination of a lengthy process with much at stake politically. The holding company, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies, and two of its four subsidiaries \u2013 tasked with banking and insurance \u2013 will be opened to investors.The holding company will continue to manage postal services and mail delivery, to which the Japanese are very attached due to the extensive network reaching even the most remote corners of the archipelago.The project will be submitted to the Tokyo stock exchange in June, with the goal of organising an initial public offering between August and December. \u201cThe law on privatisation of Japan Post requires us to bring in private equity as soon as possible,\u201d said CEO Taizo Nishimuro, adding that listing the three parts of the business at the same time \u201cwas the best way to ensure fair valuation\u201d. Eleven banks, including JP Morgan and Nomura Holdings, will manage the operation.Privatisation will involve several steps. The first phase should raise \u00a51tn to \u00a52tn ($8.4bn to $16.8bn) according to Japan\u2019s ministry of finance, which has given the go-ahead for the initial public offering. The proceeds will be used to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake, tidal wave and subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster that hit Japan in March 2011.The holding company \u2013 in which the state can legally retain a 30% share \u2013 will gradually divest itself of its interests in banking and insurance, until it owns only 50% of the whole. The two activities will thus gain a degree of independence, opening the way for diversification.The banking division manages deposits worth \u00a5178tn, consisting mainly of pensioners\u2019 savings. The funds are used to buy low-yield treasury bonds, which finance public debt and infrastructure spending in Japan.Under the changes, the banking division hopes to be permitted to make loans to big business and issue mortgages. Its distribution network will be enlarged and there are plans for partnerships with regional bodies. One of the objectives is to offer financial services in areas where there are few banks.The insurance division, which has so far concentrated on life insurance, is also keen to diversify.The question is whether investors, particularly from abroad, will find the offering attractive. Between April and September Japan Post generated \u00a5217bn in profits, but its postal services division is running at a loss. Furthermore its business is concentrated in Japan, where an ageing population may well be a limit on the scope for growth. The holding\u2019s various divisions will consequently need to look overseas. Related: Japan Post offers $6.5bn to take over Australia's Toll Holdings Privatisation of this venerable public concern was one of Junichiro Koizumi\u2019s priorities. As prime minister from 2001-2006 he worked hard to achieve this goal, even calling an early general election in 2005 as a form of referendum on the matter. A bill he proposed provided for a 10-year transition period, starting in 2007, at the end of which the banking and insurance divisions would be privatised.Koizumi was delivering on a promise made in 1993, as minister of post and telecommunications. He was keen to rid Japan of the lobby formed by postmen, numbering 260,000, a third of all public servants. His grandfather, Matajiro Koizumi, held the same position in 1929-31 and attempted in vain to privatise the post office.Koizumi Jr\u2019s plan was delayed when the Democratic party of Japan came to power in 2009. In 2012 new legislation authorised the banking and insurance divisions to diversify their activities. After the Liberal Democratic party\u2019s general election victory in December 2012 the government put privatisation back on the agenda. In addition to the influx of ready cash, it seems a good opportunity to showcase its reforming spirit.

Conservation groups have revealed that Norwegian exports of minke whale to Japan contained damaging levels of toxic pesticides, making that meat unfit for human consumption. It\u2019s a discovery that could cue a swifter decline in the appetite for whale. The news emerged this month, when the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) revealed documents showing that the Japanese government rejected imports of Norwegian whale meat because tests showed samples contained pesticides at twice the limit Japan imposes on its imports. The meat harboured chemicals such as aldrin, dieldrin, and chlordane, thought to play a role in causing birth defects, neurological harm, and some cancers if humans consume them in high quantities. Norway continues to run a large scale whaling industry\u2014the country took a record catch of 736 minke whales in 2014\u2014but surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t exist for Norwegians. \u201cFewer than five percent [of Norwegians] eat whale meat regularly,\u201d says Kate O\u2019Connell, a marine wildlife consultant from the AWI, explaining that they see it as old-fashioned fare. By comparison, Japan is a much bigger market. \u201cJapan has always been the main consumer of whale products,\u201d says Clare Perry, the head of the EIA\u2019s oceans campaign. But even there, it\u2019s losing its appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s not fashionable at all. There\u2019s an older generation in Japan that have a nostalgia about eating it, but it\u2019s not in any way a staple diet,\u201d she says. Nevertheless, a chunk of the Norwegian catch is still exported there annually: 137 tonnes of Norwegian minke have entered Japan in the last two years.Proof of pesticide poisoning may somewhat sour that appetite, something that even a global hunting ban hasn\u2019t been able to quash. There are three remaining countries that continue to hunt and eat whale commercially \u2014 Norway, Japan, and Iceland\u2014and each one ignores the worldwide ruling against this activity.In 1982 the International Whaling Commission completely outlawed commercial whale hunting. \u201cThat applies to all countries that are members of the IWC. Japan, Norway, and Iceland are all members of the IWC,\u201d Perry emphasizes. The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) also bans the trade in minke meat to protect the species, which isn\u2019t endangered but has experienced a dramatic population dive since whaling began. \u201cThere\u2019s concern over whether the hunt is sustainable,\u201d Perry notes. (Norway insists that it is, which explains why it still awards itself an annual catch quota of more than 1000 whales, one the IWC doesn\u2019t acknowledge.)When the international moratorium came into force in the 80s, Norway objected to it, which afforded the country a legal loophole that allows it to continue the hunt while maintaining its IWC membership. Norway, Iceland, and Japan also reject the CITES ban, a move that technically permits them to continue with the trade. \u201cFrom our perspective Norway should be abiding by those treaties,\u201d Perry says.Until that happens, it seems like pesticide contamination is the whales\u2019 best defence\u2014though it\u2019s also bound to harm the whales. The chemicals identified in the minkes\u2019 meat are agriculture products that would most likely have entered the ocean via agricultural run-off. Some of the pesticides, like dieldrin and chlordane, have been banned in the European Union and the United States because of their toxic effects. Because they\u2019re persistent pollutants, however, they\u2019ve lingered in the ocean. By entering the food chain and bioaccumulating within it, the chemicals eventually find their way into the bodies of larger mammals like whales. \u201cIf we think it\u2019s potentially dangerous for us to eat, you can imagine it\u2019s not particularly healthy for a whale,\u201d Perry says. As Norway\u2019s appetite for the meat dwindles, it continues to pursue markets elsewhere for its whales. But that may grow more challenging, especially since the recent meat scare isn\u2019t the first the country has caused. In fact, in the past, shipments of Norwegian whale meat have been found to be infested with bacteria and also to contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury.Within Norway, there are ongoing efforts to try and revive the meat\u2019s appeal, and there are even generous government subsidies in place to try and support the industry and keep this historical practice alive. \u201cIt is clear, however, that without an export market, the Norwegian whaling industry will continue to struggle,\u201d O\u2019Connell says. In that sense, perhaps for whales the pesticides are a morbid kind of defence against the minority that still has a taste for their meat.", "tags": ["Environment"], "title": "Japan refuses Norway's toxic whale meat"},{"date": "2015-01-20T15:50:35Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I\u2019ve always wanted to visit Japan, though I can\u2019t quite explain why. Somewhere in the mix of childhood influences ranging from You Only Live Twice and Shogun, to Tenko and those Clive James shows, came an impression of a complex, frenzied, contradictory and quietly beautiful culture that fascinated me. There\u2019s one thing all the guidebooks agree on, though: don\u2019t go in August. Go in springtime, when the cherry blossom blooms. Or in autumn, when the copious greenery turns a blazing copper. But avoid hot and humid August. So, on 9 August last year, my friend Emma and I depart.Tokyo, when we get there, has caught the tail end of a super-typhoon. After a long flight, it\u2019s genuinely refreshing to walk through the sweeping curtains of rain. Itchy-eyed and numbed with jet lag, we nevertheless manage to shuffle around the excellent Tokyo National Museum, everything feeling slightly unreal and accompanied by a constant clip-clop refrain as though someone were following us around with a glockenspiel. It turns out to be a young couple in exquisite his & hers kimonos and those dazzlingly white, slightly sinister bifurcated socks, their chunky wooden sandals beating the distinctive tattoo as they traipse around.Struggling to stay awake, we find a nice little place to eat. There\u2019s much pointing and laughter as we negotiate our way around the menus, but the waiters are kind and helpful. Though we\u2019re screened from our fellow diners by laminated curtains, the smoke from their scandalous-seeming cigarettes drifts through on to our delicious raw quail. It\u2019s quite nostalgic. We drive back through a violent storm, Tokyo now bursting into blurry neon life: the cab driver in white gloves, the car with whispering automatic doors, like something from the future as envisioned in the 1970s.The next day, after a fantastic sleep, there\u2019s an apologetic waitress at breakfast: \u201cSorry for keeping you waiting.\u201d She bows and smiles and smiles and bows, though she hasn\u2019t kept us waiting at all. We go down on to the amazingly clean, efficient tube system, which is fairly quiet during this holiday period, with none of the fabled pushing and shoving. First stop: the famous Tsukiji fish market; a strange mix of working atmosphere and tourist attraction. Octopus suckers writhe in smashed ice. Men with hooks slice at giant frozen tuna, like medieval artisans carving pink alabaster pillars. Tuna flakes skitter to the floor, though whether they\u2019re thrown away or headed for Sainsbury\u2019s, it\u2019s impossible to know.Next, we visit the first of many (many) shrines. One was erected to the memory of the great reforming Emperor Meiji, with beautifully laid-out forest trails leading to purification areas and little booths where you can make a wish for the spirits to answer. It soon becomes clear that all the shrines have these, like concessions in a department store, flogging benedictions. Is it any different, though, I wonder, to the little shops in cathedrals selling CDs of plainsong? The rituals involve washing both hands and the mouth, then writing down a wish that is hung up on a wooden plaque. There is something a bit relentless about the commercialisation of this, and about the sheer number of shrines you traipse through.One fascinating aspect of the Meiji temple are the strange indentations that cover the great wooden pillars and doors. With more than 3 million visitors a year, it can get very busy. Pilgrims have taken simply to hurling coins towards the shrine from a great distance, pockmarking the woodwork. They do offer, though, oases of calm in the sometimes overwhelming bustle. Most have been lovingly rebuilt after total destruction during the war.We plunge back into a crazier, ultra-fashionable, teen-centred Tokyo \u2013 though, as always in a strange city, I fear that I\u2019m actually standing in the middle of the equivalent of London\u2019s Camden Town. Fashions are mysterious and charming. Many women wear a sun-shunning outfit of broad-brimmed hat, long gloves and pretty lacy parasol of dusty pink or grey. They look like Victorian ghosts in surgical masks, keeping to the hard shadows or cycling past on the thronged pavement.Next day we leave for Hiroshima and our first experience of the bullet train. It is filled with impossibly cute children and super-efficient staff who bow as they enter and leave each carriage: the levels of courtesy and friendliness are so staggeringly different from Britain, it\u2019s shaming.Hiroshima is a quietly devastating place. Now a bustling modern city, it\u2019s nevertheless entirely defined by the events of 6 August 1945, and signs everywhere show what used to stand or how far you are from the \u201chypocentre\u201d of the atomic explosion. The shattered dome above which the A-bomb detonated stands within the Peace Park, where the accompanying museum pulls no punches. Inside are displays of melted spectacles, watches all stopped at 8.15am, burned and bloodied children\u2019s clothing, dropped-out hair, fingernails. We emerge, humbled and moved, into a balmy red evening, scores of people sitting in quiet contemplation.Later, down a back street, we find a tiny place for dinner. It has linen curtains and fat lanterns outside, and an atmosphere of slightly seedy congeniality with more, nicely rowdy smokers within. I jab a finger at the all-Japanese menu in the hope of ordering beer. Two tumblers of pale liquid arrive. \u201cIt looks like whisky!\u201d I laugh. It is whisky. But, again, the staff are incredibly helpful, beaming, fun. We get by with a little Japanese and a little English, and enjoy huge grilled peppers with fish flakes on top and delicious sea bass with sticky rice.A short train and ferry ride from Hiroshima is Miyajima Island, a Unesco world heritage site, where deer roam freely, nudging at tourists, tripping in and out of streams. Sadly, they\u2019ve gone the way of all creatures closely exposed to humans, scavenging for food and, like ravenous goats, even eating paper maps. But if you get away from the heavily commercialised harbour, the island becomes more serene and attractive. There\u2019s an unexpectedly brilliant aquarium full of delights: otters, sharks, porpoises. Moon jellyfish that change colour from white to blue to pink to green. Up the hills, through verdant gardens, are more temples with sun dazzling off their tin roofs, sonorous tolling bells and dozens of smiling buddhas wearing little knitted\u2248hats and bibs, most old and weathered, like grave goods. It transpires that there\u2019s to be a fireworks display later and suddenly the whole island is thronged with visitors, most of them courting young couples, again in gorgeous kimonos. Apparently it\u2019s become very fashionable for the young to wear these traditional clothes again, especially on dates. It\u2019s touching to see boys and girls both looking splendid and in love. We dine, cross-legged, on oysters and eel, then watch the fireworks bloom over the island.Another super-efficient bullet train takes us to Fukuoka \u2013 the \u201cgateway to southern Japan\u201d. As we race through the countryside, the landscape can suddenly transform. Breathtaking mists creep over the mountains. A shaft of sun on a powder-blue tiled roof, or the broad white wings of cranes in wet fields, suddenly illuminate quite how different this place is. We\u2019re on a whistlestop tour, including a video of an extraordinary local carnival \u2013 which we\u2019ve just missed \u2013 in which hundreds of trouserless men in white shirts carry massive floats on six poles. It\u2019s like the running of the bulls, but with buttocks. It turns out the shirts are a fairly recent addition, because people thought the near-nakedness was offensive. Why they didn\u2019t think to put trousers on is beyond me.In the evening, with much fanfare, we\u2019re taken to a two-star Michelin restaurant to eat the infamous fugu fish. It\u2019s an intoxicating prospect (with the emphasis on the toxic), because the flesh of the puffer fish is more deadly than cyanide. Only a small part is edible. The restaurant is wonderfully minimal, plain, cedar-scented, paper-walled, just as you\u2019d hope it to be. We\u2019re given a short tour of the kitchens and see the fugu, which arrives pre-prepared in a box, like shoes. We\u2019re closely observed as we eat, like royal food-tasters under the eye of a wary monarch. The fugu itself is curiously bland. It comes in razor-thin slivers and has a rainbow hue, like petrol in the road. But the accompanying flavours into which we dip the fish (tiny leeks, spring onions, risotto) are delicious, and one course, unexpectedly, comes in batter. Just like Harry Ramsden\u2019s, but with the frisson of potential death.Still alive, next day we take the train to Nagasaki: a very different prospect to Hiroshima. As (almost) the only port open to the west during Japan\u2019s 200-year period of isolation, it has a ramshackle mix of influences. There are lovely clapboard colonial houses from the Dutch and Portuguese settlements, and a proper neon maze of a Chinatown. Walking into town by the canal-side, you catch dark, scuttling shapes out of the corner of the eye. Astonishingly, they\u2019re crabs, hiding in the grates and drains. Loud firecrackers start to go off \u2013 it\u2019s Obon, the Japanese festival of the dead. As the humid air breaks into driving rain, there\u2019s a strange, warm calm. An off-key bell tolls as families carry huge, lantern-covered \u201cships of the dead\u201d down the winding streets in memory of lost loved ones, including, delightfully, a photo of Elvis. Firecrackers burst and spark in the rain, and gunpowder drifts across us in clouds. As we get back to the hotel, teams of men with witch brooms and surgical masks sweep up the soggy remains of the fireworks. Next morning, there\u2019s not a trace. Curiously, while Japanese cities are quite grubby-looking and industrialised, litter is virtually nonexistent. It simply doesn\u2019t occur to people to drop rubbish.Next stop: Kagoshima. It\u2019s a hot and cloudy day, and the volcano is smothered in cloud when we arrive. The resort in Ibusuki is beautifully designed, with luxurious, cool rooms in traditional Japanese style, as unlike a western spa as you can imagine. Men and women (segregated into different areas) walk about happily naked. There are plunge pools and steam baths and the famous sand baths, warmed by natural springs. We change into kimonos and Emma and I are buried up to our necks in the soft, grey, alien-looking sand by stringy young men with rakes. It\u2019s a strangely pleasant sensation, not too hot. We last about 15 minutes, the sweat beading our faces like raindrops. Only Boris Yeltsin, apparently, has managed to last more than half an hour entombed like this. We\u2019re soon hysterical as our host, the extraordinarily kind Mr Shimotakehara, asks us which parasol we want planting into the sand over our heads, like bathing belles on an Edwardian postcard.A long train journey gets us into Kyoto, back in the central region of Honshu island, which is immediately very different from anywhere else we\u2019ve been. Charming, winding streets and lots of older buildings not flattened in the war. There are shrines, of course, but also genuinely lovely shops and cafes. We have a gorgeous (and very cheap) sushi lunch with green tea ice-cream, and then there\u2019s much excitement as a couple of genuine geishas \u2013 apparently a rare sight \u2013 stroll by. It really is something to see them: the death mask faces, the fantastically elaborate hair, the tiny strip of exposed skin at the nape of the neck.Dusk shows Kyoto at its best. There\u2019s a low-key quality to the atmosphere, subtle and quiet, especially in the charming Pontocho Alley with its half-turned-down lamps, where we eat the justly famous black beef.Next day, we visit the Shogun\u2019s palace with its extraordinary sprung \u201cnightingale\u201d floors designed to squeak in order to warn of assassins and then, farther afield, to the Fushimi shrine with its endless orange tunnel. It\u2019s undeniably spectacular, but we\u2019re shrined-out by now. Then it\u2019s on to the towering bamboo forest, with a swollen, muddy yellow river close by, and fit men doing rickshaw rides with the same swagger as lads on waltzers, cocky and rough.We\u2019re sad to leave Kyoto \u2013 the undoubted hit of the trip \u2013 but one last night in Tokyo affords an astonishing view of the city. Railways stretching under motorways, cars blurring into a sea of light as we head for the Golden Gai \u2013 an extraordinary district of tiny, themed bars, each holding about 10 people. The strains of the Specials\u2019 Ghost Town lead us to a sort of 1979 punk bar with a new wave soundtrack. There\u2019s a fantastic incongruity to listening to Sparks and Blondie in the smoky atmosphere. We drink too much sake, happy.Above all, it\u2019s the people who make Japan. I\u2019ve never been met with such extraordinary kindness, courtesy and friendliness. There\u2019s far more English spoken than people lead you to think, and signage is bilingual \u2013 especially on the trains. I plan to return \u2013 in the spring, of course, or the autumn \u2013 as soon as I can. If this sounds evangelical, it is. Even in sultry August, Japan is a wonder. Go.Flights were provided by Finnair, which flies to Japan via Helsinki from \u00a3590 return, including taxes. Rail passes were provided by Japanese National Tourist Board; they cost \u00a3159 for a seven-day pass. Accommodation was provided by Hyatt Regency Kyoto (doubles from \u00a3122, room-only); Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo (doubles from \u00a3276 per night B&B); and Ibsuki Hakusuikan, a Japanese inn with an onsen hot spring spa (doubles from \u00a3188, half-board). Set fugu-tasting menus are available at two-Michelin-starred Hakata Izumi (the website is in Japanese only): lunch from \u00a320, dinner from \u00a356 \u2013 book through your Fukuoka hotel\u2019s concierge.

Her son said: \u201cReconstruction hasn\u2019t really progressed very much (in the four years) but everyone\u2019s doing the best they can so we have to too.\u201dBut work to house tens of thousands of displaced residents has made slow progress amid administrative holdups, rising construction costs and the challenge of rebuilding on high ground away from the vulnerable coastline.Just 15% of the 29,000 permanent homes planned for survivors and nuclear evacuees have been completed in the three worst affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima.The long wait has taken its toll on the health of displaced survivors.In the four years since the disaster, more than 3,200 people, many of them elderly, have died of illnesses exacerbated by their living conditions, suicide and other causes, according to government records.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is expected to respond to criticism of the slow rate of recovery by announcing a new five-year plan this summer to boost the reconstruction of ruined costal communities and decontaminate residential areas affected by the Fukushima meltdown.\u201cReconstruction is shifting to a new stage,\u201d Abe said, adding that he hoped rebuilding work would be completed by the time Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics in 2020. \u201cWe will help disaster victims become self-sustaining. As the government, we will provide the best possible support.\u201dAlthough some families have been allowed to return to their homes on the outskirts of the 20km (12 mile) evacuation zone, almost 120,000 people are still living in nuclear limbo.Japan has spent more than $15bn on lowering atmospheric radiation levels in residential areas near the stricken power plant, creating mountains of radioactive waste that is stored in 88,000 temporary sites in the area.\u201cA large number of workers have been brought in to decontaminate the village, so that residents can return, but when I look at what they are doing, the situation seems hopeless,\u201d said Nobuyoshi Ito, an environment specialist who carries out independent radiation tests on crops in the evacuated village of Iitate.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much it will cost, and even if the work is completed, it won\u2019t be clean enough for villagers to return and resume their lives.\u201dYoung families with children, fearing the possible effects of long-term exposure to radiation to their health, are scattered across Fukushima prefecture and elsewhere in Japan, leaving mainly elderly evacuees behind in cramped temporary housing units.Michihito Endo, a retired teacher from Tomioka, a deserted town near the plant, does not believe he will ever go home. \u201cWe used to be able to walk in the mountains and drink the water, to enjoy ourselves without a care in the world,\u201d Endo said.\u201cThat\u2019s no longer possible. It\u2019s very hard to take. I get very angry when I think about how Tepco and the government promoted the construction of so many nuclear power plants.\u201dAt Fukushima Daiichi \u2013 scene of the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl \u2013 optimism following the removal of more than 1,300 spent fuel assemblies from one damaged reactor building has been tempered by recent reports of yet more leaks of highly contaminated water. That is in addition to the 200,000 tonnes of toxic water already being stored in hundreds of tanks blanketing the site.Workers have yet to begin the removal of melted fuel from the three reactors that suffered meltdown, a process that will take four decades and cost tens of billions of yen.Abe also faces criticism of his push to restart idled nuclear reactors while so little progress has been made in the area affected by the Fukushima crisis.All of Japan\u2019s 48 working reactors were shut down to undergo stringent new safety checks in the wake of the disaster.The country\u2019s nuclear watchdog has approved the restart of two reactors in south-west Japan, but local opposition could frustrate Abe\u2019s plans to have them generating power again in the next few months.The pro-nuclear lobby insists that at least some reactors must go back online if Japan is to tackle the mounting cost of importing fossil fuels and make progress towards meeting its climate change commitments.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Shinzo Abe", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment"], "title": "Japan remembers the 18,000 victims of 2011's triple disaster"},{"date": "2015-02-22T13:34:50Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The regulation eight hours in the office is over. The most important work of the day is done; whatever is left can wait until the morning. This is the point many workers would think about heading for the door.Yet for millions of Japanese employees, the thought of clearing away their desks and being at home in time for dinner is enough to invite accusations of disloyalty.But after decades of giving companies carte blanche to milk every last drop of productivity from their workforce, a challenge to Japan\u2019s ingrained culture of overwork has come from the government, which is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to take at least five days\u2019 paid holiday a year.Japanese employees are currently entitled to an average 18.5 days\u2019 paid holiday a year \u2013 only two fewer than the global average \u2013 with a minimum of 10 days as well as 15 one-day national holidays. In reality, few come even close to taking their full quota, typically using only nine of their 18.5 days average entitlement, according to the labour ministry. While many British workers regard a two-week summer holiday as an inalienable right, workers here have come to see a four-night vacation in Hawaii as the height of self-indulgence.The move, to be debated in the current parliamentary session, comes after companies started encouraging employees to nap on the job to improve their performance.By the end of the decade, the government hopes that, if passed, the law will push Japanese employees towards following the example set by British workers, who use an average of 20 days\u2019 paid annual leave, and those in France, who take an average of 25.It is a worker\u2019s right to take paid vacations. But working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.Japan\u2019s unforgiving work culture may have helped turn it into an economic superpower, its corporate foot soldiers revered in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company, but this has often been to the exclusion of everything else.Japan\u2019s low birthrate and predictions of rapid population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families. More employees are falling ill from stress, or worse, succumbing to karoshi, death through overwork.Despite studies suggesting that longer hours in the office, workshop or factory floor do not necessarily make people more productive, today\u2019s workers are still nursing a collective hangover from the bubble years of the 1980s.About 22% of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of US workers and 11% in France and Germany, according to data compiled by the Japanese government. At 35%, South Korea\u2019s workaholics are even worse off.In spending 14 hours a day at work and giving up many of her paid holidays, Erika Sekiguchi is not even an extreme example. The 36-year-old trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation last year, six of which counted as sick leave. \u201cNobody else uses their vacation days,\u201d Sekiguchi said.She faces the dilemma shared by her peers in companies across Japan: to take time off to recharge, or risk inviting criticism for appearing to leave more committed colleagues in the lurch.Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours, who admits putting in 100 hours of overtime a month, blames the irresistible pressure to match one\u2019s colleagues, hour for hour. \u201cIt is a worker\u2019s right to take paid vacations,\u201d Wakebe said. \u201cBut working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.\u201dThat fear of being ostracised at work is being blamed for a rise in stress-related illness, premature death and suicide. According to official data, about 200 people die every year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules.Late last year, a court in Tokyo ordered a restaurant chain to pay compensation of \u00a558m (\u00a3320,000) to the family of a former manager of one of its outlets who hanged himself in 2010 after being made to work punishingly long hours. Court documents show the man had worked almost 200 hours of overtime a month in the seven months before his death, a form of \u201cpower harassment\u201d that the judge blamed for leaving the victim mentally ill.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is not known for taking long vacations. Yet even he has spoken out against the unreasonable demands companies place on their employees as they struggle to stay afloat in a more complex globalised market.

And soon, investors will have the opportunity to claim a stake of their own.Plans to float part of Japan Post\u2019s business, which were announced in December, represent the culmination of a lengthy process with much at stake politically. The holding company, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies, and two of its four subsidiaries \u2013 tasked with banking and insurance \u2013 will be opened to investors.The holding company will continue to manage postal services and mail delivery, to which the Japanese are very attached due to the extensive network reaching even the most remote corners of the archipelago.The project will be submitted to the Tokyo stock exchange in June, with the goal of organising an initial public offering between August and December. \u201cThe law on privatisation of Japan Post requires us to bring in private equity as soon as possible,\u201d said CEO Taizo Nishimuro, adding that listing the three parts of the business at the same time \u201cwas the best way to ensure fair valuation\u201d. Eleven banks, including JP Morgan and Nomura Holdings, will manage the operation.Privatisation will involve several steps. The first phase should raise \u00a51tn to \u00a52tn ($8.4bn to $16.8bn) according to Japan\u2019s ministry of finance, which has given the go-ahead for the initial public offering. The proceeds will be used to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake, tidal wave and subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster that hit Japan in March 2011.The holding company \u2013 in which the state can legally retain a 30% share \u2013 will gradually divest itself of its interests in banking and insurance, until it owns only 50% of the whole. The two activities will thus gain a degree of independence, opening the way for diversification.The banking division manages deposits worth \u00a5178tn, consisting mainly of pensioners\u2019 savings. The funds are used to buy low-yield treasury bonds, which finance public debt and infrastructure spending in Japan.Under the changes, the banking division hopes to be permitted to make loans to big business and issue mortgages. Its distribution network will be enlarged and there are plans for partnerships with regional bodies. One of the objectives is to offer financial services in areas where there are few banks.The insurance division, which has so far concentrated on life insurance, is also keen to diversify.The question is whether investors, particularly from abroad, will find the offering attractive. Between April and September Japan Post generated \u00a5217bn in profits, but its postal services division is running at a loss. Furthermore its business is concentrated in Japan, where an ageing population may well be a limit on the scope for growth. The holding\u2019s various divisions will consequently need to look overseas. Related: Japan Post offers $6.5bn to take over Australia's Toll Holdings Privatisation of this venerable public concern was one of Junichiro Koizumi\u2019s priorities. As prime minister from 2001-2006 he worked hard to achieve this goal, even calling an early general election in 2005 as a form of referendum on the matter. A bill he proposed provided for a 10-year transition period, starting in 2007, at the end of which the banking and insurance divisions would be privatised.Koizumi was delivering on a promise made in 1993, as minister of post and telecommunications. He was keen to rid Japan of the lobby formed by postmen, numbering 260,000, a third of all public servants. His grandfather, Matajiro Koizumi, held the same position in 1929-31 and attempted in vain to privatise the post office.Koizumi Jr\u2019s plan was delayed when the Democratic party of Japan came to power in 2009. In 2012 new legislation authorised the banking and insurance divisions to diversify their activities. After the Liberal Democratic party\u2019s general election victory in December 2012 the government put privatisation back on the agenda. In addition to the influx of ready cash, it seems a good opportunity to showcase its reforming spirit.

Conservation groups have revealed that Norwegian exports of minke whale to Japan contained damaging levels of toxic pesticides, making that meat unfit for human consumption. It\u2019s a discovery that could cue a swifter decline in the appetite for whale. The news emerged this month, when the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) revealed documents showing that the Japanese government rejected imports of Norwegian whale meat because tests showed samples contained pesticides at twice the limit Japan imposes on its imports. The meat harboured chemicals such as aldrin, dieldrin, and chlordane, thought to play a role in causing birth defects, neurological harm, and some cancers if humans consume them in high quantities. Norway continues to run a large scale whaling industry\u2014the country took a record catch of 736 minke whales in 2014\u2014but surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t exist for Norwegians. \u201cFewer than five percent [of Norwegians] eat whale meat regularly,\u201d says Kate O\u2019Connell, a marine wildlife consultant from the AWI, explaining that they see it as old-fashioned fare. By comparison, Japan is a much bigger market. \u201cJapan has always been the main consumer of whale products,\u201d says Clare Perry, the head of the EIA\u2019s oceans campaign. But even there, it\u2019s losing its appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s not fashionable at all. There\u2019s an older generation in Japan that have a nostalgia about eating it, but it\u2019s not in any way a staple diet,\u201d she says. Nevertheless, a chunk of the Norwegian catch is still exported there annually: 137 tonnes of Norwegian minke have entered Japan in the last two years.Proof of pesticide poisoning may somewhat sour that appetite, something that even a global hunting ban hasn\u2019t been able to quash. There are three remaining countries that continue to hunt and eat whale commercially \u2014 Norway, Japan, and Iceland\u2014and each one ignores the worldwide ruling against this activity.In 1982 the International Whaling Commission completely outlawed commercial whale hunting. \u201cThat applies to all countries that are members of the IWC. Japan, Norway, and Iceland are all members of the IWC,\u201d Perry emphasizes. The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) also bans the trade in minke meat to protect the species, which isn\u2019t endangered but has experienced a dramatic population dive since whaling began. \u201cThere\u2019s concern over whether the hunt is sustainable,\u201d Perry notes. (Norway insists that it is, which explains why it still awards itself an annual catch quota of more than 1000 whales, one the IWC doesn\u2019t acknowledge.)When the international moratorium came into force in the 80s, Norway objected to it, which afforded the country a legal loophole that allows it to continue the hunt while maintaining its IWC membership. Norway, Iceland, and Japan also reject the CITES ban, a move that technically permits them to continue with the trade. \u201cFrom our perspective Norway should be abiding by those treaties,\u201d Perry says.Until that happens, it seems like pesticide contamination is the whales\u2019 best defence\u2014though it\u2019s also bound to harm the whales. The chemicals identified in the minkes\u2019 meat are agriculture products that would most likely have entered the ocean via agricultural run-off. Some of the pesticides, like dieldrin and chlordane, have been banned in the European Union and the United States because of their toxic effects. Because they\u2019re persistent pollutants, however, they\u2019ve lingered in the ocean. By entering the food chain and bioaccumulating within it, the chemicals eventually find their way into the bodies of larger mammals like whales. \u201cIf we think it\u2019s potentially dangerous for us to eat, you can imagine it\u2019s not particularly healthy for a whale,\u201d Perry says. As Norway\u2019s appetite for the meat dwindles, it continues to pursue markets elsewhere for its whales. But that may grow more challenging, especially since the recent meat scare isn\u2019t the first the country has caused. In fact, in the past, shipments of Norwegian whale meat have been found to be infested with bacteria and also to contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury.Within Norway, there are ongoing efforts to try and revive the meat\u2019s appeal, and there are even generous government subsidies in place to try and support the industry and keep this historical practice alive. \u201cIt is clear, however, that without an export market, the Norwegian whaling industry will continue to struggle,\u201d O\u2019Connell says. In that sense, perhaps for whales the pesticides are a morbid kind of defence against the minority that still has a taste for their meat.", "tags": ["Environment"], "title": "Japan refuses Norway's toxic whale meat"},{"date": "2015-01-20T15:50:35Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I\u2019ve always wanted to visit Japan, though I can\u2019t quite explain why. Somewhere in the mix of childhood influences ranging from You Only Live Twice and Shogun, to Tenko and those Clive James shows, came an impression of a complex, frenzied, contradictory and quietly beautiful culture that fascinated me. There\u2019s one thing all the guidebooks agree on, though: don\u2019t go in August. Go in springtime, when the cherry blossom blooms. Or in autumn, when the copious greenery turns a blazing copper. But avoid hot and humid August. So, on 9 August last year, my friend Emma and I depart.Tokyo, when we get there, has caught the tail end of a super-typhoon. After a long flight, it\u2019s genuinely refreshing to walk through the sweeping curtains of rain. Itchy-eyed and numbed with jet lag, we nevertheless manage to shuffle around the excellent Tokyo National Museum, everything feeling slightly unreal and accompanied by a constant clip-clop refrain as though someone were following us around with a glockenspiel. It turns out to be a young couple in exquisite his & hers kimonos and those dazzlingly white, slightly sinister bifurcated socks, their chunky wooden sandals beating the distinctive tattoo as they traipse around.Struggling to stay awake, we find a nice little place to eat. There\u2019s much pointing and laughter as we negotiate our way around the menus, but the waiters are kind and helpful. Though we\u2019re screened from our fellow diners by laminated curtains, the smoke from their scandalous-seeming cigarettes drifts through on to our delicious raw quail. It\u2019s quite nostalgic. We drive back through a violent storm, Tokyo now bursting into blurry neon life: the cab driver in white gloves, the car with whispering automatic doors, like something from the future as envisioned in the 1970s.The next day, after a fantastic sleep, there\u2019s an apologetic waitress at breakfast: \u201cSorry for keeping you waiting.\u201d She bows and smiles and smiles and bows, though she hasn\u2019t kept us waiting at all. We go down on to the amazingly clean, efficient tube system, which is fairly quiet during this holiday period, with none of the fabled pushing and shoving. First stop: the famous Tsukiji fish market; a strange mix of working atmosphere and tourist attraction. Octopus suckers writhe in smashed ice. Men with hooks slice at giant frozen tuna, like medieval artisans carving pink alabaster pillars. Tuna flakes skitter to the floor, though whether they\u2019re thrown away or headed for Sainsbury\u2019s, it\u2019s impossible to know.Next, we visit the first of many (many) shrines. One was erected to the memory of the great reforming Emperor Meiji, with beautifully laid-out forest trails leading to purification areas and little booths where you can make a wish for the spirits to answer. It soon becomes clear that all the shrines have these, like concessions in a department store, flogging benedictions. Is it any different, though, I wonder, to the little shops in cathedrals selling CDs of plainsong? The rituals involve washing both hands and the mouth, then writing down a wish that is hung up on a wooden plaque. There is something a bit relentless about the commercialisation of this, and about the sheer number of shrines you traipse through.One fascinating aspect of the Meiji temple are the strange indentations that cover the great wooden pillars and doors. With more than 3 million visitors a year, it can get very busy. Pilgrims have taken simply to hurling coins towards the shrine from a great distance, pockmarking the woodwork. They do offer, though, oases of calm in the sometimes overwhelming bustle. Most have been lovingly rebuilt after total destruction during the war.We plunge back into a crazier, ultra-fashionable, teen-centred Tokyo \u2013 though, as always in a strange city, I fear that I\u2019m actually standing in the middle of the equivalent of London\u2019s Camden Town. Fashions are mysterious and charming. Many women wear a sun-shunning outfit of broad-brimmed hat, long gloves and pretty lacy parasol of dusty pink or grey. They look like Victorian ghosts in surgical masks, keeping to the hard shadows or cycling past on the thronged pavement.Next day we leave for Hiroshima and our first experience of the bullet train. It is filled with impossibly cute children and super-efficient staff who bow as they enter and leave each carriage: the levels of courtesy and friendliness are so staggeringly different from Britain, it\u2019s shaming.Hiroshima is a quietly devastating place. Now a bustling modern city, it\u2019s nevertheless entirely defined by the events of 6 August 1945, and signs everywhere show what used to stand or how far you are from the \u201chypocentre\u201d of the atomic explosion. The shattered dome above which the A-bomb detonated stands within the Peace Park, where the accompanying museum pulls no punches. Inside are displays of melted spectacles, watches all stopped at 8.15am, burned and bloodied children\u2019s clothing, dropped-out hair, fingernails. We emerge, humbled and moved, into a balmy red evening, scores of people sitting in quiet contemplation.Later, down a back street, we find a tiny place for dinner. It has linen curtains and fat lanterns outside, and an atmosphere of slightly seedy congeniality with more, nicely rowdy smokers within. I jab a finger at the all-Japanese menu in the hope of ordering beer. Two tumblers of pale liquid arrive. \u201cIt looks like whisky!\u201d I laugh. It is whisky. But, again, the staff are incredibly helpful, beaming, fun. We get by with a little Japanese and a little English, and enjoy huge grilled peppers with fish flakes on top and delicious sea bass with sticky rice.A short train and ferry ride from Hiroshima is Miyajima Island, a Unesco world heritage site, where deer roam freely, nudging at tourists, tripping in and out of streams. Sadly, they\u2019ve gone the way of all creatures closely exposed to humans, scavenging for food and, like ravenous goats, even eating paper maps. But if you get away from the heavily commercialised harbour, the island becomes more serene and attractive. There\u2019s an unexpectedly brilliant aquarium full of delights: otters, sharks, porpoises. Moon jellyfish that change colour from white to blue to pink to green. Up the hills, through verdant gardens, are more temples with sun dazzling off their tin roofs, sonorous tolling bells and dozens of smiling buddhas wearing little knitted\u2248hats and bibs, most old and weathered, like grave goods. It transpires that there\u2019s to be a fireworks display later and suddenly the whole island is thronged with visitors, most of them courting young couples, again in gorgeous kimonos. Apparently it\u2019s become very fashionable for the young to wear these traditional clothes again, especially on dates. It\u2019s touching to see boys and girls both looking splendid and in love. We dine, cross-legged, on oysters and eel, then watch the fireworks bloom over the island.Another super-efficient bullet train takes us to Fukuoka \u2013 the \u201cgateway to southern Japan\u201d. As we race through the countryside, the landscape can suddenly transform. Breathtaking mists creep over the mountains. A shaft of sun on a powder-blue tiled roof, or the broad white wings of cranes in wet fields, suddenly illuminate quite how different this place is. We\u2019re on a whistlestop tour, including a video of an extraordinary local carnival \u2013 which we\u2019ve just missed \u2013 in which hundreds of trouserless men in white shirts carry massive floats on six poles. It\u2019s like the running of the bulls, but with buttocks. It turns out the shirts are a fairly recent addition, because people thought the near-nakedness was offensive. Why they didn\u2019t think to put trousers on is beyond me.In the evening, with much fanfare, we\u2019re taken to a two-star Michelin restaurant to eat the infamous fugu fish. It\u2019s an intoxicating prospect (with the emphasis on the toxic), because the flesh of the puffer fish is more deadly than cyanide. Only a small part is edible. The restaurant is wonderfully minimal, plain, cedar-scented, paper-walled, just as you\u2019d hope it to be. We\u2019re given a short tour of the kitchens and see the fugu, which arrives pre-prepared in a box, like shoes. We\u2019re closely observed as we eat, like royal food-tasters under the eye of a wary monarch. The fugu itself is curiously bland. It comes in razor-thin slivers and has a rainbow hue, like petrol in the road. But the accompanying flavours into which we dip the fish (tiny leeks, spring onions, risotto) are delicious, and one course, unexpectedly, comes in batter. Just like Harry Ramsden\u2019s, but with the frisson of potential death.Still alive, next day we take the train to Nagasaki: a very different prospect to Hiroshima. As (almost) the only port open to the west during Japan\u2019s 200-year period of isolation, it has a ramshackle mix of influences. There are lovely clapboard colonial houses from the Dutch and Portuguese settlements, and a proper neon maze of a Chinatown. Walking into town by the canal-side, you catch dark, scuttling shapes out of the corner of the eye. Astonishingly, they\u2019re crabs, hiding in the grates and drains. Loud firecrackers start to go off \u2013 it\u2019s Obon, the Japanese festival of the dead. As the humid air breaks into driving rain, there\u2019s a strange, warm calm. An off-key bell tolls as families carry huge, lantern-covered \u201cships of the dead\u201d down the winding streets in memory of lost loved ones, including, delightfully, a photo of Elvis. Firecrackers burst and spark in the rain, and gunpowder drifts across us in clouds. As we get back to the hotel, teams of men with witch brooms and surgical masks sweep up the soggy remains of the fireworks. Next morning, there\u2019s not a trace. Curiously, while Japanese cities are quite grubby-looking and industrialised, litter is virtually nonexistent. It simply doesn\u2019t occur to people to drop rubbish.Next stop: Kagoshima. It\u2019s a hot and cloudy day, and the volcano is smothered in cloud when we arrive. The resort in Ibusuki is beautifully designed, with luxurious, cool rooms in traditional Japanese style, as unlike a western spa as you can imagine. Men and women (segregated into different areas) walk about happily naked. There are plunge pools and steam baths and the famous sand baths, warmed by natural springs. We change into kimonos and Emma and I are buried up to our necks in the soft, grey, alien-looking sand by stringy young men with rakes. It\u2019s a strangely pleasant sensation, not too hot. We last about 15 minutes, the sweat beading our faces like raindrops. Only Boris Yeltsin, apparently, has managed to last more than half an hour entombed like this. We\u2019re soon hysterical as our host, the extraordinarily kind Mr Shimotakehara, asks us which parasol we want planting into the sand over our heads, like bathing belles on an Edwardian postcard.A long train journey gets us into Kyoto, back in the central region of Honshu island, which is immediately very different from anywhere else we\u2019ve been. Charming, winding streets and lots of older buildings not flattened in the war. There are shrines, of course, but also genuinely lovely shops and cafes. We have a gorgeous (and very cheap) sushi lunch with green tea ice-cream, and then there\u2019s much excitement as a couple of genuine geishas \u2013 apparently a rare sight \u2013 stroll by. It really is something to see them: the death mask faces, the fantastically elaborate hair, the tiny strip of exposed skin at the nape of the neck.Dusk shows Kyoto at its best. There\u2019s a low-key quality to the atmosphere, subtle and quiet, especially in the charming Pontocho Alley with its half-turned-down lamps, where we eat the justly famous black beef.Next day, we visit the Shogun\u2019s palace with its extraordinary sprung \u201cnightingale\u201d floors designed to squeak in order to warn of assassins and then, farther afield, to the Fushimi shrine with its endless orange tunnel. It\u2019s undeniably spectacular, but we\u2019re shrined-out by now. Then it\u2019s on to the towering bamboo forest, with a swollen, muddy yellow river close by, and fit men doing rickshaw rides with the same swagger as lads on waltzers, cocky and rough.We\u2019re sad to leave Kyoto \u2013 the undoubted hit of the trip \u2013 but one last night in Tokyo affords an astonishing view of the city. Railways stretching under motorways, cars blurring into a sea of light as we head for the Golden Gai \u2013 an extraordinary district of tiny, themed bars, each holding about 10 people. The strains of the Specials\u2019 Ghost Town lead us to a sort of 1979 punk bar with a new wave soundtrack. There\u2019s a fantastic incongruity to listening to Sparks and Blondie in the smoky atmosphere. We drink too much sake, happy.Above all, it\u2019s the people who make Japan. I\u2019ve never been met with such extraordinary kindness, courtesy and friendliness. There\u2019s far more English spoken than people lead you to think, and signage is bilingual \u2013 especially on the trains. I plan to return \u2013 in the spring, of course, or the autumn \u2013 as soon as I can. If this sounds evangelical, it is. Even in sultry August, Japan is a wonder. Go.Flights were provided by Finnair, which flies to Japan via Helsinki from \u00a3590 return, including taxes. Rail passes were provided by Japanese National Tourist Board; they cost \u00a3159 for a seven-day pass. Accommodation was provided by Hyatt Regency Kyoto (doubles from \u00a3122, room-only); Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo (doubles from \u00a3276 per night B&B); and Ibsuki Hakusuikan, a Japanese inn with an onsen hot spring spa (doubles from \u00a3188, half-board). Set fugu-tasting menus are available at two-Michelin-starred Hakata Izumi (the website is in Japanese only): lunch from \u00a320, dinner from \u00a356 \u2013 book through your Fukuoka hotel\u2019s concierge.

Her son said: \u201cReconstruction hasn\u2019t really progressed very much (in the four years) but everyone\u2019s doing the best they can so we have to too.\u201dBut work to house tens of thousands of displaced residents has made slow progress amid administrative holdups, rising construction costs and the challenge of rebuilding on high ground away from the vulnerable coastline.Just 15% of the 29,000 permanent homes planned for survivors and nuclear evacuees have been completed in the three worst affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima.The long wait has taken its toll on the health of displaced survivors.In the four years since the disaster, more than 3,200 people, many of them elderly, have died of illnesses exacerbated by their living conditions, suicide and other causes, according to government records.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is expected to respond to criticism of the slow rate of recovery by announcing a new five-year plan this summer to boost the reconstruction of ruined costal communities and decontaminate residential areas affected by the Fukushima meltdown.\u201cReconstruction is shifting to a new stage,\u201d Abe said, adding that he hoped rebuilding work would be completed by the time Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics in 2020. \u201cWe will help disaster victims become self-sustaining. As the government, we will provide the best possible support.\u201dAlthough some families have been allowed to return to their homes on the outskirts of the 20km (12 mile) evacuation zone, almost 120,000 people are still living in nuclear limbo.Japan has spent more than $15bn on lowering atmospheric radiation levels in residential areas near the stricken power plant, creating mountains of radioactive waste that is stored in 88,000 temporary sites in the area.\u201cA large number of workers have been brought in to decontaminate the village, so that residents can return, but when I look at what they are doing, the situation seems hopeless,\u201d said Nobuyoshi Ito, an environment specialist who carries out independent radiation tests on crops in the evacuated village of Iitate.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much it will cost, and even if the work is completed, it won\u2019t be clean enough for villagers to return and resume their lives.\u201dYoung families with children, fearing the possible effects of long-term exposure to radiation to their health, are scattered across Fukushima prefecture and elsewhere in Japan, leaving mainly elderly evacuees behind in cramped temporary housing units.Michihito Endo, a retired teacher from Tomioka, a deserted town near the plant, does not believe he will ever go home. \u201cWe used to be able to walk in the mountains and drink the water, to enjoy ourselves without a care in the world,\u201d Endo said.\u201cThat\u2019s no longer possible. It\u2019s very hard to take. I get very angry when I think about how Tepco and the government promoted the construction of so many nuclear power plants.\u201dAt Fukushima Daiichi \u2013 scene of the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl \u2013 optimism following the removal of more than 1,300 spent fuel assemblies from one damaged reactor building has been tempered by recent reports of yet more leaks of highly contaminated water. That is in addition to the 200,000 tonnes of toxic water already being stored in hundreds of tanks blanketing the site.Workers have yet to begin the removal of melted fuel from the three reactors that suffered meltdown, a process that will take four decades and cost tens of billions of yen.Abe also faces criticism of his push to restart idled nuclear reactors while so little progress has been made in the area affected by the Fukushima crisis.All of Japan\u2019s 48 working reactors were shut down to undergo stringent new safety checks in the wake of the disaster.The country\u2019s nuclear watchdog has approved the restart of two reactors in south-west Japan, but local opposition could frustrate Abe\u2019s plans to have them generating power again in the next few months.The pro-nuclear lobby insists that at least some reactors must go back online if Japan is to tackle the mounting cost of importing fossil fuels and make progress towards meeting its climate change commitments.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Shinzo Abe", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment"], "title": "Japan remembers the 18,000 victims of 2011's triple disaster"},{"date": "2015-02-22T13:34:50Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The regulation eight hours in the office is over. The most important work of the day is done; whatever is left can wait until the morning. This is the point many workers would think about heading for the door.Yet for millions of Japanese employees, the thought of clearing away their desks and being at home in time for dinner is enough to invite accusations of disloyalty.But after decades of giving companies carte blanche to milk every last drop of productivity from their workforce, a challenge to Japan\u2019s ingrained culture of overwork has come from the government, which is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to take at least five days\u2019 paid holiday a year.Japanese employees are currently entitled to an average 18.5 days\u2019 paid holiday a year \u2013 only two fewer than the global average \u2013 with a minimum of 10 days as well as 15 one-day national holidays. In reality, few come even close to taking their full quota, typically using only nine of their 18.5 days average entitlement, according to the labour ministry. While many British workers regard a two-week summer holiday as an inalienable right, workers here have come to see a four-night vacation in Hawaii as the height of self-indulgence.The move, to be debated in the current parliamentary session, comes after companies started encouraging employees to nap on the job to improve their performance.By the end of the decade, the government hopes that, if passed, the law will push Japanese employees towards following the example set by British workers, who use an average of 20 days\u2019 paid annual leave, and those in France, who take an average of 25.It is a worker\u2019s right to take paid vacations. But working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.Japan\u2019s unforgiving work culture may have helped turn it into an economic superpower, its corporate foot soldiers revered in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company, but this has often been to the exclusion of everything else.Japan\u2019s low birthrate and predictions of rapid population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families. More employees are falling ill from stress, or worse, succumbing to karoshi, death through overwork.Despite studies suggesting that longer hours in the office, workshop or factory floor do not necessarily make people more productive, today\u2019s workers are still nursing a collective hangover from the bubble years of the 1980s.About 22% of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of US workers and 11% in France and Germany, according to data compiled by the Japanese government. At 35%, South Korea\u2019s workaholics are even worse off.In spending 14 hours a day at work and giving up many of her paid holidays, Erika Sekiguchi is not even an extreme example. The 36-year-old trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation last year, six of which counted as sick leave. \u201cNobody else uses their vacation days,\u201d Sekiguchi said.She faces the dilemma shared by her peers in companies across Japan: to take time off to recharge, or risk inviting criticism for appearing to leave more committed colleagues in the lurch.Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours, who admits putting in 100 hours of overtime a month, blames the irresistible pressure to match one\u2019s colleagues, hour for hour. \u201cIt is a worker\u2019s right to take paid vacations,\u201d Wakebe said. \u201cBut working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.\u201dThat fear of being ostracised at work is being blamed for a rise in stress-related illness, premature death and suicide. According to official data, about 200 people die every year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules.Late last year, a court in Tokyo ordered a restaurant chain to pay compensation of \u00a558m (\u00a3320,000) to the family of a former manager of one of its outlets who hanged himself in 2010 after being made to work punishingly long hours. Court documents show the man had worked almost 200 hours of overtime a month in the seven months before his death, a form of \u201cpower harassment\u201d that the judge blamed for leaving the victim mentally ill.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is not known for taking long vacations. Yet even he has spoken out against the unreasonable demands companies place on their employees as they struggle to stay afloat in a more complex globalised market.

Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts Takuji Aida and Kiyoko Katahira said Abe\u2019s decision to push back a second sales tax hike by two years to 2017, would give the economy a strong boost.\u201cGiven that PM Abe has decided to postpone the second tax hike to April 2017 from October 2015, the downside pressure in 2015 has largely been removed,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cThe GDP growth rate for 2015 should be supported by robust consumption and trade, and we forecast growth of around 1.5% year on year. \u201cAbe has announced he will not delay the second tax hike again. In other words, he has made a strong commitment to reflate the economy,.\u201dBut some analysts warned that weak rebound in consumption and capital expenditure remained a worrying sign.\u201cThese are somewhat disappointing figures,\u201d said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. \u201cThe situation remains weak and companies are clearly postponing investments.\u201dHowever, the rebound from recession will allow the Bank of Japan to hold off on expanding monetary stimulus. The central bank has proved to be one of the most aggressive in printing money to make borrowing cheaper and to drive down the value of the yen.Like most central banks, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has seen inflation fall below its 2% target following the collapse in oil prices that has dramatically cut fuel costs and a slowdown in China that has reduced the price of other commodities.Abe said he hoped the central bank continued with its bold monetary easing campaign to boost lending and inflation back to its target. Speaking in parliament, Abe praised the BoJ\u2019s aggressive stimulus programme for helping revive the economy and wipe out the public\u2019s \u201csticky deflationary mindset\u201d. He acknowledged that some weakness in household spending, but added that he saw signs of recovery in the economy, such as improvements in consumer sentiment. \u201cWe\u2019ll strive to ensure that wages keep rising this year and next, so that the warm breeze of recovery blows throughout the nation,\u201d Abe said.", "tags": ["Economics", "Japan", "Global recession", "Asia Pacific", "Global economy", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Financial crisis"], "title": "Japan emerges from recession but rebound is weaker than expected"},{"date": "2015-02-23T22:59:02Z", "country": "japan", "content": "It is 140 years old, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies and a much-loved Japanese national institution. And soon, investors will have the opportunity to claim a stake of their own.Plans to float part of Japan Post\u2019s business, which were announced in December, represent the culmination of a lengthy process with much at stake politically. The holding company, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies, and two of its four subsidiaries \u2013 tasked with banking and insurance \u2013 will be opened to investors.The holding company will continue to manage postal services and mail delivery, to which the Japanese are very attached due to the extensive network reaching even the most remote corners of the archipelago.The project will be submitted to the Tokyo stock exchange in June, with the goal of organising an initial public offering between August and December. \u201cThe law on privatisation of Japan Post requires us to bring in private equity as soon as possible,\u201d said CEO Taizo Nishimuro, adding that listing the three parts of the business at the same time \u201cwas the best way to ensure fair valuation\u201d. Eleven banks, including JP Morgan and Nomura Holdings, will manage the operation.Privatisation will involve several steps. The first phase should raise \u00a51tn to \u00a52tn ($8.4bn to $16.8bn) according to Japan\u2019s ministry of finance, which has given the go-ahead for the initial public offering. The proceeds will be used to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake, tidal wave and subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster that hit Japan in March 2011.The holding company \u2013 in which the state can legally retain a 30% share \u2013 will gradually divest itself of its interests in banking and insurance, until it owns only 50% of the whole. The two activities will thus gain a degree of independence, opening the way for diversification.The banking division manages deposits worth \u00a5178tn, consisting mainly of pensioners\u2019 savings. The funds are used to buy low-yield treasury bonds, which finance public debt and infrastructure spending in Japan.Under the changes, the banking division hopes to be permitted to make loans to big business and issue mortgages. Its distribution network will be enlarged and there are plans for partnerships with regional bodies. One of the objectives is to offer financial services in areas where there are few banks.The insurance division, which has so far concentrated on life insurance, is also keen to diversify.The question is whether investors, particularly from abroad, will find the offering attractive. Between April and September Japan Post generated \u00a5217bn in profits, but its postal services division is running at a loss. Furthermore its business is concentrated in Japan, where an ageing population may well be a limit on the scope for growth. The holding\u2019s various divisions will consequently need to look overseas. Related: Japan Post offers $6.5bn to take over Australia's Toll Holdings Privatisation of this venerable public concern was one of Junichiro Koizumi\u2019s priorities. As prime minister from 2001-2006 he worked hard to achieve this goal, even calling an early general election in 2005 as a form of referendum on the matter. A bill he proposed provided for a 10-year transition period, starting in 2007, at the end of which the banking and insurance divisions would be privatised.Koizumi was delivering on a promise made in 1993, as minister of post and telecommunications. He was keen to rid Japan of the lobby formed by postmen, numbering 260,000, a third of all public servants. His grandfather, Matajiro Koizumi, held the same position in 1929-31 and attempted in vain to privatise the post office.Koizumi Jr\u2019s plan was delayed when the Democratic party of Japan came to power in 2009. In 2012 new legislation authorised the banking and insurance divisions to diversify their activities. After the Liberal Democratic party\u2019s general election victory in December 2012 the government put privatisation back on the agenda. In addition to the influx of ready cash, it seems a good opportunity to showcase its reforming spirit.

Conservation groups have revealed that Norwegian exports of minke whale to Japan contained damaging levels of toxic pesticides, making that meat unfit for human consumption. It\u2019s a discovery that could cue a swifter decline in the appetite for whale. The news emerged this month, when the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) revealed documents showing that the Japanese government rejected imports of Norwegian whale meat because tests showed samples contained pesticides at twice the limit Japan imposes on its imports. The meat harboured chemicals such as aldrin, dieldrin, and chlordane, thought to play a role in causing birth defects, neurological harm, and some cancers if humans consume them in high quantities. Norway continues to run a large scale whaling industry\u2014the country took a record catch of 736 minke whales in 2014\u2014but surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t exist for Norwegians. \u201cFewer than five percent [of Norwegians] eat whale meat regularly,\u201d says Kate O\u2019Connell, a marine wildlife consultant from the AWI, explaining that they see it as old-fashioned fare. By comparison, Japan is a much bigger market. \u201cJapan has always been the main consumer of whale products,\u201d says Clare Perry, the head of the EIA\u2019s oceans campaign. But even there, it\u2019s losing its appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s not fashionable at all. There\u2019s an older generation in Japan that have a nostalgia about eating it, but it\u2019s not in any way a staple diet,\u201d she says. Nevertheless, a chunk of the Norwegian catch is still exported there annually: 137 tonnes of Norwegian minke have entered Japan in the last two years.Proof of pesticide poisoning may somewhat sour that appetite, something that even a global hunting ban hasn\u2019t been able to quash. There are three remaining countries that continue to hunt and eat whale commercially \u2014 Norway, Japan, and Iceland\u2014and each one ignores the worldwide ruling against this activity.In 1982 the International Whaling Commission completely outlawed commercial whale hunting. \u201cThat applies to all countries that are members of the IWC. Japan, Norway, and Iceland are all members of the IWC,\u201d Perry emphasizes. The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) also bans the trade in minke meat to protect the species, which isn\u2019t endangered but has experienced a dramatic population dive since whaling began. \u201cThere\u2019s concern over whether the hunt is sustainable,\u201d Perry notes. (Norway insists that it is, which explains why it still awards itself an annual catch quota of more than 1000 whales, one the IWC doesn\u2019t acknowledge.)When the international moratorium came into force in the 80s, Norway objected to it, which afforded the country a legal loophole that allows it to continue the hunt while maintaining its IWC membership. Norway, Iceland, and Japan also reject the CITES ban, a move that technically permits them to continue with the trade. \u201cFrom our perspective Norway should be abiding by those treaties,\u201d Perry says.Until that happens, it seems like pesticide contamination is the whales\u2019 best defence\u2014though it\u2019s also bound to harm the whales. The chemicals identified in the minkes\u2019 meat are agriculture products that would most likely have entered the ocean via agricultural run-off. Some of the pesticides, like dieldrin and chlordane, have been banned in the European Union and the United States because of their toxic effects. Because they\u2019re persistent pollutants, however, they\u2019ve lingered in the ocean. By entering the food chain and bioaccumulating within it, the chemicals eventually find their way into the bodies of larger mammals like whales. \u201cIf we think it\u2019s potentially dangerous for us to eat, you can imagine it\u2019s not particularly healthy for a whale,\u201d Perry says. As Norway\u2019s appetite for the meat dwindles, it continues to pursue markets elsewhere for its whales. But that may grow more challenging, especially since the recent meat scare isn\u2019t the first the country has caused. In fact, in the past, shipments of Norwegian whale meat have been found to be infested with bacteria and also to contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury.Within Norway, there are ongoing efforts to try and revive the meat\u2019s appeal, and there are even generous government subsidies in place to try and support the industry and keep this historical practice alive. \u201cIt is clear, however, that without an export market, the Norwegian whaling industry will continue to struggle,\u201d O\u2019Connell says. In that sense, perhaps for whales the pesticides are a morbid kind of defence against the minority that still has a taste for their meat.", "tags": ["Environment"], "title": "Japan refuses Norway's toxic whale meat"},{"date": "2015-01-20T15:50:35Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I\u2019ve always wanted to visit Japan, though I can\u2019t quite explain why. Somewhere in the mix of childhood influences ranging from You Only Live Twice and Shogun, to Tenko and those Clive James shows, came an impression of a complex, frenzied, contradictory and quietly beautiful culture that fascinated me. There\u2019s one thing all the guidebooks agree on, though: don\u2019t go in August. Go in springtime, when the cherry blossom blooms. Or in autumn, when the copious greenery turns a blazing copper. But avoid hot and humid August. So, on 9 August last year, my friend Emma and I depart.Tokyo, when we get there, has caught the tail end of a super-typhoon. After a long flight, it\u2019s genuinely refreshing to walk through the sweeping curtains of rain. Itchy-eyed and numbed with jet lag, we nevertheless manage to shuffle around the excellent Tokyo National Museum, everything feeling slightly unreal and accompanied by a constant clip-clop refrain as though someone were following us around with a glockenspiel. It turns out to be a young couple in exquisite his & hers kimonos and those dazzlingly white, slightly sinister bifurcated socks, their chunky wooden sandals beating the distinctive tattoo as they traipse around.Struggling to stay awake, we find a nice little place to eat. There\u2019s much pointing and laughter as we negotiate our way around the menus, but the waiters are kind and helpful. Though we\u2019re screened from our fellow diners by laminated curtains, the smoke from their scandalous-seeming cigarettes drifts through on to our delicious raw quail. It\u2019s quite nostalgic. We drive back through a violent storm, Tokyo now bursting into blurry neon life: the cab driver in white gloves, the car with whispering automatic doors, like something from the future as envisioned in the 1970s.The next day, after a fantastic sleep, there\u2019s an apologetic waitress at breakfast: \u201cSorry for keeping you waiting.\u201d She bows and smiles and smiles and bows, though she hasn\u2019t kept us waiting at all. We go down on to the amazingly clean, efficient tube system, which is fairly quiet during this holiday period, with none of the fabled pushing and shoving. First stop: the famous Tsukiji fish market; a strange mix of working atmosphere and tourist attraction. Octopus suckers writhe in smashed ice. Men with hooks slice at giant frozen tuna, like medieval artisans carving pink alabaster pillars. Tuna flakes skitter to the floor, though whether they\u2019re thrown away or headed for Sainsbury\u2019s, it\u2019s impossible to know.Next, we visit the first of many (many) shrines. One was erected to the memory of the great reforming Emperor Meiji, with beautifully laid-out forest trails leading to purification areas and little booths where you can make a wish for the spirits to answer. It soon becomes clear that all the shrines have these, like concessions in a department store, flogging benedictions. Is it any different, though, I wonder, to the little shops in cathedrals selling CDs of plainsong? The rituals involve washing both hands and the mouth, then writing down a wish that is hung up on a wooden plaque. There is something a bit relentless about the commercialisation of this, and about the sheer number of shrines you traipse through.One fascinating aspect of the Meiji temple are the strange indentations that cover the great wooden pillars and doors. With more than 3 million visitors a year, it can get very busy. Pilgrims have taken simply to hurling coins towards the shrine from a great distance, pockmarking the woodwork. They do offer, though, oases of calm in the sometimes overwhelming bustle. Most have been lovingly rebuilt after total destruction during the war.We plunge back into a crazier, ultra-fashionable, teen-centred Tokyo \u2013 though, as always in a strange city, I fear that I\u2019m actually standing in the middle of the equivalent of London\u2019s Camden Town. Fashions are mysterious and charming. Many women wear a sun-shunning outfit of broad-brimmed hat, long gloves and pretty lacy parasol of dusty pink or grey. They look like Victorian ghosts in surgical masks, keeping to the hard shadows or cycling past on the thronged pavement.Next day we leave for Hiroshima and our first experience of the bullet train. It is filled with impossibly cute children and super-efficient staff who bow as they enter and leave each carriage: the levels of courtesy and friendliness are so staggeringly different from Britain, it\u2019s shaming.Hiroshima is a quietly devastating place. Now a bustling modern city, it\u2019s nevertheless entirely defined by the events of 6 August 1945, and signs everywhere show what used to stand or how far you are from the \u201chypocentre\u201d of the atomic explosion. The shattered dome above which the A-bomb detonated stands within the Peace Park, where the accompanying museum pulls no punches. Inside are displays of melted spectacles, watches all stopped at 8.15am, burned and bloodied children\u2019s clothing, dropped-out hair, fingernails. We emerge, humbled and moved, into a balmy red evening, scores of people sitting in quiet contemplation.Later, down a back street, we find a tiny place for dinner. It has linen curtains and fat lanterns outside, and an atmosphere of slightly seedy congeniality with more, nicely rowdy smokers within. I jab a finger at the all-Japanese menu in the hope of ordering beer. Two tumblers of pale liquid arrive. \u201cIt looks like whisky!\u201d I laugh. It is whisky. But, again, the staff are incredibly helpful, beaming, fun. We get by with a little Japanese and a little English, and enjoy huge grilled peppers with fish flakes on top and delicious sea bass with sticky rice.A short train and ferry ride from Hiroshima is Miyajima Island, a Unesco world heritage site, where deer roam freely, nudging at tourists, tripping in and out of streams. Sadly, they\u2019ve gone the way of all creatures closely exposed to humans, scavenging for food and, like ravenous goats, even eating paper maps. But if you get away from the heavily commercialised harbour, the island becomes more serene and attractive. There\u2019s an unexpectedly brilliant aquarium full of delights: otters, sharks, porpoises. Moon jellyfish that change colour from white to blue to pink to green. Up the hills, through verdant gardens, are more temples with sun dazzling off their tin roofs, sonorous tolling bells and dozens of smiling buddhas wearing little knitted\u2248hats and bibs, most old and weathered, like grave goods. It transpires that there\u2019s to be a fireworks display later and suddenly the whole island is thronged with visitors, most of them courting young couples, again in gorgeous kimonos. Apparently it\u2019s become very fashionable for the young to wear these traditional clothes again, especially on dates. It\u2019s touching to see boys and girls both looking splendid and in love. We dine, cross-legged, on oysters and eel, then watch the fireworks bloom over the island.Another super-efficient bullet train takes us to Fukuoka \u2013 the \u201cgateway to southern Japan\u201d. As we race through the countryside, the landscape can suddenly transform. Breathtaking mists creep over the mountains. A shaft of sun on a powder-blue tiled roof, or the broad white wings of cranes in wet fields, suddenly illuminate quite how different this place is. We\u2019re on a whistlestop tour, including a video of an extraordinary local carnival \u2013 which we\u2019ve just missed \u2013 in which hundreds of trouserless men in white shirts carry massive floats on six poles. It\u2019s like the running of the bulls, but with buttocks. It turns out the shirts are a fairly recent addition, because people thought the near-nakedness was offensive. Why they didn\u2019t think to put trousers on is beyond me.In the evening, with much fanfare, we\u2019re taken to a two-star Michelin restaurant to eat the infamous fugu fish. It\u2019s an intoxicating prospect (with the emphasis on the toxic), because the flesh of the puffer fish is more deadly than cyanide. Only a small part is edible. The restaurant is wonderfully minimal, plain, cedar-scented, paper-walled, just as you\u2019d hope it to be. We\u2019re given a short tour of the kitchens and see the fugu, which arrives pre-prepared in a box, like shoes. We\u2019re closely observed as we eat, like royal food-tasters under the eye of a wary monarch. The fugu itself is curiously bland. It comes in razor-thin slivers and has a rainbow hue, like petrol in the road. But the accompanying flavours into which we dip the fish (tiny leeks, spring onions, risotto) are delicious, and one course, unexpectedly, comes in batter. Just like Harry Ramsden\u2019s, but with the frisson of potential death.Still alive, next day we take the train to Nagasaki: a very different prospect to Hiroshima. As (almost) the only port open to the west during Japan\u2019s 200-year period of isolation, it has a ramshackle mix of influences. There are lovely clapboard colonial houses from the Dutch and Portuguese settlements, and a proper neon maze of a Chinatown. Walking into town by the canal-side, you catch dark, scuttling shapes out of the corner of the eye. Astonishingly, they\u2019re crabs, hiding in the grates and drains. Loud firecrackers start to go off \u2013 it\u2019s Obon, the Japanese festival of the dead. As the humid air breaks into driving rain, there\u2019s a strange, warm calm. An off-key bell tolls as families carry huge, lantern-covered \u201cships of the dead\u201d down the winding streets in memory of lost loved ones, including, delightfully, a photo of Elvis. Firecrackers burst and spark in the rain, and gunpowder drifts across us in clouds. As we get back to the hotel, teams of men with witch brooms and surgical masks sweep up the soggy remains of the fireworks. Next morning, there\u2019s not a trace. Curiously, while Japanese cities are quite grubby-looking and industrialised, litter is virtually nonexistent. It simply doesn\u2019t occur to people to drop rubbish.Next stop: Kagoshima. It\u2019s a hot and cloudy day, and the volcano is smothered in cloud when we arrive. The resort in Ibusuki is beautifully designed, with luxurious, cool rooms in traditional Japanese style, as unlike a western spa as you can imagine. Men and women (segregated into different areas) walk about happily naked. There are plunge pools and steam baths and the famous sand baths, warmed by natural springs. We change into kimonos and Emma and I are buried up to our necks in the soft, grey, alien-looking sand by stringy young men with rakes. It\u2019s a strangely pleasant sensation, not too hot. We last about 15 minutes, the sweat beading our faces like raindrops. Only Boris Yeltsin, apparently, has managed to last more than half an hour entombed like this. We\u2019re soon hysterical as our host, the extraordinarily kind Mr Shimotakehara, asks us which parasol we want planting into the sand over our heads, like bathing belles on an Edwardian postcard.A long train journey gets us into Kyoto, back in the central region of Honshu island, which is immediately very different from anywhere else we\u2019ve been. Charming, winding streets and lots of older buildings not flattened in the war. There are shrines, of course, but also genuinely lovely shops and cafes. We have a gorgeous (and very cheap) sushi lunch with green tea ice-cream, and then there\u2019s much excitement as a couple of genuine geishas \u2013 apparently a rare sight \u2013 stroll by. It really is something to see them: the death mask faces, the fantastically elaborate hair, the tiny strip of exposed skin at the nape of the neck.Dusk shows Kyoto at its best. There\u2019s a low-key quality to the atmosphere, subtle and quiet, especially in the charming Pontocho Alley with its half-turned-down lamps, where we eat the justly famous black beef.Next day, we visit the Shogun\u2019s palace with its extraordinary sprung \u201cnightingale\u201d floors designed to squeak in order to warn of assassins and then, farther afield, to the Fushimi shrine with its endless orange tunnel. It\u2019s undeniably spectacular, but we\u2019re shrined-out by now. Then it\u2019s on to the towering bamboo forest, with a swollen, muddy yellow river close by, and fit men doing rickshaw rides with the same swagger as lads on waltzers, cocky and rough.We\u2019re sad to leave Kyoto \u2013 the undoubted hit of the trip \u2013 but one last night in Tokyo affords an astonishing view of the city. Railways stretching under motorways, cars blurring into a sea of light as we head for the Golden Gai \u2013 an extraordinary district of tiny, themed bars, each holding about 10 people. The strains of the Specials\u2019 Ghost Town lead us to a sort of 1979 punk bar with a new wave soundtrack. There\u2019s a fantastic incongruity to listening to Sparks and Blondie in the smoky atmosphere. We drink too much sake, happy.Above all, it\u2019s the people who make Japan. I\u2019ve never been met with such extraordinary kindness, courtesy and friendliness. There\u2019s far more English spoken than people lead you to think, and signage is bilingual \u2013 especially on the trains. I plan to return \u2013 in the spring, of course, or the autumn \u2013 as soon as I can. If this sounds evangelical, it is. Even in sultry August, Japan is a wonder. Go.Flights were provided by Finnair, which flies to Japan via Helsinki from \u00a3590 return, including taxes. Rail passes were provided by Japanese National Tourist Board; they cost \u00a3159 for a seven-day pass. Accommodation was provided by Hyatt Regency Kyoto (doubles from \u00a3122, room-only); Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo (doubles from \u00a3276 per night B&B); and Ibsuki Hakusuikan, a Japanese inn with an onsen hot spring spa (doubles from \u00a3188, half-board). Set fugu-tasting menus are available at two-Michelin-starred Hakata Izumi (the website is in Japanese only): lunch from \u00a320, dinner from \u00a356 \u2013 book through your Fukuoka hotel\u2019s concierge.

Her son said: \u201cReconstruction hasn\u2019t really progressed very much (in the four years) but everyone\u2019s doing the best they can so we have to too.\u201dBut work to house tens of thousands of displaced residents has made slow progress amid administrative holdups, rising construction costs and the challenge of rebuilding on high ground away from the vulnerable coastline.Just 15% of the 29,000 permanent homes planned for survivors and nuclear evacuees have been completed in the three worst affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima.The long wait has taken its toll on the health of displaced survivors.In the four years since the disaster, more than 3,200 people, many of them elderly, have died of illnesses exacerbated by their living conditions, suicide and other causes, according to government records.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is expected to respond to criticism of the slow rate of recovery by announcing a new five-year plan this summer to boost the reconstruction of ruined costal communities and decontaminate residential areas affected by the Fukushima meltdown.\u201cReconstruction is shifting to a new stage,\u201d Abe said, adding that he hoped rebuilding work would be completed by the time Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics in 2020. \u201cWe will help disaster victims become self-sustaining. As the government, we will provide the best possible support.\u201dAlthough some families have been allowed to return to their homes on the outskirts of the 20km (12 mile) evacuation zone, almost 120,000 people are still living in nuclear limbo.Japan has spent more than $15bn on lowering atmospheric radiation levels in residential areas near the stricken power plant, creating mountains of radioactive waste that is stored in 88,000 temporary sites in the area.\u201cA large number of workers have been brought in to decontaminate the village, so that residents can return, but when I look at what they are doing, the situation seems hopeless,\u201d said Nobuyoshi Ito, an environment specialist who carries out independent radiation tests on crops in the evacuated village of Iitate.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much it will cost, and even if the work is completed, it won\u2019t be clean enough for villagers to return and resume their lives.\u201dYoung families with children, fearing the possible effects of long-term exposure to radiation to their health, are scattered across Fukushima prefecture and elsewhere in Japan, leaving mainly elderly evacuees behind in cramped temporary housing units.Michihito Endo, a retired teacher from Tomioka, a deserted town near the plant, does not believe he will ever go home. \u201cWe used to be able to walk in the mountains and drink the water, to enjoy ourselves without a care in the world,\u201d Endo said.\u201cThat\u2019s no longer possible. It\u2019s very hard to take. I get very angry when I think about how Tepco and the government promoted the construction of so many nuclear power plants.\u201dAt Fukushima Daiichi \u2013 scene of the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl \u2013 optimism following the removal of more than 1,300 spent fuel assemblies from one damaged reactor building has been tempered by recent reports of yet more leaks of highly contaminated water. That is in addition to the 200,000 tonnes of toxic water already being stored in hundreds of tanks blanketing the site.Workers have yet to begin the removal of melted fuel from the three reactors that suffered meltdown, a process that will take four decades and cost tens of billions of yen.Abe also faces criticism of his push to restart idled nuclear reactors while so little progress has been made in the area affected by the Fukushima crisis.All of Japan\u2019s 48 working reactors were shut down to undergo stringent new safety checks in the wake of the disaster.The country\u2019s nuclear watchdog has approved the restart of two reactors in south-west Japan, but local opposition could frustrate Abe\u2019s plans to have them generating power again in the next few months.The pro-nuclear lobby insists that at least some reactors must go back online if Japan is to tackle the mounting cost of importing fossil fuels and make progress towards meeting its climate change commitments.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Shinzo Abe", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment"], "title": "Japan remembers the 18,000 victims of 2011's triple disaster"},{"date": "2015-02-22T13:34:50Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The regulation eight hours in the office is over. The most important work of the day is done; whatever is left can wait until the morning. This is the point many workers would think about heading for the door.Yet for millions of Japanese employees, the thought of clearing away their desks and being at home in time for dinner is enough to invite accusations of disloyalty.But after decades of giving companies carte blanche to milk every last drop of productivity from their workforce, a challenge to Japan\u2019s ingrained culture of overwork has come from the government, which is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to take at least five days\u2019 paid holiday a year.Japanese employees are currently entitled to an average 18.5 days\u2019 paid holiday a year \u2013 only two fewer than the global average \u2013 with a minimum of 10 days as well as 15 one-day national holidays. In reality, few come even close to taking their full quota, typically using only nine of their 18.5 days average entitlement, according to the labour ministry. While many British workers regard a two-week summer holiday as an inalienable right, workers here have come to see a four-night vacation in Hawaii as the height of self-indulgence.The move, to be debated in the current parliamentary session, comes after companies started encouraging employees to nap on the job to improve their performance.By the end of the decade, the government hopes that, if passed, the law will push Japanese employees towards following the example set by British workers, who use an average of 20 days\u2019 paid annual leave, and those in France, who take an average of 25.It is a worker\u2019s right to take paid vacations. But working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.Japan\u2019s unforgiving work culture may have helped turn it into an economic superpower, its corporate foot soldiers revered in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company, but this has often been to the exclusion of everything else.Japan\u2019s low birthrate and predictions of rapid population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families. More employees are falling ill from stress, or worse, succumbing to karoshi, death through overwork.Despite studies suggesting that longer hours in the office, workshop or factory floor do not necessarily make people more productive, today\u2019s workers are still nursing a collective hangover from the bubble years of the 1980s.About 22% of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of US workers and 11% in France and Germany, according to data compiled by the Japanese government. At 35%, South Korea\u2019s workaholics are even worse off.In spending 14 hours a day at work and giving up many of her paid holidays, Erika Sekiguchi is not even an extreme example. The 36-year-old trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation last year, six of which counted as sick leave. \u201cNobody else uses their vacation days,\u201d Sekiguchi said.She faces the dilemma shared by her peers in companies across Japan: to take time off to recharge, or risk inviting criticism for appearing to leave more committed colleagues in the lurch.Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours, who admits putting in 100 hours of overtime a month, blames the irresistible pressure to match one\u2019s colleagues, hour for hour. \u201cIt is a worker\u2019s right to take paid vacations,\u201d Wakebe said. \u201cBut working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.\u201dThat fear of being ostracised at work is being blamed for a rise in stress-related illness, premature death and suicide. According to official data, about 200 people die every year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules.Late last year, a court in Tokyo ordered a restaurant chain to pay compensation of \u00a558m (\u00a3320,000) to the family of a former manager of one of its outlets who hanged himself in 2010 after being made to work punishingly long hours. Court documents show the man had worked almost 200 hours of overtime a month in the seven months before his death, a form of \u201cpower harassment\u201d that the judge blamed for leaving the victim mentally ill.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is not known for taking long vacations. Yet even he has spoken out against the unreasonable demands companies place on their employees as they struggle to stay afloat in a more complex globalised market. Japan\u2019s working culture, Abe said recently, \u201cfalsely beatifies long hours\u201d.", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Work & careers", "Work-life balance", "Money", "World news", "Business"], "title": "Clocking off: Japan calls time on long-hours work culture"},{"date": "2015-02-16T15:48:39Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan pulled itself out of recession in the last three months of 2014, but the rebound was weaker than expected as household and corporate spending failed to move up a gear.The preliminary reading for gross domestic product (GDP) showed a quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.6% in October to December, which Tokyo said translates into an annualised 2.2%.The annualised figure was much smaller than a 3.7% increase forecast in a Reuters poll and underlines the challenge premier the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, faces in shaking off decades of stagnation.Analysts said the fragile recovery was the hangover from last spring\u2019s sales hike that shocked Japanese consumers and triggered a six-month spending freeze.The economic minister, Akira Amari, said the economy was on track for a recovery with signs that consumer sentiment was finally picking up. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts Takuji Aida and Kiyoko Katahira said Abe\u2019s decision to push back a second sales tax hike by two years to 2017, would give the economy a strong boost.\u201cGiven that PM Abe has decided to postpone the second tax hike to April 2017 from October 2015, the downside pressure in 2015 has largely been removed,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cThe GDP growth rate for 2015 should be supported by robust consumption and trade, and we forecast growth of around 1.5% year on year. \u201cAbe has announced he will not delay the second tax hike again. In other words, he has made a strong commitment to reflate the economy,.\u201dBut some analysts warned that weak rebound in consumption and capital expenditure remained a worrying sign.\u201cThese are somewhat disappointing figures,\u201d said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. \u201cThe situation remains weak and companies are clearly postponing investments.\u201dHowever, the rebound from recession will allow the Bank of Japan to hold off on expanding monetary stimulus. The central bank has proved to be one of the most aggressive in printing money to make borrowing cheaper and to drive down the value of the yen.Like most central banks, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has seen inflation fall below its 2% target following the collapse in oil prices that has dramatically cut fuel costs and a slowdown in China that has reduced the price of other commodities.Abe said he hoped the central bank continued with its bold monetary easing campaign to boost lending and inflation back to its target. Speaking in parliament, Abe praised the BoJ\u2019s aggressive stimulus programme for helping revive the economy and wipe out the public\u2019s \u201csticky deflationary mindset\u201d. He acknowledged that some weakness in household spending, but added that he saw signs of recovery in the economy, such as improvements in consumer sentiment. \u201cWe\u2019ll strive to ensure that wages keep rising this year and next, so that the warm breeze of recovery blows throughout the nation,\u201d Abe said.", "tags": ["Economics", "Japan", "Global recession", "Asia Pacific", "Global economy", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Financial crisis"], "title": "Japan emerges from recession but rebound is weaker than expected"},{"date": "2015-02-16T13:53:42Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is out of recession. After two quarters in which the economy contracted, growth resumed in the final three months of 2014.However, that was the end of the good news for the prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Growth remains sluggish. There was no expansion at all in 2014. The much-vaunted \u201cthree-arrow strategy\u201d is proving a bit of a flop.Three things are particularly worrying about the latest news from the world\u2019s third biggest economy. The first is that consumers are reluctant to spend despite the government\u2019s decision to postpone an increase in VAT planned for this spring. It was the dampening effect of last year\u2019s consumption tax rise that drove Japan into technical recession in the second and third quarters of 2014.The second concern is that companies are not investing. Although profits are high and companies are awash with money, they are sitting on their cash piles rather than spending them on new kit. Abe\u2019s \u201cthree arrows\u201d were supposed to mark a break with Japan\u2019s two-decade period of weak growth and deflation. The corporate sector clearly remains unconvinced.Finally, there is the performance of exports. The first of Abe\u2019s arrows involved an aggressive quantitative-easing (QE) programme, with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) creating money through the purchase of government bonds. This drove down the value of the yen, making Japanese exports cheaper.But the pick-up in overseas sales has been modest when set against the scale of the monetary easing, in part because global demand has been less buoyant than expected and in part because Japan is not the only country trying to push its currency lower.Indeed, since the European Central Bank dropped a hint late last year that it was starting it own QE programme, the yen has been rising against the euro.So what happens now? As a big oil-importing nation, Japan is one of the countries that should benefit most from the falling cost of crude. This though, is unlikely to be enough to give the economy the boost Abe is looking for.Consumers and businesses know that this spring\u2019s tax increase has been delayed, not abandoned. They are tightening belts in anticipation of the moment when the government takes action to repair the public finances. The second arrow \u2013 fiscal policy \u2013 has therefore not really hit the target.The third arrow \u2013 structural reform \u2013 has remained in the quiver despite the thumping mandate given to Abe in last year\u2019s general election. That only leaves monetary policy, which is why there is speculation that the BoJ will announce further easing.But this has its risks. In Japan as elsewhere, QE tends to have a bigger impact on asset prices than the real economy. The massive purchases by the BoJ are starting to gum up the bond market. And using QE to drive down the yen runs the risk of retaliation. A currency war in 2015 looks like a real possibility.", "tags": ["Japan", "Economics", "Financial crisis", "Asia Pacific", "Global recession", "Banking", "Financial sector", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Quantitative easing", "European Central Bank", "Global economy"], "title": "Japan beats recession but the good news ends there"},{"date": "2015-02-23T22:59:02Z", "country": "japan", "content": "It is 140 years old, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies and a much-loved Japanese national institution. And soon, investors will have the opportunity to claim a stake of their own.Plans to float part of Japan Post\u2019s business, which were announced in December, represent the culmination of a lengthy process with much at stake politically. The holding company, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies, and two of its four subsidiaries \u2013 tasked with banking and insurance \u2013 will be opened to investors.The holding company will continue to manage postal services and mail delivery, to which the Japanese are very attached due to the extensive network reaching even the most remote corners of the archipelago.The project will be submitted to the Tokyo stock exchange in June, with the goal of organising an initial public offering between August and December. \u201cThe law on privatisation of Japan Post requires us to bring in private equity as soon as possible,\u201d said CEO Taizo Nishimuro, adding that listing the three parts of the business at the same time \u201cwas the best way to ensure fair valuation\u201d. Eleven banks, including JP Morgan and Nomura Holdings, will manage the operation.Privatisation will involve several steps. The first phase should raise \u00a51tn to \u00a52tn ($8.4bn to $16.8bn) according to Japan\u2019s ministry of finance, which has given the go-ahead for the initial public offering. The proceeds will be used to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake, tidal wave and subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster that hit Japan in March 2011.The holding company \u2013 in which the state can legally retain a 30% share \u2013 will gradually divest itself of its interests in banking and insurance, until it owns only 50% of the whole. The two activities will thus gain a degree of independence, opening the way for diversification.The banking division manages deposits worth \u00a5178tn, consisting mainly of pensioners\u2019 savings. The funds are used to buy low-yield treasury bonds, which finance public debt and infrastructure spending in Japan.Under the changes, the banking division hopes to be permitted to make loans to big business and issue mortgages. Its distribution network will be enlarged and there are plans for partnerships with regional bodies. One of the objectives is to offer financial services in areas where there are few banks.The insurance division, which has so far concentrated on life insurance, is also keen to diversify.The question is whether investors, particularly from abroad, will find the offering attractive. Between April and September Japan Post generated \u00a5217bn in profits, but its postal services division is running at a loss. Furthermore its business is concentrated in Japan, where an ageing population may well be a limit on the scope for growth. The holding\u2019s various divisions will consequently need to look overseas. Related: Japan Post offers $6.5bn to take over Australia's Toll Holdings Privatisation of this venerable public concern was one of Junichiro Koizumi\u2019s priorities. As prime minister from 2001-2006 he worked hard to achieve this goal, even calling an early general election in 2005 as a form of referendum on the matter. A bill he proposed provided for a 10-year transition period, starting in 2007, at the end of which the banking and insurance divisions would be privatised.Koizumi was delivering on a promise made in 1993, as minister of post and telecommunications. He was keen to rid Japan of the lobby formed by postmen, numbering 260,000, a third of all public servants. His grandfather, Matajiro Koizumi, held the same position in 1929-31 and attempted in vain to privatise the post office.Koizumi Jr\u2019s plan was delayed when the Democratic party of Japan came to power in 2009. In 2012 new legislation authorised the banking and insurance divisions to diversify their activities. After the Liberal Democratic party\u2019s general election victory in December 2012 the government put privatisation back on the agenda. In addition to the influx of ready cash, it seems a good opportunity to showcase its reforming spirit.

Conservation groups have revealed that Norwegian exports of minke whale to Japan contained damaging levels of toxic pesticides, making that meat unfit for human consumption. It\u2019s a discovery that could cue a swifter decline in the appetite for whale. The news emerged this month, when the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) revealed documents showing that the Japanese government rejected imports of Norwegian whale meat because tests showed samples contained pesticides at twice the limit Japan imposes on its imports. The meat harboured chemicals such as aldrin, dieldrin, and chlordane, thought to play a role in causing birth defects, neurological harm, and some cancers if humans consume them in high quantities. Norway continues to run a large scale whaling industry\u2014the country took a record catch of 736 minke whales in 2014\u2014but surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t exist for Norwegians. \u201cFewer than five percent [of Norwegians] eat whale meat regularly,\u201d says Kate O\u2019Connell, a marine wildlife consultant from the AWI, explaining that they see it as old-fashioned fare. By comparison, Japan is a much bigger market. \u201cJapan has always been the main consumer of whale products,\u201d says Clare Perry, the head of the EIA\u2019s oceans campaign. But even there, it\u2019s losing its appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s not fashionable at all. There\u2019s an older generation in Japan that have a nostalgia about eating it, but it\u2019s not in any way a staple diet,\u201d she says. Nevertheless, a chunk of the Norwegian catch is still exported there annually: 137 tonnes of Norwegian minke have entered Japan in the last two years.Proof of pesticide poisoning may somewhat sour that appetite, something that even a global hunting ban hasn\u2019t been able to quash. There are three remaining countries that continue to hunt and eat whale commercially \u2014 Norway, Japan, and Iceland\u2014and each one ignores the worldwide ruling against this activity.In 1982 the International Whaling Commission completely outlawed commercial whale hunting. \u201cThat applies to all countries that are members of the IWC. Japan, Norway, and Iceland are all members of the IWC,\u201d Perry emphasizes. The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) also bans the trade in minke meat to protect the species, which isn\u2019t endangered but has experienced a dramatic population dive since whaling began. \u201cThere\u2019s concern over whether the hunt is sustainable,\u201d Perry notes. (Norway insists that it is, which explains why it still awards itself an annual catch quota of more than 1000 whales, one the IWC doesn\u2019t acknowledge.)When the international moratorium came into force in the 80s, Norway objected to it, which afforded the country a legal loophole that allows it to continue the hunt while maintaining its IWC membership. Norway, Iceland, and Japan also reject the CITES ban, a move that technically permits them to continue with the trade. \u201cFrom our perspective Norway should be abiding by those treaties,\u201d Perry says.Until that happens, it seems like pesticide contamination is the whales\u2019 best defence\u2014though it\u2019s also bound to harm the whales. The chemicals identified in the minkes\u2019 meat are agriculture products that would most likely have entered the ocean via agricultural run-off. Some of the pesticides, like dieldrin and chlordane, have been banned in the European Union and the United States because of their toxic effects. Because they\u2019re persistent pollutants, however, they\u2019ve lingered in the ocean. By entering the food chain and bioaccumulating within it, the chemicals eventually find their way into the bodies of larger mammals like whales. \u201cIf we think it\u2019s potentially dangerous for us to eat, you can imagine it\u2019s not particularly healthy for a whale,\u201d Perry says. As Norway\u2019s appetite for the meat dwindles, it continues to pursue markets elsewhere for its whales. But that may grow more challenging, especially since the recent meat scare isn\u2019t the first the country has caused. In fact, in the past, shipments of Norwegian whale meat have been found to be infested with bacteria and also to contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury.Within Norway, there are ongoing efforts to try and revive the meat\u2019s appeal, and there are even generous government subsidies in place to try and support the industry and keep this historical practice alive. \u201cIt is clear, however, that without an export market, the Norwegian whaling industry will continue to struggle,\u201d O\u2019Connell says. In that sense, perhaps for whales the pesticides are a morbid kind of defence against the minority that still has a taste for their meat.", "tags": ["Environment"], "title": "Japan refuses Norway's toxic whale meat"},{"date": "2015-01-20T15:50:35Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I\u2019ve always wanted to visit Japan, though I can\u2019t quite explain why. Somewhere in the mix of childhood influences ranging from You Only Live Twice and Shogun, to Tenko and those Clive James shows, came an impression of a complex, frenzied, contradictory and quietly beautiful culture that fascinated me. There\u2019s one thing all the guidebooks agree on, though: don\u2019t go in August. Go in springtime, when the cherry blossom blooms. Or in autumn, when the copious greenery turns a blazing copper. But avoid hot and humid August. So, on 9 August last year, my friend Emma and I depart.Tokyo, when we get there, has caught the tail end of a super-typhoon. After a long flight, it\u2019s genuinely refreshing to walk through the sweeping curtains of rain. Itchy-eyed and numbed with jet lag, we nevertheless manage to shuffle around the excellent Tokyo National Museum, everything feeling slightly unreal and accompanied by a constant clip-clop refrain as though someone were following us around with a glockenspiel. It turns out to be a young couple in exquisite his & hers kimonos and those dazzlingly white, slightly sinister bifurcated socks, their chunky wooden sandals beating the distinctive tattoo as they traipse around.Struggling to stay awake, we find a nice little place to eat. There\u2019s much pointing and laughter as we negotiate our way around the menus, but the waiters are kind and helpful. Though we\u2019re screened from our fellow diners by laminated curtains, the smoke from their scandalous-seeming cigarettes drifts through on to our delicious raw quail. It\u2019s quite nostalgic. We drive back through a violent storm, Tokyo now bursting into blurry neon life: the cab driver in white gloves, the car with whispering automatic doors, like something from the future as envisioned in the 1970s.The next day, after a fantastic sleep, there\u2019s an apologetic waitress at breakfast: \u201cSorry for keeping you waiting.\u201d She bows and smiles and smiles and bows, though she hasn\u2019t kept us waiting at all. We go down on to the amazingly clean, efficient tube system, which is fairly quiet during this holiday period, with none of the fabled pushing and shoving. First stop: the famous Tsukiji fish market; a strange mix of working atmosphere and tourist attraction. Octopus suckers writhe in smashed ice. Men with hooks slice at giant frozen tuna, like medieval artisans carving pink alabaster pillars. Tuna flakes skitter to the floor, though whether they\u2019re thrown away or headed for Sainsbury\u2019s, it\u2019s impossible to know.Next, we visit the first of many (many) shrines. One was erected to the memory of the great reforming Emperor Meiji, with beautifully laid-out forest trails leading to purification areas and little booths where you can make a wish for the spirits to answer. It soon becomes clear that all the shrines have these, like concessions in a department store, flogging benedictions. Is it any different, though, I wonder, to the little shops in cathedrals selling CDs of plainsong? The rituals involve washing both hands and the mouth, then writing down a wish that is hung up on a wooden plaque. There is something a bit relentless about the commercialisation of this, and about the sheer number of shrines you traipse through.One fascinating aspect of the Meiji temple are the strange indentations that cover the great wooden pillars and doors. With more than 3 million visitors a year, it can get very busy. Pilgrims have taken simply to hurling coins towards the shrine from a great distance, pockmarking the woodwork. They do offer, though, oases of calm in the sometimes overwhelming bustle. Most have been lovingly rebuilt after total destruction during the war.We plunge back into a crazier, ultra-fashionable, teen-centred Tokyo \u2013 though, as always in a strange city, I fear that I\u2019m actually standing in the middle of the equivalent of London\u2019s Camden Town. Fashions are mysterious and charming. Many women wear a sun-shunning outfit of broad-brimmed hat, long gloves and pretty lacy parasol of dusty pink or grey. They look like Victorian ghosts in surgical masks, keeping to the hard shadows or cycling past on the thronged pavement.Next day we leave for Hiroshima and our first experience of the bullet train. It is filled with impossibly cute children and super-efficient staff who bow as they enter and leave each carriage: the levels of courtesy and friendliness are so staggeringly different from Britain, it\u2019s shaming.Hiroshima is a quietly devastating place. Now a bustling modern city, it\u2019s nevertheless entirely defined by the events of 6 August 1945, and signs everywhere show what used to stand or how far you are from the \u201chypocentre\u201d of the atomic explosion. The shattered dome above which the A-bomb detonated stands within the Peace Park, where the accompanying museum pulls no punches. Inside are displays of melted spectacles, watches all stopped at 8.15am, burned and bloodied children\u2019s clothing, dropped-out hair, fingernails. We emerge, humbled and moved, into a balmy red evening, scores of people sitting in quiet contemplation.Later, down a back street, we find a tiny place for dinner. It has linen curtains and fat lanterns outside, and an atmosphere of slightly seedy congeniality with more, nicely rowdy smokers within. I jab a finger at the all-Japanese menu in the hope of ordering beer. Two tumblers of pale liquid arrive. \u201cIt looks like whisky!\u201d I laugh. It is whisky. But, again, the staff are incredibly helpful, beaming, fun. We get by with a little Japanese and a little English, and enjoy huge grilled peppers with fish flakes on top and delicious sea bass with sticky rice.A short train and ferry ride from Hiroshima is Miyajima Island, a Unesco world heritage site, where deer roam freely, nudging at tourists, tripping in and out of streams. Sadly, they\u2019ve gone the way of all creatures closely exposed to humans, scavenging for food and, like ravenous goats, even eating paper maps. But if you get away from the heavily commercialised harbour, the island becomes more serene and attractive. There\u2019s an unexpectedly brilliant aquarium full of delights: otters, sharks, porpoises. Moon jellyfish that change colour from white to blue to pink to green. Up the hills, through verdant gardens, are more temples with sun dazzling off their tin roofs, sonorous tolling bells and dozens of smiling buddhas wearing little knitted\u2248hats and bibs, most old and weathered, like grave goods. It transpires that there\u2019s to be a fireworks display later and suddenly the whole island is thronged with visitors, most of them courting young couples, again in gorgeous kimonos. Apparently it\u2019s become very fashionable for the young to wear these traditional clothes again, especially on dates. It\u2019s touching to see boys and girls both looking splendid and in love. We dine, cross-legged, on oysters and eel, then watch the fireworks bloom over the island.Another super-efficient bullet train takes us to Fukuoka \u2013 the \u201cgateway to southern Japan\u201d. As we race through the countryside, the landscape can suddenly transform. Breathtaking mists creep over the mountains. A shaft of sun on a powder-blue tiled roof, or the broad white wings of cranes in wet fields, suddenly illuminate quite how different this place is. We\u2019re on a whistlestop tour, including a video of an extraordinary local carnival \u2013 which we\u2019ve just missed \u2013 in which hundreds of trouserless men in white shirts carry massive floats on six poles. It\u2019s like the running of the bulls, but with buttocks. It turns out the shirts are a fairly recent addition, because people thought the near-nakedness was offensive. Why they didn\u2019t think to put trousers on is beyond me.In the evening, with much fanfare, we\u2019re taken to a two-star Michelin restaurant to eat the infamous fugu fish. It\u2019s an intoxicating prospect (with the emphasis on the toxic), because the flesh of the puffer fish is more deadly than cyanide. Only a small part is edible. The restaurant is wonderfully minimal, plain, cedar-scented, paper-walled, just as you\u2019d hope it to be. We\u2019re given a short tour of the kitchens and see the fugu, which arrives pre-prepared in a box, like shoes. We\u2019re closely observed as we eat, like royal food-tasters under the eye of a wary monarch. The fugu itself is curiously bland. It comes in razor-thin slivers and has a rainbow hue, like petrol in the road. But the accompanying flavours into which we dip the fish (tiny leeks, spring onions, risotto) are delicious, and one course, unexpectedly, comes in batter. Just like Harry Ramsden\u2019s, but with the frisson of potential death.Still alive, next day we take the train to Nagasaki: a very different prospect to Hiroshima. As (almost) the only port open to the west during Japan\u2019s 200-year period of isolation, it has a ramshackle mix of influences. There are lovely clapboard colonial houses from the Dutch and Portuguese settlements, and a proper neon maze of a Chinatown. Walking into town by the canal-side, you catch dark, scuttling shapes out of the corner of the eye. Astonishingly, they\u2019re crabs, hiding in the grates and drains. Loud firecrackers start to go off \u2013 it\u2019s Obon, the Japanese festival of the dead. As the humid air breaks into driving rain, there\u2019s a strange, warm calm. An off-key bell tolls as families carry huge, lantern-covered \u201cships of the dead\u201d down the winding streets in memory of lost loved ones, including, delightfully, a photo of Elvis. Firecrackers burst and spark in the rain, and gunpowder drifts across us in clouds. As we get back to the hotel, teams of men with witch brooms and surgical masks sweep up the soggy remains of the fireworks. Next morning, there\u2019s not a trace. Curiously, while Japanese cities are quite grubby-looking and industrialised, litter is virtually nonexistent. It simply doesn\u2019t occur to people to drop rubbish.Next stop: Kagoshima. It\u2019s a hot and cloudy day, and the volcano is smothered in cloud when we arrive. The resort in Ibusuki is beautifully designed, with luxurious, cool rooms in traditional Japanese style, as unlike a western spa as you can imagine. Men and women (segregated into different areas) walk about happily naked. There are plunge pools and steam baths and the famous sand baths, warmed by natural springs. We change into kimonos and Emma and I are buried up to our necks in the soft, grey, alien-looking sand by stringy young men with rakes. It\u2019s a strangely pleasant sensation, not too hot. We last about 15 minutes, the sweat beading our faces like raindrops. Only Boris Yeltsin, apparently, has managed to last more than half an hour entombed like this. We\u2019re soon hysterical as our host, the extraordinarily kind Mr Shimotakehara, asks us which parasol we want planting into the sand over our heads, like bathing belles on an Edwardian postcard.A long train journey gets us into Kyoto, back in the central region of Honshu island, which is immediately very different from anywhere else we\u2019ve been. Charming, winding streets and lots of older buildings not flattened in the war. There are shrines, of course, but also genuinely lovely shops and cafes. We have a gorgeous (and very cheap) sushi lunch with green tea ice-cream, and then there\u2019s much excitement as a couple of genuine geishas \u2013 apparently a rare sight \u2013 stroll by. It really is something to see them: the death mask faces, the fantastically elaborate hair, the tiny strip of exposed skin at the nape of the neck.Dusk shows Kyoto at its best. There\u2019s a low-key quality to the atmosphere, subtle and quiet, especially in the charming Pontocho Alley with its half-turned-down lamps, where we eat the justly famous black beef.Next day, we visit the Shogun\u2019s palace with its extraordinary sprung \u201cnightingale\u201d floors designed to squeak in order to warn of assassins and then, farther afield, to the Fushimi shrine with its endless orange tunnel. It\u2019s undeniably spectacular, but we\u2019re shrined-out by now. Then it\u2019s on to the towering bamboo forest, with a swollen, muddy yellow river close by, and fit men doing rickshaw rides with the same swagger as lads on waltzers, cocky and rough.We\u2019re sad to leave Kyoto \u2013 the undoubted hit of the trip \u2013 but one last night in Tokyo affords an astonishing view of the city. Railways stretching under motorways, cars blurring into a sea of light as we head for the Golden Gai \u2013 an extraordinary district of tiny, themed bars, each holding about 10 people. The strains of the Specials\u2019 Ghost Town lead us to a sort of 1979 punk bar with a new wave soundtrack. There\u2019s a fantastic incongruity to listening to Sparks and Blondie in the smoky atmosphere. We drink too much sake, happy.Above all, it\u2019s the people who make Japan. I\u2019ve never been met with such extraordinary kindness, courtesy and friendliness. There\u2019s far more English spoken than people lead you to think, and signage is bilingual \u2013 especially on the trains. I plan to return \u2013 in the spring, of course, or the autumn \u2013 as soon as I can. If this sounds evangelical, it is. Even in sultry August, Japan is a wonder. Go.Flights were provided by Finnair, which flies to Japan via Helsinki from \u00a3590 return, including taxes. Rail passes were provided by Japanese National Tourist Board; they cost \u00a3159 for a seven-day pass. Accommodation was provided by Hyatt Regency Kyoto (doubles from \u00a3122, room-only); Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo (doubles from \u00a3276 per night B&B); and Ibsuki Hakusuikan, a Japanese inn with an onsen hot spring spa (doubles from \u00a3188, half-board). Set fugu-tasting menus are available at two-Michelin-starred Hakata Izumi (the website is in Japanese only): lunch from \u00a320, dinner from \u00a356 \u2013 book through your Fukuoka hotel\u2019s concierge.

Her son said: \u201cReconstruction hasn\u2019t really progressed very much (in the four years) but everyone\u2019s doing the best they can so we have to too.\u201dBut work to house tens of thousands of displaced residents has made slow progress amid administrative holdups, rising construction costs and the challenge of rebuilding on high ground away from the vulnerable coastline.Just 15% of the 29,000 permanent homes planned for survivors and nuclear evacuees have been completed in the three worst affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima.The long wait has taken its toll on the health of displaced survivors.In the four years since the disaster, more than 3,200 people, many of them elderly, have died of illnesses exacerbated by their living conditions, suicide and other causes, according to government records.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is expected to respond to criticism of the slow rate of recovery by announcing a new five-year plan this summer to boost the reconstruction of ruined costal communities and decontaminate residential areas affected by the Fukushima meltdown.\u201cReconstruction is shifting to a new stage,\u201d Abe said, adding that he hoped rebuilding work would be completed by the time Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics in 2020. \u201cWe will help disaster victims become self-sustaining. As the government, we will provide the best possible support.\u201dAlthough some families have been allowed to return to their homes on the outskirts of the 20km (12 mile) evacuation zone, almost 120,000 people are still living in nuclear limbo.Japan has spent more than $15bn on lowering atmospheric radiation levels in residential areas near the stricken power plant, creating mountains of radioactive waste that is stored in 88,000 temporary sites in the area.\u201cA large number of workers have been brought in to decontaminate the village, so that residents can return, but when I look at what they are doing, the situation seems hopeless,\u201d said Nobuyoshi Ito, an environment specialist who carries out independent radiation tests on crops in the evacuated village of Iitate.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much it will cost, and even if the work is completed, it won\u2019t be clean enough for villagers to return and resume their lives.\u201dYoung families with children, fearing the possible effects of long-term exposure to radiation to their health, are scattered across Fukushima prefecture and elsewhere in Japan, leaving mainly elderly evacuees behind in cramped temporary housing units.Michihito Endo, a retired teacher from Tomioka, a deserted town near the plant, does not believe he will ever go home. \u201cWe used to be able to walk in the mountains and drink the water, to enjoy ourselves without a care in the world,\u201d Endo said.\u201cThat\u2019s no longer possible.

That is in addition to the 200,000 tonnes of toxic water already being stored in hundreds of tanks blanketing the site.Workers have yet to begin the removal of melted fuel from the three reactors that suffered meltdown, a process that will take four decades and cost tens of billions of yen.Abe also faces criticism of his push to restart idled nuclear reactors while so little progress has been made in the area affected by the Fukushima crisis.All of Japan\u2019s 48 working reactors were shut down to undergo stringent new safety checks in the wake of the disaster.The country\u2019s nuclear watchdog has approved the restart of two reactors in south-west Japan, but local opposition could frustrate Abe\u2019s plans to have them generating power again in the next few months.The pro-nuclear lobby insists that at least some reactors must go back online if Japan is to tackle the mounting cost of importing fossil fuels and make progress towards meeting its climate change commitments.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Shinzo Abe", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment"], "title": "Japan remembers the 18,000 victims of 2011's triple disaster"},{"date": "2015-02-22T13:34:50Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The regulation eight hours in the office is over. The most important work of the day is done; whatever is left can wait until the morning. This is the point many workers would think about heading for the door.Yet for millions of Japanese employees, the thought of clearing away their desks and being at home in time for dinner is enough to invite accusations of disloyalty.But after decades of giving companies carte blanche to milk every last drop of productivity from their workforce, a challenge to Japan\u2019s ingrained culture of overwork has come from the government, which is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to take at least five days\u2019 paid holiday a year.Japanese employees are currently entitled to an average 18.5 days\u2019 paid holiday a year \u2013 only two fewer than the global average \u2013 with a minimum of 10 days as well as 15 one-day national holidays. In reality, few come even close to taking their full quota, typically using only nine of their 18.5 days average entitlement, according to the labour ministry. While many British workers regard a two-week summer holiday as an inalienable right, workers here have come to see a four-night vacation in Hawaii as the height of self-indulgence.The move, to be debated in the current parliamentary session, comes after companies started encouraging employees to nap on the job to improve their performance.By the end of the decade, the government hopes that, if passed, the law will push Japanese employees towards following the example set by British workers, who use an average of 20 days\u2019 paid annual leave, and those in France, who take an average of 25.It is a worker\u2019s right to take paid vacations. But working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.Japan\u2019s unforgiving work culture may have helped turn it into an economic superpower, its corporate foot soldiers revered in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company, but this has often been to the exclusion of everything else.Japan\u2019s low birthrate and predictions of rapid population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families. More employees are falling ill from stress, or worse, succumbing to karoshi, death through overwork.Despite studies suggesting that longer hours in the office, workshop or factory floor do not necessarily make people more productive, today\u2019s workers are still nursing a collective hangover from the bubble years of the 1980s.About 22% of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of US workers and 11% in France and Germany, according to data compiled by the Japanese government. At 35%, South Korea\u2019s workaholics are even worse off.In spending 14 hours a day at work and giving up many of her paid holidays, Erika Sekiguchi is not even an extreme example. The 36-year-old trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation last year, six of which counted as sick leave. \u201cNobody else uses their vacation days,\u201d Sekiguchi said.She faces the dilemma shared by her peers in companies across Japan: to take time off to recharge, or risk inviting criticism for appearing to leave more committed colleagues in the lurch.Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours, who admits putting in 100 hours of overtime a month, blames the irresistible pressure to match one\u2019s colleagues, hour for hour. \u201cIt is a worker\u2019s right to take paid vacations,\u201d Wakebe said. \u201cBut working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.\u201dThat fear of being ostracised at work is being blamed for a rise in stress-related illness, premature death and suicide. According to official data, about 200 people die every year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules.Late last year, a court in Tokyo ordered a restaurant chain to pay compensation of \u00a558m (\u00a3320,000) to the family of a former manager of one of its outlets who hanged himself in 2010 after being made to work punishingly long hours. Court documents show the man had worked almost 200 hours of overtime a month in the seven months before his death, a form of \u201cpower harassment\u201d that the judge blamed for leaving the victim mentally ill.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is not known for taking long vacations. Yet even he has spoken out against the unreasonable demands companies place on their employees as they struggle to stay afloat in a more complex globalised market.

Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts Takuji Aida and Kiyoko Katahira said Abe\u2019s decision to push back a second sales tax hike by two years to 2017, would give the economy a strong boost.\u201cGiven that PM Abe has decided to postpone the second tax hike to April 2017 from October 2015, the downside pressure in 2015 has largely been removed,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cThe GDP growth rate for 2015 should be supported by robust consumption and trade, and we forecast growth of around 1.5% year on year. \u201cAbe has announced he will not delay the second tax hike again. In other words, he has made a strong commitment to reflate the economy,.\u201dBut some analysts warned that weak rebound in consumption and capital expenditure remained a worrying sign.\u201cThese are somewhat disappointing figures,\u201d said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. \u201cThe situation remains weak and companies are clearly postponing investments.\u201dHowever, the rebound from recession will allow the Bank of Japan to hold off on expanding monetary stimulus. The central bank has proved to be one of the most aggressive in printing money to make borrowing cheaper and to drive down the value of the yen.Like most central banks, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has seen inflation fall below its 2% target following the collapse in oil prices that has dramatically cut fuel costs and a slowdown in China that has reduced the price of other commodities.Abe said he hoped the central bank continued with its bold monetary easing campaign to boost lending and inflation back to its target. Speaking in parliament, Abe praised the BoJ\u2019s aggressive stimulus programme for helping revive the economy and wipe out the public\u2019s \u201csticky deflationary mindset\u201d. He acknowledged that some weakness in household spending, but added that he saw signs of recovery in the economy, such as improvements in consumer sentiment. \u201cWe\u2019ll strive to ensure that wages keep rising this year and next, so that the warm breeze of recovery blows throughout the nation,\u201d Abe said.", "tags": ["Economics", "Japan", "Global recession", "Asia Pacific", "Global economy", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Financial crisis"], "title": "Japan emerges from recession but rebound is weaker than expected"},{"date": "2015-02-16T13:53:42Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is out of recession. After two quarters in which the economy contracted, growth resumed in the final three months of 2014.However, that was the end of the good news for the prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Growth remains sluggish. There was no expansion at all in 2014. The much-vaunted \u201cthree-arrow strategy\u201d is proving a bit of a flop.Three things are particularly worrying about the latest news from the world\u2019s third biggest economy. The first is that consumers are reluctant to spend despite the government\u2019s decision to postpone an increase in VAT planned for this spring. It was the dampening effect of last year\u2019s consumption tax rise that drove Japan into technical recession in the second and third quarters of 2014.The second concern is that companies are not investing. Although profits are high and companies are awash with money, they are sitting on their cash piles rather than spending them on new kit. Abe\u2019s \u201cthree arrows\u201d were supposed to mark a break with Japan\u2019s two-decade period of weak growth and deflation. The corporate sector clearly remains unconvinced.Finally, there is the performance of exports. The first of Abe\u2019s arrows involved an aggressive quantitative-easing (QE) programme, with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) creating money through the purchase of government bonds. This drove down the value of the yen, making Japanese exports cheaper.But the pick-up in overseas sales has been modest when set against the scale of the monetary easing, in part because global demand has been less buoyant than expected and in part because Japan is not the only country trying to push its currency lower.Indeed, since the European Central Bank dropped a hint late last year that it was starting it own QE programme, the yen has been rising against the euro.So what happens now? As a big oil-importing nation, Japan is one of the countries that should benefit most from the falling cost of crude. This though, is unlikely to be enough to give the economy the boost Abe is looking for.Consumers and businesses know that this spring\u2019s tax increase has been delayed, not abandoned. They are tightening belts in anticipation of the moment when the government takes action to repair the public finances. The second arrow \u2013 fiscal policy \u2013 has therefore not really hit the target.The third arrow \u2013 structural reform \u2013 has remained in the quiver despite the thumping mandate given to Abe in last year\u2019s general election. That only leaves monetary policy, which is why there is speculation that the BoJ will announce further easing.But this has its risks. In Japan as elsewhere, QE tends to have a bigger impact on asset prices than the real economy. The massive purchases by the BoJ are starting to gum up the bond market. And using QE to drive down the yen runs the risk of retaliation. A currency war in 2015 looks like a real possibility.", "tags": ["Japan", "Economics", "Financial crisis", "Asia Pacific", "Global recession", "Banking", "Financial sector", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Quantitative easing", "European Central Bank", "Global economy"], "title": "Japan beats recession but the good news ends there"},{"date": "2015-01-14T06:03:56Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has announced its biggest ever defence budget in response to China\u2019s increasing military influence in the region and Beijing\u2019s claims to a group of disputed islands administered by Tokyo.The 4.98 trillion yen (US$ 42bn) budget approved by the cabinet on Wednesday is up 2% from last year and marks the third straight increase after more than a decade of cuts.The rise is in line with Japan\u2019s more assertive defence policy under the conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as he seeks to counter Chinese influence and remove the postwar legal shackles from his country\u2019s military.This year Abe is expected to push for legislation to reinterpret Japan\u2019s constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight alongside allies on foreign soil for the first time since the end of the second world war. The move has been welcomed in Washington, which wants Japan to play a bigger role in the bilateral security alliance.At US$112.2bn, China\u2019s defence budget dwarfs that of Japan. China is second only to the US, which spent US$600.4bn on defence in 2013, while Japan ranked seventh, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London.Much of the military hardware included in Japan\u2019s new budget is designed to monitor outlying territories and repel any attempt to invade island chains in the East China Sea.It includes money for 20 P-1 maritime surveillance aircraft, six F-35 fighters, five Osprey planes that double as helicopters, Global Hawk drones, two Aegis radar-equipped destroyers and a missile defence system to be jointly developed with the US.The defence ministry also plans to buy 30 amphibious assault vehicles and an early-warning aircraft that will patrol islands in southern Japan.The defence minister, Gen Nakatani, said extra defence spending was a response to the \u201cchanging situation\u201d in the region \u2013 a clear reference to repeated incursions by Chinese surveillance ships in waters near the Senkakus.\u201cThe level of defence spending reflects the amount necessary to protect Japan\u2019s air, sea and land, and guard the lives and property of our citizens,\u201d Nakatani said, adding that Chinese planes had flown \u201cabnormally close\u201d to Japanese aircraft.\u201cThe real question is whether increased defence spending is the most effective way to respond to the rise of China,\u201d which boosted military spending by 12 percent last year, said Koichi Nakano, a politics professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is an ageing, mature economy with already huge public debt. China\u2019s GDP is double that of Japan\u2019s, and its population is 10 times bigger, Nakano said.\u201cBeefing up military deterrence is going to be only part of the solution. Diplomatic efforts to lower tensions are at least as important, if not more so. Quite simply, Japan cannot afford to get into an arms race with China.\u201dWith an eye clearly on the risk of an invasion of one of its outlying islands, including the Senkaku chain, Japan has been developing its own version of the US marine corps, as well as acquiring more amphibious assault vehicles.But some analysts say Abe\u2019s defensive plans are not just in response to China\u2019s increasingly assertive behaviour in the East China sea.Tokyo is also concerned about North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, protecting sea lanes and shifting its priorities from the Cold War focus on its northernmost region to maritime threats further south, said Jun Okumura, a visiting scholar at the Meiji Institute for Global Affairs in Tokyo.\u201cThat said, China\u2019s increasingly assertive behaviour in the East China Sea and air space, plus, of course, its overtly hostile actions against the Philippines and Vietnam certainly have a major influence on the direction of Japan\u2019s military spending, the thrust of its military doctrine and its approach to security alliances,\u201d Okumura said.Tensions between Japan and China would continue as long as Beijing refuses to observe international law, said Tetsuo Kotani, a senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs. \u201cChina does not acknowledge freedom of navigation and overflight for foreign militaries, while at the same time it is threatening other countries\u2019 territorial waters and airspace,\u201d Kotani said. \u201cUnless China respects international law and rules, these crises will continue.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan reveals record defence budget as tensions with China grow"},{"date": "2015-02-23T22:59:02Z", "country": "japan", "content": "It is 140 years old, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies and a much-loved Japanese national institution.

The holding company, one of the world\u2019s largest financial bodies, and two of its four subsidiaries \u2013 tasked with banking and insurance \u2013 will be opened to investors.The holding company will continue to manage postal services and mail delivery, to which the Japanese are very attached due to the extensive network reaching even the most remote corners of the archipelago.The project will be submitted to the Tokyo stock exchange in June, with the goal of organising an initial public offering between August and December. \u201cThe law on privatisation of Japan Post requires us to bring in private equity as soon as possible,\u201d said CEO Taizo Nishimuro, adding that listing the three parts of the business at the same time \u201cwas the best way to ensure fair valuation\u201d. Eleven banks, including JP Morgan and Nomura Holdings, will manage the operation.Privatisation will involve several steps. The first phase should raise \u00a51tn to \u00a52tn ($8.4bn to $16.8bn) according to Japan\u2019s ministry of finance, which has given the go-ahead for the initial public offering. The proceeds will be used to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake, tidal wave and subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster that hit Japan in March 2011.The holding company \u2013 in which the state can legally retain a 30% share \u2013 will gradually divest itself of its interests in banking and insurance, until it owns only 50% of the whole. The two activities will thus gain a degree of independence, opening the way for diversification.The banking division manages deposits worth \u00a5178tn, consisting mainly of pensioners\u2019 savings. The funds are used to buy low-yield treasury bonds, which finance public debt and infrastructure spending in Japan.Under the changes, the banking division hopes to be permitted to make loans to big business and issue mortgages. Its distribution network will be enlarged and there are plans for partnerships with regional bodies. One of the objectives is to offer financial services in areas where there are few banks.The insurance division, which has so far concentrated on life insurance, is also keen to diversify.The question is whether investors, particularly from abroad, will find the offering attractive. Between April and September Japan Post generated \u00a5217bn in profits, but its postal services division is running at a loss. Furthermore its business is concentrated in Japan, where an ageing population may well be a limit on the scope for growth. The holding\u2019s various divisions will consequently need to look overseas. Related: Japan Post offers $6.5bn to take over Australia's Toll Holdings Privatisation of this venerable public concern was one of Junichiro Koizumi\u2019s priorities. As prime minister from 2001-2006 he worked hard to achieve this goal, even calling an early general election in 2005 as a form of referendum on the matter. A bill he proposed provided for a 10-year transition period, starting in 2007, at the end of which the banking and insurance divisions would be privatised.Koizumi was delivering on a promise made in 1993, as minister of post and telecommunications. He was keen to rid Japan of the lobby formed by postmen, numbering 260,000, a third of all public servants. His grandfather, Matajiro Koizumi, held the same position in 1929-31 and attempted in vain to privatise the post office.Koizumi Jr\u2019s plan was delayed when the Democratic party of Japan came to power in 2009. In 2012 new legislation authorised the banking and insurance divisions to diversify their activities. After the Liberal Democratic party\u2019s general election victory in December 2012 the government put privatisation back on the agenda.

Conservation groups have revealed that Norwegian exports of minke whale to Japan contained damaging levels of toxic pesticides, making that meat unfit for human consumption. It\u2019s a discovery that could cue a swifter decline in the appetite for whale. The news emerged this month, when the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) revealed documents showing that the Japanese government rejected imports of Norwegian whale meat because tests showed samples contained pesticides at twice the limit Japan imposes on its imports. The meat harboured chemicals such as aldrin, dieldrin, and chlordane, thought to play a role in causing birth defects, neurological harm, and some cancers if humans consume them in high quantities. Norway continues to run a large scale whaling industry\u2014the country took a record catch of 736 minke whales in 2014\u2014but surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t exist for Norwegians. \u201cFewer than five percent [of Norwegians] eat whale meat regularly,\u201d says Kate O\u2019Connell, a marine wildlife consultant from the AWI, explaining that they see it as old-fashioned fare. By comparison, Japan is a much bigger market. \u201cJapan has always been the main consumer of whale products,\u201d says Clare Perry, the head of the EIA\u2019s oceans campaign. But even there, it\u2019s losing its appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s not fashionable at all. There\u2019s an older generation in Japan that have a nostalgia about eating it, but it\u2019s not in any way a staple diet,\u201d she says. Nevertheless, a chunk of the Norwegian catch is still exported there annually: 137 tonnes of Norwegian minke have entered Japan in the last two years.Proof of pesticide poisoning may somewhat sour that appetite, something that even a global hunting ban hasn\u2019t been able to quash. There are three remaining countries that continue to hunt and eat whale commercially \u2014 Norway, Japan, and Iceland\u2014and each one ignores the worldwide ruling against this activity.In 1982 the International Whaling Commission completely outlawed commercial whale hunting. \u201cThat applies to all countries that are members of the IWC. Japan, Norway, and Iceland are all members of the IWC,\u201d Perry emphasizes. The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) also bans the trade in minke meat to protect the species, which isn\u2019t endangered but has experienced a dramatic population dive since whaling began. \u201cThere\u2019s concern over whether the hunt is sustainable,\u201d Perry notes. (Norway insists that it is, which explains why it still awards itself an annual catch quota of more than 1000 whales, one the IWC doesn\u2019t acknowledge.)When the international moratorium came into force in the 80s, Norway objected to it, which afforded the country a legal loophole that allows it to continue the hunt while maintaining its IWC membership. Norway, Iceland, and Japan also reject the CITES ban, a move that technically permits them to continue with the trade. \u201cFrom our perspective Norway should be abiding by those treaties,\u201d Perry says.Until that happens, it seems like pesticide contamination is the whales\u2019 best defence\u2014though it\u2019s also bound to harm the whales. The chemicals identified in the minkes\u2019 meat are agriculture products that would most likely have entered the ocean via agricultural run-off. Some of the pesticides, like dieldrin and chlordane, have been banned in the European Union and the United States because of their toxic effects. Because they\u2019re persistent pollutants, however, they\u2019ve lingered in the ocean. By entering the food chain and bioaccumulating within it, the chemicals eventually find their way into the bodies of larger mammals like whales. \u201cIf we think it\u2019s potentially dangerous for us to eat, you can imagine it\u2019s not particularly healthy for a whale,\u201d Perry says. As Norway\u2019s appetite for the meat dwindles, it continues to pursue markets elsewhere for its whales. But that may grow more challenging, especially since the recent meat scare isn\u2019t the first the country has caused. In fact, in the past, shipments of Norwegian whale meat have been found to be infested with bacteria and also to contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury.Within Norway, there are ongoing efforts to try and revive the meat\u2019s appeal, and there are even generous government subsidies in place to try and support the industry and keep this historical practice alive. \u201cIt is clear, however, that without an export market, the Norwegian whaling industry will continue to struggle,\u201d O\u2019Connell says. In that sense, perhaps for whales the pesticides are a morbid kind of defence against the minority that still has a taste for their meat.", "tags": ["Environment"], "title": "Japan refuses Norway's toxic whale meat"},{"date": "2015-01-20T15:50:35Z", "country": "japan", "content": "I\u2019ve always wanted to visit Japan, though I can\u2019t quite explain why.

There\u2019s one thing all the guidebooks agree on, though: don\u2019t go in August. Go in springtime, when the cherry blossom blooms. Or in autumn, when the copious greenery turns a blazing copper. But avoid hot and humid August. So, on 9 August last year, my friend Emma and I depart.Tokyo, when we get there, has caught the tail end of a super-typhoon. After a long flight, it\u2019s genuinely refreshing to walk through the sweeping curtains of rain. Itchy-eyed and numbed with jet lag, we nevertheless manage to shuffle around the excellent Tokyo National Museum, everything feeling slightly unreal and accompanied by a constant clip-clop refrain as though someone were following us around with a glockenspiel. It turns out to be a young couple in exquisite his & hers kimonos and those dazzlingly white, slightly sinister bifurcated socks, their chunky wooden sandals beating the distinctive tattoo as they traipse around.Struggling to stay awake, we find a nice little place to eat. There\u2019s much pointing and laughter as we negotiate our way around the menus, but the waiters are kind and helpful. Though we\u2019re screened from our fellow diners by laminated curtains, the smoke from their scandalous-seeming cigarettes drifts through on to our delicious raw quail. It\u2019s quite nostalgic. We drive back through a violent storm, Tokyo now bursting into blurry neon life: the cab driver in white gloves, the car with whispering automatic doors, like something from the future as envisioned in the 1970s.The next day, after a fantastic sleep, there\u2019s an apologetic waitress at breakfast: \u201cSorry for keeping you waiting.\u201d She bows and smiles and smiles and bows, though she hasn\u2019t kept us waiting at all. We go down on to the amazingly clean, efficient tube system, which is fairly quiet during this holiday period, with none of the fabled pushing and shoving. First stop: the famous Tsukiji fish market; a strange mix of working atmosphere and tourist attraction. Octopus suckers writhe in smashed ice. Men with hooks slice at giant frozen tuna, like medieval artisans carving pink alabaster pillars. Tuna flakes skitter to the floor, though whether they\u2019re thrown away or headed for Sainsbury\u2019s, it\u2019s impossible to know.Next, we visit the first of many (many) shrines. One was erected to the memory of the great reforming Emperor Meiji, with beautifully laid-out forest trails leading to purification areas and little booths where you can make a wish for the spirits to answer. It soon becomes clear that all the shrines have these, like concessions in a department store, flogging benedictions. Is it any different, though, I wonder, to the little shops in cathedrals selling CDs of plainsong? The rituals involve washing both hands and the mouth, then writing down a wish that is hung up on a wooden plaque. There is something a bit relentless about the commercialisation of this, and about the sheer number of shrines you traipse through.One fascinating aspect of the Meiji temple are the strange indentations that cover the great wooden pillars and doors. With more than 3 million visitors a year, it can get very busy. Pilgrims have taken simply to hurling coins towards the shrine from a great distance, pockmarking the woodwork. They do offer, though, oases of calm in the sometimes overwhelming bustle. Most have been lovingly rebuilt after total destruction during the war.We plunge back into a crazier, ultra-fashionable, teen-centred Tokyo \u2013 though, as always in a strange city, I fear that I\u2019m actually standing in the middle of the equivalent of London\u2019s Camden Town. Fashions are mysterious and charming. Many women wear a sun-shunning outfit of broad-brimmed hat, long gloves and pretty lacy parasol of dusty pink or grey. They look like Victorian ghosts in surgical masks, keeping to the hard shadows or cycling past on the thronged pavement.Next day we leave for Hiroshima and our first experience of the bullet train. It is filled with impossibly cute children and super-efficient staff who bow as they enter and leave each carriage: the levels of courtesy and friendliness are so staggeringly different from Britain, it\u2019s shaming.Hiroshima is a quietly devastating place. Now a bustling modern city, it\u2019s nevertheless entirely defined by the events of 6 August 1945, and signs everywhere show what used to stand or how far you are from the \u201chypocentre\u201d of the atomic explosion. The shattered dome above which the A-bomb detonated stands within the Peace Park, where the accompanying museum pulls no punches. Inside are displays of melted spectacles, watches all stopped at 8.15am, burned and bloodied children\u2019s clothing, dropped-out hair, fingernails. We emerge, humbled and moved, into a balmy red evening, scores of people sitting in quiet contemplation.Later, down a back street, we find a tiny place for dinner. It has linen curtains and fat lanterns outside, and an atmosphere of slightly seedy congeniality with more, nicely rowdy smokers within. I jab a finger at the all-Japanese menu in the hope of ordering beer. Two tumblers of pale liquid arrive. \u201cIt looks like whisky!\u201d I laugh. It is whisky. But, again, the staff are incredibly helpful, beaming, fun. We get by with a little Japanese and a little English, and enjoy huge grilled peppers with fish flakes on top and delicious sea bass with sticky rice.A short train and ferry ride from Hiroshima is Miyajima Island, a Unesco world heritage site, where deer roam freely, nudging at tourists, tripping in and out of streams. Sadly, they\u2019ve gone the way of all creatures closely exposed to humans, scavenging for food and, like ravenous goats, even eating paper maps. But if you get away from the heavily commercialised harbour, the island becomes more serene and attractive. There\u2019s an unexpectedly brilliant aquarium full of delights: otters, sharks, porpoises. Moon jellyfish that change colour from white to blue to pink to green. Up the hills, through verdant gardens, are more temples with sun dazzling off their tin roofs, sonorous tolling bells and dozens of smiling buddhas wearing little knitted\u2248hats and bibs, most old and weathered, like grave goods. It transpires that there\u2019s to be a fireworks display later and suddenly the whole island is thronged with visitors, most of them courting young couples, again in gorgeous kimonos. Apparently it\u2019s become very fashionable for the young to wear these traditional clothes again, especially on dates. It\u2019s touching to see boys and girls both looking splendid and in love. We dine, cross-legged, on oysters and eel, then watch the fireworks bloom over the island.Another super-efficient bullet train takes us to Fukuoka \u2013 the \u201cgateway to southern Japan\u201d. As we race through the countryside, the landscape can suddenly transform. Breathtaking mists creep over the mountains. A shaft of sun on a powder-blue tiled roof, or the broad white wings of cranes in wet fields, suddenly illuminate quite how different this place is. We\u2019re on a whistlestop tour, including a video of an extraordinary local carnival \u2013 which we\u2019ve just missed \u2013 in which hundreds of trouserless men in white shirts carry massive floats on six poles. It\u2019s like the running of the bulls, but with buttocks. It turns out the shirts are a fairly recent addition, because people thought the near-nakedness was offensive. Why they didn\u2019t think to put trousers on is beyond me.In the evening, with much fanfare, we\u2019re taken to a two-star Michelin restaurant to eat the infamous fugu fish. It\u2019s an intoxicating prospect (with the emphasis on the toxic), because the flesh of the puffer fish is more deadly than cyanide. Only a small part is edible. The restaurant is wonderfully minimal, plain, cedar-scented, paper-walled, just as you\u2019d hope it to be. We\u2019re given a short tour of the kitchens and see the fugu, which arrives pre-prepared in a box, like shoes. We\u2019re closely observed as we eat, like royal food-tasters under the eye of a wary monarch. The fugu itself is curiously bland. It comes in razor-thin slivers and has a rainbow hue, like petrol in the road. But the accompanying flavours into which we dip the fish (tiny leeks, spring onions, risotto) are delicious, and one course, unexpectedly, comes in batter. Just like Harry Ramsden\u2019s, but with the frisson of potential death.Still alive, next day we take the train to Nagasaki: a very different prospect to Hiroshima. As (almost) the only port open to the west during Japan\u2019s 200-year period of isolation, it has a ramshackle mix of influences. There are lovely clapboard colonial houses from the Dutch and Portuguese settlements, and a proper neon maze of a Chinatown. Walking into town by the canal-side, you catch dark, scuttling shapes out of the corner of the eye. Astonishingly, they\u2019re crabs, hiding in the grates and drains. Loud firecrackers start to go off \u2013 it\u2019s Obon, the Japanese festival of the dead. As the humid air breaks into driving rain, there\u2019s a strange, warm calm. An off-key bell tolls as families carry huge, lantern-covered \u201cships of the dead\u201d down the winding streets in memory of lost loved ones, including, delightfully, a photo of Elvis. Firecrackers burst and spark in the rain, and gunpowder drifts across us in clouds. As we get back to the hotel, teams of men with witch brooms and surgical masks sweep up the soggy remains of the fireworks. Next morning, there\u2019s not a trace. Curiously, while Japanese cities are quite grubby-looking and industrialised, litter is virtually nonexistent. It simply doesn\u2019t occur to people to drop rubbish.Next stop: Kagoshima. It\u2019s a hot and cloudy day, and the volcano is smothered in cloud when we arrive. The resort in Ibusuki is beautifully designed, with luxurious, cool rooms in traditional Japanese style, as unlike a western spa as you can imagine. Men and women (segregated into different areas) walk about happily naked. There are plunge pools and steam baths and the famous sand baths, warmed by natural springs. We change into kimonos and Emma and I are buried up to our necks in the soft, grey, alien-looking sand by stringy young men with rakes. It\u2019s a strangely pleasant sensation, not too hot. We last about 15 minutes, the sweat beading our faces like raindrops. Only Boris Yeltsin, apparently, has managed to last more than half an hour entombed like this. We\u2019re soon hysterical as our host, the extraordinarily kind Mr Shimotakehara, asks us which parasol we want planting into the sand over our heads, like bathing belles on an Edwardian postcard.A long train journey gets us into Kyoto, back in the central region of Honshu island, which is immediately very different from anywhere else we\u2019ve been. Charming, winding streets and lots of older buildings not flattened in the war. There are shrines, of course, but also genuinely lovely shops and cafes. We have a gorgeous (and very cheap) sushi lunch with green tea ice-cream, and then there\u2019s much excitement as a couple of genuine geishas \u2013 apparently a rare sight \u2013 stroll by. It really is something to see them: the death mask faces, the fantastically elaborate hair, the tiny strip of exposed skin at the nape of the neck.Dusk shows Kyoto at its best. There\u2019s a low-key quality to the atmosphere, subtle and quiet, especially in the charming Pontocho Alley with its half-turned-down lamps, where we eat the justly famous black beef.Next day, we visit the Shogun\u2019s palace with its extraordinary sprung \u201cnightingale\u201d floors designed to squeak in order to warn of assassins and then, farther afield, to the Fushimi shrine with its endless orange tunnel. It\u2019s undeniably spectacular, but we\u2019re shrined-out by now. Then it\u2019s on to the towering bamboo forest, with a swollen, muddy yellow river close by, and fit men doing rickshaw rides with the same swagger as lads on waltzers, cocky and rough.We\u2019re sad to leave Kyoto \u2013 the undoubted hit of the trip \u2013 but one last night in Tokyo affords an astonishing view of the city. Railways stretching under motorways, cars blurring into a sea of light as we head for the Golden Gai \u2013 an extraordinary district of tiny, themed bars, each holding about 10 people. The strains of the Specials\u2019 Ghost Town lead us to a sort of 1979 punk bar with a new wave soundtrack. There\u2019s a fantastic incongruity to listening to Sparks and Blondie in the smoky atmosphere. We drink too much sake, happy.Above all, it\u2019s the people who make Japan. I\u2019ve never been met with such extraordinary kindness, courtesy and friendliness. There\u2019s far more English spoken than people lead you to think, and signage is bilingual \u2013 especially on the trains. I plan to return \u2013 in the spring, of course, or the autumn \u2013 as soon as I can. If this sounds evangelical, it is. Even in sultry August, Japan is a wonder. Go.Flights were provided by Finnair, which flies to Japan via Helsinki from \u00a3590 return, including taxes. Rail passes were provided by Japanese National Tourist Board; they cost \u00a3159 for a seven-day pass. Accommodation was provided by Hyatt Regency Kyoto (doubles from \u00a3122, room-only); Mandarin Oriental, Tokyo (doubles from \u00a3276 per night B&B); and Ibsuki Hakusuikan, a Japanese inn with an onsen hot spring spa (doubles from \u00a3188, half-board). Set fugu-tasting menus are available at two-Michelin-starred Hakata Izumi (the website is in Japanese only): lunch from \u00a320, dinner from \u00a356 \u2013 book through your Fukuoka hotel\u2019s concierge.

Her son said: \u201cReconstruction hasn\u2019t really progressed very much (in the four years) but everyone\u2019s doing the best they can so we have to too.\u201dBut work to house tens of thousands of displaced residents has made slow progress amid administrative holdups, rising construction costs and the challenge of rebuilding on high ground away from the vulnerable coastline.Just 15% of the 29,000 permanent homes planned for survivors and nuclear evacuees have been completed in the three worst affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima.The long wait has taken its toll on the health of displaced survivors.In the four years since the disaster, more than 3,200 people, many of them elderly, have died of illnesses exacerbated by their living conditions, suicide and other causes, according to government records.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is expected to respond to criticism of the slow rate of recovery by announcing a new five-year plan this summer to boost the reconstruction of ruined costal communities and decontaminate residential areas affected by the Fukushima meltdown.\u201cReconstruction is shifting to a new stage,\u201d Abe said, adding that he hoped rebuilding work would be completed by the time Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics in 2020. \u201cWe will help disaster victims become self-sustaining. As the government, we will provide the best possible support.\u201dAlthough some families have been allowed to return to their homes on the outskirts of the 20km (12 mile) evacuation zone, almost 120,000 people are still living in nuclear limbo.Japan has spent more than $15bn on lowering atmospheric radiation levels in residential areas near the stricken power plant, creating mountains of radioactive waste that is stored in 88,000 temporary sites in the area.\u201cA large number of workers have been brought in to decontaminate the village, so that residents can return, but when I look at what they are doing, the situation seems hopeless,\u201d said Nobuyoshi Ito, an environment specialist who carries out independent radiation tests on crops in the evacuated village of Iitate.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much it will cost, and even if the work is completed, it won\u2019t be clean enough for villagers to return and resume their lives.\u201dYoung families with children, fearing the possible effects of long-term exposure to radiation to their health, are scattered across Fukushima prefecture and elsewhere in Japan, leaving mainly elderly evacuees behind in cramped temporary housing units.Michihito Endo, a retired teacher from Tomioka, a deserted town near the plant, does not believe he will ever go home. \u201cWe used to be able to walk in the mountains and drink the water, to enjoy ourselves without a care in the world,\u201d Endo said.\u201cThat\u2019s no longer possible. It\u2019s very hard to take. I get very angry when I think about how Tepco and the government promoted the construction of so many nuclear power plants.\u201dAt Fukushima Daiichi \u2013 scene of the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl \u2013 optimism following the removal of more than 1,300 spent fuel assemblies from one damaged reactor building has been tempered by recent reports of yet more leaks of highly contaminated water. That is in addition to the 200,000 tonnes of toxic water already being stored in hundreds of tanks blanketing the site.Workers have yet to begin the removal of melted fuel from the three reactors that suffered meltdown, a process that will take four decades and cost tens of billions of yen.Abe also faces criticism of his push to restart idled nuclear reactors while so little progress has been made in the area affected by the Fukushima crisis.All of Japan\u2019s 48 working reactors were shut down to undergo stringent new safety checks in the wake of the disaster.The country\u2019s nuclear watchdog has approved the restart of two reactors in south-west Japan, but local opposition could frustrate Abe\u2019s plans to have them generating power again in the next few months.The pro-nuclear lobby insists that at least some reactors must go back online if Japan is to tackle the mounting cost of importing fossil fuels and make progress towards meeting its climate change commitments.", "tags": ["Japan disaster", "Japan", "Shinzo Abe", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment"], "title": "Japan remembers the 18,000 victims of 2011's triple disaster"},{"date": "2015-02-22T13:34:50Z", "country": "japan", "content": "The regulation eight hours in the office is over. The most important work of the day is done; whatever is left can wait until the morning. This is the point many workers would think about heading for the door.Yet for millions of Japanese employees, the thought of clearing away their desks and being at home in time for dinner is enough to invite accusations of disloyalty.But after decades of giving companies carte blanche to milk every last drop of productivity from their workforce, a challenge to Japan\u2019s ingrained culture of overwork has come from the government, which is considering making it a legal requirement for workers to take at least five days\u2019 paid holiday a year.Japanese employees are currently entitled to an average 18.5 days\u2019 paid holiday a year \u2013 only two fewer than the global average \u2013 with a minimum of 10 days as well as 15 one-day national holidays. In reality, few come even close to taking their full quota, typically using only nine of their 18.5 days average entitlement, according to the labour ministry. While many British workers regard a two-week summer holiday as an inalienable right, workers here have come to see a four-night vacation in Hawaii as the height of self-indulgence.The move, to be debated in the current parliamentary session, comes after companies started encouraging employees to nap on the job to improve their performance.By the end of the decade, the government hopes that, if passed, the law will push Japanese employees towards following the example set by British workers, who use an average of 20 days\u2019 paid annual leave, and those in France, who take an average of 25.It is a worker\u2019s right to take paid vacations. But working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.Japan\u2019s unforgiving work culture may have helped turn it into an economic superpower, its corporate foot soldiers revered in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company, but this has often been to the exclusion of everything else.Japan\u2019s low birthrate and predictions of rapid population decline are partly blamed on the lack of time couples have to start families. More employees are falling ill from stress, or worse, succumbing to karoshi, death through overwork.Despite studies suggesting that longer hours in the office, workshop or factory floor do not necessarily make people more productive, today\u2019s workers are still nursing a collective hangover from the bubble years of the 1980s.About 22% of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of US workers and 11% in France and Germany, according to data compiled by the Japanese government. At 35%, South Korea\u2019s workaholics are even worse off.In spending 14 hours a day at work and giving up many of her paid holidays, Erika Sekiguchi is not even an extreme example. The 36-year-old trading company employee used eight of her 20 days of paid vacation last year, six of which counted as sick leave. \u201cNobody else uses their vacation days,\u201d Sekiguchi said.She faces the dilemma shared by her peers in companies across Japan: to take time off to recharge, or risk inviting criticism for appearing to leave more committed colleagues in the lurch.Yuu Wakebe, a health ministry official overseeing policy on working hours, who admits putting in 100 hours of overtime a month, blames the irresistible pressure to match one\u2019s colleagues, hour for hour. \u201cIt is a worker\u2019s right to take paid vacations,\u201d Wakebe said. \u201cBut working in Japan involves quite a lot of a volunteer spirit.\u201dThat fear of being ostracised at work is being blamed for a rise in stress-related illness, premature death and suicide. According to official data, about 200 people die every year from heart attacks, strokes and other karoshi events brought on by punishing work schedules.Late last year, a court in Tokyo ordered a restaurant chain to pay compensation of \u00a558m (\u00a3320,000) to the family of a former manager of one of its outlets who hanged himself in 2010 after being made to work punishingly long hours. Court documents show the man had worked almost 200 hours of overtime a month in the seven months before his death, a form of \u201cpower harassment\u201d that the judge blamed for leaving the victim mentally ill.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is not known for taking long vacations. Yet even he has spoken out against the unreasonable demands companies place on their employees as they struggle to stay afloat in a more complex globalised market.

Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale analysts Takuji Aida and Kiyoko Katahira said Abe\u2019s decision to push back a second sales tax hike by two years to 2017, would give the economy a strong boost.\u201cGiven that PM Abe has decided to postpone the second tax hike to April 2017 from October 2015, the downside pressure in 2015 has largely been removed,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cThe GDP growth rate for 2015 should be supported by robust consumption and trade, and we forecast growth of around 1.5% year on year. \u201cAbe has announced he will not delay the second tax hike again. In other words, he has made a strong commitment to reflate the economy,.\u201dBut some analysts warned that weak rebound in consumption and capital expenditure remained a worrying sign.\u201cThese are somewhat disappointing figures,\u201d said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. \u201cThe situation remains weak and companies are clearly postponing investments.\u201dHowever, the rebound from recession will allow the Bank of Japan to hold off on expanding monetary stimulus. The central bank has proved to be one of the most aggressive in printing money to make borrowing cheaper and to drive down the value of the yen.Like most central banks, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has seen inflation fall below its 2% target following the collapse in oil prices that has dramatically cut fuel costs and a slowdown in China that has reduced the price of other commodities.Abe said he hoped the central bank continued with its bold monetary easing campaign to boost lending and inflation back to its target. Speaking in parliament, Abe praised the BoJ\u2019s aggressive stimulus programme for helping revive the economy and wipe out the public\u2019s \u201csticky deflationary mindset\u201d. He acknowledged that some weakness in household spending, but added that he saw signs of recovery in the economy, such as improvements in consumer sentiment. \u201cWe\u2019ll strive to ensure that wages keep rising this year and next, so that the warm breeze of recovery blows throughout the nation,\u201d Abe said.", "tags": ["Economics", "Japan", "Global recession", "Asia Pacific", "Global economy", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Financial crisis"], "title": "Japan emerges from recession but rebound is weaker than expected"},{"date": "2015-02-16T13:53:42Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is out of recession. After two quarters in which the economy contracted, growth resumed in the final three months of 2014.However, that was the end of the good news for the prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Growth remains sluggish. There was no expansion at all in 2014. The much-vaunted \u201cthree-arrow strategy\u201d is proving a bit of a flop.Three things are particularly worrying about the latest news from the world\u2019s third biggest economy. The first is that consumers are reluctant to spend despite the government\u2019s decision to postpone an increase in VAT planned for this spring. It was the dampening effect of last year\u2019s consumption tax rise that drove Japan into technical recession in the second and third quarters of 2014.The second concern is that companies are not investing. Although profits are high and companies are awash with money, they are sitting on their cash piles rather than spending them on new kit. Abe\u2019s \u201cthree arrows\u201d were supposed to mark a break with Japan\u2019s two-decade period of weak growth and deflation. The corporate sector clearly remains unconvinced.Finally, there is the performance of exports. The first of Abe\u2019s arrows involved an aggressive quantitative-easing (QE) programme, with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) creating money through the purchase of government bonds. This drove down the value of the yen, making Japanese exports cheaper.But the pick-up in overseas sales has been modest when set against the scale of the monetary easing, in part because global demand has been less buoyant than expected and in part because Japan is not the only country trying to push its currency lower.Indeed, since the European Central Bank dropped a hint late last year that it was starting it own QE programme, the yen has been rising against the euro.So what happens now? As a big oil-importing nation, Japan is one of the countries that should benefit most from the falling cost of crude. This though, is unlikely to be enough to give the economy the boost Abe is looking for.Consumers and businesses know that this spring\u2019s tax increase has been delayed, not abandoned. They are tightening belts in anticipation of the moment when the government takes action to repair the public finances. The second arrow \u2013 fiscal policy \u2013 has therefore not really hit the target.The third arrow \u2013 structural reform \u2013 has remained in the quiver despite the thumping mandate given to Abe in last year\u2019s general election. That only leaves monetary policy, which is why there is speculation that the BoJ will announce further easing.But this has its risks. In Japan as elsewhere, QE tends to have a bigger impact on asset prices than the real economy. The massive purchases by the BoJ are starting to gum up the bond market. And using QE to drive down the yen runs the risk of retaliation. A currency war in 2015 looks like a real possibility.", "tags": ["Japan", "Economics", "Financial crisis", "Asia Pacific", "Global recession", "Banking", "Financial sector", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Quantitative easing", "European Central Bank", "Global economy"], "title": "Japan beats recession but the good news ends there"},{"date": "2015-01-14T06:03:56Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has announced its biggest ever defence budget in response to China\u2019s increasing military influence in the region and Beijing\u2019s claims to a group of disputed islands administered by Tokyo.The 4.98 trillion yen (US$ 42bn) budget approved by the cabinet on Wednesday is up 2% from last year and marks the third straight increase after more than a decade of cuts.The rise is in line with Japan\u2019s more assertive defence policy under the conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as he seeks to counter Chinese influence and remove the postwar legal shackles from his country\u2019s military.This year Abe is expected to push for legislation to reinterpret Japan\u2019s constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight alongside allies on foreign soil for the first time since the end of the second world war. The move has been welcomed in Washington, which wants Japan to play a bigger role in the bilateral security alliance.At US$112.2bn, China\u2019s defence budget dwarfs that of Japan. China is second only to the US, which spent US$600.4bn on defence in 2013, while Japan ranked seventh, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London.Much of the military hardware included in Japan\u2019s new budget is designed to monitor outlying territories and repel any attempt to invade island chains in the East China Sea.It includes money for 20 P-1 maritime surveillance aircraft, six F-35 fighters, five Osprey planes that double as helicopters, Global Hawk drones, two Aegis radar-equipped destroyers and a missile defence system to be jointly developed with the US.The defence ministry also plans to buy 30 amphibious assault vehicles and an early-warning aircraft that will patrol islands in southern Japan.The defence minister, Gen Nakatani, said extra defence spending was a response to the \u201cchanging situation\u201d in the region \u2013 a clear reference to repeated incursions by Chinese surveillance ships in waters near the Senkakus.\u201cThe level of defence spending reflects the amount necessary to protect Japan\u2019s air, sea and land, and guard the lives and property of our citizens,\u201d Nakatani said, adding that Chinese planes had flown \u201cabnormally close\u201d to Japanese aircraft.\u201cThe real question is whether increased defence spending is the most effective way to respond to the rise of China,\u201d which boosted military spending by 12 percent last year, said Koichi Nakano, a politics professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is an ageing, mature economy with already huge public debt. China\u2019s GDP is double that of Japan\u2019s, and its population is 10 times bigger, Nakano said.\u201cBeefing up military deterrence is going to be only part of the solution. Diplomatic efforts to lower tensions are at least as important, if not more so. Quite simply, Japan cannot afford to get into an arms race with China.\u201dWith an eye clearly on the risk of an invasion of one of its outlying islands, including the Senkaku chain, Japan has been developing its own version of the US marine corps, as well as acquiring more amphibious assault vehicles.But some analysts say Abe\u2019s defensive plans are not just in response to China\u2019s increasingly assertive behaviour in the East China sea.Tokyo is also concerned about North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, protecting sea lanes and shifting its priorities from the Cold War focus on its northernmost region to maritime threats further south, said Jun Okumura, a visiting scholar at the Meiji Institute for Global Affairs in Tokyo.\u201cThat said, China\u2019s increasingly assertive behaviour in the East China Sea and air space, plus, of course, its overtly hostile actions against the Philippines and Vietnam certainly have a major influence on the direction of Japan\u2019s military spending, the thrust of its military doctrine and its approach to security alliances,\u201d Okumura said.Tensions between Japan and China would continue as long as Beijing refuses to observe international law, said Tetsuo Kotani, a senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs. \u201cChina does not acknowledge freedom of navigation and overflight for foreign militaries, while at the same time it is threatening other countries\u2019 territorial waters and airspace,\u201d Kotani said. \u201cUnless China respects international law and rules, these crises will continue.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "title": "Japan reveals record defence budget as tensions with China grow"},{"date": "2015-01-15T08:10:37Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan has taken its campaign to rewrite its wartime history into the classroom with demands that a US publisher remove \u201cinaccurate\u201d descriptions of tens of thousands of women who were forced to work as sex slaves before and during the war.The move by the country\u2019s foreign ministry comes after a Japanese publisher said it would delete text and depictions of the women, most of whom were from the Korean peninsula, from textbooks used in high schools.Suken Shuppan, a Tokyo-based publisher said it had successfully applied to the education ministry to remove references to \u201ccomfort women\u201d \u2013 a euphemism for sex slaves commonly used in Japan \u2013 from three social studies and politics textbooks.The publisher has refused to explain why it had sought for permission for the change.The education ministry approved the revision, which applies to texts that will be used at the start of the new academic year next spring.In 2014 Japan\u2019s conservative administration, led by Shinzo Abe, tightened curriculum guidelines that require publishers to state the government\u2019s official view on contentious issues.\u201cThe idea is to strengthen state control over textbooks,\u201d said Mina Watanabe, at the Women\u2019s Active Museum on War and Peace in Tokyo. \u201cWhat Suken Shuppan did was an over-reaction. It should explain why it erased the terms and the government should explain why it accepted the change.\u201dUnder Abe, a nationalist, Japan has attempted to play down controversial episodes in its modern history, including the Rape of Nanking, the treatment of Allied prisoners of war, and the coercion of as many as 20,000 women, most of whom were from the Korean peninsula, to work at military brothels.While Abe has stopped short of reversing an official apology to the women issued in 1993 by the then chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, he supports the revisionist view that the women were not coerced, sparking anger in South Korea.The Kono statement acknowledges that many comfort women were recruited against their will, and that the military was often involved, either indirectly or directly, in the setting up of \u201ccomfort stations\u201d.Experts who helped write a 2007 US House of Representatives resolution calling on Japan to acknowledge and apologise for the role imperial forces played in coercing the women say Abe is quietly undermining the official apology as Japan prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war with a new \u201cforward-looking\u201d statement from Abe.\u201c[He] is trying to have it both ways,\u201d said Larry Niksch, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cHe says things that encourage the history revisionists, but he also makes statements that put some distance between himself and the revisionists.\u201cMy sense is that he will not change the Kono statement this year. He has said too many times that he won\u2019t change it. However, he might not oppose a move in the Japanese diet to pass a resolution refuting the Kono statement.\u201dDisagreement between Tokyo and Seoul over the comfort women issue has prevented Abe from holding a summit with his South Korean counterpart, Park Geun-hye, even though both leaders have been in power for two years.The South Korean foreign ministry said Suken Shuppan\u2019s move risked further damaging ties. \u201cHistorical facts cannot be modified or deleted,\u201d a ministry official was quoted by the Asahi Shimbun as saying. \u201cIf the Japanese government repeats such nonsense, it will become a serious obstacle to the improvement of ties between South Korea and Japan.\u201dThe authors of the Japanese textbooks will tweak passages to render them more ambiguous. The new material will mention that South Koreans are seeking compensation through the Japanese courts, but won\u2019t explain why, Kyodo News said.This is the first time that pressure has been applied to publishers in the US, where some Korean-American communities have erected memorials to the comfort women, sparking protests from Tokyo.Japan\u2019s foreign ministry requested that McGraw-Hill delete a passage containing a reference to comfort women from a text on world history used by high schools in California. The passage says that Japan\u2019s imperial army \u201cforcibly recruited, conscripted and dragooned as many as 200,000 women aged 14 to 20\u201d to serve in military brothels.But at a meeting with officials from the Japanese consulate in New York, McGraw-Hill refused to change the passage, saying it was \u201cbased on historical facts,\u201d according to the Sankei Shimbun.Watanabe welcomed McGraw-Hill\u2019s refusal to bow to pressure, but said Japanese children risked growing up ignorant of their country\u2019s past.Censoring textbooks would be devastating for pupils, she said. \u201cChildren in neighbouring countries know the truth about the Japanese military\u2019s conduct in Asia \u2026 only Japanese children would be kept in the dark, but they have the right to learn the facts of history.\u201dThe revisionists received a boost last summer when the Asahi Shimbun, Japan\u2019s only liberal broadsheet, admitted it had run a series of erroneous articles in the 1980s and 90s about comfort women.The articles repeated claims by Seiji Yoshida, a former Japanese soldier who said he had helped round up women on the South Korean island of Jeju during the war. Yoshida\u2019s testimony has since been discredited.Abe and his supporters have since claimed that the Asahi articles were reflected in global media coverage of the comfort women issue and had damaged Japan\u2019s image overseas. An independent investigation, however, found there was \u201cno clear evidence\u201d to support Abe\u2019s claim.", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Second world war"], "title": "Japan urges US publisher to remove comfort women from textbooks"},{"date": "2015-06-19T08:21:20Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Eighteen months ago, Whiplash premiered at the Sundance film festival, where it won the jury and audience awards \u2013 victories that helped propel it to chunky box-office and awards glory.

The data, compiled by WWF, Oil Change International (OCI) and the Natural Resource Defence Council, reveals more than $73bn of international public finance was given to coal between 2007 and 2014. The group said the money \u201cmoved through largely unknown and opaque institutions\u201d.ECAs based in OECD member states were the biggest drivers of coal investment, accounting for nearly half of the total.The data comes a week before the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD\u2019s) export credit group is due to meet in Paris to discuss banning export finance for coal. The US and France have already stopped their ECAs giving money to coal power plants, and are pushing for a global ban on export credit for coal. Sebastien Godinot, an economist with WWF-Europe, said there was a high risk of the talks foundering on the recalcitrance of Australia, Japan and Korea.\u201cThe OECD countries have to recognise that this policy of supporting coal exports with public money is just completely inconsistent with their climate commitments. You have three countries which are trying to block progress which are Japan, Korea and Australia. This is the dark side.

Over their lifetime, supported plants would spew 18bn tonnes into the atmosphere.Stephen Kretzmann, executive director of OCI, said that by blocking progress and continuing to fund their own coal companies \u201cgovernments are prioritising the corporate profits of the coal industry over the climate and the interests of the poor\u201d.The coal industry has argued that its product is necessary to bring affordable electricity to the developing world. But the data revealed that Australia, one of the world\u2019s 10 richest countries , received over $4bn in funding for new coal projects \u2013 mostly for mines and mostly from Japan. This makes it one of the biggest beneficiaries of coal export finance in the world and one of eight high income countries in the top 20. Australia has also adopted the strongest opposition to the OECD export credit ban.Japanese miner Mitsubishi received over $1.4bn worth of credit from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, one of Japan\u2019s two ECAs, to bolster its stake in the Caval Ridge Coal Mine in the Australian state of Queensland. At the opening, Australian prime minister Tony Abbott declared: \u201cCoal is good for humanity.\u201dThe total funding for coal from ECAs was $12bn more than the funding from all global development banks. Japan\u2019s finance alone was three times the funding given by the World Bank, whose president has called for an end to subsidies for coal.No countries defined as \u2018low-income\u2019 received finance from ECAs based in OECD countries. Much of the money did end up in emerging economies, such as Vietnam, South Africa and India. But Kretzmann said the money was not targeted at development and that renewable energy was generally the cheapest way to provide electricity to those who lack it.\u201cAn ECA is an agency that is specifically designed to support a country\u2019s own domestic corporate agenda abroad, to open up new markets for companies based in those countries. In the case of Japan, which is by far the largest lender, you have Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi who are the really big winners,\u201d he said.Last week Reuters reported that Germany had weakened Europe\u2019s stance on banning coal export finance. The Guardian understands that Germany is supportive of controls on coal finance but not the total ban desired by France and the US. Godinot said this was of particular concern because of Germany\u2019s position in the EU and the EU\u2019s large influence on the OECD \u2013 two-thirds of OECD countries are in the EU.Shelagh Whitley, a climate finance expert at the Overseas Development Institute, said Germany\u2019s continued support for coal overseas \u2013 it is the fourth largest export financier of coal \u2013 was at odds with its domestic phase out of coal subsidies and clean energy growth. \u201cThis dirty money helps German coal companies, now unable to do business at home, export their dead-end technologies to developing countries. This leaves a black mark on the country\u2019s otherwise clean climate record,\u201d she said.

At the opening, Australian prime minister Tony Abbott declared: \u201cCoal is good for humanity.\u201dThe total funding for coal from ECAs was $12bn more than the funding from all global development banks. Japan\u2019s finance alone was three times the funding given by the World Bank, whose president has called for an end to subsidies for coal.No countries defined as \u2018low-income\u2019 received finance from ECAs based in OECD countries. Much of the money did end up in emerging economies, such as Vietnam, South Africa and India. But Kretzmann said the money was not targeted at development and that renewable energy was generally the cheapest way to provide electricity to those who lack it.\u201cAn ECA is an agency that is specifically designed to support a country\u2019s own domestic corporate agenda abroad, to open up new markets for companies based in those countries. In the case of Japan, which is by far the largest lender, you have Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi who are the really big winners,\u201d he said.Last week Reuters reported that Germany had weakened Europe\u2019s stance on banning coal export finance. The Guardian understands that Germany is supportive of controls on coal finance but not the total ban desired by France and the US. Godinot said this was of particular concern because of Germany\u2019s position in the EU and the EU\u2019s large influence on the OECD \u2013 two-thirds of OECD countries are in the EU.Shelagh Whitley, a climate finance expert at the Overseas Development Institute, said Germany\u2019s continued support for coal overseas \u2013 it is the fourth largest export financier of coal \u2013 was at odds with its domestic phase out of coal subsidies and clean energy growth. \u201cThis dirty money helps German coal companies, now unable to do business at home, export their dead-end technologies to developing countries. This leaves a black mark on the country\u2019s otherwise clean climate record,\u201d she said.

It took off early on Sunday for a six-day, six-night, flight over the Pacific Ocean.Pilot Andr\u00e9 Borschberg, 62, left Nanjing, in eastern China, at about 2.40am following extended delays due to weather-related safety concerns. The 5,270-mile (8,500km) flight would have been a record for duration by a single pilot.Borschberg was asked to circle over the Sea of Japan while meteorologists assessed the situation. They have now decided not to proceed, and the plane arrived at the Komaki airfield just before 3pm GMT on Monday.Speaking to mission control in Monaco from the cockpit of the plane, the pilot said situations like this are to be expected. \u201cOverall from the start I personally had a really wonderful time. But there is always unexpected situations, either from a technical point of view or from a weather point of view, to cope with. It\u2019s taken 18 years to sort technical questions, whether it\u2019s specialists trying to find the right route... so that was really a very interesting start.\u201cNow we face some changes so we will have to see if these changes are really important. In terms of strategy I think we\u2019ll know more in a few hours, and to keep all the options open. I\u2019m waiting here in the sea of Japan, and the Japanese MCC and authorities have been extremely helpful, extremely open and nice, they accommodate our wishes to have this aircraft integrated into their traffic.\u201cPart of the programme was to do some holding anyway. We\u2019re doing the holding a little bit earlier than expected, but for the time being it doesn\u2019t change anything. We need to see what the new forecast tells us.\u201dBertrand Piccard, who has been watching the flight from mission control, added: \u201cWe are not daredevils, we are explorers. We have to put safety at the top of all of our priorities. Everyone is very happy with the plane - but the weather does not fit. We land in Nagoya and we wait for better conditions to continue.\u201dSolar Impulse 2 is powered by more than 17,000 solar cells built into wings that, at 72 metres, are almost as long as those of an Airbus A380 superjumbo.Borschberg completed Solar Impulse 2\u2019s first overnight leg, with the aircraft relying solely on batteries charged by the sun\u2019s energy, but poor weather ahead threw the rest of the marathon flight into doubt.A statement was posted on the Solar Impulse website, which helps track the flight\u2019s journey, earlier today. It said: \u201cYesterday we had the possibility to cross the weather front just before Hawaii on day 5. However, with the forecasts we now have, we don\u2019t see this possibility anymore, which means that for the moment the road to Hawaii is blocked. We need all the data from the next weather forecasts, so that our weather experts can analyse what\u2019s going to happen in the next four to five days.\u201cWhilst we wait for the forecasts, we have decided to hold the position of the aircraft.

The data, compiled by WWF, Oil Change International (OCI) and the Natural Resource Defence Council, reveals more than $73bn of international public finance was given to coal between 2007 and 2014. The group said the money \u201cmoved through largely unknown and opaque institutions\u201d.ECAs based in OECD member states were the biggest drivers of coal investment, accounting for nearly half of the total.The data comes a week before the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD\u2019s) export credit group is due to meet in Paris to discuss banning export finance for coal. The US and France have already stopped their ECAs giving money to coal power plants, and are pushing for a global ban on export credit for coal. Sebastien Godinot, an economist with WWF-Europe, said there was a high risk of the talks foundering on the recalcitrance of Australia, Japan and Korea.\u201cThe OECD countries have to recognise that this policy of supporting coal exports with public money is just completely inconsistent with their climate commitments. You have three countries which are trying to block progress which are Japan, Korea and Australia. This is the dark side. Their intention is clearly to buy time or to block any substantial progress,\u201d he said.Under current OECD rules, ECA finance gives preferable, long-term conditions to all fossil fuel projects, including coal. Godinot said the loans, guarantees, policy lending and technical assistance often act as seed funding, which draws more investment to projects meaning the $73bn is actually responsible for generating much larger investments in the dirtiest fossil fuel.The NGOs calculated that the coal power plants supported by international finance would emit 0.5bn tonnes of carbon each year, equal to the annual emissions of Italy. Over their lifetime, supported plants would spew 18bn tonnes into the atmosphere.Stephen Kretzmann, executive director of OCI, said that by blocking progress and continuing to fund their own coal companies \u201cgovernments are prioritising the corporate profits of the coal industry over the climate and the interests of the poor\u201d.The coal industry has argued that its product is necessary to bring affordable electricity to the developing world. But the data revealed that Australia, one of the world\u2019s 10 richest countries , received over $4bn in funding for new coal projects \u2013 mostly for mines and mostly from Japan. This makes it one of the biggest beneficiaries of coal export finance in the world and one of eight high income countries in the top 20. Australia has also adopted the strongest opposition to the OECD export credit ban.Japanese miner Mitsubishi received over $1.4bn worth of credit from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, one of Japan\u2019s two ECAs, to bolster its stake in the Caval Ridge Coal Mine in the Australian state of Queensland.

It took off early on Sunday for a six-day, six-night, flight over the Pacific Ocean.Pilot Andr\u00e9 Borschberg, 62, left Nanjing, in eastern China, at about 2.40am following extended delays due to weather-related safety concerns. The 5,270-mile (8,500km) flight would have been a record for duration by a single pilot.Borschberg was asked to circle over the Sea of Japan while meteorologists assessed the situation. They have now decided not to proceed, and the plane arrived at the Komaki airfield just before 3pm GMT on Monday.Speaking to mission control in Monaco from the cockpit of the plane, the pilot said situations like this are to be expected. \u201cOverall from the start I personally had a really wonderful time. But there is always unexpected situations, either from a technical point of view or from a weather point of view, to cope with. It\u2019s taken 18 years to sort technical questions, whether it\u2019s specialists trying to find the right route... so that was really a very interesting start.\u201cNow we face some changes so we will have to see if these changes are really important. In terms of strategy I think we\u2019ll know more in a few hours, and to keep all the options open. I\u2019m waiting here in the sea of Japan, and the Japanese MCC and authorities have been extremely helpful, extremely open and nice, they accommodate our wishes to have this aircraft integrated into their traffic.\u201cPart of the programme was to do some holding anyway. We\u2019re doing the holding a little bit earlier than expected, but for the time being it doesn\u2019t change anything. We need to see what the new forecast tells us.\u201dBertrand Piccard, who has been watching the flight from mission control, added: \u201cWe are not daredevils, we are explorers. We have to put safety at the top of all of our priorities. Everyone is very happy with the plane - but the weather does not fit. We land in Nagoya and we wait for better conditions to continue.\u201dSolar Impulse 2 is powered by more than 17,000 solar cells built into wings that, at 72 metres, are almost as long as those of an Airbus A380 superjumbo.Borschberg completed Solar Impulse 2\u2019s first overnight leg, with the aircraft relying solely on batteries charged by the sun\u2019s energy, but poor weather ahead threw the rest of the marathon flight into doubt.A statement was posted on the Solar Impulse website, which helps track the flight\u2019s journey, earlier today. It said: \u201cYesterday we had the possibility to cross the weather front just before Hawaii on day 5. However, with the forecasts we now have, we don\u2019t see this possibility anymore, which means that for the moment the road to Hawaii is blocked. We need all the data from the next weather forecasts, so that our weather experts can analyse what\u2019s going to happen in the next four to five days.\u201cWhilst we wait for the forecasts, we have decided to hold the position of the aircraft. We have asked Andr\u00e9 to stay where he is: it\u2019s fine, the weather is good and the batteries are charging. During this time we will analyse where he will have to go to find a possibility to cross that front.\u201dThe China to Hawaii journey is the seventh and most challenging leg of the attempt to circumnavigate the world using just the energy of the Sun.

The data, compiled by WWF, Oil Change International (OCI) and the Natural Resource Defence Council, reveals more than $73bn of international public finance was given to coal between 2007 and 2014. The group said the money \u201cmoved through largely unknown and opaque institutions\u201d.ECAs based in OECD member states were the biggest drivers of coal investment, accounting for nearly half of the total.The data comes a week before the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD\u2019s) export credit group is due to meet in Paris to discuss banning export finance for coal. The US and France have already stopped their ECAs giving money to coal power plants, and are pushing for a global ban on export credit for coal. Sebastien Godinot, an economist with WWF-Europe, said there was a high risk of the talks foundering on the recalcitrance of Australia, Japan and Korea.\u201cThe OECD countries have to recognise that this policy of supporting coal exports with public money is just completely inconsistent with their climate commitments. You have three countries which are trying to block progress which are Japan, Korea and Australia. This is the dark side. Their intention is clearly to buy time or to block any substantial progress,\u201d he said.Under current OECD rules, ECA finance gives preferable, long-term conditions to all fossil fuel projects, including coal. Godinot said the loans, guarantees, policy lending and technical assistance often act as seed funding, which draws more investment to projects meaning the $73bn is actually responsible for generating much larger investments in the dirtiest fossil fuel.The NGOs calculated that the coal power plants supported by international finance would emit 0.5bn tonnes of carbon each year, equal to the annual emissions of Italy. Over their lifetime, supported plants would spew 18bn tonnes into the atmosphere.Stephen Kretzmann, executive director of OCI, said that by blocking progress and continuing to fund their own coal companies \u201cgovernments are prioritising the corporate profits of the coal industry over the climate and the interests of the poor\u201d.The coal industry has argued that its product is necessary to bring affordable electricity to the developing world. But the data revealed that Australia, one of the world\u2019s 10 richest countries , received over $4bn in funding for new coal projects \u2013 mostly for mines and mostly from Japan. This makes it one of the biggest beneficiaries of coal export finance in the world and one of eight high income countries in the top 20. Australia has also adopted the strongest opposition to the OECD export credit ban.Japanese miner Mitsubishi received over $1.4bn worth of credit from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, one of Japan\u2019s two ECAs, to bolster its stake in the Caval Ridge Coal Mine in the Australian state of Queensland. At the opening, Australian prime minister Tony Abbott declared: \u201cCoal is good for humanity.\u201dThe total funding for coal from ECAs was $12bn more than the funding from all global development banks. Japan\u2019s finance alone was three times the funding given by the World Bank, whose president has called for an end to subsidies for coal.No countries defined as \u2018low-income\u2019 received finance from ECAs based in OECD countries. Much of the money did end up in emerging economies, such as Vietnam, South Africa and India. But Kretzmann said the money was not targeted at development and that renewable energy was generally the cheapest way to provide electricity to those who lack it.\u201cAn ECA is an agency that is specifically designed to support a country\u2019s own domestic corporate agenda abroad, to open up new markets for companies based in those countries. In the case of Japan, which is by far the largest lender, you have Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi who are the really big winners,\u201d he said.Last week Reuters reported that Germany had weakened Europe\u2019s stance on banning coal export finance. The Guardian understands that Germany is supportive of controls on coal finance but not the total ban desired by France and the US. Godinot said this was of particular concern because of Germany\u2019s position in the EU and the EU\u2019s large influence on the OECD \u2013 two-thirds of OECD countries are in the EU.Shelagh Whitley, a climate finance expert at the Overseas Development Institute, said Germany\u2019s continued support for coal overseas \u2013 it is the fourth largest export financier of coal \u2013 was at odds with its domestic phase out of coal subsidies and clean energy growth. \u201cThis dirty money helps German coal companies, now unable to do business at home, export their dead-end technologies to developing countries. This leaves a black mark on the country\u2019s otherwise clean climate record,\u201d she said.

Chinese state media also responded angrily to the decision to use the word \u201cincident\u201d in some of the books to describe the Nanking massacre in December 1937. It is the first time that all social studies textbooks for junior high schools \u2013 for children aged 12 to 15 \u2013 have repeated government claims to the territories.The textbooks\u2019 claims on contentious territorial and historical issues reflect the growing influence of Japan\u2019s revisionist movement, led by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Abe, a conservative and enthusiastic supporter of patriotic education in Japanese schools, has previously angered South Korea by claiming that up to 200,000 mainly Korean women who worked as wartime \u201ccomfort women\u201d were not coerced into sexual slavery by Japanese military authorities.  Related: Anger of wartime sex slaves haunts Japan and South Korea This year the three countries will mark the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war, and there is growing speculation that Abe will mark the occasion with a statement that attempts to play down past atrocities by removing references to Japanese aggression on the Asian mainland in the first half of the 20th century.Japan\u2019s neighbours have urged it to leave unchanged an official apology issued in 1993 that acknowledged the military\u2019s role in forcing women into sexual slavery, as well as a 1995 statement apologising for the country\u2019s wartime conduct. South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry called the textbooks\u2019 content \u201cyet another provocation that distorts, reduces and omits clear historic facts to strengthen its unjust claims to what is clearly our territory\u201d.

It shows Japan doesn\u2019t have any will to play a responsible role as a trusted neighbouring country.\u201dJapan\u2019s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said the textbooks were designed to avoid \u201cmisunderstandings\u201d among pupils. \u201cOur country\u2019s textbook screening is carried out impartially and neutrally, based on professional and academic deliberations,\u201d Suga told reporters. \u201cSince our country\u2019s stance on Takeshima and history recognition have been consistent, we responded to [South Korea] by saying we cannot accept their protest.\u201d In China, the state news agency, Xinhua, accused Japan\u2019s \u201cincreasingly right-leaning\u201d leaders of taking their revisionist beliefs into the classroom. Xinhua noted that a previous textbook passage recalling that Japanese troops had \u201ckilled many captives and civilians\u201d in Nanking had been replaced with the more innocuous claim that captives and civilians had been \u201cinvolved\u201d.The extent of the slaughter is still the subject of debate, although mainstream historians say Japanese troops killed as many 200,000 people in the eastern Chinese city.

The budget will be drafted into a bill in December and submitted to parliament for approval.Japan had been making annual cuts to its defence budget for a decade up to 2013. The increases since then reflect its growing anxiety about China\u2019s expanding naval reach. The rise is also in line with Japan\u2019s more assertive defence policy under the conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as he seeks to check Chinese influence and expand the scope of his country\u2019s military.Abe\u2019s ongoing attempts to push through legislation that would allow Japanese troops to fight alongside allies on foreign soil for the first time since the end of the second world war brought tens of thousands of people out in protest on Sunday.Monday\u2019s budget request, an increase of 2.2% on last year, demonstrates a shift in Japan\u2019s security emphasis from its northern maritime border with Russia to its long and porous southern reaches. In contrast to previous investment in tanks and heavy artillery, it is building a more flexible and mobile force \u2013 including its own version of the US marine corps \u2013 that would be able to quickly defend territory against an invading enemy.

Japan\u2019s share of regional military spending, meanwhile, fell from 20% in 2010 to just below 14% last year.Much of the hardware included in Japan\u2019s new budget is designed to monitor outlying territories and repel any attempt to invade the Senkaku islands, which are administered by Japan but claimed by China.Japan is building a military radar station on Yonaguni island, just 94 miles south of the islands.According to a request submitted on Monday, the ministry\u2019s shopping list includes amphibious assault vehicles, stealth warplanes, F-35 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, F-35 fighters and an advanced Aegis radar-equipped destroyer.It also wants to acquire Global Hawk drones and surveillance helicopters to defend far-flung islands along an 870-mile stretch of ocean between the Japanese mainland and waters off Taiwan.The ministry is also seeking extra cash to build new military bases and expand existing ones on some of the islands, equipping them with state-of-the-art radar and missile batteries.Ministry officials have set aside \u00a358m to expand an army base on Miyakojima island, 188 miles east of Yonaguni, and \u00a347m to build a base on Amami Oshima, an island midway between the main Okinawan island and the Japanese mainland.

After this, falsifying catch data became more difficult, although there are still reports of international observers failing to report infractions, either through distraction or direct collusion.Given the ease and temptation to misreport catch data, the scientists suggest any future whaling activities should be monitored by a comprehensive and transparent independent observer scheme, a finding supported by Brierley.\u201cWe have to have faith that the numbers reported today are those that are caught,\u201d he said. \u201cBut unless you have an independent observer on the boat, it\u2019s very hard to know.\u201d", "tags": ["Whaling", "Environment", "Conservation", "Marine life", "Whales", "Cetaceans", "Japan", "World news", "Russia", "Asia Pacific", "Europe"], "title": "Japan accused of falsifying whaling data"},{"date": "2015-08-31T11:39:46Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan\u2019s defence ministry has requested its biggest ever budget to bolster its ability to protect outlying islands in response to China\u2019s growing military reach in the region.The ministry has asked for 5.09 trillion yen (\u00a327bn) for the financial year starting in April 2016, amid concern over Beijing\u2019s construction of artificial bases in the South China Sea and its claims to the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu island chain in the East China SeaIf approved, the defence budget would be Japan\u2019s biggest ever, after the fourth increase in as many years. The budget will be drafted into a bill in December and submitted to parliament for approval.Japan had been making annual cuts to its defence budget for a decade up to 2013. The increases since then reflect its growing anxiety about China\u2019s expanding naval reach. The rise is also in line with Japan\u2019s more assertive defence policy under the conservative prime minister, Shinzo Abe, as he seeks to check Chinese influence and expand the scope of his country\u2019s military.Abe\u2019s ongoing attempts to push through legislation that would allow Japanese troops to fight alongside allies on foreign soil for the first time since the end of the second world war brought tens of thousands of people out in protest on Sunday.Monday\u2019s budget request, an increase of 2.2% on last year, demonstrates a shift in Japan\u2019s security emphasis from its northern maritime border with Russia to its long and porous southern reaches. In contrast to previous investment in tanks and heavy artillery, it is building a more flexible and mobile force \u2013 including its own version of the US marine corps \u2013 that would be able to quickly defend territory against an invading enemy. Related: Japan defence paper warns on China and pushes for stronger military role Japan\u2019s defence budget is still dwarfed by that of China, where military spending rose by more than 10% this year to \u00a390bn.China is second only to the US, which spent $581bn (\u00a3377bn) on defence in 2014, while Japan was ranked seventh, according to the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London.In 2010 China accounted for about 28% of defence spending in Asia, but by 2014 its share had increased to 38%, according to IISS. Japan\u2019s share of regional military spending, meanwhile, fell from 20% in 2010 to just below 14% last year.Much of the hardware included in Japan\u2019s new budget is designed to monitor outlying territories and repel any attempt to invade the Senkaku islands, which are administered by Japan but claimed by China.Japan is building a military radar station on Yonaguni island, just 94 miles south of the islands.According to a request submitted on Monday, the ministry\u2019s shopping list includes amphibious assault vehicles, stealth warplanes, F-35 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, F-35 fighters and an advanced Aegis radar-equipped destroyer.It also wants to acquire Global Hawk drones and surveillance helicopters to defend far-flung islands along an 870-mile stretch of ocean between the Japanese mainland and waters off Taiwan.The ministry is also seeking extra cash to build new military bases and expand existing ones on some of the islands, equipping them with state-of-the-art radar and missile batteries.Ministry officials have set aside \u00a358m to expand an army base on Miyakojima island, 188 miles east of Yonaguni, and \u00a347m to build a base on Amami Oshima, an island midway between the main Okinawan island and the Japanese mainland.

Designated a Unesco world heritage site in 1993, the island has long been revered by the Japanese as one of the country\u2019s natural wonders, but it is only in recent years that foreign visitors have started to discover Yakushima\u2019s secrets.This small, round island has an incredibly mountainous interior, but at only 17 miles wide, it is possible to see all of the main sights and get a good taste of island life in just a few days. Miyanoura-dake (1,935m) is one of Japan\u2019s famous One Hundred Mountains, and is the country\u2019s most southerly point where snow can be found in winter. But Yakushima is best known for the extensive and hauntingly beautiful forests that cover most of the island, home to Japanese cedar trees (known as Yakusugi), some of which are thousands of years old. Walking through these moody, temperate rainforests, full of fairytale-like trees with twisted moss-covered roots, it is no surprise to learn that the island was the inspiration for acclaimed Studio Ghibli animation Princess Mononoke, directed by Hayao Miyazaki.The extremely wet climate means crystal-clear rivers tumble down from the high peaks, resulting in spectacular waterfalls, which carve their way through the granite bedrock. Lavish green, dense foliage provides the perfect home for the Yakushima macaque and the Yaku deer, both of which are smaller than their mainland counterparts but less timid, so can easily be spotted foraging near roadsides and along hiking trails. In the summer months, endangered loggerhead turtles make their nests on Yakushima\u2019s beaches, while tropical fish and corals can be found in the shallow and warm coastal waters. Geothermal hot springs (onsen) are everywhere, as they are in most of Japan, and some of the island\u2019s best are right on the beach.The two main points of entry are the tiny port towns of Miyanoura and Anbo, where daily ferries from Kagoshima put in. Be sure to bring plenty of cash from the mainland as ATMs are almost non-existent and few places accept cards. A road loops around the entire island, although the western stretch is too narrow and remote for the (limited) bus service, so a rental car is the best way to get around.Outdoor activities are high on the agenda for most visitors to Yakushima, and the steep mountains and pristine forests attract hikers from all over Japan, with trails to suit all abilities. Yakusugi Land, a nature park, (two buses a day from Anbo, ticket \u00a34) is home to many impressive old cedars, and has a number of easy hikes (ranging from 30 minutes to three hours), which afford close-up views of these relics.Further north, Shiratani Unsuikyo (35 minutes from Miyanoura by bus, ticket \u00a33) is a world of mossy-green woods and babbling streams that inspired Miyazaki\u2019s animated masterpiece. The well-marked paths lead to a number of ancient, individually named cedars. For the more adventurous, this area marks the beginning (or end) of a gruelling three-day traverse across the island\u2019s interior, passing landmarks, such as Wilson\u2019s Stump (the hollow remains of a long-felled giant cedar) and the oddly-shaped granite outcrops that characterise the high mountain tops. There are a number of huts to stay in, for free, but you need to bring your own sleeping bag and cooking equipment as accommodation is extremely basic (and cold at night).For those who love soaking in hot springs, the unique Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen on the south coast is a must. It\u2019s right on the rocky shoreline and so can only be accessed twice a day, when the tide is low. Pop \u00a5100 (50p) into the honesty box, strip down (a small towel can be used to protect your modesty) and be sure to follow local etiquette by rinsing yourself before entering the pools. Just down the road is Yudomari Onsen, which has a bamboo divider to separate the sexes and, for those who can\u2019t stand the heat, the water here is a pleasant 38C.In summer, loggerhead turtles return to the place they were born some 30 years earlier to lay eggs on the beach. For night-time turtle watching with a local guide, make a reservation at the sea turtle museum (umigame-kan.org).There are exceptionally good snorkelling and sea-kayaking spots all around the island. As the rainiest place in Japan, waterfalls are ubiquitous and the most spectacular is the west coast\u2019s 88m-high Ooko-no-taki, just a short walk from the main road.The newly-opened Guesthouse Yakushima (from \u00a316pp for a dorm bed) is in a secluded spot on the south coast, close to the impressive Senpiro Waterfall and Toroki Falls (the only waterfall in Japan that flows directly into the sea).

He added that Tokyo was not considering a fresh stimulus.The plea for big business to support the recovery came as official data on Monday showed Japan\u2019s economy shrank by an annualised 0.8% in July to September after a deeper than previously estimated 0.7% contraction in the previous three months, providing the two consecutive quarters of declines needed to mark a recession. Analysts said labour shortages were a significant feature of an ageing population in a country that had put severe restrictions on immigration.

Designated a Unesco world heritage site in 1993, the island has long been revered by the Japanese as one of the country\u2019s natural wonders, but it is only in recent years that foreign visitors have started to discover Yakushima\u2019s secrets.This small, round island has an incredibly mountainous interior, but at only 17 miles wide, it is possible to see all of the main sights and get a good taste of island life in just a few days. Miyanoura-dake (1,935m) is one of Japan\u2019s famous One Hundred Mountains, and is the country\u2019s most southerly point where snow can be found in winter. But Yakushima is best known for the extensive and hauntingly beautiful forests that cover most of the island, home to Japanese cedar trees (known as Yakusugi), some of which are thousands of years old. Walking through these moody, temperate rainforests, full of fairytale-like trees with twisted moss-covered roots, it is no surprise to learn that the island was the inspiration for acclaimed Studio Ghibli animation Princess Mononoke, directed by Hayao Miyazaki.The extremely wet climate means crystal-clear rivers tumble down from the high peaks, resulting in spectacular waterfalls, which carve their way through the granite bedrock. Lavish green, dense foliage provides the perfect home for the Yakushima macaque and the Yaku deer, both of which are smaller than their mainland counterparts but less timid, so can easily be spotted foraging near roadsides and along hiking trails. In the summer months, endangered loggerhead turtles make their nests on Yakushima\u2019s beaches, while tropical fish and corals can be found in the shallow and warm coastal waters. Geothermal hot springs (onsen) are everywhere, as they are in most of Japan, and some of the island\u2019s best are right on the beach.The two main points of entry are the tiny port towns of Miyanoura and Anbo, where daily ferries from Kagoshima put in. Be sure to bring plenty of cash from the mainland as ATMs are almost non-existent and few places accept cards. A road loops around the entire island, although the western stretch is too narrow and remote for the (limited) bus service, so a rental car is the best way to get around.Outdoor activities are high on the agenda for most visitors to Yakushima, and the steep mountains and pristine forests attract hikers from all over Japan, with trails to suit all abilities. Yakusugi Land, a nature park, (two buses a day from Anbo, ticket \u00a34) is home to many impressive old cedars, and has a number of easy hikes (ranging from 30 minutes to three hours), which afford close-up views of these relics.Further north, Shiratani Unsuikyo (35 minutes from Miyanoura by bus, ticket \u00a33) is a world of mossy-green woods and babbling streams that inspired Miyazaki\u2019s animated masterpiece. The well-marked paths lead to a number of ancient, individually named cedars. For the more adventurous, this area marks the beginning (or end) of a gruelling three-day traverse across the island\u2019s interior, passing landmarks, such as Wilson\u2019s Stump (the hollow remains of a long-felled giant cedar) and the oddly-shaped granite outcrops that characterise the high mountain tops. There are a number of huts to stay in, for free, but you need to bring your own sleeping bag and cooking equipment as accommodation is extremely basic (and cold at night).For those who love soaking in hot springs, the unique Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen on the south coast is a must. It\u2019s right on the rocky shoreline and so can only be accessed twice a day, when the tide is low. Pop \u00a5100 (50p) into the honesty box, strip down (a small towel can be used to protect your modesty) and be sure to follow local etiquette by rinsing yourself before entering the pools. Just down the road is Yudomari Onsen, which has a bamboo divider to separate the sexes and, for those who can\u2019t stand the heat, the water here is a pleasant 38C.In summer, loggerhead turtles return to the place they were born some 30 years earlier to lay eggs on the beach. For night-time turtle watching with a local guide, make a reservation at the sea turtle museum (umigame-kan.org).There are exceptionally good snorkelling and sea-kayaking spots all around the island. As the rainiest place in Japan, waterfalls are ubiquitous and the most spectacular is the west coast\u2019s 88m-high Ooko-no-taki, just a short walk from the main road.The newly-opened Guesthouse Yakushima (from \u00a316pp for a dorm bed) is in a secluded spot on the south coast, close to the impressive Senpiro Waterfall and Toroki Falls (the only waterfall in Japan that flows directly into the sea).

The young gymnast turned dancer was famously nurtured by Rudolf Nureyev but went on to forge her own remarkable career in classical ballet and, latterly, contemporary dance.She joined the Royal Ballet as principal guest artist in 1989 after dancing opposite Nureyev in his 50th birthday performance of Giselle.

Designated a Unesco world heritage site in 1993, the island has long been revered by the Japanese as one of the country\u2019s natural wonders, but it is only in recent years that foreign visitors have started to discover Yakushima\u2019s secrets.This small, round island has an incredibly mountainous interior, but at only 17 miles wide, it is possible to see all of the main sights and get a good taste of island life in just a few days. Miyanoura-dake (1,935m) is one of Japan\u2019s famous One Hundred Mountains, and is the country\u2019s most southerly point where snow can be found in winter. But Yakushima is best known for the extensive and hauntingly beautiful forests that cover most of the island, home to Japanese cedar trees (known as Yakusugi), some of which are thousands of years old. Walking through these moody, temperate rainforests, full of fairytale-like trees with twisted moss-covered roots, it is no surprise to learn that the island was the inspiration for acclaimed Studio Ghibli animation Princess Mononoke, directed by Hayao Miyazaki.The extremely wet climate means crystal-clear rivers tumble down from the high peaks, resulting in spectacular waterfalls, which carve their way through the granite bedrock. Lavish green, dense foliage provides the perfect home for the Yakushima macaque and the Yaku deer, both of which are smaller than their mainland counterparts but less timid, so can easily be spotted foraging near roadsides and along hiking trails. In the summer months, endangered loggerhead turtles make their nests on Yakushima\u2019s beaches, while tropical fish and corals can be found in the shallow and warm coastal waters. Geothermal hot springs (onsen) are everywhere, as they are in most of Japan, and some of the island\u2019s best are right on the beach.The two main points of entry are the tiny port towns of Miyanoura and Anbo, where daily ferries from Kagoshima put in. Be sure to bring plenty of cash from the mainland as ATMs are almost non-existent and few places accept cards. A road loops around the entire island, although the western stretch is too narrow and remote for the (limited) bus service, so a rental car is the best way to get around.Outdoor activities are high on the agenda for most visitors to Yakushima, and the steep mountains and pristine forests attract hikers from all over Japan, with trails to suit all abilities. Yakusugi Land, a nature park, (two buses a day from Anbo, ticket \u00a34) is home to many impressive old cedars, and has a number of easy hikes (ranging from 30 minutes to three hours), which afford close-up views of these relics.Further north, Shiratani Unsuikyo (35 minutes from Miyanoura by bus, ticket \u00a33) is a world of mossy-green woods and babbling streams that inspired Miyazaki\u2019s animated masterpiece. The well-marked paths lead to a number of ancient, individually named cedars. For the more adventurous, this area marks the beginning (or end) of a gruelling three-day traverse across the island\u2019s interior, passing landmarks, such as Wilson\u2019s Stump (the hollow remains of a long-felled giant cedar) and the oddly-shaped granite outcrops that characterise the high mountain tops. There are a number of huts to stay in, for free, but you need to bring your own sleeping bag and cooking equipment as accommodation is extremely basic (and cold at night).For those who love soaking in hot springs, the unique Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen on the south coast is a must. It\u2019s right on the rocky shoreline and so can only be accessed twice a day, when the tide is low. Pop \u00a5100 (50p) into the honesty box, strip down (a small towel can be used to protect your modesty) and be sure to follow local etiquette by rinsing yourself before entering the pools. Just down the road is Yudomari Onsen, which has a bamboo divider to separate the sexes and, for those who can\u2019t stand the heat, the water here is a pleasant 38C.In summer, loggerhead turtles return to the place they were born some 30 years earlier to lay eggs on the beach. For night-time turtle watching with a local guide, make a reservation at the sea turtle museum (umigame-kan.org).There are exceptionally good snorkelling and sea-kayaking spots all around the island. As the rainiest place in Japan, waterfalls are ubiquitous and the most spectacular is the west coast\u2019s 88m-high Ooko-no-taki, just a short walk from the main road.The newly-opened Guesthouse Yakushima (from \u00a316pp for a dorm bed) is in a secluded spot on the south coast, close to the impressive Senpiro Waterfall and Toroki Falls (the only waterfall in Japan that flows directly into the sea). The rooms are clean, done in western and Japanese-tatami styles, and the friendly owner speaks good English.Cottage Morinokokage (from \u00a327pp) is conveniently near Anbo port and has helpful English-speaking owners. A range of cosy, pine-scented self-catering cottages offer splendid mountain views. Request the belly-filling barbecue set (for an extra \u00a316) to grill meat and vegetables under the twinkling lights of your veranda, whatever the weather.Soyotei (from \u00a376pp) is a beautiful, traditional family-run guesthouse on the less-visited north-west coast, close to one of the best beaches on the island which is a prime turtle-nesting site. Enjoy freshly caught seafood and local produce, tatami rooms with ocean views and relax in the adjoining hot spring. English is limited but the owners are attentive, and the price includes an evening meal and breakfast.JR Hotel Yakushima (doubles from \u00a3210) is the high-end option. Perched above the sea on the southern coast, the sunset views from the hotel\u2019s outdoor bath, great food and polite service are all exemplary, even by Japanese standards.There is no shortage of good food on Yakushima but, as with many out-of-the-way places in Japan, restaurants tend to close early. Seafood is the staple cuisine and is as fresh as it comes. Lean, locally sourced deer is the main meat option in any season, delicious grilled over charcoal, yakiniku-style. Should you crave fast food, there is a tiny Mos Burger in Anbo, surely the most rustic branch of this Japanese burger chain in the country. If visiting in the winter, keep your eyes peeled for small roadside stalls selling bags of ponkan and tankan, sweet and juicy varieties of oranges grown all over the island. Also, be sure to try the potent yet delicate local Mitake shochu, a distilled, sweet-potato relative of sake, best served on the rocks.For visitors fresh off the ferry, Shiosai (lunch sets from \u00a37, +81 997 42 2721) is a popular seafood restaurant just a short walk down the main street from Miyanoura port. The seasonal mackerel sashimi is a Yakushima speciality, and the fried flying fish (tobiuo) is another local favourite. Lunchtime sets are reasonably priced and typically offer a choice of sashimi or fried fish in a light tempura batter, both served with a small salad and miso soup. Popular with locals and tourists alike, an English menu is available.Rengaya in Anbo (sets from \u00a35, dinner from around \u00a316, +81 997 46 3439) is a lively establishment most well-known for its platters of deer meat and vegetables, which guests cook over a smoky grill in the centre of the table. After a long day in the mountains, stretch your legs out on the tatami mats (no chairs here) and wash everything down with a cold beer or refreshing chuhai (a carbonated alcoholic drink).On the main road in Anbo, Kamogawa (sets from \u00a35, +81 997 46 2101) is a cosy, family-run restaurant that offers satisfyingly large seafood sets at very reasonable prices.The Toppy hydrofoil takes about two hours from Kagoshima to Anbo (\u00a348 one-way) and the slower Yaku 2 ferry goes to Miyanoura once a day (\u00a327 one-way).

Related: Sylvie Guillem: 'I don't want to think about my last show \u2013 I just want to live it' Guillem first announced her plan to retire in 2014, three decades after she was made the youngest ever \u00e9toile \u2013 or top-ranking dancer \u2013 at the Paris Opera ballet as a 19-year-old. The young gymnast turned dancer was famously nurtured by Rudolf Nureyev but went on to forge her own remarkable career in classical ballet and, latterly, contemporary dance.She joined the Royal Ballet as principal guest artist in 1989 after dancing opposite Nureyev in his 50th birthday performance of Giselle. In London she earned the nickname \u201cMademoiselle Non\u201d due to the number of roles she turned down, but wherever she travelled in the world, Guillem\u2019s performances were a sellout.\u201cI just feel honoured to have been born in the same era as such a great artist,\u201d said Andi Matsui, a Japanese woman seeing the dancer live for the third time.Many in the audience were long-term fans. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her probably 100 times, and have travelled overseas to watch her,\u201d said Yuka Koike. \u201cAs always she was perfect. But for me, today was extremely emotional. From now, I\u2019m going to have to find a new dancer to follow.\u201dThat sadness, however, was tinged with a sense of the inevitable. All respected Guillem\u2019s decision to hang up her shoes. \u201cIt\u2019s natural for a dancer to stop, and she decided on her own terms when to finish,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Neumann, a German living in Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s better that she stopped before her performances started getting worse.\u201dHe, however, was not as enthused with her final performance. \u201cIt was good, but I am not really a fan of these \u2018best of\u2019 performances. I preferred Two and Dreamtime to Bol\u00e9ro at the end. I\u2019m more into contemporary dance.\u201dDaisuke Satogami, from T\u014dhoku, said the performance \u201creally struck me in the heart. I saw her perform Bol\u00e9ro in T\u014dhoku in the October after the 2011 tsunami. I wanted to offer her so much thanks for that, for being pure enough of heart to perform up there at such a time.\u201d Related: Sylvie Guillem: \u2018You dance, and there is always an answer\u2019 Guillem was awarded the prestigious Praemium Imperiale arts prize in Japan in September for her contribution to theatre. The award includes a 15m yen (\u00a384,000) cash reward. \u201cGuillem\u2019s brilliance lies in her ability to combine physical excellence with a passionate honesty and a desire to explore what can be achieved through the medium of dance,\u201d the award body said.Before finishing for good, Guillem will perform one last time for a live Japanese TV broadcast of Bol\u00e9ro on Thursday to see in the new year. Yokohama\u2019s Kanagawa Kenmin hall may seem an unusual location for the dancer\u2019s final show, compared with somewhere in the capital, Tokyo, or Japan\u2019s cultural heart, Kyoto. But Kenichi Nagai, the director of the foundation that runs the venue, said Guillem had wanted to perform there one last time.\u201cIt\u2019s our 40th anniversary this year, and in our time we have seen a lot of history-making performances at the hall,\u201d Nagai said. \u201cWe did not have the space to fit in a performance by her, but then the organisers of the tour contacted us and offered to put on a show on either 30 or 31 December.

There is something wrong with the idea that you can only be cool and attractive if you\u2019re thin.\u201dAimed primarily at men in their 30s and 40s, the first issue of Mr Babe had sold over half of its 50,000 print run \u2013 considered a healthy number in Japan\u2019s declining magazine industry \u2013 within a few weeks of publication.While the country\u2019s publishing industry was quicker to respond to demand for fashion and lifestyle advice for \u201cplus-size\u201d women, with the 2013 launch of the magazine La Farfa, statistics show that, in fact, the obesity rate among Japanese women has been falling for the past decade.By contrast, a 2013 survey by the health and welfare ministry found that almost a third of Japanese men had a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or above, at which a person is considered overweight.\u201cJust imagine how many people that represents, and how many more men like that there will be in the future,\u201d said Kurashina.With Japan confronting long-term depopulation and a persistently low birthrate, he regards his magazine as more than just a novelty for a niche readership.

Related: Japan 's 'quintuple dip' recession delivers a fresh blow to Abenomics Economics minister Akira Amari said a lack of workers available for public works projects worth billions of pounds restricted the government\u2019s ability to bolster the economy.Amari urged Japanese firms to use their record cash holdings to raise wages and increase capital spending to generate sustainable growth led by the private sector, instead of relying on government to always take the lead. He added that Tokyo was not considering a fresh stimulus.The plea for big business to support the recovery came as official data on Monday showed Japan\u2019s economy shrank by an annualised 0.8% in July to September after a deeper than previously estimated 0.7% contraction in the previous three months, providing the two consecutive quarters of declines needed to mark a recession. Analysts said labour shortages were a significant feature of an ageing population in a country that had put severe restrictions on immigration. But the government maintained its cautiously upbeat outlook, saying that despite a downturn in national income during the summer and autumn, an improved outlook for jobs and wages would mean a return to growth later in the year. \u201cWhile there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of the various [stimulus] steps taken so far,\u201d Amari said. He blamed a big reduction in stock levels for the dip in the third quarter and excluding this effect, said the economy expanded by an annualised 1.4%. Structural reform to support business investment is the third arrow in the country\u2019s recovery plan, dubbed Abenomics after the prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe.Izumi Devalier, an economist at HSBC, was also upbeat about the prospects for the economy, saying there were \u201cpositive trends that reflect the economy\u2019s continued progress in exiting deflation\u201d.\u201cPrivate consumption rebounded strongly on the back of improved real labour income. Meanwhile, nominal GDP continues to rise on the back of firm domestic price pressures and a better terms of trade,\u201d she added. \u201cThe bad news is that corporates are not yet convinced that the reflationary trend is here to stay, keeping capital expenditure weak. But this issue cannot be addressed through short-term stimulus alone.\u201d Japan has been stuck in a deflationary economic slump since a property and banking crash in the early 1990s. Under Abe\u2019s reforms, the government has increased its spending to regularly run a budget deficit of about 10%. This has been matched by aggressive action by the Bank of Japan to drive down borrowing costs to business and households with extra quantitative easing. But structural reforms have proved more difficult to implement and business investment has lagged.The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell in November to its lowest reading since April 2013.

The rooms are clean, done in western and Japanese-tatami styles, and the friendly owner speaks good English.Cottage Morinokokage (from \u00a327pp) is conveniently near Anbo port and has helpful English-speaking owners. A range of cosy, pine-scented self-catering cottages offer splendid mountain views. Request the belly-filling barbecue set (for an extra \u00a316) to grill meat and vegetables under the twinkling lights of your veranda, whatever the weather.Soyotei (from \u00a376pp) is a beautiful, traditional family-run guesthouse on the less-visited north-west coast, close to one of the best beaches on the island which is a prime turtle-nesting site. Enjoy freshly caught seafood and local produce, tatami rooms with ocean views and relax in the adjoining hot spring. English is limited but the owners are attentive, and the price includes an evening meal and breakfast.JR Hotel Yakushima (doubles from \u00a3210) is the high-end option. Perched above the sea on the southern coast, the sunset views from the hotel\u2019s outdoor bath, great food and polite service are all exemplary, even by Japanese standards.There is no shortage of good food on Yakushima but, as with many out-of-the-way places in Japan, restaurants tend to close early. Seafood is the staple cuisine and is as fresh as it comes. Lean, locally sourced deer is the main meat option in any season, delicious grilled over charcoal, yakiniku-style. Should you crave fast food, there is a tiny Mos Burger in Anbo, surely the most rustic branch of this Japanese burger chain in the country. If visiting in the winter, keep your eyes peeled for small roadside stalls selling bags of ponkan and tankan, sweet and juicy varieties of oranges grown all over the island. Also, be sure to try the potent yet delicate local Mitake shochu, a distilled, sweet-potato relative of sake, best served on the rocks.For visitors fresh off the ferry, Shiosai (lunch sets from \u00a37, +81 997 42 2721) is a popular seafood restaurant just a short walk down the main street from Miyanoura port. The seasonal mackerel sashimi is a Yakushima speciality, and the fried flying fish (tobiuo) is another local favourite. Lunchtime sets are reasonably priced and typically offer a choice of sashimi or fried fish in a light tempura batter, both served with a small salad and miso soup. Popular with locals and tourists alike, an English menu is available.Rengaya in Anbo (sets from \u00a35, dinner from around \u00a316, +81 997 46 3439) is a lively establishment most well-known for its platters of deer meat and vegetables, which guests cook over a smoky grill in the centre of the table. After a long day in the mountains, stretch your legs out on the tatami mats (no chairs here) and wash everything down with a cold beer or refreshing chuhai (a carbonated alcoholic drink).On the main road in Anbo, Kamogawa (sets from \u00a35, +81 997 46 2101) is a cosy, family-run restaurant that offers satisfyingly large seafood sets at very reasonable prices.The Toppy hydrofoil takes about two hours from Kagoshima to Anbo (\u00a348 one-way) and the slower Yaku 2 ferry goes to Miyanoura once a day (\u00a327 one-way).

Related: Sylvie Guillem: 'I don't want to think about my last show \u2013 I just want to live it' Guillem first announced her plan to retire in 2014, three decades after she was made the youngest ever \u00e9toile \u2013 or top-ranking dancer \u2013 at the Paris Opera ballet as a 19-year-old. The young gymnast turned dancer was famously nurtured by Rudolf Nureyev but went on to forge her own remarkable career in classical ballet and, latterly, contemporary dance.She joined the Royal Ballet as principal guest artist in 1989 after dancing opposite Nureyev in his 50th birthday performance of Giselle. In London she earned the nickname \u201cMademoiselle Non\u201d due to the number of roles she turned down, but wherever she travelled in the world, Guillem\u2019s performances were a sellout.\u201cI just feel honoured to have been born in the same era as such a great artist,\u201d said Andi Matsui, a Japanese woman seeing the dancer live for the third time.Many in the audience were long-term fans. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her probably 100 times, and have travelled overseas to watch her,\u201d said Yuka Koike. \u201cAs always she was perfect. But for me, today was extremely emotional. From now, I\u2019m going to have to find a new dancer to follow.\u201dThat sadness, however, was tinged with a sense of the inevitable. All respected Guillem\u2019s decision to hang up her shoes. \u201cIt\u2019s natural for a dancer to stop, and she decided on her own terms when to finish,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Neumann, a German living in Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s better that she stopped before her performances started getting worse.\u201dHe, however, was not as enthused with her final performance. \u201cIt was good, but I am not really a fan of these \u2018best of\u2019 performances. I preferred Two and Dreamtime to Bol\u00e9ro at the end. I\u2019m more into contemporary dance.\u201dDaisuke Satogami, from T\u014dhoku, said the performance \u201creally struck me in the heart. I saw her perform Bol\u00e9ro in T\u014dhoku in the October after the 2011 tsunami. I wanted to offer her so much thanks for that, for being pure enough of heart to perform up there at such a time.\u201d Related: Sylvie Guillem: \u2018You dance, and there is always an answer\u2019 Guillem was awarded the prestigious Praemium Imperiale arts prize in Japan in September for her contribution to theatre. The award includes a 15m yen (\u00a384,000) cash reward. \u201cGuillem\u2019s brilliance lies in her ability to combine physical excellence with a passionate honesty and a desire to explore what can be achieved through the medium of dance,\u201d the award body said.Before finishing for good, Guillem will perform one last time for a live Japanese TV broadcast of Bol\u00e9ro on Thursday to see in the new year. Yokohama\u2019s Kanagawa Kenmin hall may seem an unusual location for the dancer\u2019s final show, compared with somewhere in the capital, Tokyo, or Japan\u2019s cultural heart, Kyoto. But Kenichi Nagai, the director of the foundation that runs the venue, said Guillem had wanted to perform there one last time.\u201cIt\u2019s our 40th anniversary this year, and in our time we have seen a lot of history-making performances at the hall,\u201d Nagai said. \u201cWe did not have the space to fit in a performance by her, but then the organisers of the tour contacted us and offered to put on a show on either 30 or 31 December.

There is something wrong with the idea that you can only be cool and attractive if you\u2019re thin.\u201dAimed primarily at men in their 30s and 40s, the first issue of Mr Babe had sold over half of its 50,000 print run \u2013 considered a healthy number in Japan\u2019s declining magazine industry \u2013 within a few weeks of publication.While the country\u2019s publishing industry was quicker to respond to demand for fashion and lifestyle advice for \u201cplus-size\u201d women, with the 2013 launch of the magazine La Farfa, statistics show that, in fact, the obesity rate among Japanese women has been falling for the past decade.By contrast, a 2013 survey by the health and welfare ministry found that almost a third of Japanese men had a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or above, at which a person is considered overweight.\u201cJust imagine how many people that represents, and how many more men like that there will be in the future,\u201d said Kurashina.With Japan confronting long-term depopulation and a persistently low birthrate, he regards his magazine as more than just a novelty for a niche readership. By giving larger men the confidence to date \u2013 and perhaps to marry and start families \u2013 he believes he is on a mission to arrest Japan\u2019s looming demographic implosion.Kurashina is happy to describe himself as \u201cpocchari\u201d (chubby), but recoils at the uncharitable overtones of \u201cdebu\u201d, a Japanese word best translated as \u201cfatso\u201d.

Tsuda, 63, was the first inmate to be executed following a conviction by a new system introduced in 2009 to give citizen jurors a role in sentencing, along with a panel of judges.Campaigners described the executions as \u201ca cruel form of punishment\u201d. Roseann Rife, East Asia research director at Amnesty International, said: \u201cThe Japanese authorities\u2019 willingness to put people to death is chilling and must end now before more lives are lost. The death penalty is not justice or an answer to tackling crime, it is a cruel form of punishment that flies in the face of respect for life.\u201cJapan should immediately introduce an official moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolition of the death penalty.\u201dSome campaigners hoped lay judges would be more reluctant to convict defendants accused of crimes that carry the death penalty - particularly those who claim they were forced to confess - but the number of accused to have been sentenced to death under the system now stands at 26.The justice minister, Mitsuhide Iwaki, told reporters that the lay judges had arrived at a \u201cvery grave\u201d judgement after lengthy deliberations.The second hanged man, Kazuyuki Wakabayashi, 39, had been convicted of the murder of a 52-year-old woman and her daughter in 2006. He was sentenced to death by judges.Japan has resisted international pressure to abolish the death penalty, notably from the UN and the European Union. Public support for capital punishment has remained strong since Aum Supreme Truth, a doomsday cult, killed 13 people and injured thousands of others in a sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.Japan and the US are the only two advanced industrial nations that retain the death penalty. Last year, only 22 countries carried out executions, and as of November this year, 140 countries had abolished capital punishment in law or in practice, according to Amnesty.\u201cJapan\u2019s continued use of the death penalty makes it stand out for all the wrong reasons \u2013 across the world, and increasingly also in the East Asia region,\u201d Rife said.Japan\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d executions have been condemned as particularly cruel. Typically, prisoners are kept in solitary confinement for years and given only a few hours\u2019 notice before being led to the gallows. Their families and lawyers are usually notified about the execution only after it has taken place.Amnesty said that several prisoners with mental and intellectual disabilities are known to have been executed or remain on death row.Doubts have also been raised over the safety of death penalty convictions in Japan. Iwao Hakamada, who had spent more than 45 years on death row, was freed last year after a court ordered a retrial in his murder case, amid suggestions that police investigators fabricated evidence against him.Before Friday\u2019s executions Japan had 128 inmates on death row, local media said.", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Capital punishment"], "title": "Japan executes first man convicted by citizen judges"},{"date": "2015-11-16T12:54:42Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan\u2019s recovery is being held back by a shortage of skilled labour, a leading minister has claimed, after the world\u2019s third-largest economy entered its fourth technical recession in five years. Related: Japan 's 'quintuple dip' recession delivers a fresh blow to Abenomics Economics minister Akira Amari said a lack of workers available for public works projects worth billions of pounds restricted the government\u2019s ability to bolster the economy.Amari urged Japanese firms to use their record cash holdings to raise wages and increase capital spending to generate sustainable growth led by the private sector, instead of relying on government to always take the lead. He added that Tokyo was not considering a fresh stimulus.The plea for big business to support the recovery came as official data on Monday showed Japan\u2019s economy shrank by an annualised 0.8% in July to September after a deeper than previously estimated 0.7% contraction in the previous three months, providing the two consecutive quarters of declines needed to mark a recession. Analysts said labour shortages were a significant feature of an ageing population in a country that had put severe restrictions on immigration. But the government maintained its cautiously upbeat outlook, saying that despite a downturn in national income during the summer and autumn, an improved outlook for jobs and wages would mean a return to growth later in the year. \u201cWhile there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of the various [stimulus] steps taken so far,\u201d Amari said. He blamed a big reduction in stock levels for the dip in the third quarter and excluding this effect, said the economy expanded by an annualised 1.4%. Structural reform to support business investment is the third arrow in the country\u2019s recovery plan, dubbed Abenomics after the prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe.Izumi Devalier, an economist at HSBC, was also upbeat about the prospects for the economy, saying there were \u201cpositive trends that reflect the economy\u2019s continued progress in exiting deflation\u201d.\u201cPrivate consumption rebounded strongly on the back of improved real labour income. Meanwhile, nominal GDP continues to rise on the back of firm domestic price pressures and a better terms of trade,\u201d she added. \u201cThe bad news is that corporates are not yet convinced that the reflationary trend is here to stay, keeping capital expenditure weak. But this issue cannot be addressed through short-term stimulus alone.\u201d Japan has been stuck in a deflationary economic slump since a property and banking crash in the early 1990s. Under Abe\u2019s reforms, the government has increased its spending to regularly run a budget deficit of about 10%. This has been matched by aggressive action by the Bank of Japan to drive down borrowing costs to business and households with extra quantitative easing. But structural reforms have proved more difficult to implement and business investment has lagged.The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell in November to its lowest reading since April 2013. The service sector index fell in October to its lowest since March, dragged down by wholesalers and retailers. Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas Securities: \u201cAbenomics\u2019 first two arrows of monetary and fiscal stimulus were meant to buy time, but Japan failed to make progress with painful reforms needed to boost its growth potential.

Many of the 17,000 Japanese living there at the end of the war were forced to leave.

Medvedev said the government would spend 70 billion roubles (\u00a3730m) on developing the territories over the next decade.Japan is embroiled in territorial rows on three fronts: with Russia over the Northern Territories, with China over the Senkaku islands, and with South Korea over the Takeshima islands.", "tags": ["Japan", "Russia", "Second world war", "Asia Pacific", "Europe", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Vladimir Putin"], "title": "Vladimir Putin's visit to Japan postponed indefinitely"},{"date": "2015-10-14T05:30:01Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Nestling in the warm, sub-tropical waters 37 miles south of Kyushu, Japan\u2019s third largest island, the towering mountains and ancient forests of Yakushima make it a secluded and largely unspoilt paradise, which feels a world away from the hustle and bustle of Japan\u2019s megacities. Designated a Unesco world heritage site in 1993, the island has long been revered by the Japanese as one of the country\u2019s natural wonders, but it is only in recent years that foreign visitors have started to discover Yakushima\u2019s secrets.This small, round island has an incredibly mountainous interior, but at only 17 miles wide, it is possible to see all of the main sights and get a good taste of island life in just a few days. Miyanoura-dake (1,935m) is one of Japan\u2019s famous One Hundred Mountains, and is the country\u2019s most southerly point where snow can be found in winter. But Yakushima is best known for the extensive and hauntingly beautiful forests that cover most of the island, home to Japanese cedar trees (known as Yakusugi), some of which are thousands of years old. Walking through these moody, temperate rainforests, full of fairytale-like trees with twisted moss-covered roots, it is no surprise to learn that the island was the inspiration for acclaimed Studio Ghibli animation Princess Mononoke, directed by Hayao Miyazaki.The extremely wet climate means crystal-clear rivers tumble down from the high peaks, resulting in spectacular waterfalls, which carve their way through the granite bedrock. Lavish green, dense foliage provides the perfect home for the Yakushima macaque and the Yaku deer, both of which are smaller than their mainland counterparts but less timid, so can easily be spotted foraging near roadsides and along hiking trails. In the summer months, endangered loggerhead turtles make their nests on Yakushima\u2019s beaches, while tropical fish and corals can be found in the shallow and warm coastal waters. Geothermal hot springs (onsen) are everywhere, as they are in most of Japan, and some of the island\u2019s best are right on the beach.The two main points of entry are the tiny port towns of Miyanoura and Anbo, where daily ferries from Kagoshima put in. Be sure to bring plenty of cash from the mainland as ATMs are almost non-existent and few places accept cards. A road loops around the entire island, although the western stretch is too narrow and remote for the (limited) bus service, so a rental car is the best way to get around.Outdoor activities are high on the agenda for most visitors to Yakushima, and the steep mountains and pristine forests attract hikers from all over Japan, with trails to suit all abilities. Yakusugi Land, a nature park, (two buses a day from Anbo, ticket \u00a34) is home to many impressive old cedars, and has a number of easy hikes (ranging from 30 minutes to three hours), which afford close-up views of these relics.Further north, Shiratani Unsuikyo (35 minutes from Miyanoura by bus, ticket \u00a33) is a world of mossy-green woods and babbling streams that inspired Miyazaki\u2019s animated masterpiece. The well-marked paths lead to a number of ancient, individually named cedars. For the more adventurous, this area marks the beginning (or end) of a gruelling three-day traverse across the island\u2019s interior, passing landmarks, such as Wilson\u2019s Stump (the hollow remains of a long-felled giant cedar) and the oddly-shaped granite outcrops that characterise the high mountain tops. There are a number of huts to stay in, for free, but you need to bring your own sleeping bag and cooking equipment as accommodation is extremely basic (and cold at night).For those who love soaking in hot springs, the unique Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen on the south coast is a must. It\u2019s right on the rocky shoreline and so can only be accessed twice a day, when the tide is low. Pop \u00a5100 (50p) into the honesty box, strip down (a small towel can be used to protect your modesty) and be sure to follow local etiquette by rinsing yourself before entering the pools. Just down the road is Yudomari Onsen, which has a bamboo divider to separate the sexes and, for those who can\u2019t stand the heat, the water here is a pleasant 38C.In summer, loggerhead turtles return to the place they were born some 30 years earlier to lay eggs on the beach. For night-time turtle watching with a local guide, make a reservation at the sea turtle museum (umigame-kan.org).There are exceptionally good snorkelling and sea-kayaking spots all around the island. As the rainiest place in Japan, waterfalls are ubiquitous and the most spectacular is the west coast\u2019s 88m-high Ooko-no-taki, just a short walk from the main road.The newly-opened Guesthouse Yakushima (from \u00a316pp for a dorm bed) is in a secluded spot on the south coast, close to the impressive Senpiro Waterfall and Toroki Falls (the only waterfall in Japan that flows directly into the sea). The rooms are clean, done in western and Japanese-tatami styles, and the friendly owner speaks good English.Cottage Morinokokage (from \u00a327pp) is conveniently near Anbo port and has helpful English-speaking owners. A range of cosy, pine-scented self-catering cottages offer splendid mountain views. Request the belly-filling barbecue set (for an extra \u00a316) to grill meat and vegetables under the twinkling lights of your veranda, whatever the weather.Soyotei (from \u00a376pp) is a beautiful, traditional family-run guesthouse on the less-visited north-west coast, close to one of the best beaches on the island which is a prime turtle-nesting site. Enjoy freshly caught seafood and local produce, tatami rooms with ocean views and relax in the adjoining hot spring. English is limited but the owners are attentive, and the price includes an evening meal and breakfast.JR Hotel Yakushima (doubles from \u00a3210) is the high-end option. Perched above the sea on the southern coast, the sunset views from the hotel\u2019s outdoor bath, great food and polite service are all exemplary, even by Japanese standards.There is no shortage of good food on Yakushima but, as with many out-of-the-way places in Japan, restaurants tend to close early. Seafood is the staple cuisine and is as fresh as it comes. Lean, locally sourced deer is the main meat option in any season, delicious grilled over charcoal, yakiniku-style. Should you crave fast food, there is a tiny Mos Burger in Anbo, surely the most rustic branch of this Japanese burger chain in the country. If visiting in the winter, keep your eyes peeled for small roadside stalls selling bags of ponkan and tankan, sweet and juicy varieties of oranges grown all over the island. Also, be sure to try the potent yet delicate local Mitake shochu, a distilled, sweet-potato relative of sake, best served on the rocks.For visitors fresh off the ferry, Shiosai (lunch sets from \u00a37, +81 997 42 2721) is a popular seafood restaurant just a short walk down the main street from Miyanoura port. The seasonal mackerel sashimi is a Yakushima speciality, and the fried flying fish (tobiuo) is another local favourite. Lunchtime sets are reasonably priced and typically offer a choice of sashimi or fried fish in a light tempura batter, both served with a small salad and miso soup. Popular with locals and tourists alike, an English menu is available.Rengaya in Anbo (sets from \u00a35, dinner from around \u00a316, +81 997 46 3439) is a lively establishment most well-known for its platters of deer meat and vegetables, which guests cook over a smoky grill in the centre of the table. After a long day in the mountains, stretch your legs out on the tatami mats (no chairs here) and wash everything down with a cold beer or refreshing chuhai (a carbonated alcoholic drink).On the main road in Anbo, Kamogawa (sets from \u00a35, +81 997 46 2101) is a cosy, family-run restaurant that offers satisfyingly large seafood sets at very reasonable prices.The Toppy hydrofoil takes about two hours from Kagoshima to Anbo (\u00a348 one-way) and the slower Yaku 2 ferry goes to Miyanoura once a day (\u00a327 one-way).

Related: Sylvie Guillem: 'I don't want to think about my last show \u2013 I just want to live it' Guillem first announced her plan to retire in 2014, three decades after she was made the youngest ever \u00e9toile \u2013 or top-ranking dancer \u2013 at the Paris Opera ballet as a 19-year-old. The young gymnast turned dancer was famously nurtured by Rudolf Nureyev but went on to forge her own remarkable career in classical ballet and, latterly, contemporary dance.She joined the Royal Ballet as principal guest artist in 1989 after dancing opposite Nureyev in his 50th birthday performance of Giselle. In London she earned the nickname \u201cMademoiselle Non\u201d due to the number of roles she turned down, but wherever she travelled in the world, Guillem\u2019s performances were a sellout.\u201cI just feel honoured to have been born in the same era as such a great artist,\u201d said Andi Matsui, a Japanese woman seeing the dancer live for the third time.Many in the audience were long-term fans. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her probably 100 times, and have travelled overseas to watch her,\u201d said Yuka Koike. \u201cAs always she was perfect. But for me, today was extremely emotional. From now, I\u2019m going to have to find a new dancer to follow.\u201dThat sadness, however, was tinged with a sense of the inevitable. All respected Guillem\u2019s decision to hang up her shoes. \u201cIt\u2019s natural for a dancer to stop, and she decided on her own terms when to finish,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Neumann, a German living in Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s better that she stopped before her performances started getting worse.\u201dHe, however, was not as enthused with her final performance. \u201cIt was good, but I am not really a fan of these \u2018best of\u2019 performances. I preferred Two and Dreamtime to Bol\u00e9ro at the end. I\u2019m more into contemporary dance.\u201dDaisuke Satogami, from T\u014dhoku, said the performance \u201creally struck me in the heart. I saw her perform Bol\u00e9ro in T\u014dhoku in the October after the 2011 tsunami. I wanted to offer her so much thanks for that, for being pure enough of heart to perform up there at such a time.\u201d Related: Sylvie Guillem: \u2018You dance, and there is always an answer\u2019 Guillem was awarded the prestigious Praemium Imperiale arts prize in Japan in September for her contribution to theatre. The award includes a 15m yen (\u00a384,000) cash reward. \u201cGuillem\u2019s brilliance lies in her ability to combine physical excellence with a passionate honesty and a desire to explore what can be achieved through the medium of dance,\u201d the award body said.Before finishing for good, Guillem will perform one last time for a live Japanese TV broadcast of Bol\u00e9ro on Thursday to see in the new year. Yokohama\u2019s Kanagawa Kenmin hall may seem an unusual location for the dancer\u2019s final show, compared with somewhere in the capital, Tokyo, or Japan\u2019s cultural heart, Kyoto. But Kenichi Nagai, the director of the foundation that runs the venue, said Guillem had wanted to perform there one last time.\u201cIt\u2019s our 40th anniversary this year, and in our time we have seen a lot of history-making performances at the hall,\u201d Nagai said. \u201cWe did not have the space to fit in a performance by her, but then the organisers of the tour contacted us and offered to put on a show on either 30 or 31 December.

Tsuda, 63, was the first inmate to be executed following a conviction by a new system introduced in 2009 to give citizen jurors a role in sentencing, along with a panel of judges.Campaigners described the executions as \u201ca cruel form of punishment\u201d. Roseann Rife, East Asia research director at Amnesty International, said: \u201cThe Japanese authorities\u2019 willingness to put people to death is chilling and must end now before more lives are lost. The death penalty is not justice or an answer to tackling crime, it is a cruel form of punishment that flies in the face of respect for life.\u201cJapan should immediately introduce an official moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolition of the death penalty.\u201dSome campaigners hoped lay judges would be more reluctant to convict defendants accused of crimes that carry the death penalty - particularly those who claim they were forced to confess - but the number of accused to have been sentenced to death under the system now stands at 26.The justice minister, Mitsuhide Iwaki, told reporters that the lay judges had arrived at a \u201cvery grave\u201d judgement after lengthy deliberations.The second hanged man, Kazuyuki Wakabayashi, 39, had been convicted of the murder of a 52-year-old woman and her daughter in 2006. He was sentenced to death by judges.Japan has resisted international pressure to abolish the death penalty, notably from the UN and the European Union. Public support for capital punishment has remained strong since Aum Supreme Truth, a doomsday cult, killed 13 people and injured thousands of others in a sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.Japan and the US are the only two advanced industrial nations that retain the death penalty. Last year, only 22 countries carried out executions, and as of November this year, 140 countries had abolished capital punishment in law or in practice, according to Amnesty.\u201cJapan\u2019s continued use of the death penalty makes it stand out for all the wrong reasons \u2013 across the world, and increasingly also in the East Asia region,\u201d Rife said.Japan\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d executions have been condemned as particularly cruel. Typically, prisoners are kept in solitary confinement for years and given only a few hours\u2019 notice before being led to the gallows. Their families and lawyers are usually notified about the execution only after it has taken place.Amnesty said that several prisoners with mental and intellectual disabilities are known to have been executed or remain on death row.Doubts have also been raised over the safety of death penalty convictions in Japan. Iwao Hakamada, who had spent more than 45 years on death row, was freed last year after a court ordered a retrial in his murder case, amid suggestions that police investigators fabricated evidence against him.Before Friday\u2019s executions Japan had 128 inmates on death row, local media said.", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Capital punishment"], "title": "Japan executes first man convicted by citizen judges"},{"date": "2015-12-16T09:31:40Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan\u2019s supreme court has ruled that a 19th-century law forcing married couples to use the same surname \u2013 almost always that of the husband \u2013 does not violate the constitution.The court\u2019s ruling on Wednesday will be seen as a setback for women\u2019s rights in Japan, just as the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pushes for a greater role for women in the workplace to boost economic growth. Related: Japanese women in court fight to keep their surnames after marriage In a minor victory, however, the country\u2019s top court said that a second legal provision preventing women from remarrying for six months after they divorce violates the constitution\u2019s commitment to gender equality. But the court said that a remarriage ban on women of up to 100 days was reasonable, according to Kyodo News.The same-name ruling came in response to a lawsuit by five women who argued the requirement, as stipulated in the 1896 civil code, violates married couples\u2019 civil rights.While the law does not stipulate which name married couples should adopt, in practice women take their husband\u2019s name in 96% of cases \u2013 a reflection, critics, say of Japan\u2019s male-dominated society.One of the plaintiffs, Kaori Oguni, said before the ruling: \u201cBy losing your surname \u2026 you\u2019re being made light of, you\u2019re not respected \u2026 It\u2019s as if part of your self vanishes.\u201dOguni and four other women launched their legal challenge in 2011, seeking damages of 6m yen (\u00a333,000) for the emotional distress and practical inconvenience of having to take their husband\u2019s name.The attempt to have the law deemed unconstitutional encountered opposition from conservative politicians and commentators, who argued that allowing couples to have different surnames would damage the traditional family unit.The law reflects the traditional view that marriages in Japan are unions between families, not individuals. During the Meiji era (1868-1912), when the law was introduced, it was common for a woman to leave her family to become part of her husband\u2019s family.\u201cNames are the best way to bind families,\u201d Masaomi Takanori, a constitutional scholar, told NHK public television in the run-up to the verdict. \u201cAllowing different surnames risks destroying social stability, the maintenance of public order and the basis for social welfare.\u201dIn practice, many women continue to use their maiden names at work and their legal, married surname in official documents. They include the internal affairs minister, Sanae Takaichi.Oguni said: \u201cIf changing surnames is so easy, why don\u2019t more men do it? The system is one that says, basically, if you\u2019re not willing to change, you shouldn\u2019t be getting married.\u201dThe issue has divided public opinion. A poll by the liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper found that 52% of respondents believed couples should have the right to choose, while 34% opposed the move. If given the option, more than 70% said they would adopt a single family name.Wednesday\u2019s decision means that the only option open to couples who wish to use separate surnames is not to register their marriages. People in common-law marriages, however, encounter complications in inheritance and parental rights.While it is not directly related to the name issue, the plaintiffs were hoping that Abe\u2019s quest to raise the profile of women in the workplace would help their cause.Japan is thought to be one of only a few industrialised countries where it is illegal for married couples to have different surnames.A justice ministry panel recommended in 1996 that the same-name rule be abolished and that the waiting time for remarriage be cut to 100 days, but the change met fierce opposition from conservative MPs, who condemned it as an attack on family values and social cohesion.The UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women has also called on Japan to revise the laws.The court\u2019s ruling on remarrying came after a woman who divorced her violent husband said the law had caused her mental anguish by preventing her from remarrying when she wanted to.The law bans women from remarrying until six months after divorce in case there is confusion over the paternity of children who are conceived shortly before or after the divorce.

Related: Japan 's 'quintuple dip' recession delivers a fresh blow to Abenomics Economics minister Akira Amari said a lack of workers available for public works projects worth billions of pounds restricted the government\u2019s ability to bolster the economy.Amari urged Japanese firms to use their record cash holdings to raise wages and increase capital spending to generate sustainable growth led by the private sector, instead of relying on government to always take the lead. He added that Tokyo was not considering a fresh stimulus.The plea for big business to support the recovery came as official data on Monday showed Japan\u2019s economy shrank by an annualised 0.8% in July to September after a deeper than previously estimated 0.7% contraction in the previous three months, providing the two consecutive quarters of declines needed to mark a recession. Analysts said labour shortages were a significant feature of an ageing population in a country that had put severe restrictions on immigration. But the government maintained its cautiously upbeat outlook, saying that despite a downturn in national income during the summer and autumn, an improved outlook for jobs and wages would mean a return to growth later in the year. \u201cWhile there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of the various [stimulus] steps taken so far,\u201d Amari said. He blamed a big reduction in stock levels for the dip in the third quarter and excluding this effect, said the economy expanded by an annualised 1.4%. Structural reform to support business investment is the third arrow in the country\u2019s recovery plan, dubbed Abenomics after the prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe.Izumi Devalier, an economist at HSBC, was also upbeat about the prospects for the economy, saying there were \u201cpositive trends that reflect the economy\u2019s continued progress in exiting deflation\u201d.\u201cPrivate consumption rebounded strongly on the back of improved real labour income. Meanwhile, nominal GDP continues to rise on the back of firm domestic price pressures and a better terms of trade,\u201d she added. \u201cThe bad news is that corporates are not yet convinced that the reflationary trend is here to stay, keeping capital expenditure weak. But this issue cannot be addressed through short-term stimulus alone.\u201d Japan has been stuck in a deflationary economic slump since a property and banking crash in the early 1990s. Under Abe\u2019s reforms, the government has increased its spending to regularly run a budget deficit of about 10%. This has been matched by aggressive action by the Bank of Japan to drive down borrowing costs to business and households with extra quantitative easing. But structural reforms have proved more difficult to implement and business investment has lagged.The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell in November to its lowest reading since April 2013.

Designated a Unesco world heritage site in 1993, the island has long been revered by the Japanese as one of the country\u2019s natural wonders, but it is only in recent years that foreign visitors have started to discover Yakushima\u2019s secrets.This small, round island has an incredibly mountainous interior, but at only 17 miles wide, it is possible to see all of the main sights and get a good taste of island life in just a few days. Miyanoura-dake (1,935m) is one of Japan\u2019s famous One Hundred Mountains, and is the country\u2019s most southerly point where snow can be found in winter. But Yakushima is best known for the extensive and hauntingly beautiful forests that cover most of the island, home to Japanese cedar trees (known as Yakusugi), some of which are thousands of years old. Walking through these moody, temperate rainforests, full of fairytale-like trees with twisted moss-covered roots, it is no surprise to learn that the island was the inspiration for acclaimed Studio Ghibli animation Princess Mononoke, directed by Hayao Miyazaki.The extremely wet climate means crystal-clear rivers tumble down from the high peaks, resulting in spectacular waterfalls, which carve their way through the granite bedrock. Lavish green, dense foliage provides the perfect home for the Yakushima macaque and the Yaku deer, both of which are smaller than their mainland counterparts but less timid, so can easily be spotted foraging near roadsides and along hiking trails. In the summer months, endangered loggerhead turtles make their nests on Yakushima\u2019s beaches, while tropical fish and corals can be found in the shallow and warm coastal waters. Geothermal hot springs (onsen) are everywhere, as they are in most of Japan, and some of the island\u2019s best are right on the beach.The two main points of entry are the tiny port towns of Miyanoura and Anbo, where daily ferries from Kagoshima put in. Be sure to bring plenty of cash from the mainland as ATMs are almost non-existent and few places accept cards. A road loops around the entire island, although the western stretch is too narrow and remote for the (limited) bus service, so a rental car is the best way to get around.Outdoor activities are high on the agenda for most visitors to Yakushima, and the steep mountains and pristine forests attract hikers from all over Japan, with trails to suit all abilities. Yakusugi Land, a nature park, (two buses a day from Anbo, ticket \u00a34) is home to many impressive old cedars, and has a number of easy hikes (ranging from 30 minutes to three hours), which afford close-up views of these relics.Further north, Shiratani Unsuikyo (35 minutes from Miyanoura by bus, ticket \u00a33) is a world of mossy-green woods and babbling streams that inspired Miyazaki\u2019s animated masterpiece. The well-marked paths lead to a number of ancient, individually named cedars. For the more adventurous, this area marks the beginning (or end) of a gruelling three-day traverse across the island\u2019s interior, passing landmarks, such as Wilson\u2019s Stump (the hollow remains of a long-felled giant cedar) and the oddly-shaped granite outcrops that characterise the high mountain tops. There are a number of huts to stay in, for free, but you need to bring your own sleeping bag and cooking equipment as accommodation is extremely basic (and cold at night).For those who love soaking in hot springs, the unique Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen on the south coast is a must. It\u2019s right on the rocky shoreline and so can only be accessed twice a day, when the tide is low.

Just down the road is Yudomari Onsen, which has a bamboo divider to separate the sexes and, for those who can\u2019t stand the heat, the water here is a pleasant 38C.In summer, loggerhead turtles return to the place they were born some 30 years earlier to lay eggs on the beach. For night-time turtle watching with a local guide, make a reservation at the sea turtle museum (umigame-kan.org).There are exceptionally good snorkelling and sea-kayaking spots all around the island. As the rainiest place in Japan, waterfalls are ubiquitous and the most spectacular is the west coast\u2019s 88m-high Ooko-no-taki, just a short walk from the main road.The newly-opened Guesthouse Yakushima (from \u00a316pp for a dorm bed) is in a secluded spot on the south coast, close to the impressive Senpiro Waterfall and Toroki Falls (the only waterfall in Japan that flows directly into the sea). The rooms are clean, done in western and Japanese-tatami styles, and the friendly owner speaks good English.Cottage Morinokokage (from \u00a327pp) is conveniently near Anbo port and has helpful English-speaking owners. A range of cosy, pine-scented self-catering cottages offer splendid mountain views. Request the belly-filling barbecue set (for an extra \u00a316) to grill meat and vegetables under the twinkling lights of your veranda, whatever the weather.Soyotei (from \u00a376pp) is a beautiful, traditional family-run guesthouse on the less-visited north-west coast, close to one of the best beaches on the island which is a prime turtle-nesting site. Enjoy freshly caught seafood and local produce, tatami rooms with ocean views and relax in the adjoining hot spring. English is limited but the owners are attentive, and the price includes an evening meal and breakfast.JR Hotel Yakushima (doubles from \u00a3210) is the high-end option. Perched above the sea on the southern coast, the sunset views from the hotel\u2019s outdoor bath, great food and polite service are all exemplary, even by Japanese standards.There is no shortage of good food on Yakushima but, as with many out-of-the-way places in Japan, restaurants tend to close early. Seafood is the staple cuisine and is as fresh as it comes. Lean, locally sourced deer is the main meat option in any season, delicious grilled over charcoal, yakiniku-style. Should you crave fast food, there is a tiny Mos Burger in Anbo, surely the most rustic branch of this Japanese burger chain in the country. If visiting in the winter, keep your eyes peeled for small roadside stalls selling bags of ponkan and tankan, sweet and juicy varieties of oranges grown all over the island. Also, be sure to try the potent yet delicate local Mitake shochu, a distilled, sweet-potato relative of sake, best served on the rocks.For visitors fresh off the ferry, Shiosai (lunch sets from \u00a37, +81 997 42 2721) is a popular seafood restaurant just a short walk down the main street from Miyanoura port. The seasonal mackerel sashimi is a Yakushima speciality, and the fried flying fish (tobiuo) is another local favourite. Lunchtime sets are reasonably priced and typically offer a choice of sashimi or fried fish in a light tempura batter, both served with a small salad and miso soup. Popular with locals and tourists alike, an English menu is available.Rengaya in Anbo (sets from \u00a35, dinner from around \u00a316, +81 997 46 3439) is a lively establishment most well-known for its platters of deer meat and vegetables, which guests cook over a smoky grill in the centre of the table. After a long day in the mountains, stretch your legs out on the tatami mats (no chairs here) and wash everything down with a cold beer or refreshing chuhai (a carbonated alcoholic drink).On the main road in Anbo, Kamogawa (sets from \u00a35, +81 997 46 2101) is a cosy, family-run restaurant that offers satisfyingly large seafood sets at very reasonable prices.The Toppy hydrofoil takes about two hours from Kagoshima to Anbo (\u00a348 one-way) and the slower Yaku 2 ferry goes to Miyanoura once a day (\u00a327 one-way).

Related: Sylvie Guillem: 'I don't want to think about my last show \u2013 I just want to live it' Guillem first announced her plan to retire in 2014, three decades after she was made the youngest ever \u00e9toile \u2013 or top-ranking dancer \u2013 at the Paris Opera ballet as a 19-year-old. The young gymnast turned dancer was famously nurtured by Rudolf Nureyev but went on to forge her own remarkable career in classical ballet and, latterly, contemporary dance.She joined the Royal Ballet as principal guest artist in 1989 after dancing opposite Nureyev in his 50th birthday performance of Giselle. In London she earned the nickname \u201cMademoiselle Non\u201d due to the number of roles she turned down, but wherever she travelled in the world, Guillem\u2019s performances were a sellout.\u201cI just feel honoured to have been born in the same era as such a great artist,\u201d said Andi Matsui, a Japanese woman seeing the dancer live for the third time.Many in the audience were long-term fans. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her probably 100 times, and have travelled overseas to watch her,\u201d said Yuka Koike. \u201cAs always she was perfect. But for me, today was extremely emotional. From now, I\u2019m going to have to find a new dancer to follow.\u201dThat sadness, however, was tinged with a sense of the inevitable. All respected Guillem\u2019s decision to hang up her shoes. \u201cIt\u2019s natural for a dancer to stop, and she decided on her own terms when to finish,\u201d said Bj\u00f6rn Neumann, a German living in Japan. \u201cIt\u2019s better that she stopped before her performances started getting worse.\u201dHe, however, was not as enthused with her final performance. \u201cIt was good, but I am not really a fan of these \u2018best of\u2019 performances. I preferred Two and Dreamtime to Bol\u00e9ro at the end. I\u2019m more into contemporary dance.\u201dDaisuke Satogami, from T\u014dhoku, said the performance \u201creally struck me in the heart. I saw her perform Bol\u00e9ro in T\u014dhoku in the October after the 2011 tsunami. I wanted to offer her so much thanks for that, for being pure enough of heart to perform up there at such a time.\u201d Related: Sylvie Guillem: \u2018You dance, and there is always an answer\u2019 Guillem was awarded the prestigious Praemium Imperiale arts prize in Japan in September for her contribution to theatre. The award includes a 15m yen (\u00a384,000) cash reward. \u201cGuillem\u2019s brilliance lies in her ability to combine physical excellence with a passionate honesty and a desire to explore what can be achieved through the medium of dance,\u201d the award body said.Before finishing for good, Guillem will perform one last time for a live Japanese TV broadcast of Bol\u00e9ro on Thursday to see in the new year. Yokohama\u2019s Kanagawa Kenmin hall may seem an unusual location for the dancer\u2019s final show, compared with somewhere in the capital, Tokyo, or Japan\u2019s cultural heart, Kyoto. But Kenichi Nagai, the director of the foundation that runs the venue, said Guillem had wanted to perform there one last time.\u201cIt\u2019s our 40th anniversary this year, and in our time we have seen a lot of history-making performances at the hall,\u201d Nagai said. \u201cWe did not have the space to fit in a performance by her, but then the organisers of the tour contacted us and offered to put on a show on either 30 or 31 December.

Tsuda, 63, was the first inmate to be executed following a conviction by a new system introduced in 2009 to give citizen jurors a role in sentencing, along with a panel of judges.Campaigners described the executions as \u201ca cruel form of punishment\u201d. Roseann Rife, East Asia research director at Amnesty International, said: \u201cThe Japanese authorities\u2019 willingness to put people to death is chilling and must end now before more lives are lost. The death penalty is not justice or an answer to tackling crime, it is a cruel form of punishment that flies in the face of respect for life.\u201cJapan should immediately introduce an official moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolition of the death penalty.\u201dSome campaigners hoped lay judges would be more reluctant to convict defendants accused of crimes that carry the death penalty - particularly those who claim they were forced to confess - but the number of accused to have been sentenced to death under the system now stands at 26.The justice minister, Mitsuhide Iwaki, told reporters that the lay judges had arrived at a \u201cvery grave\u201d judgement after lengthy deliberations.The second hanged man, Kazuyuki Wakabayashi, 39, had been convicted of the murder of a 52-year-old woman and her daughter in 2006. He was sentenced to death by judges.Japan has resisted international pressure to abolish the death penalty, notably from the UN and the European Union. Public support for capital punishment has remained strong since Aum Supreme Truth, a doomsday cult, killed 13 people and injured thousands of others in a sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.Japan and the US are the only two advanced industrial nations that retain the death penalty. Last year, only 22 countries carried out executions, and as of November this year, 140 countries had abolished capital punishment in law or in practice, according to Amnesty.\u201cJapan\u2019s continued use of the death penalty makes it stand out for all the wrong reasons \u2013 across the world, and increasingly also in the East Asia region,\u201d Rife said.Japan\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d executions have been condemned as particularly cruel. Typically, prisoners are kept in solitary confinement for years and given only a few hours\u2019 notice before being led to the gallows. Their families and lawyers are usually notified about the execution only after it has taken place.Amnesty said that several prisoners with mental and intellectual disabilities are known to have been executed or remain on death row.Doubts have also been raised over the safety of death penalty convictions in Japan. Iwao Hakamada, who had spent more than 45 years on death row, was freed last year after a court ordered a retrial in his murder case, amid suggestions that police investigators fabricated evidence against him.Before Friday\u2019s executions Japan had 128 inmates on death row, local media said.", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Capital punishment"], "title": "Japan executes first man convicted by citizen judges"},{"date": "2015-12-16T09:31:40Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan\u2019s supreme court has ruled that a 19th-century law forcing married couples to use the same surname \u2013 almost always that of the husband \u2013 does not violate the constitution.The court\u2019s ruling on Wednesday will be seen as a setback for women\u2019s rights in Japan, just as the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pushes for a greater role for women in the workplace to boost economic growth. Related: Japanese women in court fight to keep their surnames after marriage In a minor victory, however, the country\u2019s top court said that a second legal provision preventing women from remarrying for six months after they divorce violates the constitution\u2019s commitment to gender equality. But the court said that a remarriage ban on women of up to 100 days was reasonable, according to Kyodo News.The same-name ruling came in response to a lawsuit by five women who argued the requirement, as stipulated in the 1896 civil code, violates married couples\u2019 civil rights.While the law does not stipulate which name married couples should adopt, in practice women take their husband\u2019s name in 96% of cases \u2013 a reflection, critics, say of Japan\u2019s male-dominated society.One of the plaintiffs, Kaori Oguni, said before the ruling: \u201cBy losing your surname \u2026 you\u2019re being made light of, you\u2019re not respected \u2026 It\u2019s as if part of your self vanishes.\u201dOguni and four other women launched their legal challenge in 2011, seeking damages of 6m yen (\u00a333,000) for the emotional distress and practical inconvenience of having to take their husband\u2019s name.The attempt to have the law deemed unconstitutional encountered opposition from conservative politicians and commentators, who argued that allowing couples to have different surnames would damage the traditional family unit.The law reflects the traditional view that marriages in Japan are unions between families, not individuals. During the Meiji era (1868-1912), when the law was introduced, it was common for a woman to leave her family to become part of her husband\u2019s family.\u201cNames are the best way to bind families,\u201d Masaomi Takanori, a constitutional scholar, told NHK public television in the run-up to the verdict. \u201cAllowing different surnames risks destroying social stability, the maintenance of public order and the basis for social welfare.\u201dIn practice, many women continue to use their maiden names at work and their legal, married surname in official documents. They include the internal affairs minister, Sanae Takaichi.Oguni said: \u201cIf changing surnames is so easy, why don\u2019t more men do it? The system is one that says, basically, if you\u2019re not willing to change, you shouldn\u2019t be getting married.\u201dThe issue has divided public opinion. A poll by the liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper found that 52% of respondents believed couples should have the right to choose, while 34% opposed the move. If given the option, more than 70% said they would adopt a single family name.Wednesday\u2019s decision means that the only option open to couples who wish to use separate surnames is not to register their marriages. People in common-law marriages, however, encounter complications in inheritance and parental rights.While it is not directly related to the name issue, the plaintiffs were hoping that Abe\u2019s quest to raise the profile of women in the workplace would help their cause.Japan is thought to be one of only a few industrialised countries where it is illegal for married couples to have different surnames.A justice ministry panel recommended in 1996 that the same-name rule be abolished and that the waiting time for remarriage be cut to 100 days, but the change met fierce opposition from conservative MPs, who condemned it as an attack on family values and social cohesion.The UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women has also called on Japan to revise the laws.The court\u2019s ruling on remarrying came after a woman who divorced her violent husband said the law had caused her mental anguish by preventing her from remarrying when she wanted to.The law bans women from remarrying until six months after divorce in case there is confusion over the paternity of children who are conceived shortly before or after the divorce.

They are expected to speed up the formation of a maritime and aerial communication mechanism to prevent an accidental collision near the islands from quickly escalating into war.At the same time, Japan has stepped up its defence readiness amid China\u2019s military buildup and its frequent patrols near the disputed islands, which the Chinese call Diaoyu. Only last week, two Chinese coastguard vessels sailed briefly into Japanese territorial waters around the islands, the 33rd time they have done so this year.Japan\u2019s increasing sense of caution over Chinese military activity is being reflected in higher defence spending and strategic a shift away from its northern maritime border with Russia to its long and porous southern reaches.The defence ministry is seeking a record 5.09tn yen (\u00a327bn) in next year\u2019s budget, including money for longer-range anti-ship missiles, Global Hawk drones and Osprey tilt rotor aircraft.\u2022 The picture caption was amended on 22 December 2015.

Related: Japan 's 'quintuple dip' recession delivers a fresh blow to Abenomics Economics minister Akira Amari said a lack of workers available for public works projects worth billions of pounds restricted the government\u2019s ability to bolster the economy.Amari urged Japanese firms to use their record cash holdings to raise wages and increase capital spending to generate sustainable growth led by the private sector, instead of relying on government to always take the lead. He added that Tokyo was not considering a fresh stimulus.The plea for big business to support the recovery came as official data on Monday showed Japan\u2019s economy shrank by an annualised 0.8% in July to September after a deeper than previously estimated 0.7% contraction in the previous three months, providing the two consecutive quarters of declines needed to mark a recession. Analysts said labour shortages were a significant feature of an ageing population in a country that had put severe restrictions on immigration. But the government maintained its cautiously upbeat outlook, saying that despite a downturn in national income during the summer and autumn, an improved outlook for jobs and wages would mean a return to growth later in the year. \u201cWhile there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of the various [stimulus] steps taken so far,\u201d Amari said. He blamed a big reduction in stock levels for the dip in the third quarter and excluding this effect, said the economy expanded by an annualised 1.4%. Structural reform to support business investment is the third arrow in the country\u2019s recovery plan, dubbed Abenomics after the prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe.Izumi Devalier, an economist at HSBC, was also upbeat about the prospects for the economy, saying there were \u201cpositive trends that reflect the economy\u2019s continued progress in exiting deflation\u201d.\u201cPrivate consumption rebounded strongly on the back of improved real labour income. Meanwhile, nominal GDP continues to rise on the back of firm domestic price pressures and a better terms of trade,\u201d she added. \u201cThe bad news is that corporates are not yet convinced that the reflationary trend is here to stay, keeping capital expenditure weak. But this issue cannot be addressed through short-term stimulus alone.\u201d Japan has been stuck in a deflationary economic slump since a property and banking crash in the early 1990s. Under Abe\u2019s reforms, the government has increased its spending to regularly run a budget deficit of about 10%. This has been matched by aggressive action by the Bank of Japan to drive down borrowing costs to business and households with extra quantitative easing. But structural reforms have proved more difficult to implement and business investment has lagged.The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell in November to its lowest reading since April 2013.

Putin will not be among the leaders attending the G7 summit in Japan next year after Russia was banished from the group following its annexation of Crimea last year.But Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said Tokyo would continue to explore the possibility of a visit this year, as agreed between Putin and Abe at last November\u2019s Apec summit in Beijing. Japan and Russia have failed to make progress on the sovereignty dispute despite numerous rounds of talks. Japan insists that all four islands should be returned, while Russia cites a 1956 agreement under which it would return the two smaller, less developed islands, but only after the countries sign a peace treaty.Located in the northwest Pacific near the northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaido, the Northern Territories are surrounded by rich fishing grounds, mineral deposits and possibly offshore oil and gas reserves. Many of the 17,000 Japanese living there at the end of the war were forced to leave. The islands are now inhabited by about 14,000 Russians.Japan accused Russia of damaging the prospects for a breakthrough after Moscow said in June that it would accelerate building work on civilian and military infrastructure on the islands. Medvedev said the government would spend 70 billion roubles (\u00a3730m) on developing the territories over the next decade.Japan is embroiled in territorial rows on three fronts: with Russia over the Northern Territories, with China over the Senkaku islands, and with South Korea over the Takeshima islands.", "tags": ["Japan", "Russia", "Second world war", "Asia Pacific", "Europe", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Vladimir Putin"], "title": "Vladimir Putin's visit to Japan postponed indefinitely"},{"date": "2015-10-14T05:30:01Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Nestling in the warm, sub-tropical waters 37 miles south of Kyushu, Japan\u2019s third largest island, the towering mountains and ancient forests of Yakushima make it a secluded and largely unspoilt paradise, which feels a world away from the hustle and bustle of Japan\u2019s megacities. Designated a Unesco world heritage site in 1993, the island has long been revered by the Japanese as one of the country\u2019s natural wonders, but it is only in recent years that foreign visitors have started to discover Yakushima\u2019s secrets.This small, round island has an incredibly mountainous interior, but at only 17 miles wide, it is possible to see all of the main sights and get a good taste of island life in just a few days. Miyanoura-dake (1,935m) is one of Japan\u2019s famous One Hundred Mountains, and is the country\u2019s most southerly point where snow can be found in winter. But Yakushima is best known for the extensive and hauntingly beautiful forests that cover most of the island, home to Japanese cedar trees (known as Yakusugi), some of which are thousands of years old. Walking through these moody, temperate rainforests, full of fairytale-like trees with twisted moss-covered roots, it is no surprise to learn that the island was the inspiration for acclaimed Studio Ghibli animation Princess Mononoke, directed by Hayao Miyazaki.The extremely wet climate means crystal-clear rivers tumble down from the high peaks, resulting in spectacular waterfalls, which carve their way through the granite bedrock. Lavish green, dense foliage provides the perfect home for the Yakushima macaque and the Yaku deer, both of which are smaller than their mainland counterparts but less timid, so can easily be spotted foraging near roadsides and along hiking trails. In the summer months, endangered loggerhead turtles make their nests on Yakushima\u2019s beaches, while tropical fish and corals can be found in the shallow and warm coastal waters. Geothermal hot springs (onsen) are everywhere, as they are in most of Japan, and some of the island\u2019s best are right on the beach.The two main points of entry are the tiny port towns of Miyanoura and Anbo, where daily ferries from Kagoshima put in. Be sure to bring plenty of cash from the mainland as ATMs are almost non-existent and few places accept cards. A road loops around the entire island, although the western stretch is too narrow and remote for the (limited) bus service, so a rental car is the best way to get around.Outdoor activities are high on the agenda for most visitors to Yakushima, and the steep mountains and pristine forests attract hikers from all over Japan, with trails to suit all abilities. Yakusugi Land, a nature park, (two buses a day from Anbo, ticket \u00a34) is home to many impressive old cedars, and has a number of easy hikes (ranging from 30 minutes to three hours), which afford close-up views of these relics.Further north, Shiratani Unsuikyo (35 minutes from Miyanoura by bus, ticket \u00a33) is a world of mossy-green woods and babbling streams that inspired Miyazaki\u2019s animated masterpiece. The well-marked paths lead to a number of ancient, individually named cedars. For the more adventurous, this area marks the beginning (or end) of a gruelling three-day traverse across the island\u2019s interior, passing landmarks, such as Wilson\u2019s Stump (the hollow remains of a long-felled giant cedar) and the oddly-shaped granite outcrops that characterise the high mountain tops. There are a number of huts to stay in, for free, but you need to bring your own sleeping bag and cooking equipment as accommodation is extremely basic (and cold at night).For those who love soaking in hot springs, the unique Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen on the south coast is a must. It\u2019s right on the rocky shoreline and so can only be accessed twice a day, when the tide is low. Pop \u00a5100 (50p) into the honesty box, strip down (a small towel can be used to protect your modesty) and be sure to follow local etiquette by rinsing yourself before entering the pools. Just down the road is Yudomari Onsen, which has a bamboo divider to separate the sexes and, for those who can\u2019t stand the heat, the water here is a pleasant 38C.In summer, loggerhead turtles return to the place they were born some 30 years earlier to lay eggs on the beach. For night-time turtle watching with a local guide, make a reservation at the sea turtle museum (umigame-kan.org).There are exceptionally good snorkelling and sea-kayaking spots all around the island. As the rainiest place in Japan, waterfalls are ubiquitous and the most spectacular is the west coast\u2019s 88m-high Ooko-no-taki, just a short walk from the main road.The newly-opened Guesthouse Yakushima (from \u00a316pp for a dorm bed) is in a secluded spot on the south coast, close to the impressive Senpiro Waterfall and Toroki Falls (the only waterfall in Japan that flows directly into the sea). The rooms are clean, done in western and Japanese-tatami styles, and the friendly owner speaks good English.Cottage Morinokokage (from \u00a327pp) is conveniently near Anbo port and has helpful English-speaking owners. A range of cosy, pine-scented self-catering cottages offer splendid mountain views. Request the belly-filling barbecue set (for an extra \u00a316) to grill meat and vegetables under the twinkling lights of your veranda, whatever the weather.Soyotei (from \u00a376pp) is a beautiful, traditional family-run guesthouse on the less-visited north-west coast, close to one of the best beaches on the island which is a prime turtle-nesting site. Enjoy freshly caught seafood and local produce, tatami rooms with ocean views and relax in the adjoining hot spring. English is limited but the owners are attentive, and the price includes an evening meal and breakfast.JR Hotel Yakushima (doubles from \u00a3210) is the high-end option. Perched above the sea on the southern coast, the sunset views from the hotel\u2019s outdoor bath, great food and polite service are all exemplary, even by Japanese standards.There is no shortage of good food on Yakushima but, as with many out-of-the-way places in Japan, restaurants tend to close early. Seafood is the staple cuisine and is as fresh as it comes. Lean, locally sourced deer is the main meat option in any season, delicious grilled over charcoal, yakiniku-style. Should you crave fast food, there is a tiny Mos Burger in Anbo, surely the most rustic branch of this Japanese burger chain in the country. If visiting in the winter, keep your eyes peeled for small roadside stalls selling bags of ponkan and tankan, sweet and juicy varieties of oranges grown all over the island. Also, be sure to try the potent yet delicate local Mitake shochu, a distilled, sweet-potato relative of sake, best served on the rocks.For visitors fresh off the ferry, Shiosai (lunch sets from \u00a37, +81 997 42 2721) is a popular seafood restaurant just a short walk down the main street from Miyanoura port. The seasonal mackerel sashimi is a Yakushima speciality, and the fried flying fish (tobiuo) is another local favourite. Lunchtime sets are reasonably priced and typically offer a choice of sashimi or fried fish in a light tempura batter, both served with a small salad and miso soup. Popular with locals and tourists alike, an English menu is available.Rengaya in Anbo (sets from \u00a35, dinner from around \u00a316, +81 997 46 3439) is a lively establishment most well-known for its platters of deer meat and vegetables, which guests cook over a smoky grill in the centre of the table. After a long day in the mountains, stretch your legs out on the tatami mats (no chairs here) and wash everything down with a cold beer or refreshing chuhai (a carbonated alcoholic drink).On the main road in Anbo, Kamogawa (sets from \u00a35, +81 997 46 2101) is a cosy, family-run restaurant that offers satisfyingly large seafood sets at very reasonable prices.The Toppy hydrofoil takes about two hours from Kagoshima to Anbo (\u00a348 one-way) and the slower Yaku 2 ferry goes to Miyanoura once a day (\u00a327 one-way).

Related: Sylvie Guillem: 'I don't want to think about my last show \u2013 I just want to live it' Guillem first announced her plan to retire in 2014, three decades after she was made the youngest ever \u00e9toile \u2013 or top-ranking dancer \u2013 at the Paris Opera ballet as a 19-year-old. The young gymnast turned dancer was famously nurtured by Rudolf Nureyev but went on to forge her own remarkable career in classical ballet and, latterly, contemporary dance.She joined the Royal Ballet as principal guest artist in 1989 after dancing opposite Nureyev in his 50th birthday performance of Giselle. In London she earned the nickname \u201cMademoiselle Non\u201d due to the number of roles she turned down, but wherever she travelled in the world, Guillem\u2019s performances were a sellout.\u201cI just feel honoured to have been born in the same era as such a great artist,\u201d said Andi Matsui, a Japanese woman seeing the dancer live for the third time.Many in the audience were long-term fans. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her probably 100 times, and have travelled overseas to watch her,\u201d said Yuka Koike. \u201cAs always she was perfect. But for me, today was extremely emotional. From now, I\u2019m going to have to find a new dancer to follow.\u201dThat sadness, however, was tinged with a sense of the inevitable.

I saw her perform Bol\u00e9ro in T\u014dhoku in the October after the 2011 tsunami. I wanted to offer her so much thanks for that, for being pure enough of heart to perform up there at such a time.\u201d Related: Sylvie Guillem: \u2018You dance, and there is always an answer\u2019 Guillem was awarded the prestigious Praemium Imperiale arts prize in Japan in September for her contribution to theatre. The award includes a 15m yen (\u00a384,000) cash reward. \u201cGuillem\u2019s brilliance lies in her ability to combine physical excellence with a passionate honesty and a desire to explore what can be achieved through the medium of dance,\u201d the award body said.Before finishing for good, Guillem will perform one last time for a live Japanese TV broadcast of Bol\u00e9ro on Thursday to see in the new year. Yokohama\u2019s Kanagawa Kenmin hall may seem an unusual location for the dancer\u2019s final show, compared with somewhere in the capital, Tokyo, or Japan\u2019s cultural heart, Kyoto. But Kenichi Nagai, the director of the foundation that runs the venue, said Guillem had wanted to perform there one last time.\u201cIt\u2019s our 40th anniversary this year, and in our time we have seen a lot of history-making performances at the hall,\u201d Nagai said. \u201cWe did not have the space to fit in a performance by her, but then the organisers of the tour contacted us and offered to put on a show on either 30 or 31 December.

Tsuda, 63, was the first inmate to be executed following a conviction by a new system introduced in 2009 to give citizen jurors a role in sentencing, along with a panel of judges.Campaigners described the executions as \u201ca cruel form of punishment\u201d. Roseann Rife, East Asia research director at Amnesty International, said: \u201cThe Japanese authorities\u2019 willingness to put people to death is chilling and must end now before more lives are lost. The death penalty is not justice or an answer to tackling crime, it is a cruel form of punishment that flies in the face of respect for life.\u201cJapan should immediately introduce an official moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolition of the death penalty.\u201dSome campaigners hoped lay judges would be more reluctant to convict defendants accused of crimes that carry the death penalty - particularly those who claim they were forced to confess - but the number of accused to have been sentenced to death under the system now stands at 26.The justice minister, Mitsuhide Iwaki, told reporters that the lay judges had arrived at a \u201cvery grave\u201d judgement after lengthy deliberations.The second hanged man, Kazuyuki Wakabayashi, 39, had been convicted of the murder of a 52-year-old woman and her daughter in 2006. He was sentenced to death by judges.Japan has resisted international pressure to abolish the death penalty, notably from the UN and the European Union. Public support for capital punishment has remained strong since Aum Supreme Truth, a doomsday cult, killed 13 people and injured thousands of others in a sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.Japan and the US are the only two advanced industrial nations that retain the death penalty. Last year, only 22 countries carried out executions, and as of November this year, 140 countries had abolished capital punishment in law or in practice, according to Amnesty.\u201cJapan\u2019s continued use of the death penalty makes it stand out for all the wrong reasons \u2013 across the world, and increasingly also in the East Asia region,\u201d Rife said.Japan\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d executions have been condemned as particularly cruel. Typically, prisoners are kept in solitary confinement for years and given only a few hours\u2019 notice before being led to the gallows. Their families and lawyers are usually notified about the execution only after it has taken place.Amnesty said that several prisoners with mental and intellectual disabilities are known to have been executed or remain on death row.Doubts have also been raised over the safety of death penalty convictions in Japan. Iwao Hakamada, who had spent more than 45 years on death row, was freed last year after a court ordered a retrial in his murder case, amid suggestions that police investigators fabricated evidence against him.Before Friday\u2019s executions Japan had 128 inmates on death row, local media said.", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Capital punishment"], "title": "Japan executes first man convicted by citizen judges"},{"date": "2015-12-16T09:31:40Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan\u2019s supreme court has ruled that a 19th-century law forcing married couples to use the same surname \u2013 almost always that of the husband \u2013 does not violate the constitution.The court\u2019s ruling on Wednesday will be seen as a setback for women\u2019s rights in Japan, just as the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pushes for a greater role for women in the workplace to boost economic growth. Related: Japanese women in court fight to keep their surnames after marriage In a minor victory, however, the country\u2019s top court said that a second legal provision preventing women from remarrying for six months after they divorce violates the constitution\u2019s commitment to gender equality. But the court said that a remarriage ban on women of up to 100 days was reasonable, according to Kyodo News.The same-name ruling came in response to a lawsuit by five women who argued the requirement, as stipulated in the 1896 civil code, violates married couples\u2019 civil rights.While the law does not stipulate which name married couples should adopt, in practice women take their husband\u2019s name in 96% of cases \u2013 a reflection, critics, say of Japan\u2019s male-dominated society.One of the plaintiffs, Kaori Oguni, said before the ruling: \u201cBy losing your surname \u2026 you\u2019re being made light of, you\u2019re not respected \u2026 It\u2019s as if part of your self vanishes.\u201dOguni and four other women launched their legal challenge in 2011, seeking damages of 6m yen (\u00a333,000) for the emotional distress and practical inconvenience of having to take their husband\u2019s name.The attempt to have the law deemed unconstitutional encountered opposition from conservative politicians and commentators, who argued that allowing couples to have different surnames would damage the traditional family unit.The law reflects the traditional view that marriages in Japan are unions between families, not individuals. During the Meiji era (1868-1912), when the law was introduced, it was common for a woman to leave her family to become part of her husband\u2019s family.\u201cNames are the best way to bind families,\u201d Masaomi Takanori, a constitutional scholar, told NHK public television in the run-up to the verdict. \u201cAllowing different surnames risks destroying social stability, the maintenance of public order and the basis for social welfare.\u201dIn practice, many women continue to use their maiden names at work and their legal, married surname in official documents. They include the internal affairs minister, Sanae Takaichi.Oguni said: \u201cIf changing surnames is so easy, why don\u2019t more men do it? The system is one that says, basically, if you\u2019re not willing to change, you shouldn\u2019t be getting married.\u201dThe issue has divided public opinion. A poll by the liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper found that 52% of respondents believed couples should have the right to choose, while 34% opposed the move. If given the option, more than 70% said they would adopt a single family name.Wednesday\u2019s decision means that the only option open to couples who wish to use separate surnames is not to register their marriages. People in common-law marriages, however, encounter complications in inheritance and parental rights.While it is not directly related to the name issue, the plaintiffs were hoping that Abe\u2019s quest to raise the profile of women in the workplace would help their cause.Japan is thought to be one of only a few industrialised countries where it is illegal for married couples to have different surnames.A justice ministry panel recommended in 1996 that the same-name rule be abolished and that the waiting time for remarriage be cut to 100 days, but the change met fierce opposition from conservative MPs, who condemned it as an attack on family values and social cohesion.The UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women has also called on Japan to revise the laws.The court\u2019s ruling on remarrying came after a woman who divorced her violent husband said the law had caused her mental anguish by preventing her from remarrying when she wanted to.The law bans women from remarrying until six months after divorce in case there is confusion over the paternity of children who are conceived shortly before or after the divorce.

They are expected to speed up the formation of a maritime and aerial communication mechanism to prevent an accidental collision near the islands from quickly escalating into war.At the same time, Japan has stepped up its defence readiness amid China\u2019s military buildup and its frequent patrols near the disputed islands, which the Chinese call Diaoyu. Only last week, two Chinese coastguard vessels sailed briefly into Japanese territorial waters around the islands, the 33rd time they have done so this year.Japan\u2019s increasing sense of caution over Chinese military activity is being reflected in higher defence spending and strategic a shift away from its northern maritime border with Russia to its long and porous southern reaches.The defence ministry is seeking a record 5.09tn yen (\u00a327bn) in next year\u2019s budget, including money for longer-range anti-ship missiles, Global Hawk drones and Osprey tilt rotor aircraft.\u2022 The picture caption was amended on 22 December 2015.

The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too.Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern.For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast.Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets.They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. Related: 'North Korean' boats carrying dead bodies wash ashore in Japan In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast.Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201dMost of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. Related: A life of luxury and adulation for Kim Jong-un impersonators With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants.In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind.But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths.Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance. If they had been found alive we would have done everything we could to help them.\u201dJiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, believes Kim sent out an order in the summer that more seafood should be provided to the army. \u201cThe problem is that the North Korean fishing industry is no longer run on socialist principles,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe fishermen realised that if they donated their catch to the military they would end up losing money, so they started allowing soldiers to go out and catch their own fish.\u201dThat meant bigger hauls, and allowed civilian fishermen to continue earning money for themselves and foreign currency for the regime under Kim\u2019s quasi-capitalist reforms.Ishimaru, who discussed the boat disappearances with contacts by phone in North Korea earlier this week, believes that large numbers of boats carrying soldiers who knew nothing about fishing or navigation left ports in North Korea soon after Kim\u2019s exhortation to increase catches.Typically small, with tiny engines and no GPS navigation instruments or VHF radios, the boats would easily have lost their way in a storm or a strong current and quickly run out of food and fuel.\u201cWhen Kim Jong-un issues an order no one can ignore it, even if he is asking them to do the impossible,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThat means inexperienced soldiers go out to sea, even in terrible conditions and with no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that they are soldiers, so they wear civilian clothes, which is why none of the bodies found in Japan was in uniform.\u201dIn Fukui, concern about the arrival of vessels from North Korea is mixed with sympathy for the people who met such wretched ends, in freezing seas many miles from home. \u201cI expect they were ordered to catch fish by the North Korean government, but of course no one there will take any responsibility for what happened to them,\u201d said Mitsumasa Sakashita, a 67-year-old fisherman in Fukui. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, because they were just like us: fishermen trying to make a living from the sea.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Fishing"], "title": "Mystery of Japan sea's ghost ships points to North Korea"},{"date": "2015-11-16T12:54:42Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan\u2019s recovery is being held back by a shortage of skilled labour, a leading minister has claimed, after the world\u2019s third-largest economy entered its fourth technical recession in five years. Related: Japan 's 'quintuple dip' recession delivers a fresh blow to Abenomics Economics minister Akira Amari said a lack of workers available for public works projects worth billions of pounds restricted the government\u2019s ability to bolster the economy.Amari urged Japanese firms to use their record cash holdings to raise wages and increase capital spending to generate sustainable growth led by the private sector, instead of relying on government to always take the lead. He added that Tokyo was not considering a fresh stimulus.The plea for big business to support the recovery came as official data on Monday showed Japan\u2019s economy shrank by an annualised 0.8% in July to September after a deeper than previously estimated 0.7% contraction in the previous three months, providing the two consecutive quarters of declines needed to mark a recession. Analysts said labour shortages were a significant feature of an ageing population in a country that had put severe restrictions on immigration. But the government maintained its cautiously upbeat outlook, saying that despite a downturn in national income during the summer and autumn, an improved outlook for jobs and wages would mean a return to growth later in the year. \u201cWhile there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of the various [stimulus] steps taken so far,\u201d Amari said. He blamed a big reduction in stock levels for the dip in the third quarter and excluding this effect, said the economy expanded by an annualised 1.4%. Structural reform to support business investment is the third arrow in the country\u2019s recovery plan, dubbed Abenomics after the prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe.Izumi Devalier, an economist at HSBC, was also upbeat about the prospects for the economy, saying there were \u201cpositive trends that reflect the economy\u2019s continued progress in exiting deflation\u201d.\u201cPrivate consumption rebounded strongly on the back of improved real labour income. Meanwhile, nominal GDP continues to rise on the back of firm domestic price pressures and a better terms of trade,\u201d she added. \u201cThe bad news is that corporates are not yet convinced that the reflationary trend is here to stay, keeping capital expenditure weak. But this issue cannot be addressed through short-term stimulus alone.\u201d Japan has been stuck in a deflationary economic slump since a property and banking crash in the early 1990s. Under Abe\u2019s reforms, the government has increased its spending to regularly run a budget deficit of about 10%. This has been matched by aggressive action by the Bank of Japan to drive down borrowing costs to business and households with extra quantitative easing. But structural reforms have proved more difficult to implement and business investment has lagged.The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell in November to its lowest reading since April 2013.

Designated a Unesco world heritage site in 1993, the island has long been revered by the Japanese as one of the country\u2019s natural wonders, but it is only in recent years that foreign visitors have started to discover Yakushima\u2019s secrets.This small, round island has an incredibly mountainous interior, but at only 17 miles wide, it is possible to see all of the main sights and get a good taste of island life in just a few days. Miyanoura-dake (1,935m) is one of Japan\u2019s famous One Hundred Mountains, and is the country\u2019s most southerly point where snow can be found in winter. But Yakushima is best known for the extensive and hauntingly beautiful forests that cover most of the island, home to Japanese cedar trees (known as Yakusugi), some of which are thousands of years old. Walking through these moody, temperate rainforests, full of fairytale-like trees with twisted moss-covered roots, it is no surprise to learn that the island was the inspiration for acclaimed Studio Ghibli animation Princess Mononoke, directed by Hayao Miyazaki.The extremely wet climate means crystal-clear rivers tumble down from the high peaks, resulting in spectacular waterfalls, which carve their way through the granite bedrock. Lavish green, dense foliage provides the perfect home for the Yakushima macaque and the Yaku deer, both of which are smaller than their mainland counterparts but less timid, so can easily be spotted foraging near roadsides and along hiking trails. In the summer months, endangered loggerhead turtles make their nests on Yakushima\u2019s beaches, while tropical fish and corals can be found in the shallow and warm coastal waters. Geothermal hot springs (onsen) are everywhere, as they are in most of Japan, and some of the island\u2019s best are right on the beach.The two main points of entry are the tiny port towns of Miyanoura and Anbo, where daily ferries from Kagoshima put in. Be sure to bring plenty of cash from the mainland as ATMs are almost non-existent and few places accept cards. A road loops around the entire island, although the western stretch is too narrow and remote for the (limited) bus service, so a rental car is the best way to get around.Outdoor activities are high on the agenda for most visitors to Yakushima, and the steep mountains and pristine forests attract hikers from all over Japan, with trails to suit all abilities. Yakusugi Land, a nature park, (two buses a day from Anbo, ticket \u00a34) is home to many impressive old cedars, and has a number of easy hikes (ranging from 30 minutes to three hours), which afford close-up views of these relics.Further north, Shiratani Unsuikyo (35 minutes from Miyanoura by bus, ticket \u00a33) is a world of mossy-green woods and babbling streams that inspired Miyazaki\u2019s animated masterpiece. The well-marked paths lead to a number of ancient, individually named cedars. For the more adventurous, this area marks the beginning (or end) of a gruelling three-day traverse across the island\u2019s interior, passing landmarks, such as Wilson\u2019s Stump (the hollow remains of a long-felled giant cedar) and the oddly-shaped granite outcrops that characterise the high mountain tops. There are a number of huts to stay in, for free, but you need to bring your own sleeping bag and cooking equipment as accommodation is extremely basic (and cold at night).For those who love soaking in hot springs, the unique Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen on the south coast is a must. It\u2019s right on the rocky shoreline and so can only be accessed twice a day, when the tide is low. Pop \u00a5100 (50p) into the honesty box, strip down (a small towel can be used to protect your modesty) and be sure to follow local etiquette by rinsing yourself before entering the pools. Just down the road is Yudomari Onsen, which has a bamboo divider to separate the sexes and, for those who can\u2019t stand the heat, the water here is a pleasant 38C.In summer, loggerhead turtles return to the place they were born some 30 years earlier to lay eggs on the beach. For night-time turtle watching with a local guide, make a reservation at the sea turtle museum (umigame-kan.org).There are exceptionally good snorkelling and sea-kayaking spots all around the island. As the rainiest place in Japan, waterfalls are ubiquitous and the most spectacular is the west coast\u2019s 88m-high Ooko-no-taki, just a short walk from the main road.The newly-opened Guesthouse Yakushima (from \u00a316pp for a dorm bed) is in a secluded spot on the south coast, close to the impressive Senpiro Waterfall and Toroki Falls (the only waterfall in Japan that flows directly into the sea). The rooms are clean, done in western and Japanese-tatami styles, and the friendly owner speaks good English.Cottage Morinokokage (from \u00a327pp) is conveniently near Anbo port and has helpful English-speaking owners. A range of cosy, pine-scented self-catering cottages offer splendid mountain views. Request the belly-filling barbecue set (for an extra \u00a316) to grill meat and vegetables under the twinkling lights of your veranda, whatever the weather.Soyotei (from \u00a376pp) is a beautiful, traditional family-run guesthouse on the less-visited north-west coast, close to one of the best beaches on the island which is a prime turtle-nesting site. Enjoy freshly caught seafood and local produce, tatami rooms with ocean views and relax in the adjoining hot spring. English is limited but the owners are attentive, and the price includes an evening meal and breakfast.JR Hotel Yakushima (doubles from \u00a3210) is the high-end option. Perched above the sea on the southern coast, the sunset views from the hotel\u2019s outdoor bath, great food and polite service are all exemplary, even by Japanese standards.There is no shortage of good food on Yakushima but, as with many out-of-the-way places in Japan, restaurants tend to close early. Seafood is the staple cuisine and is as fresh as it comes. Lean, locally sourced deer is the main meat option in any season, delicious grilled over charcoal, yakiniku-style. Should you crave fast food, there is a tiny Mos Burger in Anbo, surely the most rustic branch of this Japanese burger chain in the country. If visiting in the winter, keep your eyes peeled for small roadside stalls selling bags of ponkan and tankan, sweet and juicy varieties of oranges grown all over the island. Also, be sure to try the potent yet delicate local Mitake shochu, a distilled, sweet-potato relative of sake, best served on the rocks.For visitors fresh off the ferry, Shiosai (lunch sets from \u00a37, +81 997 42 2721) is a popular seafood restaurant just a short walk down the main street from Miyanoura port. The seasonal mackerel sashimi is a Yakushima speciality, and the fried flying fish (tobiuo) is another local favourite. Lunchtime sets are reasonably priced and typically offer a choice of sashimi or fried fish in a light tempura batter, both served with a small salad and miso soup. Popular with locals and tourists alike, an English menu is available.Rengaya in Anbo (sets from \u00a35, dinner from around \u00a316, +81 997 46 3439) is a lively establishment most well-known for its platters of deer meat and vegetables, which guests cook over a smoky grill in the centre of the table. After a long day in the mountains, stretch your legs out on the tatami mats (no chairs here) and wash everything down with a cold beer or refreshing chuhai (a carbonated alcoholic drink).On the main road in Anbo, Kamogawa (sets from \u00a35, +81 997 46 2101) is a cosy, family-run restaurant that offers satisfyingly large seafood sets at very reasonable prices.The Toppy hydrofoil takes about two hours from Kagoshima to Anbo (\u00a348 one-way) and the slower Yaku 2 ferry goes to Miyanoura once a day (\u00a327 one-way).

The first issue of Mr Babe \u2013 Japan\u2019s first magazine \u201cby chubby men, for chubby men\u201d \u2013 went on sale in October, aimed at a readership Kurashina believes has been ignored by the country\u2019s fashion and lifestyle industry.Featuring Jack Black on the cover and \u201cstocky\u201d amateur models inside, Kurashina\u2019s magazine offers tips on fashion and grooming, dating and, yes, diet and exercise.\u201cI kept asking myself why there were so few fashionable clothes for people like me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are plenty of clothes for slim men, and specialist shops for unusually tall men, but practically nothing for podgy men.\u201cYou could say that Japan is behind the times, but I think it\u2019s more accurate to say that clothes manufacturers here have simply never given bigger men a second thought. There is something wrong with the idea that you can only be cool and attractive if you\u2019re thin.\u201dAimed primarily at men in their 30s and 40s, the first issue of Mr Babe had sold over half of its 50,000 print run \u2013 considered a healthy number in Japan\u2019s declining magazine industry \u2013 within a few weeks of publication.While the country\u2019s publishing industry was quicker to respond to demand for fashion and lifestyle advice for \u201cplus-size\u201d women, with the 2013 launch of the magazine La Farfa, statistics show that, in fact, the obesity rate among Japanese women has been falling for the past decade.By contrast, a 2013 survey by the health and welfare ministry found that almost a third of Japanese men had a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or above, at which a person is considered overweight.\u201cJust imagine how many people that represents, and how many more men like that there will be in the future,\u201d said Kurashina.With Japan confronting long-term depopulation and a persistently low birthrate, he regards his magazine as more than just a novelty for a niche readership. By giving larger men the confidence to date \u2013 and perhaps to marry and start families \u2013 he believes he is on a mission to arrest Japan\u2019s looming demographic implosion.Kurashina is happy to describe himself as \u201cpocchari\u201d (chubby), but recoils at the uncharitable overtones of \u201cdebu\u201d, a Japanese word best translated as \u201cfatso\u201d. He said: \u201cDebu has lots of negative connotations. You\u2019ll find it in the magazine, but only in quotation marks. I prefer to think of our readers as stylish, larger men, not fat men.\u201dWhile it broaches the subject of overeating, Mr Babe is mercifully free of advice on weight loss. \u201cWe don\u2019t shy away from health issues, but we\u2019d never dream of telling people to lose weight,\u201d Kurashina said. \u201cIt\u2019s about enjoying life just as you are \u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to avoid exercise or not keep an eye on what you eat.\u201dKurashina believes Mr Babe is the first step towards redressing the balance in favour of men who are unfairly blamed for sagging around the middle as they approach middle age. \u201cWhen was the last time you saw a big guy modelling clothes for high street retailers? It\u2019s easy to come to the conclusion that we\u2019re being discriminated against.\u201cThe problem is that men in their 30s and 40s are busier at work than at other points in their career. They spend all day at work, they go drinking in the evening to relieve stress, and do the same again the next day. They don\u2019t have time to go to the gym ... it\u2019s no wonder they put on weight.\u201dThe second issue of Mr Babe will broach another subject that can turn clothes shopping expeditions into the stuff of nightmares: what to wear during the relentlessly hot and humid summer months.

Tsuda, 63, was the first inmate to be executed following a conviction by a new system introduced in 2009 to give citizen jurors a role in sentencing, along with a panel of judges.Campaigners described the executions as \u201ca cruel form of punishment\u201d. Roseann Rife, East Asia research director at Amnesty International, said: \u201cThe Japanese authorities\u2019 willingness to put people to death is chilling and must end now before more lives are lost. The death penalty is not justice or an answer to tackling crime, it is a cruel form of punishment that flies in the face of respect for life.\u201cJapan should immediately introduce an official moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolition of the death penalty.\u201dSome campaigners hoped lay judges would be more reluctant to convict defendants accused of crimes that carry the death penalty - particularly those who claim they were forced to confess - but the number of accused to have been sentenced to death under the system now stands at 26.The justice minister, Mitsuhide Iwaki, told reporters that the lay judges had arrived at a \u201cvery grave\u201d judgement after lengthy deliberations.The second hanged man, Kazuyuki Wakabayashi, 39, had been convicted of the murder of a 52-year-old woman and her daughter in 2006. He was sentenced to death by judges.Japan has resisted international pressure to abolish the death penalty, notably from the UN and the European Union. Public support for capital punishment has remained strong since Aum Supreme Truth, a doomsday cult, killed 13 people and injured thousands of others in a sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.Japan and the US are the only two advanced industrial nations that retain the death penalty. Last year, only 22 countries carried out executions, and as of November this year, 140 countries had abolished capital punishment in law or in practice, according to Amnesty.\u201cJapan\u2019s continued use of the death penalty makes it stand out for all the wrong reasons \u2013 across the world, and increasingly also in the East Asia region,\u201d Rife said.Japan\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d executions have been condemned as particularly cruel. Typically, prisoners are kept in solitary confinement for years and given only a few hours\u2019 notice before being led to the gallows. Their families and lawyers are usually notified about the execution only after it has taken place.Amnesty said that several prisoners with mental and intellectual disabilities are known to have been executed or remain on death row.Doubts have also been raised over the safety of death penalty convictions in Japan. Iwao Hakamada, who had spent more than 45 years on death row, was freed last year after a court ordered a retrial in his murder case, amid suggestions that police investigators fabricated evidence against him.Before Friday\u2019s executions Japan had 128 inmates on death row, local media said.", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Capital punishment"], "title": "Japan executes first man convicted by citizen judges"},{"date": "2015-12-16T09:31:40Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan\u2019s supreme court has ruled that a 19th-century law forcing married couples to use the same surname \u2013 almost always that of the husband \u2013 does not violate the constitution.The court\u2019s ruling on Wednesday will be seen as a setback for women\u2019s rights in Japan, just as the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pushes for a greater role for women in the workplace to boost economic growth. Related: Japanese women in court fight to keep their surnames after marriage In a minor victory, however, the country\u2019s top court said that a second legal provision preventing women from remarrying for six months after they divorce violates the constitution\u2019s commitment to gender equality. But the court said that a remarriage ban on women of up to 100 days was reasonable, according to Kyodo News.The same-name ruling came in response to a lawsuit by five women who argued the requirement, as stipulated in the 1896 civil code, violates married couples\u2019 civil rights.While the law does not stipulate which name married couples should adopt, in practice women take their husband\u2019s name in 96% of cases \u2013 a reflection, critics, say of Japan\u2019s male-dominated society.One of the plaintiffs, Kaori Oguni, said before the ruling: \u201cBy losing your surname \u2026 you\u2019re being made light of, you\u2019re not respected \u2026 It\u2019s as if part of your self vanishes.\u201dOguni and four other women launched their legal challenge in 2011, seeking damages of 6m yen (\u00a333,000) for the emotional distress and practical inconvenience of having to take their husband\u2019s name.The attempt to have the law deemed unconstitutional encountered opposition from conservative politicians and commentators, who argued that allowing couples to have different surnames would damage the traditional family unit.The law reflects the traditional view that marriages in Japan are unions between families, not individuals. During the Meiji era (1868-1912), when the law was introduced, it was common for a woman to leave her family to become part of her husband\u2019s family.\u201cNames are the best way to bind families,\u201d Masaomi Takanori, a constitutional scholar, told NHK public television in the run-up to the verdict. \u201cAllowing different surnames risks destroying social stability, the maintenance of public order and the basis for social welfare.\u201dIn practice, many women continue to use their maiden names at work and their legal, married surname in official documents. They include the internal affairs minister, Sanae Takaichi.Oguni said: \u201cIf changing surnames is so easy, why don\u2019t more men do it? The system is one that says, basically, if you\u2019re not willing to change, you shouldn\u2019t be getting married.\u201dThe issue has divided public opinion. A poll by the liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper found that 52% of respondents believed couples should have the right to choose, while 34% opposed the move. If given the option, more than 70% said they would adopt a single family name.Wednesday\u2019s decision means that the only option open to couples who wish to use separate surnames is not to register their marriages. People in common-law marriages, however, encounter complications in inheritance and parental rights.While it is not directly related to the name issue, the plaintiffs were hoping that Abe\u2019s quest to raise the profile of women in the workplace would help their cause.Japan is thought to be one of only a few industrialised countries where it is illegal for married couples to have different surnames.A justice ministry panel recommended in 1996 that the same-name rule be abolished and that the waiting time for remarriage be cut to 100 days, but the change met fierce opposition from conservative MPs, who condemned it as an attack on family values and social cohesion.The UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women has also called on Japan to revise the laws.The court\u2019s ruling on remarrying came after a woman who divorced her violent husband said the law had caused her mental anguish by preventing her from remarrying when she wanted to.The law bans women from remarrying until six months after divorce in case there is confusion over the paternity of children who are conceived shortly before or after the divorce.

They are expected to speed up the formation of a maritime and aerial communication mechanism to prevent an accidental collision near the islands from quickly escalating into war.At the same time, Japan has stepped up its defence readiness amid China\u2019s military buildup and its frequent patrols near the disputed islands, which the Chinese call Diaoyu. Only last week, two Chinese coastguard vessels sailed briefly into Japanese territorial waters around the islands, the 33rd time they have done so this year.Japan\u2019s increasing sense of caution over Chinese military activity is being reflected in higher defence spending and strategic a shift away from its northern maritime border with Russia to its long and porous southern reaches.The defence ministry is seeking a record 5.09tn yen (\u00a327bn) in next year\u2019s budget, including money for longer-range anti-ship missiles, Global Hawk drones and Osprey tilt rotor aircraft.\u2022 The picture caption was amended on 22 December 2015.

The remains have been cremated, the ashes unclaimed. Soon the rickety wooden vessel that took its occupants to their deaths will be destroyed too.Their 12m (40ft) boat now rests on a wharf in the city of Fukui, its bow encrusted with shells and algae, the ripped traces of what appears to be a sail trailing from its stern.For weeks \u2013 possibly months \u2013 it drifted south through the perilous stretch of water separating Japan from the Korean peninsula, before being spotted by fishermen approximately 60 miles (100km) off the coast.Inside, coastguard officials made a grim discovery: the skeletons and badly decomposed bodies of seven people dressed in clothes that bore labels written in Korean Hangul script. Alongside them was squid-fishing equipment and empty plastic bottles and cigarette packets.They represent just one piece in the \u201cghost ship\u201d puzzle that Japanese authorities have conceded may never be solved. The poor condition of the boat, the lack of equipment and, in one case, the discovery of a Kim Jong-il lapel badge all point to one country of origin: North Korea. Related: 'North Korean' boats carrying dead bodies wash ashore in Japan In the past two months at least a dozen suspected North Korean boats carrying the remains of 27 people have been found drifting off Japan\u2019s coast.Some believe those on the boats were defectors; others speculated they were spies. But the most plausible explanation is less dramatic: that they are the victims of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\u2019s latest bid to boost seafood production amid expected food shortages among his 1.2-million-strong army and the promise of more foreign currency from lucrative exports to China. Economic necessity seems much more plausible than defection as an explanation for the boats\u2019 arrival in Japan since October, according to John Nilsson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at Chatham House. He said: \u201cIf you were minded to defect, and were thinking in terms of a maritime route, why not head south to South Korea, rather than seek to make the perilous crossing to Japan.\u201dMost of the boats were found carrying basic fishing equipment, nets and signs written in Korean script. In the grimmest discovery of all, 10 badly decomposed bodies were found in a single vessel with markings that said Korean People\u2019s Army, the official name of North Korea\u2019s military. There were also pieces of what appeared to be a North Korean flag. North Korea watchers say there is no evidence to suggest the boats were crewed by agents sent to abduct Japanese citizens, as happened on many occasions during the 70s and 80s. And while defectors have occasionally arrived in Japan by sea \u2013 most recently in 2011 \u2013 few believe the victims were civilians attempting to flee the North Korean regime. Related: A life of luxury and adulation for Kim Jong-un impersonators With no official diplomatic channels to pursue, there has been no reported contact between Pyongyang and Tokyo about the vessels or their occupants.In fact, many wrecked boats thought to be from North Korea drift towards Japan every year. More than 60 were discovered last year \u2013 most of them empty \u2013 according to the coastguard. In 2013 the number totalled 80. So far this year, 34 mystery boats have arrived, driven by fierce currents and a strong prevailing southwesterly wind.But it is the arrival of so many, and in such quick succession, that has heightened speculation about their origins, and how they came to take so many people to their deaths.Akio Saito, a Fukui resident, agreed with the theory that the victims were fellow fishermen, sent out in dilapidated vessels ill-equipped to cover long distances. \u201cIt would be easy for boats of that size to capsize in the Japan sea at this time of year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe waves are often six or seven metres high, so they\u2019d have no chance. If they had been found alive we would have done everything we could to help them.\u201dJiro Ishimaru of Asia Press, an Osaka-based organisation with a network of high-level contacts in North Korea, believes Kim sent out an order in the summer that more seafood should be provided to the army. \u201cThe problem is that the North Korean fishing industry is no longer run on socialist principles,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThe fishermen realised that if they donated their catch to the military they would end up losing money, so they started allowing soldiers to go out and catch their own fish.\u201dThat meant bigger hauls, and allowed civilian fishermen to continue earning money for themselves and foreign currency for the regime under Kim\u2019s quasi-capitalist reforms.Ishimaru, who discussed the boat disappearances with contacts by phone in North Korea earlier this week, believes that large numbers of boats carrying soldiers who knew nothing about fishing or navigation left ports in North Korea soon after Kim\u2019s exhortation to increase catches.Typically small, with tiny engines and no GPS navigation instruments or VHF radios, the boats would easily have lost their way in a storm or a strong current and quickly run out of food and fuel.\u201cWhen Kim Jong-un issues an order no one can ignore it, even if he is asking them to do the impossible,\u201d Ishimaru said. \u201cThat means inexperienced soldiers go out to sea, even in terrible conditions and with no idea what they are doing. They don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that they are soldiers, so they wear civilian clothes, which is why none of the bodies found in Japan was in uniform.\u201dIn Fukui, concern about the arrival of vessels from North Korea is mixed with sympathy for the people who met such wretched ends, in freezing seas many miles from home. \u201cI expect they were ordered to catch fish by the North Korean government, but of course no one there will take any responsibility for what happened to them,\u201d said Mitsumasa Sakashita, a 67-year-old fisherman in Fukui. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, because they were just like us: fishermen trying to make a living from the sea.\u201d", "tags": ["Japan", "North Korea", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Kim Jong-un", "Fishing"], "title": "Mystery of Japan sea's ghost ships points to North Korea"},{"date": "2015-11-29T00:05:10Z", "country": "japan", "content": "Japan is set to resume whaling early next year, after a break of more than 12 months, in defiance of an international court of justice ruling that it cease the practice.The Japanese government says it has taken into account the court ruling and its \u201cscientific\u201d whaling programme will catch only a third of the minke whales it caught under its previous programme \u2013 333 instead of 1,000 \u2013 which it halted in March last year.Japan\u2019s international whaling commissioner, Joji Morishita, said in a letter that his government had \u201csincerely taken into account\u201d recommendations of the International Whaling Commission\u2019s scientific committee. He said Japan\u2019s new programme \u201cdoes not require any substantial changes\u201d and confirmed whaling would resume.However, the announcement has been condemned by environmental groups and the Australian and UK governments. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed with Japan\u2019s decision to restart whaling in the Southern Ocean. This undermines the global ban on commercial whaling which the UK strongly supports.\u201dThe International Fund for Animal Welfare said Japan\u2019s new programme would result in the slaughter of nearly 4,000 whales over the next 12 years in an expanded Antarctic killing zone.

The Japanese Fisheries Agency has notified the IWC that it will resume whaling in the 2015-16 season under a revised plan. The commission is reviewing the science behind the plan and has raised serious concerns.\u201cAustralia strongly opposes the decision by Japan to resuming whaling in the Southern Ocean this summer,\u201d Hunt said on Saturday. \u201cIt cannot unilaterally decide whether it has adequately addressed the scientific committee\u2019s questions.\u201dHunt said Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and foreign minister Julie Bishop have also directly told Japan that Australia does not support whaling. \u201c[We] will continue to pursue the issue through the IWC and in direct discussions with Japan,\u201d he said.Conservation group Sea Shepherd, which annually sent boats to disrupt the Japanese whaling fleet, warned any return to whaling by Japan would be illegal.\u201cWe would like to remind the Japanese government that the whales of the Southern Ocean are protected by international law, by Australian law and by Sea Shepherd,\u201d chief executive Alex Cornelissen said. \u201cAs such, any violation of the sanctity of the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary or the Australian Whale Sanctuary will be regarded as a criminal act.\u201dSea Shepherd\u2019s main ship, the Steve Irwin, is docked in Melbourne, but the group did not say whether it would trail the Japanese whalers on any new hunts. Australia won a case against Japan last year in the international court of justice. The court ruled that Japan\u2019s \u201cscientific\u201d whaling programme was not scientific at all and ordered Tokyo to recall its fleet.Japan started its whaling programme in 1987, a year after an international moratorium was enacted. It accuses critics of sentimentality and disregarding scientific evidence about sustainability. Japan also maintains that most species are not endangered and that eating whale is part of its food culture.The ICJ says Japan has caught some 3,600 minke whales since its current programme began in 2005. In April 2013, Japan announced its whaling haul from the Southern Ocean was at a record low because of \u201cunforgivable sabotage\u201d by activists from the environmental group Sea Shepherd.", "tags": ["Japan", "Whaling", "Malcolm Turnbull", "Greg Hunt", "Julie Bishop", "Wildlife", "Marine life", "Conservation", "Environment", "World news"], "title": "Japan under fire over decision to resume whaling"},
