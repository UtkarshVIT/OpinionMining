The future of Russian politics is unpredictable. Indeed, we may be seeing the dawn of a new era there. Or so conclude two perfectly competent Independent reports on Putin's winter of discontent. But it's not only Russia's would-be repeat president who has uncertainty to grapple with: this could also be a bit of a new era test for Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny, owner and chairman respectively of the Indy and Evening Standard empire.Is Lebedev senior an admirer, a critic or a thumbsucker when it comes to Putin? Will Indy leader-writers be able to call openly for the old KGB fixer to go if he turns police truncheons and gas canisters on the young marchers who demand his departure? Does Lebedev want another eight years of Putin in charge, or not? And will the Independents reflect his wishes (or even find out what they are)?No verbal grenades flying yet. The Lebedev ownership in Kensington has been hands off, and full of pristine sentiments. There's no manifest reason to fear what may come next â€“ but every reason to watch very closely indeed.
