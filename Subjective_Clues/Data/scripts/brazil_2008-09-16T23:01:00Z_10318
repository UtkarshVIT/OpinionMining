My friend Ceri runs a Fairtrade nut company (chooseliberation.com): this is her divine recipe. Soup for 4200g Brazil nuts1litre vegetable or half-strength chicken stock2tbsp unsalted butter2tbsp plain flourBig pinch ground mace4tbsp double cream Small squeeze of lime100g torn-up oyster mushrooms2tbsp light olive oilA clove of garlic, choppedA handful of parsley, finely chopped4 small slices of bread (I used a baguette)Salt and pepperPreheat oven to 200ºC /400ºF.Bake the nuts for 10 minutes or so, wiggling halfway to toast evenly. When golden, take them out and tip them into a dry tea-towel. Wrap the towel round the nuts to make a tight ball, then scrunch to get the skins off.Warm the stock. Pulse the nuts in a processor until finely ground. Add a ladle of stock and pulse again till smooth. Melt the butter in a heavy-based saucepan and when it begins to foam, stir in the flour over a low heat for a couple of minutes. Then gradually ladle in two thirds of stock, using a whisk to ensure it stays smooth.Add the rest of the stock, including the nutty stock from the processor, the cream, mace and seasoning, then whisk until just below boiling. Simmer very gently for 10 minutes.Heat the oil in a frying pan, and fry the garlic for a minute, then toss in the mushrooms and season.Sieve the soup and add a little hot water, if it's too thick. Add a tiny bit of lime juice and check seasoning. Serve with toast, in warmed bowls, topped with the mushrooms (after a final toss with the parsley) and a few sliced Brazils for a nutty crunch. · Allegra McEvedy is the co-founder of the fast-food chain Leon.
