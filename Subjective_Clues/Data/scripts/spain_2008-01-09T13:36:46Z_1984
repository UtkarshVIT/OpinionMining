Edward Fitzgerald, QC, made the plea as he represented the pair at City of Westminster magistrates court.Spain accuses Jamil el-Banna, 45, and Omar Deghayes, 38, of membership of an al-Qaida cell in Madrid, but Fitzgerald claimed it would be an "obvious injustice" for proceedings against them to continue.They were reunited with their families in the UK last month after nearly five years in captivity, but were immediately served with European arrest warrants following an extradition request from Spain.Fitzgerald told the court: "The Spanish authorities are deeply implicated in the ordeal of the last five years."They acquiesced to, and facilitated, their interrogation at Guantánamo and indeed participated in that interrogation process."They took no steps or adequate steps to say 'we want them for trial in Spain'. They left them to be interrogated in Guantánamo, and now - after they have been exonerated by US authorities, after English police have said they don't wish to bring any charges - the Spanish authorities are saying, 'we want to question them on the self same charges'."Spain alleges Banna and Deghayes belonged to the cell which provided members to train in terror camps in Afghanistan and Indonesia. The cell was also alleged to have raised funds for terrorism and to have spread al-Qaida propaganda.Fitzgerald claimed it would be an "obvious oppression" to "now extradite them for the same allegations that have been fully investigated in Guantánamo".David Perry, representing the Spanish government, said Spain was "a trusted and valued proven partner". "They are not wanted for questioning. They are wanted for the accusation of belonging to a Spanish terrorist group which was the al-Qaida terrorist group in Spain operating through the late 90s and into 2003."British counter-terrorism police have already questioned the men and decided they should not be charged with any offence. The senior district judge, Timothy Workman, extended the pair's bail, which includes stringent conditions such as wearing an electronic tag and obeying curfews. He ordered the men to return for a further hearing at the same court on February 14.
