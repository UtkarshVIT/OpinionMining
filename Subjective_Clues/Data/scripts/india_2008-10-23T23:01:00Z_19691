It was satisfying to see the coverage of India's Chandrayaan-1 mission to the moon (October 21 and 23), but rather saddening to see no recognition (or even mention) of the substantial UK involvement. One of the key instruments on board Chandrayaan-1 is CIXS, which will map the surface composition of lunar soil and rock – something which is the key to understanding the origins and evolution of the Earth-moon system. CIXS has been developed, built and led by a UK team – the instrument was built at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and science leadership is by Professor Manuel Grande at Aberystwyth. In assembling the instrument suite for Chandrayaan-1, the Indian Space Agency chose the best experiments on offer, regardless of country of origin. It would be nice to see the efforts of the CIXS team and the UK contribution to this mission recognised.Dr Andy BreenSolar system physics research group, Aberystwyth University
