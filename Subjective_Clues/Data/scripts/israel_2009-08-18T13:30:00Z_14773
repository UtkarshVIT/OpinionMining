At first glance, Israel's latest manoeuvre in its fight against terror is well intentioned, if completely ineffectual. Like the rulers of any sovereign state, Israel's leaders have a duty to protect their citizens – whether from Kassam fire in the south, Katyusha barrages in the north or suicide bombers in civilian centres across the country. According to government officials, the new policy of barring visitors to the Palestinian Authority from entering Israel is imperative to keep potentially dangerous individuals away from vulnerable targets in Israeli towns and cities.However, given that the security wall is barely half-finished, and that IDF checkpoints can be circumvented with the most minimal of effort, an ink stamp in the passport of someone determined to kill Israeli citizens is unlikely to have much effect in thwarting a terror attack. During my trip to Hebron and Susiya last week, I moved freely between Areas A, B and C, without showing my passport once; the few bored soldiers I encountered paying little attention to the comings and goings on their turf, despite Israeli assertions that the borders are tightly monitored the length and breadth of the country.While Israeli officials can mask their true motives for the prohibitive visa policy behind a cloak stencilled with "security precautions", when viewed in the context of previous, similar actions, the facade begins to crack. International activists operating in Israel and the West Bank have long been subject to restrictive measures at the hands of the authorities, arrested and deported on the most spurious of grounds, and then denied re-entry to the country for periods up to 10 years. At the same time, even Israeli activists have at times been banned from contentious areas such as Hebron; again, ostensibly for security reasons, but far more likely because officials didn't want the incessant crimes of the settlers being documented by the likes of B'tselem and Rabbis for Human Rights.With the incumbent cabinet dominated by hardline rightwing figures such as Binyamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman, moves such as the "PA-only" stamp are hardly unexpected in terms of their general attitude towards the Palestinians and their supporters. The fact that banning visitors to the PA from entering Israel contravenes the Oslo Accords means little to leaders who scoff at the agreement and wish it had never been signed in the first place.Meanwhile, the fact that foreign nationals have played their part in terror attacks against Israel ensures that the Israeli public can be convinced that such measures are entirely palatable, despite the fact that in the longer term every act of collective punishment and restriction only stokes up the tension and guarantees another generation of Israel-hating Palestinian youths. The news that a Syrian national was among the fighters killed by Hamas in Gaza last week is an alarming development in the conflict – but shouldn't be overplayed in terms of the argument over allowing foreigners who've visited PA areas to set foot on Israeli soil.Israel's leaders are quick to denounce regimes that deny entry to Israeli citizens, yet when the mood takes them are happy to take similar action against foreigners wishing to visit Israel, simply for having committed the crime of spending time in Palestinian Authority territory. Such a path is a dangerous route to go down, given Israel's supporters' constant claim to be the only democracy in the Middle East, and tolerant of internal and external dissent, whether in the public, press or political arena.Further cementing the separation between Israelis and Palestinians – in this case by confining visitors to one area or another – is in no one's best interests; no one, that is, who has any lingering hope that a just resolution to the interminable conflict can ever be achieved. The Israeli government has for years banned Israelis from entering the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinians are totally banned from Israeli soil without a permit, ensuring contact and dialogue between the two people is at an all-time low. Those who previously had freedom of movement between the two sides, such as foreign nationals – whether as tourists, aid workers, or in any other civilian role – at least kept some contact going, but the new visa policy slams the door shut in their faces too.Anyone who truly believes Israelis are more secure as a result of these measures is either completely unaware of how porous Israel's borders are – visa or no visa – or is intentionally deluding themselves to buy into the government's hawkish, intransigent stance towards its political opponents. Either way, Israelis shouldn't sleep easier at night as a result of the new restrictions: not only are they as vulnerable as before, despite their leaders' protestations, but also the flames burning in the region have been fanned even higher as a result of this ill-thought-out and ill-intentioned policy.
