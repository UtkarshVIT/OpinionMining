This week the Guardian's New Europe series moves south-west, from Germany to France. Here, we will report from a country that is on the brink of election season, with the presidential contest to be held next year. But the economy is mired in gloom and doubts linger about the durability of its much-cherished exception culturelle.Over the next week, in the paper and on the Guardian's website, our correspondents, columnists and critics will write about food, film and finance, media, music and multiculturalism. We will explore France's affinity for nuclear power, investigate the strengths of the health system – and the weakness of education and the jobs-for-life culture.We will hear from numerous French voices as part of this series, which includes live blogs, films and podcasts. There will be interviews with leading French political and cultural figures. In subsequent weeks, our series will move further south, to Spain, before looking east to the biggest new EU country, Poland.Stay with us on this month-long journey. Get to know your neighbours a bit better.
