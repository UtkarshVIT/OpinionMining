Yay! Can hardly believe it's 100 days, which is only *frowns, counts fingers* five leg-waxes or three haircuts, slightly more I suppose if you have highlights, and yet so much has happened, even things they said were impossible like the log basket arriving from Romania *faints*.Dave said why not try those descriptive thingys people do on Twitter because if my diaries are read in future *blushes* he thinks they will really bring the writing *holds pen* to life. Really *weeps with relief* it's only snagging stuff now, in the flat, though we'll have to replace the rug *cross face* where Sir Philip was so ill after the fight, but Dave said chill babes, you can't pass a political milestone like this without a celebration and he's probably never played a proper drinking game before, are they even legal in Monaco?And until all the fuss about change, everyone was loving Honest Phil's Topshop To Go discount rail, typical Huhne to fuss about a few pounds and of course Phil would have paid him back if it hadn't been for that last game of Find the Lady. Oik's still upset but I know he's heard worse than "get me another drink, you fucking tosser" at Oxford if it wasn't with the Deripaskas, though I suppose they say it in Russian.But I am a bit worried *worried face* because Philip is Dave's first big fashion appointment, and if he can't fit in with the other boys God knows how they'll take to Johnnie Boden at the foreign office. Then I'd pencilled Sadie Frost for the BBC cuts and Kate Moss at education. Because Kate is in her understated way such a hard worker with a total horror of waste, says you could save millions by making one school dinner feed three, plus the children would look and feel fabulous.The rag trade is full of amazing thinkers, look at the Prada gel bag, so it's terribly unfair I said to *crosses self* Cable, when he started playing up, to hold zero political experience against them. I mean, 100 days ago Oik could barely count and now look, so before you rubbish Honest Phil ask yourself what you know about Topshop.As seen by Catherine Bennett
