Japan's industrial production rose more than expected last month as exporters benefited from global stimulus measures, but the news was tempered by warnings that sustained recovery is a long way off.Output rose 1.9% in July, the fifth consecutive monthly gain – due in part to rising overseas demand for cars and steel – but at a slower pace than in the past four months.The Bank of Japan [BoJ] governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, said the world's second biggest economy was showing signs of recovery, but added that he expected "only moderate" growth.Japan's output is still almost 23% lower than this time last year, underlining the size of the task facing the incoming prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, whose party won yesterday's general election by a landslideThe turnaround in Japanese output and exports had been expected given their catastrophic decline during a year of recession.Analysts said recent gains could peter out once the effects of more than $2tn (£1.2tn) in global fiscal spending wear off."Japan is picking up from a very low level and we don't want to make the mistake of thinking it is back on track to fast growth," Sebastien Barbe, an economist at Calyon in Hong Kong, told Reuters."Exports across Asia are still quite weak and we need to see the US economy in particular accelerate."Although manufacturers expect modest rises in output to continue, Shirakawa said it was far too early to talk of sustained recovery."At present, Japan's economic conditions are showing some signs of recovery," he told business leaders in Osaka. "At the same time, the bank fully recognises that the outlook is associated with great uncertainty."Output rose 8.3% and GDP rose at an annualised rate of 3.7% in the three months to June, as Japan emerged battered and bruised from a year-long recession.Shirakawa said recent drops in consumer prices would ease as long as the recovery stays the course, but added that downward pressure on prices would continue."The question is how the economy will develop after the positive effects fade," he said. "We still cannot be confident about the strength of final demand at home."In the second quarter core consumer prices fell a record 2.2% from a year earlier, heightening fears that Japan could be trapped in a deflationary spiral for the second time in five years.With the BoJ resigned to a sustained period of deflation, analysts said they did not expect any change to Japan's ultra-low interest rates, currently at 0.1%.
