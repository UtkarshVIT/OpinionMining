South Korea will support a UN resolution expressing concern about human rights in North Korea, dramatically shifting its stance towards the totalitarian regime of its neighbour.The new government in Seoul, led by President Lee Myung-bak, is breaking from the policy of successive liberal administrations which have been reluctant to publicly criticise Pyongyang. A senior official confirmed South Korea would vote in favour of the resolution today, a move that could anger the communist North amid a deadlock in international nuclear talks.Lee, who took office last month, has promised a tougher stance in dealing with North Korea. Since 2003, South Korea has voted only once for a UN resolution on North Korean human rights - after the North's nuclear test in October 2006. In other votes, South Korea either abstained or stayed away out of concern that its criticism might harm efforts to resolve the nuclear standoff with the North.According to a copy of the draft resolution, the UN Human Rights Council will say it is "deeply concerned at the continuing reports of systematic, widespread and grave violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights" in North Korea.The resolution also calls for a one-year extension of the mandate of Vitit Muntarbhorn, the UN special rapporteur on North Korean human rights. Muntarbhorn is tasked with investigating rights abuses in the country, but has never been allowed to visit.International advocacy groups say North Korea is among the world's worst abusers of human rights. It has been accused, among other things, of running a network of prison camps believed to house some 200,000 political detainees."I believe the North Korean people should get to a point where they can enjoy the minimum basic happiness of human beings," Lee said in a meeting with unification ministry officials. The two Koreas have remained technically at war since 1953, when the three-year Korean war was brought to a halt with an armistice.The North Korean government rejects criticism of its rights record, denouncing it as part of an American attempt to overthrow the regime.Pyongyang has not yet satisfied Washington's demand for a full audit of its nuclear programmes. Today, the nominee to head South Korea's joint chiefs of staff, General Kim Tae-young, told parliament he believed North Korea has enough plutonium to build six to seven nuclear weapons.
