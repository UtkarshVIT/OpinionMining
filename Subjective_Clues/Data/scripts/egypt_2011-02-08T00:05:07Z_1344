Timothy Garton Ash (If this is young Arabs' 1989, Europe must be ready with a bold response, 3 February) says: "What we need are people on the spot who speak the language, know the history, have been there repeatedly over a number of years, and can evaluate the main players and social forces."

A really "bold response" to events in the Arab world would be for Europe to throw off its own self-perpetuating elites.Andy CroftMiddlesbrough
