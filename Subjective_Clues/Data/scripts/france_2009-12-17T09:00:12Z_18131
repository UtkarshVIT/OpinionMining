Hundreds of Vietnamese followers of a radical Buddhist leader have called on the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to grant them temporary asylum, a week after they were attacked by vigilantes allegedly hired by the Vietnamese authorities.Representatives of the followers yesterday urged Sarkozy to grant them asylum "until it is safe for them to return to Vietnam to practise their faith, together".About 380 young monks and nuns were forced to flee Bat Nha monastery in central Lam Dong province at the end of September after the authorities reacted angrily to a call by their exiled spiritual leader, Thich Nhat Hanh, to end religious intolerance and disband the country's notorious A41 religious police.Supporters say that several monks were beaten and four were sexually assaulted, while two others were held under house arrest without charge.The year long standoff between the Buddhists and the Vietnamese authorities took another violent turn last week when the government sealed off a temple where 200 followers had been taking refuge.A 100-strong armed mob, allegedly directed by undercover police and communist party officials, assaulted the occupants and attempted to clear them from Phuoc Hue pagoda in Lam Dong province.The attack forced an EU delegation to abandon a fact-finding mission to the temple, and the abbot, Thich Thai Thuan, was forced to write a note urging the followers to leave the temple by the end of the year."They pressured me to sign the paper to evict the monastic," he told Radio France. "They forced me, so I had to sign."Campaigners said the attacks were proof of Vietnam's contempt for human rights and called on the international community to take action."Vietnam's international donors should insist that the government halt the attacks on the monks and nuns in Lam Dong, allow them to practise their religion, and prevent any further violent expulsions," said Elaine Pearson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch."And they should make clear they will keep close tabs on the situation."The EU, one of Vietnam's biggest donors, pledged $1bn in aid earlier this month, but pressed the government to lift its restrictions on the media and permit religious freedoms and political dissent."The vigilante action to prevent diplomats from meeting with the monks and nuns is a real slap in the face to the EU," Pearson said. "The EU needs to make clear that it has leverage and will use it."The EU delegation was sent after the European parliament passed a resolution last month condemning the Buddhists' violent expulsion.Nhat Hanh helped popularise Buddhism in the west and was nominated for the Nobel peace prize by Martin Luther King.His followers, who describe themselves as the "most radical and fastest growing" in Vietnam, say the government regards their leader as a threat to its authority.He was forced to leave the former South Vietnam in 1965 because of his opposition to the Vietnam war.During his exile in France he sold millions of books and brought Buddhist thought to a new audience in the west through his Zen teachings and peace activism.His return to Vietnam in 2005 – with the government's blessing – after 39 years in exile raised hopes for a new era of religious freedom in the country.All religious activity remains under state control, but the government insists it respects the freedom to worship and described the recent attacks as a dispute between rival Buddhist groups.
