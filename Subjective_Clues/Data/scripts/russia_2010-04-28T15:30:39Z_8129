Russia today posted documents concerning the massacre of Polish prisoners in Katyn on a government website, and said it would release further archive material dealing with Soviet-era repression.Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev, said he had personally ordered the online publication of the archive on the massacre, which took place 70 years ago when Soviet secret police shot 22,000 Polish officers near Katyn in western Russia.The documents have been published before in Poland and Russia. But the decision to publish them online is the latest positive gesture by Moscow to Warsaw after this month's air disaster that killed Poland's president, Lech Kaczynski.The crash provoked an unprecedented Russian reaction, with Medvedev attending Kaczynski's funeral in Krakow and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin, leading the investigation into why Kaczynski's plane went down.Medvedev suggested Russia would now release further classified documents on the massacre. "The Katyn archives are open. [But] there are certain materials that have not yet been forwarded to our Polish partners," Medvedev said.Pledging greater openness, he added: "I have ordered that appropriate work be carried out and materials that are interesting to our Polish colleagues be handed over to them."Human rights groups say that Russia has refused to hand over the most sensitive archive materials – which identify individual officers from the NKVD, the pre-KGB secret police – who carried out the killings.Today, the head of Russia's state archives agency, Rosarchiv, Andrei Artizov, said the documents came from the top-secret archive of the politburo. They include a letter from Lavrenti Beria, the head of the NKVD, written in March 1940.In it, Beria describes the Polish PoWs as "incorrigible enemies of Soviet power" and urges their liquidation. The archive includes the signatures of Stalin and other politburo members on a resolution authorising the murders – which Stalin subsequently blamed on the Nazis.Artizov said all Soviet leaders after Stalin were told the truth about Katyn. He said the murders were carried out at three distinct sites: Pyatikhatka, near Kharkov; Katyn, near Smolensk; and Mednoye in Russia's Tver region. The largest number of Polish officers were shot dead in Mednoye, he said.Historians said that the decision to post the documents on the internet was an important step to enable Russians to come to terms with their past.Andrzej Kunert, a Polish historian, said the Kremlin's move was significant. "We can call the decision a breakthrough."
