Imaneja is perhaps the best-loved of the Candomblé orixas and her anniversary in February is celebrated up and down the Atlantic coast of Brazil.Candomblé is the religion that the African slaves brought with them in the 16th century. Percussion music on atabaques – wooden drums covered in goatskin – underlies the ceremonies, accompanied by agogô bells (like a tambourine) and a xequerê, which is a gourd strung with beads.The 12 orixas are a bit like Christian saints who act as your personal intermediary to the deity. You discover your own orixa by attending a session of throwing shells. The way they fall enables the local priest to tell you not only your orixa but your future as well.Imaneja is the queen of all the oceans, mother of the other orixas and protector of families and their homes. Many people wear white on Fridays, which is designated as her day of the week.Our Festa de Imaneja starts in the village square, where the women dance in their white-and-blue hooped dresses and the men move melodically in white tunics around a flower-decked boat carrying the image of the orixa. The procession moves on to the Catholic church where, in spite of the complete difference of religions, the local padre blesses Imaneja, her boat and the bowls of popcorn that are also intrinsic to the ceremony. He sprinkles holy water on everyone, which both refreshes the spirit and cools the perspiring crowd.There is no conflict between religions, the African drums play at the church door and the crowd packs in to pray and be blessed by a priest.As evening comes, the whole ensemble moves down the hill to the fishermen's beach where there's more dancing and a liberal amount of beer drinking from the adjacent bar. At an auspicious moment, the Mother of Saint boards a fishing boat and takes the image of Imaneja and her boat and flowers to be launched beyond the coral reef into the Atlantic waves.It's then the villagers turn to throw their white and blue flowers into the sea and to light candles on the beach.As with most Brazilian events, the evening – or more often the early morning after – finishes with parties at almost every bar along the beach – at some of which more images of Imaneja in boats are floated off eastwards.
