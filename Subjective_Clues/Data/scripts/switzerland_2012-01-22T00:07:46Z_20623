Even for the 51 weeks a year when Davos is just another ski resort, Switzerland is renowned as a haven for multimillionaires in search of a quiet life – and a minimal tax bill. Lewis Hamilton and Phil Collins are among the Brits who have chosen to flee to the Alpine state to avoid the scrutiny of the Revenue.But tax havens, where few questions are asked about residents' financial affairs, have come under increasing international pressure to change their ways in recent years.The resignation of Swiss central bank governor Philipp Hildebrand earlier this month, after his wealthy wife caused controversy by betting against the Swiss franc, showed that the country has become less tolerant of the idea that the financial affairs of the super-rich should be secret.The UK and German treasuries have both recently signed agreements with the Swiss government under which their citizens will have to pay up for salting their money away in secretive accounts in Zurich or Geneva – though the European commission is currently challenging the deals, which have not yet been signed into law.Criticism of the Swiss authorities' approach intensified after a celebrated case starting in 2010, in which a whistleblower at HSBC released the financial details of scores of the bank's private clients, allowing the French, German and UK authorities to pursue them for unpaid tax.More recently, the Swiss government has proposed abolishing so-called "lump sum taxation", under which wealthy individuals can offer to pay a flat fee up front in exchange for avoiding any scrutiny of their financial affairs by the authorities.Swiss finance minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said last summer when the idea was announced that revenue could double, although she acknowledged that some taxpayers might decide to leave rather than submit to closer examination of their affairs. "We have to realistically reckon with people leaving, but we do not think it will be a huge number," she said. However, the plan has not yet come into force.At the same time, a group of leftwing campaigners is promoting the idea of a referendum on imposing a federal inheritance tax for the first time, as well as a levy on financial gifts. The proposals are unlikely to be voted on until next year but could be enforced retrospectively to cover any gifts made from this month.However, Richard Murphy of the Tax Justice Network said it would be a mistake to see these straws in the wind as evidence that Switzerland is shrugging off its secretive status. "It's clearly still a tax haven, and most wealthy people if they wanted to could still put their money there, no questions asked," he said.
