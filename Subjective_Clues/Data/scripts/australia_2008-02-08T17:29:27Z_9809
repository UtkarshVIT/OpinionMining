Tourism Australia, which infamously ruffled British sensibilities with the controversial "Where the bloody hell are you?" TV ad campaign is reviewing its global advertising account.The statutory review has begun as Tourism Australia's three-year contracts with M&C Saatchi, which develops the creative ads, and Carat, which is responsible for media planning and buying, come to an end in June.Tourism Australia has appointed Sydney-based pitch consultants The Agency Register to provide strategic advice on selecting the advertising agencies to handle the account.Rick Allert, the chairman of Tourism Australia, said there would be a "rigorous procurement process".The official tender document for agencies made it clear that it would not just look to award the account to the agency that came in with the cheapest fee. "Price is not the sole determining factor in the assessment of value," it said. "Value considers excellence in creative skills, servicing capabilities and the right organisational fit, alongside the cost of services."The tender document places the "estimated value" of the fees to the winning agencies at A$10m (£4.5m).Tourism Australia's new advertising contract will start on July 1 for three years with an option for an additional two years.Reports in Australia put the size of the Tourism Australia's annual global advertising spend at as much as A$180m. However, according to Nielsen Media Research the UK spend was just £4.5m in 2007 across all media.In 2006, Australian tourism minister Fran Bailey accused the British of lacking a sense of humour after the "Where the bloody hell are you?" campaign resulted in a flurry of complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK.· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
