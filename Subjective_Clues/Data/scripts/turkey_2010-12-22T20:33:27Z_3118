Barack Obama cut a forlorn figure on 3 November, the day after the midterm elections. Standing in front of television cameras at the White House, he took responsibility for the Democrats' disastrous results.It had been, he said, "a shellacking". US media commentators began to write him off as a president unable to get things done, either at home or abroad, a potential one-term president.But today saw a rejuvenated man, one in a mood to celebrate a series of unlikely legislative successes.In a lame-duck Congress, the normally dead zone between an election and the new Congress beginning in January, and with time against him, Obama secured a deal on tax, albeit a messy compromise – but one that averts a financial crisis.And last weekend, defying all expectations, Congress voted to repeal the "don't ask, don't tell" policy on gay soldiers in the military.Late today he added to that with his biggest foreign policy success to date, the Senate's ratification of the US-Russia arms treaty.Taken together with his health reform legislation earlier this year, the supposedly do-nothing president ends 2010 with a substantial body of policy successes behind him, one that puts him on course for becoming one of the most liberal presidents in US history.Obama spoke today before an emotional and noisy crowd at the ceremony where he signed the bill ending the ban on gays in the US military, which had to be moved from the White House to the interior department to accommodate all who wanted to attend.He appeared to have regained some of his lost composure, closer to the crowd-pleasing orator of the 2008 campaign trail than the cautious, unemotional, stick-to-the-teleprompter persona he has adopted as president.He praised Republicans and Democrats who helped push through the repeal of the ban. "No longer will tens of thousands of Americans in uniform be asked to live a lie, or look over their shoulder, in order to serve the country that they love," he said.Civil rightsHis speech was repeatedly greeted with cheers and there were tears not only in the audience but among senior politicians on the platform behind him.Aubrey Sarvis, director of the Servicemembers legal defence network, one of the leading groups campaigning for change, saw repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military as a major event for the Obama presidency.Sarvis made a comparison with Lyndon Johnson, who brought in the 1960s civil rights legislation as well as a series of other social and economic reforms."In signing this bill today, President Obama delivered on a defining civil rights measure for our country and for gay, lesbian and bisexual service members who have been silenced for far too long. Clearly, this is President Obama's Lyndon Johnson moment in history," he said.Larry Sabato, professor of politics at the University of Virginia, was also impressed that Obama had achieved so much in a lame-duck session.He tweeted: "It's official. Like it or not, this lame-duck session is the most productive of the 15 held since WWII."The Republicans, in the wake of their November election victory, had seemed an unstoppable and uncompromising force, one dedicated to ensuring Obama lost in 2012. Obstructionism had worked for them over the last two years and more was expected.But it has not turned out like that and Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator, today voiced his dismay with fellow Republicans for making so many concessions to the White House and to the Democratic leadership in Congress, in particular the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid.Graham, speaking on Fox News radio, said the Republicans had no one to blame but themselves for allowing so much legislation through. "When it's all going to be said and done, Harry Reid has eaten our lunch," Graham said. "This has been a capitulation in two weeks of dramatic proportions of policies that wouldn't have passed in the new Congress."The nuclear arms issue exposed the extent of the disarray in Republican ranks, with a sizeable core prepared to ignore the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who on Sunday announced he would vote against it.Obama, who has been committed to nuclear disarmament since his university days, may be tempted to take another step next year and press the Senate on a comprehensive test ban treaty."Nuclear disarmament is one of the things that Obama really cares about, and he decided to stake his personal credibility on this vote," said Anne Penketh, Washington programme director of the British American Security Information Council. "I wouldn't rule out the administration testing the water next year to see whether they can get the votes in the Senate to ratify the global test ban treaty, which would provide a crucial push towards it coming into force."The arms treaty vote was the last major piece of legislation to be considered by Congress before adjourning for Christmas. Obama, who had delayed his holiday until it completed its business, was due to fly out yesterday for Hawaii.VictoryTom Mann, a politics specialist at the Brookings Institution, predicted Obama was likely to win re-election in 2012. "I thought the lame-duck president perspective after the midterm elections was misguided," he said."Developments during the lame-duck Congress reinforce an alternative view that Obama is alive and well politically and likely to win re-election."The tax agreement provides important stimulus to hasten economic recovery and job growth. The victory on 'don't ask, don't tell' will help mobilise the youngest cohort and liberal base in 2012."Ratification of the new Start treaty demonstrates the limits of McConnell's ability to unify his party in opposition when the substantive case for passage is overwhelming."But Ross Baker, professor of politics at Rutgers University and a former Senate staffer, saw problems ahead."Obama has had a good run during the lame-duck, but his problem, all along, has not been the achievement but rather his inability to exploit the achievements. An astute White House message operation would have immediately dubbed the tax cut 'the Obama tax cut'. They seem unable to take credit for the very considerable accomplishments of this president."On Obama's re-election chances, Baker said: "I'm assuming that the Republicans will nominate someone very conservative. Such a nominee can easily be painted as out of the mainstream by an Obama campaign team that, for all of their problems with getting out the message of their accomplishments as the governing party, are very good at winning elections."I would pick Obama to be re-elected if the unemployment trend lines are good – not 5% but edging back toward 8% [from 9.8% at present]."
