Your insufficiently pessimistic leading article (Dead but not buried, 16 December) fails to refer to the most ineluctable fact about the stalemate between Israel and the Palestinians: demography. The prime minister of Jordan, whom I met in Amman last month, is the latest international statesman to point to what some of us have been saying for quite a while: that it is only a matter of time before the Palestinians (5.2 million at present) will outnumber Israeli Jews (5.7 million) and, as a prominent British Jewish leader said recently, exhibit Israel as an apartheid state. There will be no turning back, the chances of a two-state solution will disappear incrementally, and the one state that remains will not be Israel. Netanyahu's refusal to have a peace policy will become a suicide note.Gerald Kaufman MPLab, Manchester Gorton
