Seun Kuti is unmistakably his father's son. Progeny of Fela Kuti, the primary bandleader of Afrobeat - the politically charged and mesmerisingly groovy sound of 1970s Nigeria - Seun, like older brother Femi, keeps their father's flame alive. As with Fela's work, the music on new album Many Things is unafraid to engage with specifics - Mosquito Song is about governmental failure to provide information about malaria prevention - and, what's more, it does so with the aid of Fela's band, Egypt 80. For all Seun's claims of being hip-hop influenced, he's not changed much on the Afrobeat template, but realistically, what he's protesting about hasn't changed much either.
