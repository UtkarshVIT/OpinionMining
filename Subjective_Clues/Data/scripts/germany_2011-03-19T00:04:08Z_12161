Experience the beauty of the Amazon and learn about its wildlife, ecology and complexity at this magical attraction – inside a 30m-high old gasometer. It features a giant 360° panoramic recreation of the rainforest. Bring or hire binoculars so you can spot animals in the 'forest' – and listen out for their calls. It's a great combination of originality and information.Richard-Lehman Strasse 114, +49 341 35 55 340, asisi.de; entrance €10 adults, €5 childrenLesley46Dachgarten at the ReichstagAvoid the queues at the Reichstag for the price of breakfast by booking online at the restaurant Dachgarten. Go straight to the front of any queue to get into the Reichstag and tell them you have booked breakfast, get your name checked off the list by the guards and get escorted through security by your personal escort to the lift that carries you to the restaurant at the foot of the glass dome. Terrific breakfast (and we are vegetarian) and then we had the run of the dome and fabulous views over Berlin. Awesome.

Pollution and graffiti ruined the first lot so get to see it before this happens again.Mühlenstrasse 1, eastsidegallery.comtheairsZwiebelfischWith the demise of Gainsbourg (it's been turned into a supermarket) there's only Zwiebelfisch and Diener flying the flag for old Berlin in this chic square between the K'Damm (Kurfürstendamm) and Kantstrasse. Once a hotbed of revolutionary chatter, it's now a very laidback joint that seems totally at ease with itself. Papered in thousands of posters and old photos, it's got a chilled-out vibe thanks in no small measure to the genial owner, a veteran of West Berlin's pre-1989 counter culture. Zwiebelfisch, incidentally, is an old printing expression meaning a letter printed in the wrong font.Savignyplatz 7, +49 30 312 73 63, zwiebelfisch-berlin.deTimETempelhof airportThis now-disused terminal is the third largest building in the world, and the scale is breathtaking, in particular the vast arrivals hall, which was designed by Ernst Sagebiel. He worked in the same offices as Albert Speer, Hitler's architect. It is that worrying link with the past that makes walking through the site all the more interesting. It is particularly eerie now it is empty but there are plenty of reminders of the airport's previous life as a major international terminal and the role it played in the 1948 Berlin Airlift. The US military used it as a base during the cold war, from 1945, and their old offices are left exactly as they were immediately after their departure in 1993. Brilliant.+49 30 6091 1660, berlin-airport.de; the airport tour lasts two hours and costs €8ppJGNaughtonX-Terrain barGreat little cellar bar in Oranienburger Strasse. Go down the steps and be greeted by the bowler-hatted Ian Dury-esque owner/designer of this DIY retro establishment. Homemade artworks and paraphenalia adorn the brick walls, candles drip wax over their holders – soak up the smoke-filled ambience and Rolling Stones grooves. Relax on a big-armed sofa and discuss the Tacheles art collective (just along the road) over a Berliner Weisse, green or red. A real taste of creative, underground Berlin.Oranienburger Strasse 40WillJohnson747Strand Pauli Beach ClubStrand Pauli is one of several beach clubs in Hamburg with a great view of the river Elbe. It's near Landungsbrücken, just 15 minutes from the Hauptbahnhof, Hamburg's central train station. Here you will find good music, German beer and food direct from the barbecue.

You can pamper yourself in the thermal brine spas at Bad Saarow, spend the night in the opulent surroundings of the fairytale Schloss Hubertushöhe, a former royal hunting lodge, or just take in the unspoilt beaches, woodland and wildlife.Bad Saarow spa, +49 33 631 8680, bad-saarow.de; Schloss Hubertushöhe, hubertushoehe.deBurgermeisterschechThe AldstadtThe city that gave us Kraftwerk also gave us some of the finest beer in the world. The Altstadt is crammed with traditional German beerhalls selling the renowned Altbier. This top-fermented ale is best sampled in the four brewpubs, each with their own distinctive tipple served from the barrel. The oldest is Schumacher, not far from the station, and the other three – the Füchschen, Schlüssel and Uerige – are in the Altstadt.Oststrasse 123, +49 21 1828 9020, schumacher-alt.deTroutiemcfishWein und BiershänkeFamous for its Flammkuchen and Neuwein, the Shänke restaurant has been satisfying the hunger of both locals and tourists since 1982. The friendly atmosphere is great for any type of gathering, with its flea-market decor and wooden beams.Flammkuchen is a huge rectangular slice of deliciousness, traditionally topped with bacon and onion. It's similar to the humble pizza, but has a sauce made of quark (a type of cheese) instead of tomato. My favourite is half topped with feta and jalapeños, with the other half covered in mushrooms, onions, sweetcorn and kidney beans. Its non-alcoholic KiBa cocktail (half cherry-half banana) is my favourite accompaniment, except for in September and October, when the sweet-tasting Neuwein is in season.Nähe Dom, Wollstrasse 7-9, +49 62 412 4919, weinundbierschaenke.deemilyreactsCafe BeegCafe Beeg is an old-school German cafe, with a formal atmosphere, delicious food, cakes and coffee.

Base yourself in the popular island town of Lindau and stroll around the old quarter before heading out to explore the lakeside. You can cycle or walk southwards along the lake to Bregenz in Austria (having a dip in the "See" along the way), or take one of the many boats or catamarans across to Konstanz or Rorschach in Switzerland. Venture inland from Lindau and hike up to the top of the Pfänder for breath-taking views.

It is highly entertaining to watch local surfers riding the artificial wave. When you have had enough, take a stroll in the English Garden and stop at the Chinese Tower beer garden for a bite to eat and a local beer. Bliss.
