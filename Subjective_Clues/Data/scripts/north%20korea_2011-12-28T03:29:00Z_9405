Tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Pyongyang to bid farewell to former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, in a meticulously choreographed funeral designed to cement his legacy and pave the way for the transfer of power to his youngest son, Kim Jong-un.Reports said that the funeral on Wednesday, originally scheduled for mid-morning, had been delayed by several hours after more than 5cm of snow fell in Pyongyang on Tuesday night.The city's citizens had been mobilised to clear snow from the funeral cortege's 40km drive from Kumsusan memorial palace, where Kim's body has been lying in state.The procession was expected to head to the city's main plaza, Kim Il Sung Square, where hundreds of thousands of North Koreans have been paying their respects since hearing of his death 10 days ago. What appeared to be live footage from North Korean state TV showed the procession moving slowly through the streets against a backdrop of snowfall and clearly audible mass outpouring of grief from an estimated 200,000 mourners, most of whom were in military uniform.The procession may have helped answer key questions about the communist regime's immediate future, amid fears that the rapid rise to power of the inexperienced Kim Jong-un could spark a power struggle that could potentially threaten regional security.Jong-un, wearing a long black coat, walked at the front of the hearse carrying his father's casket on its roof, a sign that the succession is proceeding as the older Kim had envisaged when he unveiled the youngest of his three sons as his heir at a military parade in the capital in October 2010.The younger Kim bowed his head slightly and held a military salute as the motorcade left the city's main square. Just yards behind him was his Kim Jong-il's brother-in-law, Jang Song -thaek, whom many expect to help the new leader tighten his grip on power in the coming months. With them was Ri Yong-ho, the army's chief of staff.In front were cars carrying a large wreath draped with black ribbons and a huge portrait of a smiling Kim Jong-il dressed in his trademark khaki suit.Following them were about a dozen black Mercedes-Benz sedans and a larger fleet of white luxury cars. The only military vehicles on display were the jeeps surrounding Kim's hearse.Kim's two other sons, Kim Jong Nam and Kim Jong Chol, have not yet been seen.The early stages of the procession were watched by ranks of soldiers, some of whom held on to each other for support, while women in civilian clothes clasped white handkerchiefs to their mouths.The funeral was accompanied by a slow march performed by a military band and an oscillating commentary from a newscaster identified as Ri Chun-hee, who announced Kim Jong-il's death last week.Amid eulogies to Kim Jong-il, she says that under Jong-un's leadership, "North Korea will experience only victories".Some in the crowd could be heard shouting: "How could you leave us? What are we supposed to do without you?" State media used the snowy weather to bolster myths about Kim Jong-il's birth on Korea's highest peak, although Soviet records show he was born in Russia."The feathery snowfall reminds the Korean people of the snowy day when the leader was born in the secret camp of Mt Paektu and of the great revolutionary career that he followed through snowdrifts," said the Korea Central News Agency. "It seems the sky knows well of how much he got snowed on during his uninterrupted field guidance tour for the happiness of the people."Citing the snowy weather, one soldier told North Korea state TV: "A national tragedy has occurred; how could the sky not cry?Another said: "The people, the mountains, the streams and the heavens are weeping tears of blood for having to bid the final farewell."State media have sought to burnish Kim Jong-il's reputation as an inspired military leader who brought prosperity and progress to what, by any measure, is one of the world's poorest countries.Kim Jong-il, who died from a heart attack on 17 December aged 69, left behind a country that is some way towards developing nuclear weapons as part of his "military first" policy.As soon as Kim's death was announced last Monday - two days after the fact - there were fears that North Korean military elites, resentful of the younger Kim's rapid rise to power, could block his accession and plunge the country into chaos.Jong-un, who is aged 28 or 29, had a little over a year to prepare for power after his first public appearance at a military parade in October 2010.Fears of a political vacuum appear to have been allayed, however, with senior military and Workers' party officials reportedly pledging loyalty to Jong-un.North Korean media have started referring to him as "supreme commander" of the armed forces; the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers' party, has also described Jong-un as the head of the party's central committee, one of the country's most powerful decision-making bodies. On Wednesday, the state media declared that the country was in the "warm care" of Jong-un.Kim Jong-un will be advised by a small group of "senior revolutionaries", including his aunt and uncle, whose first task will be to ensure stability at least until the country marks the centenary of Kim Il-sung's birth next April.Kim Jong-il had been expected to use the anniversary to pronounce North Korea a "strong and prosperous nation" and a bona fide nuclear power.Jong-un will continue to pursue the military-first policy of his father, according to Jeon Hyun-jun of the Korea Institute for National Unification."North Korea's economic crisis and security problems will not be solved easily in the future," he wrote in a commentary for the Daily NK website, adding that the term "military first" had appeared 21 times in Rodong Sinmun editorials on 22 December alone.Jeon said he believed the party and military will not oppose their new leader; the weakest link, he says, are the people, whose loyalty to the regime has been weakened by glaring faults in the food distribution system."We must not fall into the trap of using a hardline policy towards North Korea," Jeon wrote. "Rather, we must let it be known that the rice of the North Korean people is not given by their general or supreme leader, but by the US and South Korea. We are in great need of a strategic plan."The younger Kim will inherit a country that is close to mounting nuclear warheads on its ballistic missiles, according to a US expert.Larry Niksch, who spent 43 years monitoring North Korea for the US congressional research service, said in a study that the regime could miniaturise and mount a nuclear warhead on a medium-range Nodong missile within one or two years.Siegfried Hecker, the former head of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said last year that the North's uranium enrichment programme was more advanced than previously thought.Hecker, who visited North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex in November 2010, believes the country would have to conduct a third nuclear test - the first two were conducted in 2006 and 2009 - to be certain its warhead technology was sound."If the test is successful they may be able to have the capability within a couple of years," he told Reuters. "We simply don't know what else they have and how much highly enriched uranium they can make or have made."Before the funeral coverage started, about four hours later than scheduled, North Korean state TV was showing archive footage of Kim Jong-il's early days as leader, including his vaunted trips to farms and factories to offer "field guidance".Large portraits of a smiling Kim Jong-il could be seen around Pyongyang, reports said, with the streets bedecked with red "kimjongilia" begonias named after the deceased leader.In the 10 days since Kim Jong-il's death was announced, North Korean state TV has repeatedly broadcast scenes of uniformed soldiers and civilians in black suits or traditional dress falling to their knees in distress before the bier where the "dear leader" has been lying in state.In a startling break with tradition, his son was shown in obvious distress as he wiped away tears during one of a reported five visits he has made the mausoleum in just over a week.It was not immediate clear if Kim Jong-il would be buried or embalmed and placed on permanent display next to the body of his father at Kumsusan memorial palace in Pyongyang.The funeral proceedings are expected to last two days. On Thursday, a national memorial service will feature an artillery salute to be followed by a three minutes' silence at noon and trains and ships sounding their horns in unison.
