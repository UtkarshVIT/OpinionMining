The falling value of the pound against the euro is forcing many British tourists to soak up the sunshine in Egypt and Turkey rather than Spain and Greece, accor­ding to a report.A survey by the Foreign Office and the Association of British Travel Agents found that the number of people ­booking a summer holiday in Egypt was up 38% and Turkey was up 32%, even as traditional holiday spots such as Spain remained "stable".An Abta spokesman said the immediate cause has been the effect of the credit crunch on disposable incomes in the UK and the falling value of the pound against the euro. Increased investment in tourism infrastructure by the governments of countries such as Egypt had also helped make them more attractive destinations."You have so many all inclusive deals at good rates to countries like Egypt, and you spend very little money once you get there, which makes it very attractive," he said.The number of people booking holidays to Turkey reached 2 million, while 1 million people bought packages to Egypt. This is still well short of the 12 million people who go to Spain every year, but the numbers have been ­growing steadily.The Abta spokesman said the eurozone was still the most popular destination by a long margin, with traditional hot spots Spain, Greece and France still going strong. There was even a slight increase in the number of tourists to those countries this year, which Abta attributed to holidays being planned in advance."The travel and tourism industry is usually about six months behind economic trends," he said. "The next year will be an interesting one."January is usually the busiest time for travel agents, with most people planning their summer holidays at the start of the year. Abta expects this January to set the tone for the industry for the rest of the year.On the flip side, the UK has become a hot spot for tourists, especially people looking for bargains on the high street. "Based on anecdotal evidence, I would say domestic tourism is doing pretty well," Sean Tipton from Abta said. "London is becoming quite a shopping destination for people from continental Europe and America."
