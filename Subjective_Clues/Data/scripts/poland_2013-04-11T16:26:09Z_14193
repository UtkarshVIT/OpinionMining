Festival name: Off Plus Camera – International Festival of Independent CinemaLocation: Krakow, PolandWebsite: www.offpluscamera.comDates: annually,12-21 April 2013About: This increasingly dynamic festival of independent cinema is geared towards young and debut directors. Taking place in the picturesque southern Polish city of Krakow, the festival is staged in former palaces – such as the Pod Baranami cinema and Kino ARS just off the main square – and, to a lesser extent, at all seven of the city's other art-house cinemas. This year's festival will also offer rooftop screenings, "for those who like extreme sports", according to the artistic director. By attracting more sponsors and by vastly improving organisation and publicity, Off Plus Camera has developed rapidly under the auspices of festival director, Szymon Miszczak; artistic director, Ania Trzebiatowska (who formerly worked on BBC's Arena); and Poland's brilliant young film-critic, Michał Oleszczyk.This year's sixth festival promises to be the best yet, with more than 100 films, 300 screenings and 200 festival guests. Categories include Black American Cinema (from Shaft to Jackie Brown), New Italian Cinema (Bellocchio's Dormant Beauty stars), Polish feature films and shorts, Faces of Crisis (including Ektoras Lygizos' Boy Eating the Bird's Food) and Dark Stars Rising (Andy Warhol's Dracula and William Lustig's Maniac, among them). Above all, 12 directors – including Shane Carruth with Upstream Color, Daniel Hoesl with Soldate Jeannette, and Michael Noer with Northwest – will be competing for the international dramatic competition Making Way with a $100,000 (£65,000) prize. The four-person jury includes the UK's John Rhys-Davies and Ruth Meyers, and is chaired by one of Poland's leading directors, Lech Majewski. A panel of international critics will select their favourite film, while a new Off CameraPro Industry section will offer 12 workshops run by industry professionals, and aimed at directors, producers and distributors. Melissa Leo will accept the special Against the Current award.Throw in well-attended nightly parties at lovely venues, a lavish closing gala and buffet, a special guest in the guise of actor and film-maker Josh Hartnett, not to mention the opportunity of wandering around this beautiful city between screenings, and you'll begin to see why Off Plus Camera is set to become an unmissable event on the European festival circuit.
