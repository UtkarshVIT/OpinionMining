I\u2019ve been inspired by how much progress India has made in building a strong nation and the largest democracy in the world, and I look forward to strengthening my connection to the country.\u201dFrom the start, the project has raised questions about net neutrality and just how much control Facebook will have over the internet access it brings and whether it would charge more to visit certain sites.As the venture capitalist Om Malik wrote: \u201cI am suspicious of any for-profit company arguing its good intentions and its free gifts.\u201dSilicon Valley, home to some 90,000 Indians, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, reacted swiftly with a collective shudder. As did Indian entrepreneurs.\u201cThe bottom-line is that this ban on differential pricing was not decided by some elitist group of activists who have some un-articulated vested interest to prevent India\u2019s poor folks to come online but by TRAI in an extraordinary democratic process that was both rigorous and comprehensive,\u201d wrote Sumanth Raghavendra, an entrepreneur at Deck App Technologies, a Bangalore-based startup. \u201cAnd remarkably courageous.\u201dOther members of Andreessen\u2019s venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, however, defended the message.8/ Instead the (understandable) anti-colonialist overreaction threw out the capitalist baby with the colonialist bathwater.Another member of the influential firm, Benedict Evans, joked about what he sees as a history of inefficiency in India technological policy:\u2018I don\u2019t understand why people complain about the phones. The 10 year waiting list shows how popular they are\u2019Indian minister, early 1980sIt\u2019s not the first time Silicon Valley has stumbled on clumsy statements about India. Last year, Airbnb cofounder Brian Chesky wrote that  Gandhi wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if India, back then, had tried to limit rentals to a minimum of 30 days.Nor is it the first time Facebook\u2019s political efforts have fallen short. Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s much ballyhooed FWD.us has largely collapsed. By comparing Free Basics to colonialism, Andreessen, an investor in companies like Airbnb and Facebook, drew an interesting parallel between Silicon Valley\u2019s concept of \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 which often comes with strings attached \u2013 and the American history of colonial rule.He was arguing that Silicon Valley is colonial by nature, giving the gift of something free in exchange for a tax of data and control which people don\u2019t quite realize they\u2019re providing. This desire to own and control is often presented by tech evangelists in terms of freedom, equality, and access \u2013 Internet.org, as Facebook calls the umbrella effort under which is puts Free Basics, is not a non-profit. It is a for-profit arm of a for-profit company. Adding the \u201c.org\u201d may have an impact on public opinion or confuse journalists, but the fact remains that Free Basics was an effort for Facebook to make money.By Wednesday morning, apparently chastened by the uproar intense enough to make Andreessen a trending topic in south-east Asia, and with a public relations disaster looming for Facebook, the venture capitalist backtracked.1/Last night on Twitter, I made an ill-informed and ill-advised comment about Indian politics and economics.2/To be clear, I am 100% opposed to colonialism, and 100% in favor of independence and freedom, in any country, including India.3/I am a huge admirer of the nation of India and the Indian people, who have been nothing but kind and generous to me for many years.4/I apologize for any offense my comment caused, and withdraw it in full and without reservation.5/I will leave all future commentary on all of these topics to people with more knowledge and experience than me.Other members of his firm, Benedict Evans and Balaji S Srinivasan, have not retracted their statements.

How dare you imply otherwise? No.\u201dOn 8 February, India\u2019s telecoms regulator blocked services such as Facebook\u2019s Free Basics, a scheme to offer a small selection of low-bandwidth apps for free to users in the developing world. Net neutrality campaigners have opposed the service, which already operates in 16 other countries, because they say Facebook and its telecoms partners have too much control over which apps can be included, and should not be given what is effectively priority access to a developing market.The general argument for it in Silicon Valley has been that, yes, it comes with potentially unsavory strings attached, but it\u2019s free, and it\u2019s better than nothing.When the news came that India had rejected Facebook, board member and investor Andreessen tweeted the missive that echoed around the world: \u201cAnti-Colonialism has been economically catastrophic for India for decades. Why stop now?\u201dOne sunny San Francisco day later \u2013 after Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg was forced to publicly disavow the tweet \u2013 Sharma was calling in on Arvind Gupta, who invests in and guides a group of early stage startups at his accelerator IndieBio. Their conversation quickly shifted to Free Basics and Andreessen\u2019s message. Culturally, Indians tend to be very wary of strangers bringing gifts in the guise of tradeGupta said he felt Facebook\u2019s stumble was partly due to distance and being out of touch with Indian people.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think this is a good idea 5,000 miles away in your nice apartment,\u201d Gupta said. Sharma saw it as part of a broader issue of homogeneity in Silicon Valley, a region run by a narrow set of oligarchs who famously eschew hiring women or people of color. \u201cWhy is the Valley suddenly so tone deaf? Well, look how badly the Valley does on inclusion in hiring. Bias is the norm here,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cWhy is the Indian user any less capable than anyone else? Why do they have different needs than you do? They don\u2019t. But that thinking is all part of the same problem.\u201dSome Indian leaders in Silicon Valley, though, argue that too much is being made of Andreessen\u2019s comment. Related: Mark Zuckerberg chides board member over 'deeply upsetting' India comments Venky Ganesan, managing director of local investment firm Menlo Ventures, said that Free Basics could seem quite a bit like colonialism: a gift in exchange for some of your freedom. \u201cThe historical dimension that most American companies might not fully appreciate is that Indian schoolchildren, including me when I grew up, are taught that the colonization of India started with the East India Company coming to trade,\u201d Ganesan said. \u201cCulturally, Indians tend to be very wary of strangers bringing gifts in the guise of trade.\u201dBut Ganesan felt the international outrage to Andreessen\u2019s message was overblown: \u201cHonestly the reaction to Marc\u2019s tweets is a tempest in a teapot ... People need to relax.\u201d\u201cFacebook was trying to provide free access to content to the poor in India in a manner that both benefited them and the poor,\u201d Ganesan wrote. \u201cIs some access better than no access? That\u2019s the question.\u201dThis privileged assumption that oh the poor need this, the poor should be happy with this, it\u2019s set us back by yearsAnd, in a way, much of Silicon Valley is a form of colonialism. Facebook, Twitter, Google and the rest offer a free service in exchange for control. Resistance becomes more difficult than assimilation, and so the trade doesn\u2019t seem too bad.Nor are Facebook\u2019s efforts historically unique in western dealings with India, writes historian David Arnold in his book on the topic: \u201cFaith in Britain\u2019s capacity to modernize and civilize India was always fraught with multiple contradictions, among them a recurrent belief that Indians were unready (or unfit) to receive the benefits of scientific modernity, a determination to deny India the competitive advantages that full access to modern science and technology might entail, and a romantically tinged anti-industrialism, in which India was destined to remain a land of princes, peasants and artisans, spared the ugliness and turmoil of modern industrial society.\u201d Back at IndieBio, an industrial office space with a high-end research lab in the basement and, upstairs, some leftover snacks and name tags from an earlier party, Sharma and Gupta agreed Facebook was fighting a losing battle. In the early days of the internet in America, telecommunications companies like AT&T tried to create walled internets in the US, too, Gupta recalled, adding that he worked on some of them and that the strategy obviously hadn\u2019t worked.Sharma said this would set India and Silicon Valley relations back. \u201cI know the entire Facebook team behind this. I know their intention, but why do this?\u201d Sharma wondered. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the companies in India are saints, but we\u2019re just beginning to step out of that. And now this privileged set of assumptions that oh the poor need this, the poor should be happy with this, it\u2019s set us all back by years.\u201dAndreessen, whose venture capital firm has invested $4.3bn in companies like Airbnb and Skype and may be the most powerful investment group in the valley, stirred controversy in the fall when a seemingly-arbitrary group of women and people of color realized he had \u201cblocked\u201d them on Twitter, or made it so they couldn\u2019t read his messages. \u201cHas Marc blocked you yet?\u201d Sharma asked. \u201cHe\u2019s blocked me.\u201d", "tags": ["Facebook", "Silicon Valley", "Technology", "Venture capital", "India", "US news", "Business", "Social networking", "South and Central Asia"], "title": "Marc Andreessen's 'colonialism' gaffe?

Why stop now?\u201dOne sunny San Francisco day later \u2013 after Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg was forced to publicly disavow the tweet \u2013 Sharma was calling in on Arvind Gupta, who invests in and guides a group of early stage startups at his accelerator IndieBio. Their conversation quickly shifted to Free Basics and Andreessen\u2019s message.

Sharma saw it as part of a broader issue of homogeneity in Silicon Valley, a region run by a narrow set of oligarchs who famously eschew hiring women or people of color. \u201cWhy is the Valley suddenly so tone deaf? Well, look how badly the Valley does on inclusion in hiring. Bias is the norm here,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cWhy is the Indian user any less capable than anyone else? Why do they have different needs than you do? They don\u2019t. But that thinking is all part of the same problem.\u201dSome Indian leaders in Silicon Valley, though, argue that too much is being made of Andreessen\u2019s comment.

Facebook, Twitter, Google and the rest offer a free service in exchange for control. Resistance becomes more difficult than assimilation, and so the trade doesn\u2019t seem too bad.Nor are Facebook\u2019s efforts historically unique in western dealings with India, writes historian David Arnold in his book on the topic: \u201cFaith in Britain\u2019s capacity to modernize and civilize India was always fraught with multiple contradictions, among them a recurrent belief that Indians were unready (or unfit) to receive the benefits of scientific modernity, a determination to deny India the competitive advantages that full access to modern science and technology might entail, and a romantically tinged anti-industrialism, in which India was destined to remain a land of princes, peasants and artisans, spared the ugliness and turmoil of modern industrial society.\u201d Back at IndieBio, an industrial office space with a high-end research lab in the basement and, upstairs, some leftover snacks and name tags from an earlier party, Sharma and Gupta agreed Facebook was fighting a losing battle. In the early days of the internet in America, telecommunications companies like AT&T tried to create walled internets in the US, too, Gupta recalled, adding that he worked on some of them and that the strategy obviously hadn\u2019t worked.Sharma said this would set India and Silicon Valley relations back. \u201cI know the entire Facebook team behind this.

I\u2019ve been inspired by how much progress India has made in building a strong nation and the largest democracy in the world, and I look forward to strengthening my connection to the country.\u201dFrom the start, the project has raised questions about net neutrality and just how much control Facebook will have over the internet access it brings and whether it would charge more to visit certain sites.As the venture capitalist Om Malik wrote: \u201cI am suspicious of any for-profit company arguing its good intentions and its free gifts.\u201dSilicon Valley, home to some 90,000 Indians, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, reacted swiftly with a collective shudder. As did Indian entrepreneurs.\u201cThe bottom-line is that this ban on differential pricing was not decided by some elitist group of activists who have some un-articulated vested interest to prevent India\u2019s poor folks to come online but by TRAI in an extraordinary democratic process that was both rigorous and comprehensive,\u201d wrote Sumanth Raghavendra, an entrepreneur at Deck App Technologies, a Bangalore-based startup. \u201cAnd remarkably courageous.\u201dOther members of Andreessen\u2019s venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, however, defended the message.8/ Instead the (understandable) anti-colonialist overreaction threw out the capitalist baby with the colonialist bathwater.Another member of the influential firm, Benedict Evans, joked about what he sees as a history of inefficiency in India technological policy:\u2018I don\u2019t understand why people complain about the phones. The 10 year waiting list shows how popular they are\u2019Indian minister, early 1980sIt\u2019s not the first time Silicon Valley has stumbled on clumsy statements about India. Last year, Airbnb cofounder Brian Chesky wrote that  Gandhi wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if India, back then, had tried to limit rentals to a minimum of 30 days.Nor is it the first time Facebook\u2019s political efforts have fallen short. Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s much ballyhooed FWD.us has largely collapsed. By comparing Free Basics to colonialism, Andreessen, an investor in companies like Airbnb and Facebook, drew an interesting parallel between Silicon Valley\u2019s concept of \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 which often comes with strings attached \u2013 and the American history of colonial rule.He was arguing that Silicon Valley is colonial by nature, giving the gift of something free in exchange for a tax of data and control which people don\u2019t quite realize they\u2019re providing. This desire to own and control is often presented by tech evangelists in terms of freedom, equality, and access \u2013 Internet.org, as Facebook calls the umbrella effort under which is puts Free Basics, is not a non-profit. It is a for-profit arm of a for-profit company. Adding the \u201c.org\u201d may have an impact on public opinion or confuse journalists, but the fact remains that Free Basics was an effort for Facebook to make money.By Wednesday morning, apparently chastened by the uproar intense enough to make Andreessen a trending topic in south-east Asia, and with a public relations disaster looming for Facebook, the venture capitalist backtracked.1/Last night on Twitter, I made an ill-informed and ill-advised comment about Indian politics and economics.2/To be clear, I am 100% opposed to colonialism, and 100% in favor of independence and freedom, in any country, including India.3/I am a huge admirer of the nation of India and the Indian people, who have been nothing but kind and generous to me for many years.4/I apologize for any offense my comment caused, and withdraw it in full and without reservation.5/I will leave all future commentary on all of these topics to people with more knowledge and experience than me.Other members of his firm, Benedict Evans and Balaji S Srinivasan, have not retracted their statements.

The pope has also mentioned that the huge consumption of the developed world has repercussions on the developing world,\u201d Javadekar said.India\u2019s submission to the UN, known as its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), focuses on clean energy, including solar power, which the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has already strongly backed.

Last year, Airbnb cofounder Brian Chesky wrote that  Gandhi wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if India, back then, had tried to limit rentals to a minimum of 30 days.Nor is it the first time Facebook\u2019s political efforts have fallen short. Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s much ballyhooed FWD.us has largely collapsed. By comparing Free Basics to colonialism, Andreessen, an investor in companies like Airbnb and Facebook, drew an interesting parallel between Silicon Valley\u2019s concept of \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 which often comes with strings attached \u2013 and the American history of colonial rule.He was arguing that Silicon Valley is colonial by nature, giving the gift of something free in exchange for a tax of data and control which people don\u2019t quite realize they\u2019re providing. This desire to own and control is often presented by tech evangelists in terms of freedom, equality, and access \u2013 Internet.org, as Facebook calls the umbrella effort under which is puts Free Basics, is not a non-profit. It is a for-profit arm of a for-profit company. Adding the \u201c.org\u201d may have an impact on public opinion or confuse journalists, but the fact remains that Free Basics was an effort for Facebook to make money.By Wednesday morning, apparently chastened by the uproar intense enough to make Andreessen a trending topic in south-east Asia, and with a public relations disaster looming for Facebook, the venture capitalist backtracked.1/Last night on Twitter, I made an ill-informed and ill-advised comment about Indian politics and economics.2/To be clear, I am 100% opposed to colonialism, and 100% in favor of independence and freedom, in any country, including India.3/I am a huge admirer of the nation of India and the Indian people, who have been nothing but kind and generous to me for many years.4/I apologize for any offense my comment caused, and withdraw it in full and without reservation.5/I will leave all future commentary on all of these topics to people with more knowledge and experience than me.Other members of his firm, Benedict Evans and Balaji S Srinivasan, have not retracted their statements.

My wife, son, mother and I arrive early to witness the sunrise, to beat the heat and the exhausting crowds, and to touch the marble walls while they are still cool. Like countless visitors before us, we have our photograph taken in front of the Taj with postcard precision. Our smiles suggest a joy in our own adventures.Later that day we fly home to Bangalore in the south, where my family and I have been living. When the sun rises the following day, we find my mother lying dead on the floor of our flat.With the help of our extraordinary neighbours, a colonel in the Indian army and his wife, the panic of not knowing what steps to take with a dead relative in India is stilled, and within minutes friends and neighbours offer us solace. They knew we\u2019d been travelling with my mother and, to a person, their first words to us are, \u201cShe had a good death.\u201dI\u2019d lost loved ones before, most after long, painful illnesses with lingering spells in hospitals draining them of spirit and vigour. I didn\u2019t believe there was such a thing as a good death. But if I\u2019d known my mother was going to die on that sunny Sunday morning in February, I\u2019d probably have hoped it turned out exactly like it did.My mother, Kristine, had never had any desire to see India. She lived in Toronto, Canada, and the thought of visiting the dusty, crowded chaos of the Asian sub-continent was about as appealing to her as eating a five-alarm prawn curry for breakfast every morning. But as soon as I told her we planned to live for two years in India, she asked when it would be convenient for her to visit.She first travelled to Bangalore to see us in January, 2014, and we took her to Kerala for a backwater houseboat cruise, a delightful beach holiday on the Arabian Sea and a few days in ancient Kochi. Like so many other westerners, my mother was changed by India \u2013 she wrote in her journal that she was no longer afraid, feeling perfectly capable of flagging down an auto-rickshaw by herself and wishing she could share her new love of the country with those who would never get to see it \u2013 shedding her earlier apprehensions and anxious to return.For her second visit a year later, we planned a thrilling two weeks through Rajasthan, home of Mughal empires, distinctive art and architecture. This time she arrived excited and eager.On her last morning, she saw the Taj\u00a0Mahal at sunrise.While many senior citizens scramble\u00a0to meet the demands of their bucket list, Kristine crossed off items that she didn\u2019t even know were on a list, her joy\u00a0greater for the surprises.I knew my mother wanted to be cremated. There are better ways of using precious earth, she\u2019d told me, than burying people in it. And though she might have been happy to have her ashes left in India, it seemed only right that I take them home to Canada to scatter with all of her family present. Besides, it\u2019s easier to transport a small urn than a complete body.A cremation, it turns out, is easy to arrange in India where just obtaining a sim card requires a thick sheaf of paperwork, photo ID and the patience of a saint. It\u2019s also far more rewarding.At the crematorium, I sat with my mother\u2019s body in a quiet tiled room as we waited our turn \u2013 it was a busy day for cremations. Outside the window I heard crying and shouting and singing. The sounds of sadness were mixed with the unmistakable bustle of a collective, accompanied by the floral aromas of burning incense and garlands blanketing the white-bearded man\u2019s body, which was being washed by loved ones. This group was sad and happy, joyously celebrating a life while offering their shared grief to whomever was listening.Looking back at my mother lying there, covered discreetly with a plain white sheet, I thought something was missing. The Indian mourners outside grieved openly under the bright sun, celebrating despite their sorrow. Inside, it was solemn and melancholy. We found some flowers to place over and around her, allowing Kristine to end her bodily existence in a way that she surely would have appreciated since becoming so enraptured with the humanity of India.My friends and I carried her to the oven. I watched her body begin to burn before the door clanged shut.This never could have happened in the society in which I\u2019d grown up. My culture\u2019s habits in dealing with death are private, behind-the-scenes, all arrangements taken care of. If our loved ones are laid out for us to view, they are made beautiful. Funerals are, traditionally, solemn, mournful and gloomy occasions marked by kind reflections and \u201crespectful\u201d whispers. We don\u2019t want to risk offending the mourners or, even worse, the deceased.And when the bereaved are overcome by grief, we don\u2019t know how to react because we can\u2019t stand seeing people in pain. We want them to stop crying, stop wailing, stop sinking deeper and deeper into their own misery because we\u2019re sure that will make them feel better. But really we\u2019re just trying to make it easier for ourselves.With my mother\u2019s good death, accompanied by the celebratory way we dealt with her body, those of us who had lost her were given the permission to find happiness from the end of an extraordinary life. If I learned anything from my fellow Indian mourners, it\u2019s that it\u2019s much easier to be sad when there is joy.\u201cIt was all worth it,\u201d Kristine had said, looking out over the Yamuna river that arcs quietly behind the Taj like a swooping brush-stroke.It wasn\u2019t just the trek through the desert on camels, trains and bicycles, scaling hilltop forts and palaces, waking up before dawn and driving through the dark to the Taj that was worth it. To her, at that moment, everything in her life was worth it. And she\u2019d been able to share the whole adventure with her family.Jon Magidsohn\u2019s book, Immortal Highway, will be published shortly by Iguana. jonmagidsohn.com/memoir/", "tags": ["Family", "Death and dying", "Parents and parenting", "Bereavement", "Life and style"], "title": "My mother\u2019s good death in India"},{"date": "2015-10-02T06:57:24Z", "content": "India, the world\u2019s third biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has pledged to source 40% of its electricity from renewable and other low-carbon sources by 2030.It is the last major economy, following 140 other countries including China, the US and the EU, to submit a climate change plan to the UN before international talks to reach a deal on tackling global warming in Paris this December.Campaigners welcomed the commitment to cut the \u201cemissions intensity\u201d of its economy \u2013 a ratio of carbon emissions per unit of GDP \u2013 by up to 35% by 2030. India\u2019s population of 1.2 billion, about 363 million of whom live in poverty, is projected to grow to 1.5 billion by 2030. \u201cIt is estimated that more than half of India of 2030 is yet to be built,\u201d India\u2019s submission claimed.The country has previously pledged an emissions intensity cut of up to 25% by 2020.Prakash Javadekar, India\u2019s environment minister, said: \u201cThough India is not part of the problem, it wants to be part of the solution.

The pope has also mentioned that the huge consumption of the developed world has repercussions on the developing world,\u201d Javadekar said.India\u2019s submission to the UN, known as its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), focuses on clean energy, including solar power, which the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has already strongly backed. It also promised to plant more forests by 2030 to absorb carbon emissions.Modi has repeatedly said India would not accept constraints on its development as part of any climate deal. Unlike China\u2019s submission to the UN in June, India\u2019s does not spell out when its emissions might peak.Most environment groups and thinktanks said the plan, which was submitted to the UN late on Thursday, was good and recognised the impacts global warming would have on India.Rhea Suh, the president of the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said: \u201cIndia\u2019s strong climate plan offers a comprehensive approach to curb the worst impacts of climate change.\u201dGermana Canzi, an analyst at UK-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, hailed India\u2019s pledge as significant and said: \u201cThe path of that India will now take in its development is extremely important for the future of the climate, particularly as the country is set to surpass China to become the world\u2019s most populous country by 2028, with 1.45 billion people.\u201dNitin Pandit, CEO of the World Resources Institute in India, said: \u201cAs one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, India recognises the domestic benefits of confronting this issue. Its climate plan does a good job combining opportunities to reduce emissions in the near term, and it includes clear goals to restore landscapes that will bring long-term benefits.\u201dBut Durwood Zaelke, a climate change expert and long-time campaigner on the need to phase out climate-changing gases such as HFCs as part of the effort against global warming, said India \u201ccould do much better\u201d, and \u201ceasily\u201d, if it agreed to phase out HFCs, which are used in air conditioning. Unlike the largely dry language of submissions by the US and EU, India\u2019s contains colourful passages explaining its attitude towards the environment, citing its long tradition of a harmonious relationship between man and nature. Mahatma Gandhi is invoked several times, including his comment that \u201cEarth has enough resources to meet people\u2019s needs, but will never have enough to satisfy people\u2019s greed.\u201dThe Philippines also made an informal indication of its plans to cut its carbon emissions by 70% by 2030 but only if it receives financial assistance, a presidential aide told Reuters news agency on Friday.An analysis of 140 countries\u2019 pledges to the UN so far found this week that they would see temperatures rise to 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Governments at previous climate talks have committed to holding rises to 2C.The quest for a deal in Paris is intensifying, according to Laurence Tubiana, the French ambassador for climate change, speaking during a Google hangout on Friday.She said that countries must come up with adequate emissions reductions, and that all countries - including the poorest - must be involved in the deal. An additional pre-meeting will also take place in Paris two weeks before the actual summit which starts on 30 November, she confirmed, in an attempt to iron out any remaining difficult issues in advance.\u2022 Additional reporting by Fiona Harvey", "tags": ["Climate change", "India", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Renewable energy", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Energy", "Environment", "South and Central Asia", "World news", "Global climate talks", "Nuclear power", "Coal", "Fossil fuels"], "title": "India unveils climate change plan"},{"date": "2016-02-12T06:00:11Z", "content": "After an irate Facebook board member wrote that India is better off under colonialism, many in Silicon Valley\u2019s large and influential Indian population were offended. \u201cPeople like [Facebook board member] Marc Andreessen are speaking from places of such massive privilege and are still so massively wrong,\u201d said Rohit Sharma, a venture capitalist with True Ventures, which has raised $878m. \u201cSomeone in India\u2019s needs are just the same as someone in San Francisco. How dare you imply otherwise? No.\u201dOn 8 February, India\u2019s telecoms regulator blocked services such as Facebook\u2019s Free Basics, a scheme to offer a small selection of low-bandwidth apps for free to users in the developing world. Net neutrality campaigners have opposed the service, which already operates in 16 other countries, because they say Facebook and its telecoms partners have too much control over which apps can be included, and should not be given what is effectively priority access to a developing market.The general argument for it in Silicon Valley has been that, yes, it comes with potentially unsavory strings attached, but it\u2019s free, and it\u2019s better than nothing.When the news came that India had rejected Facebook, board member and investor Andreessen tweeted the missive that echoed around the world: \u201cAnti-Colonialism has been economically catastrophic for India for decades. Why stop now?\u201dOne sunny San Francisco day later \u2013 after Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg was forced to publicly disavow the tweet \u2013 Sharma was calling in on Arvind Gupta, who invests in and guides a group of early stage startups at his accelerator IndieBio. Their conversation quickly shifted to Free Basics and Andreessen\u2019s message. Culturally, Indians tend to be very wary of strangers bringing gifts in the guise of tradeGupta said he felt Facebook\u2019s stumble was partly due to distance and being out of touch with Indian people.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think this is a good idea 5,000 miles away in your nice apartment,\u201d Gupta said. Sharma saw it as part of a broader issue of homogeneity in Silicon Valley, a region run by a narrow set of oligarchs who famously eschew hiring women or people of color. \u201cWhy is the Valley suddenly so tone deaf? Well, look how badly the Valley does on inclusion in hiring. Bias is the norm here,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cWhy is the Indian user any less capable than anyone else? Why do they have different needs than you do? They don\u2019t. But that thinking is all part of the same problem.\u201dSome Indian leaders in Silicon Valley, though, argue that too much is being made of Andreessen\u2019s comment. Related: Mark Zuckerberg chides board member over 'deeply upsetting' India comments Venky Ganesan, managing director of local investment firm Menlo Ventures, said that Free Basics could seem quite a bit like colonialism: a gift in exchange for some of your freedom. \u201cThe historical dimension that most American companies might not fully appreciate is that Indian schoolchildren, including me when I grew up, are taught that the colonization of India started with the East India Company coming to trade,\u201d Ganesan said. \u201cCulturally, Indians tend to be very wary of strangers bringing gifts in the guise of trade.\u201dBut Ganesan felt the international outrage to Andreessen\u2019s message was overblown: \u201cHonestly the reaction to Marc\u2019s tweets is a tempest in a teapot ... People need to relax.\u201d\u201cFacebook was trying to provide free access to content to the poor in India in a manner that both benefited them and the poor,\u201d Ganesan wrote. \u201cIs some access better than no access? That\u2019s the question.\u201dThis privileged assumption that oh the poor need this, the poor should be happy with this, it\u2019s set us back by yearsAnd, in a way, much of Silicon Valley is a form of colonialism. Facebook, Twitter, Google and the rest offer a free service in exchange for control. Resistance becomes more difficult than assimilation, and so the trade doesn\u2019t seem too bad.Nor are Facebook\u2019s efforts historically unique in western dealings with India, writes historian David Arnold in his book on the topic: \u201cFaith in Britain\u2019s capacity to modernize and civilize India was always fraught with multiple contradictions, among them a recurrent belief that Indians were unready (or unfit) to receive the benefits of scientific modernity, a determination to deny India the competitive advantages that full access to modern science and technology might entail, and a romantically tinged anti-industrialism, in which India was destined to remain a land of princes, peasants and artisans, spared the ugliness and turmoil of modern industrial society.\u201d Back at IndieBio, an industrial office space with a high-end research lab in the basement and, upstairs, some leftover snacks and name tags from an earlier party, Sharma and Gupta agreed Facebook was fighting a losing battle. In the early days of the internet in America, telecommunications companies like AT&T tried to create walled internets in the US, too, Gupta recalled, adding that he worked on some of them and that the strategy obviously hadn\u2019t worked.Sharma said this would set India and Silicon Valley relations back. \u201cI know the entire Facebook team behind this. I know their intention, but why do this?\u201d Sharma wondered. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the companies in India are saints, but we\u2019re just beginning to step out of that. And now this privileged set of assumptions that oh the poor need this, the poor should be happy with this, it\u2019s set us all back by years.\u201dAndreessen, whose venture capital firm has invested $4.3bn in companies like Airbnb and Skype and may be the most powerful investment group in the valley, stirred controversy in the fall when a seemingly-arbitrary group of women and people of color realized he had \u201cblocked\u201d them on Twitter, or made it so they couldn\u2019t read his messages. \u201cHas Marc blocked you yet?\u201d Sharma asked. \u201cHe\u2019s blocked me.\u201d", "tags": ["Facebook", "Silicon Valley", "Technology", "Venture capital", "India", "US news", "Business", "Social networking", "South and Central Asia"], "title": "Marc Andreessen's 'colonialism' gaffe?

By comparing Free Basics to colonialism, Andreessen, an investor in companies like Airbnb and Facebook, drew an interesting parallel between Silicon Valley\u2019s concept of \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 which often comes with strings attached \u2013 and the American history of colonial rule.He was arguing that Silicon Valley is colonial by nature, giving the gift of something free in exchange for a tax of data and control which people don\u2019t quite realize they\u2019re providing. This desire to own and control is often presented by tech evangelists in terms of freedom, equality, and access \u2013 Internet.org, as Facebook calls the umbrella effort under which is puts Free Basics, is not a non-profit. It is a for-profit arm of a for-profit company. Adding the \u201c.org\u201d may have an impact on public opinion or confuse journalists, but the fact remains that Free Basics was an effort for Facebook to make money.By Wednesday morning, apparently chastened by the uproar intense enough to make Andreessen a trending topic in south-east Asia, and with a public relations disaster looming for Facebook, the venture capitalist backtracked.1/Last night on Twitter, I made an ill-informed and ill-advised comment about Indian politics and economics.2/To be clear, I am 100% opposed to colonialism, and 100% in favor of independence and freedom, in any country, including India.3/I am a huge admirer of the nation of India and the Indian people, who have been nothing but kind and generous to me for many years.4/I apologize for any offense my comment caused, and withdraw it in full and without reservation.5/I will leave all future commentary on all of these topics to people with more knowledge and experience than me.Other members of his firm, Benedict Evans and Balaji S Srinivasan, have not retracted their statements.

My wife, son, mother and I arrive early to witness the sunrise, to beat the heat and the exhausting crowds, and to touch the marble walls while they are still cool. Like countless visitors before us, we have our photograph taken in front of the Taj with postcard precision. Our smiles suggest a joy in our own adventures.Later that day we fly home to Bangalore in the south, where my family and I have been living. When the sun rises the following day, we find my mother lying dead on the floor of our flat.With the help of our extraordinary neighbours, a colonel in the Indian army and his wife, the panic of not knowing what steps to take with a dead relative in India is stilled, and within minutes friends and neighbours offer us solace. They knew we\u2019d been travelling with my mother and, to a person, their first words to us are, \u201cShe had a good death.\u201dI\u2019d lost loved ones before, most after long, painful illnesses with lingering spells in hospitals draining them of spirit and vigour. I didn\u2019t believe there was such a thing as a good death. But if I\u2019d known my mother was going to die on that sunny Sunday morning in February, I\u2019d probably have hoped it turned out exactly like it did.My mother, Kristine, had never had any desire to see India. She lived in Toronto, Canada, and the thought of visiting the dusty, crowded chaos of the Asian sub-continent was about as appealing to her as eating a five-alarm prawn curry for breakfast every morning. But as soon as I told her we planned to live for two years in India, she asked when it would be convenient for her to visit.She first travelled to Bangalore to see us in January, 2014, and we took her to Kerala for a backwater houseboat cruise, a delightful beach holiday on the Arabian Sea and a few days in ancient Kochi. Like so many other westerners, my mother was changed by India \u2013 she wrote in her journal that she was no longer afraid, feeling perfectly capable of flagging down an auto-rickshaw by herself and wishing she could share her new love of the country with those who would never get to see it \u2013 shedding her earlier apprehensions and anxious to return.For her second visit a year later, we planned a thrilling two weeks through Rajasthan, home of Mughal empires, distinctive art and architecture. This time she arrived excited and eager.On her last morning, she saw the Taj\u00a0Mahal at sunrise.While many senior citizens scramble\u00a0to meet the demands of their bucket list, Kristine crossed off items that she didn\u2019t even know were on a list, her joy\u00a0greater for the surprises.I knew my mother wanted to be cremated. There are better ways of using precious earth, she\u2019d told me, than burying people in it. And though she might have been happy to have her ashes left in India, it seemed only right that I take them home to Canada to scatter with all of her family present. Besides, it\u2019s easier to transport a small urn than a complete body.A cremation, it turns out, is easy to arrange in India where just obtaining a sim card requires a thick sheaf of paperwork, photo ID and the patience of a saint. It\u2019s also far more rewarding.At the crematorium, I sat with my mother\u2019s body in a quiet tiled room as we waited our turn \u2013 it was a busy day for cremations. Outside the window I heard crying and shouting and singing. The sounds of sadness were mixed with the unmistakable bustle of a collective, accompanied by the floral aromas of burning incense and garlands blanketing the white-bearded man\u2019s body, which was being washed by loved ones. This group was sad and happy, joyously celebrating a life while offering their shared grief to whomever was listening.Looking back at my mother lying there, covered discreetly with a plain white sheet, I thought something was missing. The Indian mourners outside grieved openly under the bright sun, celebrating despite their sorrow. Inside, it was solemn and melancholy. We found some flowers to place over and around her, allowing Kristine to end her bodily existence in a way that she surely would have appreciated since becoming so enraptured with the humanity of India.My friends and I carried her to the oven. I watched her body begin to burn before the door clanged shut.This never could have happened in the society in which I\u2019d grown up. My culture\u2019s habits in dealing with death are private, behind-the-scenes, all arrangements taken care of. If our loved ones are laid out for us to view, they are made beautiful. Funerals are, traditionally, solemn, mournful and gloomy occasions marked by kind reflections and \u201crespectful\u201d whispers. We don\u2019t want to risk offending the mourners or, even worse, the deceased.And when the bereaved are overcome by grief, we don\u2019t know how to react because we can\u2019t stand seeing people in pain. We want them to stop crying, stop wailing, stop sinking deeper and deeper into their own misery because we\u2019re sure that will make them feel better. But really we\u2019re just trying to make it easier for ourselves.With my mother\u2019s good death, accompanied by the celebratory way we dealt with her body, those of us who had lost her were given the permission to find happiness from the end of an extraordinary life. If I learned anything from my fellow Indian mourners, it\u2019s that it\u2019s much easier to be sad when there is joy.\u201cIt was all worth it,\u201d Kristine had said, looking out over the Yamuna river that arcs quietly behind the Taj like a swooping brush-stroke.It wasn\u2019t just the trek through the desert on camels, trains and bicycles, scaling hilltop forts and palaces, waking up before dawn and driving through the dark to the Taj that was worth it. To her, at that moment, everything in her life was worth it. And she\u2019d been able to share the whole adventure with her family.Jon Magidsohn\u2019s book, Immortal Highway, will be published shortly by Iguana. jonmagidsohn.com/memoir/", "tags": ["Family", "Death and dying", "Parents and parenting", "Bereavement", "Life and style"], "title": "My mother\u2019s good death in India"},{"date": "2016-01-13T16:57:39Z", "content": "Pakistan said it had arrested members of the Islamist terror group widely blamed for a four-day attack on an airbase in India that threatened to wreck a thaw in relations between the two countries.Islamabad announced on Wednesday that several individuals belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) had been arrested based on information supplied by India and Pakistan\u2019s own investigations.\u201cThe offices of the organisation are also being traced and sealed,\u201d said a statement from the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif.The government said Pakistan was considering sending its own investigators to Pathankot, where six gunmen assaulted an airbase on 2 January, killing seven soldiers.Past crackdowns on JeM ultimately failed to dismantle an organisation that continues to operate openly in Pakistan through its charity wing and numerous publications.Wednesday\u2019s announcement is nonetheless a potentially significant step against an organisation long patronised by Pakistan\u2019s military establishment as a proxy force against India.The announcement was cheered by peace campaigners, who feared the Pathankot incident had been deliberately mounted to derail a renewal of high-level diplomatic engagement between the two south Asian countries, which have fought four wars since independence in 1947.India\u2019s foreign secretary, Subrahmanyam Jaisankar, is due to travel to Islamabad on Friday to discuss the resumption of the peace process between the neighbouring states, which has been stalled since the Mumbai terror attacks launched by Pakistan-based terrorists on targets in India\u2019s commercial capital in 2008.The meeting has hung in the balance as Delhi waited to see whether Islamabad would respond to the demand by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for Islamabad to take \u201cfirm and immediate\u201d action against those responsible for planning the Pathankot attack.Many analysts suspect the incident, and an assault by gunmen on an Indian consulate in Afghanistan on 3 January, were deliberately intended to spoil historic overtures Modi made on 25 December during a surprise visit to the Pakistani city of Lahore.Some even feared that Pakistan\u2019s powerful military establishment, rumoured to be unhappy with Sharif\u2019s determination for rapid rapprochement with India, may have authorised the attacks.JeM has long been associated with Pakistan\u2019s military intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which used the group as a proxy force to launch attacks inside Indian-held Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state that Pakistan claims for itself.Masood Azhar, the group\u2019s leader, was arrested in the aftermath of a JeM assault on India\u2019s parliament in 2001, but a court released him the following year.Imtiaz Alam, the head of the South Asia Free Media Association, which campaigns for peace between the two countries, said the JeM arrests showed the military were serious in their oft-stated claim to be cracking down on all terrorist groups.\u201cThey are no more supported, even if some elements may have become autonomous and are doing their own private practice,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is a very good omen that Pakistan is taking the investigation seriously. Even hawks like the Indian home minister says he has confidence in the Pakistani investigation.\u201dModi, a Hindu nationalist who won power in a landslide victory in 2014, has repeatedly surprised observers with a series of unorthodox initiatives aimed at engaging with his counterpart in Pakistan.He invited Sharif to his inauguration ceremony, but then allowed the armed forces to take part in a major artillery duel with their Pakistani counterparts after clashes along the contested border.Senior officials later said that both moves had been designed to test Pakistan\u2019s reactions and gauge the strength of its military\u2019s influence on security and foreign policy.The Pathankot assault, which dragged on for days before all the attackers were killed, has prompted fierce domestic criticism of India\u2019s security agenciesand the national security adviser, Ajit Doval.Newspapers have reported poor perimeter security, coordination and decision-making \u2013 the Indian Express described \u201cglaring gaps in planning, command, training and equipment\u201d \u2013 and ministers have been accused of making a series of misleading statements.Underlining the complexity of evolving threats from terrorism in the region, Pakistan suffered an attack on one of its diplomatic missions on Wednesday when three attackers attempted to storm the consulate in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.Local officials said at least seven members of the Afghan security forces were killed in an assault claimed by Islamic State, which has secured a foothold in Nangarhar.The group claimed the attackers had succeeded in killing \u201cseveral Pakistani intelligence officers\u201d, but Islamabad said all of its staff were safe.Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri in Kabul", "tags": ["Pakistan", "India", "Kashmir", "Afghanistan", "Narendra Modi", "Mumbai terror attacks", "South and Central Asia", "World news"], "title": "Pakistan arrests Jaish-e-Mohammad members over India airbase attack"},{"date": "2015-10-02T06:57:24Z", "content": "India, the world\u2019s third biggest greenhouse gas emitter, has pledged to source 40% of its electricity from renewable and other low-carbon sources by 2030.It is the last major economy, following 140 other countries including China, the US and the EU, to submit a climate change plan to the UN before international talks to reach a deal on tackling global warming in Paris this December.Campaigners welcomed the commitment to cut the \u201cemissions intensity\u201d of its economy \u2013 a ratio of carbon emissions per unit of GDP \u2013 by up to 35% by 2030. India\u2019s population of 1.2 billion, about 363 million of whom live in poverty, is projected to grow to 1.5 billion by 2030. \u201cIt is estimated that more than half of India of 2030 is yet to be built,\u201d India\u2019s submission claimed.The country has previously pledged an emissions intensity cut of up to 25% by 2020.Prakash Javadekar, India\u2019s environment minister, said: \u201cThough India is not part of the problem, it wants to be part of the solution.

The pope has also mentioned that the huge consumption of the developed world has repercussions on the developing world,\u201d Javadekar said.India\u2019s submission to the UN, known as its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), focuses on clean energy, including solar power, which the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has already strongly backed. It also promised to plant more forests by 2030 to absorb carbon emissions.Modi has repeatedly said India would not accept constraints on its development as part of any climate deal. Unlike China\u2019s submission to the UN in June, India\u2019s does not spell out when its emissions might peak.Most environment groups and thinktanks said the plan, which was submitted to the UN late on Thursday, was good and recognised the impacts global warming would have on India.Rhea Suh, the president of the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said: \u201cIndia\u2019s strong climate plan offers a comprehensive approach to curb the worst impacts of climate change.\u201dGermana Canzi, an analyst at UK-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, hailed India\u2019s pledge as significant and said: \u201cThe path of that India will now take in its development is extremely important for the future of the climate, particularly as the country is set to surpass China to become the world\u2019s most populous country by 2028, with 1.45 billion people.\u201dNitin Pandit, CEO of the World Resources Institute in India, said: \u201cAs one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, India recognises the domestic benefits of confronting this issue. Its climate plan does a good job combining opportunities to reduce emissions in the near term, and it includes clear goals to restore landscapes that will bring long-term benefits.\u201dBut Durwood Zaelke, a climate change expert and long-time campaigner on the need to phase out climate-changing gases such as HFCs as part of the effort against global warming, said India \u201ccould do much better\u201d, and \u201ceasily\u201d, if it agreed to phase out HFCs, which are used in air conditioning. Unlike the largely dry language of submissions by the US and EU, India\u2019s contains colourful passages explaining its attitude towards the environment, citing its long tradition of a harmonious relationship between man and nature. Mahatma Gandhi is invoked several times, including his comment that \u201cEarth has enough resources to meet people\u2019s needs, but will never have enough to satisfy people\u2019s greed.\u201dThe Philippines also made an informal indication of its plans to cut its carbon emissions by 70% by 2030 but only if it receives financial assistance, a presidential aide told Reuters news agency on Friday.An analysis of 140 countries\u2019 pledges to the UN so far found this week that they would see temperatures rise to 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Governments at previous climate talks have committed to holding rises to 2C.The quest for a deal in Paris is intensifying, according to Laurence Tubiana, the French ambassador for climate change, speaking during a Google hangout on Friday.She said that countries must come up with adequate emissions reductions, and that all countries - including the poorest - must be involved in the deal. An additional pre-meeting will also take place in Paris two weeks before the actual summit which starts on 30 November, she confirmed, in an attempt to iron out any remaining difficult issues in advance.\u2022 Additional reporting by Fiona Harvey", "tags": ["Climate change", "India", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Renewable energy", "COP 21: UN climate change conference | Paris", "Energy", "Environment", "South and Central Asia", "World news", "Global climate talks", "Nuclear power", "Coal", "Fossil fuels"], "title": "India unveils climate change plan"},{"date": "2016-02-12T06:00:11Z", "content": "After an irate Facebook board member wrote that India is better off under colonialism, many in Silicon Valley\u2019s large and influential Indian population were offended. \u201cPeople like [Facebook board member] Marc Andreessen are speaking from places of such massive privilege and are still so massively wrong,\u201d said Rohit Sharma, a venture capitalist with True Ventures, which has raised $878m. \u201cSomeone in India\u2019s needs are just the same as someone in San Francisco. How dare you imply otherwise? No.\u201dOn 8 February, India\u2019s telecoms regulator blocked services such as Facebook\u2019s Free Basics, a scheme to offer a small selection of low-bandwidth apps for free to users in the developing world. Net neutrality campaigners have opposed the service, which already operates in 16 other countries, because they say Facebook and its telecoms partners have too much control over which apps can be included, and should not be given what is effectively priority access to a developing market.The general argument for it in Silicon Valley has been that, yes, it comes with potentially unsavory strings attached, but it\u2019s free, and it\u2019s better than nothing.When the news came that India had rejected Facebook, board member and investor Andreessen tweeted the missive that echoed around the world: \u201cAnti-Colonialism has been economically catastrophic for India for decades. Why stop now?\u201dOne sunny San Francisco day later \u2013 after Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg was forced to publicly disavow the tweet \u2013 Sharma was calling in on Arvind Gupta, who invests in and guides a group of early stage startups at his accelerator IndieBio. Their conversation quickly shifted to Free Basics and Andreessen\u2019s message. Culturally, Indians tend to be very wary of strangers bringing gifts in the guise of tradeGupta said he felt Facebook\u2019s stumble was partly due to distance and being out of touch with Indian people.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think this is a good idea 5,000 miles away in your nice apartment,\u201d Gupta said. Sharma saw it as part of a broader issue of homogeneity in Silicon Valley, a region run by a narrow set of oligarchs who famously eschew hiring women or people of color. \u201cWhy is the Valley suddenly so tone deaf? Well, look how badly the Valley does on inclusion in hiring. Bias is the norm here,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cWhy is the Indian user any less capable than anyone else? Why do they have different needs than you do? They don\u2019t. But that thinking is all part of the same problem.\u201dSome Indian leaders in Silicon Valley, though, argue that too much is being made of Andreessen\u2019s comment. Related: Mark Zuckerberg chides board member over 'deeply upsetting' India comments Venky Ganesan, managing director of local investment firm Menlo Ventures, said that Free Basics could seem quite a bit like colonialism: a gift in exchange for some of your freedom. \u201cThe historical dimension that most American companies might not fully appreciate is that Indian schoolchildren, including me when I grew up, are taught that the colonization of India started with the East India Company coming to trade,\u201d Ganesan said. \u201cCulturally, Indians tend to be very wary of strangers bringing gifts in the guise of trade.\u201dBut Ganesan felt the international outrage to Andreessen\u2019s message was overblown: \u201cHonestly the reaction to Marc\u2019s tweets is a tempest in a teapot ... People need to relax.\u201d\u201cFacebook was trying to provide free access to content to the poor in India in a manner that both benefited them and the poor,\u201d Ganesan wrote. \u201cIs some access better than no access? That\u2019s the question.\u201dThis privileged assumption that oh the poor need this, the poor should be happy with this, it\u2019s set us back by yearsAnd, in a way, much of Silicon Valley is a form of colonialism. Facebook, Twitter, Google and the rest offer a free service in exchange for control. Resistance becomes more difficult than assimilation, and so the trade doesn\u2019t seem too bad.Nor are Facebook\u2019s efforts historically unique in western dealings with India, writes historian David Arnold in his book on the topic: \u201cFaith in Britain\u2019s capacity to modernize and civilize India was always fraught with multiple contradictions, among them a recurrent belief that Indians were unready (or unfit) to receive the benefits of scientific modernity, a determination to deny India the competitive advantages that full access to modern science and technology might entail, and a romantically tinged anti-industrialism, in which India was destined to remain a land of princes, peasants and artisans, spared the ugliness and turmoil of modern industrial society.\u201d Back at IndieBio, an industrial office space with a high-end research lab in the basement and, upstairs, some leftover snacks and name tags from an earlier party, Sharma and Gupta agreed Facebook was fighting a losing battle. In the early days of the internet in America, telecommunications companies like AT&T tried to create walled internets in the US, too, Gupta recalled, adding that he worked on some of them and that the strategy obviously hadn\u2019t worked.Sharma said this would set India and Silicon Valley relations back. \u201cI know the entire Facebook team behind this. I know their intention, but why do this?\u201d Sharma wondered. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the companies in India are saints, but we\u2019re just beginning to step out of that. And now this privileged set of assumptions that oh the poor need this, the poor should be happy with this, it\u2019s set us all back by years.\u201dAndreessen, whose venture capital firm has invested $4.3bn in companies like Airbnb and Skype and may be the most powerful investment group in the valley, stirred controversy in the fall when a seemingly-arbitrary group of women and people of color realized he had \u201cblocked\u201d them on Twitter, or made it so they couldn\u2019t read his messages. \u201cHas Marc blocked you yet?\u201d Sharma asked. \u201cHe\u2019s blocked me.\u201d", "tags": ["Facebook", "Silicon Valley", "Technology", "Venture capital", "India", "US news", "Business", "Social networking", "South and Central Asia"], "title": "Marc Andreessen's 'colonialism' gaffe?

India\u2019s telecommunications regulatory board banned Facebook\u2019s $45m effort to deliver Free Basics and ruled in favor of net neutrality, writing that \u201cdifferential tariffs arguably disadvantage small content providers who may not be able to participate in such schemes\u201d.

Why stop now?\u201d Facebook swiftly denounced his comments, saying: \u201cWe strongly reject the sentiments expressed by Marc Andreessen last night regarding India.\u201dOn Wednesday afternoon, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg posted a statement on his own Facebook page calling Andreessen\u2019s comments \u201cdeeply upsetting\u201d. \u201cI want to respond to Marc Andreessen\u2019s comments about India yesterday,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.\u201c... they do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all. India has been personally important to me and Facebook ... I\u2019ve been inspired by how much progress India has made in building a strong nation and the largest democracy in the world, and I look forward to strengthening my connection to the country.\u201dFrom the start, the project has raised questions about net neutrality and just how much control Facebook will have over the internet access it brings and whether it would charge more to visit certain sites.As the venture capitalist Om Malik wrote: \u201cI am suspicious of any for-profit company arguing its good intentions and its free gifts.\u201dSilicon Valley, home to some 90,000 Indians, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, reacted swiftly with a collective shudder. As did Indian entrepreneurs.\u201cThe bottom-line is that this ban on differential pricing was not decided by some elitist group of activists who have some un-articulated vested interest to prevent India\u2019s poor folks to come online but by TRAI in an extraordinary democratic process that was both rigorous and comprehensive,\u201d wrote Sumanth Raghavendra, an entrepreneur at Deck App Technologies, a Bangalore-based startup. \u201cAnd remarkably courageous.\u201dOther members of Andreessen\u2019s venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, however, defended the message.8/ Instead the (understandable) anti-colonialist overreaction threw out the capitalist baby with the colonialist bathwater.Another member of the influential firm, Benedict Evans, joked about what he sees as a history of inefficiency in India technological policy:\u2018I don\u2019t understand why people complain about the phones. The 10 year waiting list shows how popular they are\u2019Indian minister, early 1980sIt\u2019s not the first time Silicon Valley has stumbled on clumsy statements about India. Last year, Airbnb cofounder Brian Chesky wrote that  Gandhi wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if India, back then, had tried to limit rentals to a minimum of 30 days.Nor is it the first time Facebook\u2019s political efforts have fallen short. Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s much ballyhooed FWD.us has largely collapsed. By comparing Free Basics to colonialism, Andreessen, an investor in companies like Airbnb and Facebook, drew an interesting parallel between Silicon Valley\u2019s concept of \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 which often comes with strings attached \u2013 and the American history of colonial rule.He was arguing that Silicon Valley is colonial by nature, giving the gift of something free in exchange for a tax of data and control which people don\u2019t quite realize they\u2019re providing. This desire to own and control is often presented by tech evangelists in terms of freedom, equality, and access \u2013 Internet.org, as Facebook calls the umbrella effort under which is puts Free Basics, is not a non-profit. It is a for-profit arm of a for-profit company. Adding the \u201c.org\u201d may have an impact on public opinion or confuse journalists, but the fact remains that Free Basics was an effort for Facebook to make money.By Wednesday morning, apparently chastened by the uproar intense enough to make Andreessen a trending topic in south-east Asia, and with a public relations disaster looming for Facebook, the venture capitalist backtracked.1/Last night on Twitter, I made an ill-informed and ill-advised comment about Indian politics and economics.2/To be clear, I am 100% opposed to colonialism, and 100% in favor of independence and freedom, in any country, including India.3/I am a huge admirer of the nation of India and the Indian people, who have been nothing but kind and generous to me for many years.4/I apologize for any offense my comment caused, and withdraw it in full and without reservation.5/I will leave all future commentary on all of these topics to people with more knowledge and experience than me.Other members of his firm, Benedict Evans and Balaji S Srinivasan, have not retracted their statements.

My wife, son, mother and I arrive early to witness the sunrise, to beat the heat and the exhausting crowds, and to touch the marble walls while they are still cool. Like countless visitors before us, we have our photograph taken in front of the Taj with postcard precision. Our smiles suggest a joy in our own adventures.Later that day we fly home to Bangalore in the south, where my family and I have been living. When the sun rises the following day, we find my mother lying dead on the floor of our flat.With the help of our extraordinary neighbours, a colonel in the Indian army and his wife, the panic of not knowing what steps to take with a dead relative in India is stilled, and within minutes friends and neighbours offer us solace. They knew we\u2019d been travelling with my mother and, to a person, their first words to us are, \u201cShe had a good death.\u201dI\u2019d lost loved ones before, most after long, painful illnesses with lingering spells in hospitals draining them of spirit and vigour. I didn\u2019t believe there was such a thing as a good death. But if I\u2019d known my mother was going to die on that sunny Sunday morning in February, I\u2019d probably have hoped it turned out exactly like it did.My mother, Kristine, had never had any desire to see India. She lived in Toronto, Canada, and the thought of visiting the dusty, crowded chaos of the Asian sub-continent was about as appealing to her as eating a five-alarm prawn curry for breakfast every morning. But as soon as I told her we planned to live for two years in India, she asked when it would be convenient for her to visit.She first travelled to Bangalore to see us in January, 2014, and we took her to Kerala for a backwater houseboat cruise, a delightful beach holiday on the Arabian Sea and a few days in ancient Kochi. Like so many other westerners, my mother was changed by India \u2013 she wrote in her journal that she was no longer afraid, feeling perfectly capable of flagging down an auto-rickshaw by herself and wishing she could share her new love of the country with those who would never get to see it \u2013 shedding her earlier apprehensions and anxious to return.For her second visit a year later, we planned a thrilling two weeks through Rajasthan, home of Mughal empires, distinctive art and architecture. This time she arrived excited and eager.On her last morning, she saw the Taj\u00a0Mahal at sunrise.While many senior citizens scramble\u00a0to meet the demands of their bucket list, Kristine crossed off items that she didn\u2019t even know were on a list, her joy\u00a0greater for the surprises.I knew my mother wanted to be cremated. There are better ways of using precious earth, she\u2019d told me, than burying people in it. And though she might have been happy to have her ashes left in India, it seemed only right that I take them home to Canada to scatter with all of her family present. Besides, it\u2019s easier to transport a small urn than a complete body.A cremation, it turns out, is easy to arrange in India where just obtaining a sim card requires a thick sheaf of paperwork, photo ID and the patience of a saint. It\u2019s also far more rewarding.At the crematorium, I sat with my mother\u2019s body in a quiet tiled room as we waited our turn \u2013 it was a busy day for cremations. Outside the window I heard crying and shouting and singing. The sounds of sadness were mixed with the unmistakable bustle of a collective, accompanied by the floral aromas of burning incense and garlands blanketing the white-bearded man\u2019s body, which was being washed by loved ones. This group was sad and happy, joyously celebrating a life while offering their shared grief to whomever was listening.Looking back at my mother lying there, covered discreetly with a plain white sheet, I thought something was missing. The Indian mourners outside grieved openly under the bright sun, celebrating despite their sorrow. Inside, it was solemn and melancholy. We found some flowers to place over and around her, allowing Kristine to end her bodily existence in a way that she surely would have appreciated since becoming so enraptured with the humanity of India.My friends and I carried her to the oven. I watched her body begin to burn before the door clanged shut.This never could have happened in the society in which I\u2019d grown up. My culture\u2019s habits in dealing with death are private, behind-the-scenes, all arrangements taken care of. If our loved ones are laid out for us to view, they are made beautiful. Funerals are, traditionally, solemn, mournful and gloomy occasions marked by kind reflections and \u201crespectful\u201d whispers. We don\u2019t want to risk offending the mourners or, even worse, the deceased.And when the bereaved are overcome by grief, we don\u2019t know how to react because we can\u2019t stand seeing people in pain. We want them to stop crying, stop wailing, stop sinking deeper and deeper into their own misery because we\u2019re sure that will make them feel better. But really we\u2019re just trying to make it easier for ourselves.With my mother\u2019s good death, accompanied by the celebratory way we dealt with her body, those of us who had lost her were given the permission to find happiness from the end of an extraordinary life. If I learned anything from my fellow Indian mourners, it\u2019s that it\u2019s much easier to be sad when there is joy.\u201cIt was all worth it,\u201d Kristine had said, looking out over the Yamuna river that arcs quietly behind the Taj like a swooping brush-stroke.It wasn\u2019t just the trek through the desert on camels, trains and bicycles, scaling hilltop forts and palaces, waking up before dawn and driving through the dark to the Taj that was worth it. To her, at that moment, everything in her life was worth it. And she\u2019d been able to share the whole adventure with her family.Jon Magidsohn\u2019s book, Immortal Highway, will be published shortly by Iguana. jonmagidsohn.com/memoir/", "tags": ["Family", "Death and dying", "Parents and parenting", "Bereavement", "Life and style"], "title": "My mother\u2019s good death in India"},{"date": "2016-01-13T16:57:39Z", "content": "Pakistan said it had arrested members of the Islamist terror group widely blamed for a four-day attack on an airbase in India that threatened to wreck a thaw in relations between the two countries.Islamabad announced on Wednesday that several individuals belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) had been arrested based on information supplied by India and Pakistan\u2019s own investigations.\u201cThe offices of the organisation are also being traced and sealed,\u201d said a statement from the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif.The government said Pakistan was considering sending its own investigators to Pathankot, where six gunmen assaulted an airbase on 2 January, killing seven soldiers.Past crackdowns on JeM ultimately failed to dismantle an organisation that continues to operate openly in Pakistan through its charity wing and numerous publications.Wednesday\u2019s announcement is nonetheless a potentially significant step against an organisation long patronised by Pakistan\u2019s military establishment as a proxy force against India.The announcement was cheered by peace campaigners, who feared the Pathankot incident had been deliberately mounted to derail a renewal of high-level diplomatic engagement between the two south Asian countries, which have fought four wars since independence in 1947.India\u2019s foreign secretary, Subrahmanyam Jaisankar, is due to travel to Islamabad on Friday to discuss the resumption of the peace process between the neighbouring states, which has been stalled since the Mumbai terror attacks launched by Pakistan-based terrorists on targets in India\u2019s commercial capital in 2008.The meeting has hung in the balance as Delhi waited to see whether Islamabad would respond to the demand by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for Islamabad to take \u201cfirm and immediate\u201d action against those responsible for planning the Pathankot attack.Many analysts suspect the incident, and an assault by gunmen on an Indian consulate in Afghanistan on 3 January, were deliberately intended to spoil historic overtures Modi made on 25 December during a surprise visit to the Pakistani city of Lahore.Some even feared that Pakistan\u2019s powerful military establishment, rumoured to be unhappy with Sharif\u2019s determination for rapid rapprochement with India, may have authorised the attacks.JeM has long been associated with Pakistan\u2019s military intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which used the group as a proxy force to launch attacks inside Indian-held Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state that Pakistan claims for itself.Masood Azhar, the group\u2019s leader, was arrested in the aftermath of a JeM assault on India\u2019s parliament in 2001, but a court released him the following year.Imtiaz Alam, the head of the South Asia Free Media Association, which campaigns for peace between the two countries, said the JeM arrests showed the military were serious in their oft-stated claim to be cracking down on all terrorist groups.\u201cThey are no more supported, even if some elements may have become autonomous and are doing their own private practice,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is a very good omen that Pakistan is taking the investigation seriously. Even hawks like the Indian home minister says he has confidence in the Pakistani investigation.\u201dModi, a Hindu nationalist who won power in a landslide victory in 2014, has repeatedly surprised observers with a series of unorthodox initiatives aimed at engaging with his counterpart in Pakistan.He invited Sharif to his inauguration ceremony, but then allowed the armed forces to take part in a major artillery duel with their Pakistani counterparts after clashes along the contested border.Senior officials later said that both moves had been designed to test Pakistan\u2019s reactions and gauge the strength of its military\u2019s influence on security and foreign policy.The Pathankot assault, which dragged on for days before all the attackers were killed, has prompted fierce domestic criticism of India\u2019s security agenciesand the national security adviser, Ajit Doval.Newspapers have reported poor perimeter security, coordination and decision-making \u2013 the Indian Express described \u201cglaring gaps in planning, command, training and equipment\u201d \u2013 and ministers have been accused of making a series of misleading statements.Underlining the complexity of evolving threats from terrorism in the region, Pakistan suffered an attack on one of its diplomatic missions on Wednesday when three attackers attempted to storm the consulate in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.Local officials said at least seven members of the Afghan security forces were killed in an assault claimed by Islamic State, which has secured a foothold in Nangarhar.The group claimed the attackers had succeeded in killing \u201cseveral Pakistani intelligence officers\u201d, but Islamabad said all of its staff were safe.Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri in Kabul", "tags": ["Pakistan", "India", "Kashmir", "Afghanistan", "Narendra Modi", "Mumbai terror attacks", "South and Central Asia", "World news"], "title": "Pakistan arrests Jaish-e-Mohammad members over India airbase attack"},{"date": "2016-01-13T07:00:04Z", "content": "As a girl, Noorjehan Niaz remembers visiting the famous Muslim shrine of Haji Ali and walking down the long causeway off the coastline in south Mumbai, pushing through the throng to the inner chamber of the mosque where the grave of the 15th century saint lies. Here, her parents taught her to press her head against the grave and shower rose petals on to the green silk draping it. In 2011, as an adult, she was shocked to find the entrance shut. She was allowed into the mosque\u2019s other areas to pray but the shrine\u2019s trustees had decided that only men were allowed inside. \u201cThe trustees said the ban was aimed at \u2018protecting\u2019 female worshippers from sexual attention because, when they bowed, the pallu [loose end] of their saris fell, exposing their chest area which aroused the men who might be looking at them,\u201d says Niaz. She later discovered from the trustees that another reason for the ban was that it was a \u201csin\u201d for women to go near the grave when they were menstruating. Related: Banished for menstruating: the Indian women isolated while they bleed | Gagandeep Kaur As co-founder of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (Indian Muslim Women\u2019s Movement, BMMA), Niaz refused to accept the ban. The BMMA filed a petition in the courts demanding the ban be lifted and pointing out that even saints were born from wombs. Three years later, this bitter legal battle is reaching an end, with the Mumbai high court expected to announce a verdict on 18 January. If the judges rule that the ban must be lifted, it will set a precedent for others fighting discrimination against women in places of worship.In India, it is only in churches where men and women enjoy equal rights of worship. Temples and mosques practise discrimination routinely. In November, a Hindu temple in Maharashtra suspended seven security guards after a female devotee stepped on a platform to worship an idol. Women are barred from the platform and temple priests performed a \u201cpurification\u201d ceremony to rid it of the \u201cpollution\u201d the woman had caused.Many Hindu temples prohibit women who have their period from entering. The Sabarimala temple in Kerala goes a step further \u2013 since it is impossible to know whether a woman is menstruating, it has banned all women aged between 10 and 50. Prayar Gopalakrishnan, president of the board that manages the temple, said women will be allowed to enter only after a machine has been invented and installed to detect if they have their period.Similarly, at the shrine of the saint Nizamuddin Auliya in the Indian capital, Muslim men and women start the journey to the grave on foot together. When they reach the final section, where they remove their shoes, buy wicker baskets of rose petals and walk down winding narrow steps towards the grave, they separate. The women stand behind a carved stone screen. The men go inside to the grave and place consecrated shrouds over it.Aisha Hassan, a 35-year-old teacher from Agra, stood behind the screen, saying a prayer as her husband and son went inside. When asked if it was unfair that women could not touch the grave, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind if I can\u2019t go in. I\u2019d like to but these are century-old rules that have come down to us and we must obey them.\u201dIn this conservative society where internet pornography is popular and sex columns in the newspapers discuss masturbation and premature ejaculation, talk of menstruation is taboo. So many Hindu and Muslim women have internalised the notion that it is unclean that they voluntarily stay away from temples and mosques when they have their periods.But the outcry that followed Gopalakrishnan\u2019s comments turned the tide. Indian women began shouting from the rooftops that menstruation is not unclean, polluting or shameful.Young women across India launched a Happy To Bleed campaign on Facebook to protest against the sexism of the temple authorities. The campaign urged women to hold placards saying \u201cHappy to Bleed\u201d, take a picture of themselves and upload it on to their Facebook profile.Adita Gupta, who created a comic book and website called \u201cMenstrupedia\u201d to educate young women and portray menstruation positively, posted: \u201cMr Prayar Gopalakrishnan and everyone who thinks women are impure during their periods, don\u2019t forget it\u2019s the same \u2018impurity\u2019 you survived on for nine months inside your mother\u2019s womb\u201d.Gupta said: \u201cI am an educated, modern, middle class woman but I too believed that I shouldn\u2019t enter the kitchen, touch any idols or touch the pickle jar or poppadom because I was told as a girl that they will go bad.\u201dDespite women\u2019s anger, BMMA\u2019s lawyer, Raju Moray, believes the court may be unwilling to give a verdict. \u201cThe Indian courts are reluctant to interfere in religion, particularly with a Muslim issue like this where there could be a backlash. Conservative Muslims might say their religion is being targeted by Hindus. No one has the judicial courage to take a stand in favour of women,\u201d he says.\u201cA dozen lawyers approached by the BMMA refused to take this case because they were scared that a militant Muslim group might target them,\u201d he adds.Niaz believes the judges have no choice but to support their petition because the Haji Ali ban is against the equal rights enshrined in the Indian constitution (pdf). \u201cBut if they rule in our favour, that will open the gates for Hindu women to claim the same rights in temples all over India, annoying conservative Hindu groups in addition to conservative Muslim groups. The whole thing is so complex and controversial, I wonder if they will give any verdict at all,\u201d she says.However, a positive ruling, she adds, would send out a powerful message to women from all faiths who have been excluded from their place of worship.

Our historical cumulative emission as of today is below 3%.\u201d Related: Coal is not the answer to India's energy poverty, whatever Tony Abbott says | EAS Sarma In a speech in New York, he referenced the pope\u2019s address to the UN last week and emphasised that while India was a big emitter, it was responsible for less carbon pollution than many developed countries since the industrial revolution. \u201cThe developed world must take moral responsibility for the state of the world today. The pope has also mentioned that the huge consumption of the developed world has repercussions on the developing world,\u201d Javadekar said.India\u2019s submission to the UN, known as its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), focuses on clean energy, including solar power, which the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has already strongly backed. It also promised to plant more forests by 2030 to absorb carbon emissions.Modi has repeatedly said India would not accept constraints on its development as part of any climate deal. Unlike China\u2019s submission to the UN in June, India\u2019s does not spell out when its emissions might peak.Most environment groups and thinktanks said the plan, which was submitted to the UN late on Thursday, was good and recognised the impacts global warming would have on India.Rhea Suh, the president of the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said: \u201cIndia\u2019s strong climate plan offers a comprehensive approach to curb the worst impacts of climate change.\u201dGermana Canzi, an analyst at UK-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, hailed India\u2019s pledge as significant and said: \u201cThe path of that India will now take in its development is extremely important for the future of the climate, particularly as the country is set to surpass China to become the world\u2019s most populous country by 2028, with 1.45 billion people.\u201dNitin Pandit, CEO of the World Resources Institute in India, said: \u201cAs one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, India recognises the domestic benefits of confronting this issue. Its climate plan does a good job combining opportunities to reduce emissions in the near term, and it includes clear goals to restore landscapes that will bring long-term benefits.\u201dBut Durwood Zaelke, a climate change expert and long-time campaigner on the need to phase out climate-changing gases such as HFCs as part of the effort against global warming, said India \u201ccould do much better\u201d, and \u201ceasily\u201d, if it agreed to phase out HFCs, which are used in air conditioning. Unlike the largely dry language of submissions by the US and EU, India\u2019s contains colourful passages explaining its attitude towards the environment, citing its long tradition of a harmonious relationship between man and nature.

How dare you imply otherwise? No.\u201dOn 8 February, India\u2019s telecoms regulator blocked services such as Facebook\u2019s Free Basics, a scheme to offer a small selection of low-bandwidth apps for free to users in the developing world. Net neutrality campaigners have opposed the service, which already operates in 16 other countries, because they say Facebook and its telecoms partners have too much control over which apps can be included, and should not be given what is effectively priority access to a developing market.The general argument for it in Silicon Valley has been that, yes, it comes with potentially unsavory strings attached, but it\u2019s free, and it\u2019s better than nothing.When the news came that India had rejected Facebook, board member and investor Andreessen tweeted the missive that echoed around the world: \u201cAnti-Colonialism has been economically catastrophic for India for decades. Why stop now?\u201dOne sunny San Francisco day later \u2013 after Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg was forced to publicly disavow the tweet \u2013 Sharma was calling in on Arvind Gupta, who invests in and guides a group of early stage startups at his accelerator IndieBio. Their conversation quickly shifted to Free Basics and Andreessen\u2019s message. Culturally, Indians tend to be very wary of strangers bringing gifts in the guise of tradeGupta said he felt Facebook\u2019s stumble was partly due to distance and being out of touch with Indian people.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think this is a good idea 5,000 miles away in your nice apartment,\u201d Gupta said. Sharma saw it as part of a broader issue of homogeneity in Silicon Valley, a region run by a narrow set of oligarchs who famously eschew hiring women or people of color. \u201cWhy is the Valley suddenly so tone deaf? Well, look how badly the Valley does on inclusion in hiring. Bias is the norm here,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cWhy is the Indian user any less capable than anyone else? Why do they have different needs than you do? They don\u2019t. But that thinking is all part of the same problem.\u201dSome Indian leaders in Silicon Valley, though, argue that too much is being made of Andreessen\u2019s comment. Related: Mark Zuckerberg chides board member over 'deeply upsetting' India comments Venky Ganesan, managing director of local investment firm Menlo Ventures, said that Free Basics could seem quite a bit like colonialism: a gift in exchange for some of your freedom. \u201cThe historical dimension that most American companies might not fully appreciate is that Indian schoolchildren, including me when I grew up, are taught that the colonization of India started with the East India Company coming to trade,\u201d Ganesan said. \u201cCulturally, Indians tend to be very wary of strangers bringing gifts in the guise of trade.\u201dBut Ganesan felt the international outrage to Andreessen\u2019s message was overblown: \u201cHonestly the reaction to Marc\u2019s tweets is a tempest in a teapot ... People need to relax.\u201d\u201cFacebook was trying to provide free access to content to the poor in India in a manner that both benefited them and the poor,\u201d Ganesan wrote. \u201cIs some access better than no access? That\u2019s the question.\u201dThis privileged assumption that oh the poor need this, the poor should be happy with this, it\u2019s set us back by yearsAnd, in a way, much of Silicon Valley is a form of colonialism. Facebook, Twitter, Google and the rest offer a free service in exchange for control. Resistance becomes more difficult than assimilation, and so the trade doesn\u2019t seem too bad.Nor are Facebook\u2019s efforts historically unique in western dealings with India, writes historian David Arnold in his book on the topic: \u201cFaith in Britain\u2019s capacity to modernize and civilize India was always fraught with multiple contradictions, among them a recurrent belief that Indians were unready (or unfit) to receive the benefits of scientific modernity, a determination to deny India the competitive advantages that full access to modern science and technology might entail, and a romantically tinged anti-industrialism, in which India was destined to remain a land of princes, peasants and artisans, spared the ugliness and turmoil of modern industrial society.\u201d Back at IndieBio, an industrial office space with a high-end research lab in the basement and, upstairs, some leftover snacks and name tags from an earlier party, Sharma and Gupta agreed Facebook was fighting a losing battle. In the early days of the internet in America, telecommunications companies like AT&T tried to create walled internets in the US, too, Gupta recalled, adding that he worked on some of them and that the strategy obviously hadn\u2019t worked.Sharma said this would set India and Silicon Valley relations back. \u201cI know the entire Facebook team behind this. I know their intention, but why do this?\u201d Sharma wondered. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the companies in India are saints, but we\u2019re just beginning to step out of that. And now this privileged set of assumptions that oh the poor need this, the poor should be happy with this, it\u2019s set us all back by years.\u201dAndreessen, whose venture capital firm has invested $4.3bn in companies like Airbnb and Skype and may be the most powerful investment group in the valley, stirred controversy in the fall when a seemingly-arbitrary group of women and people of color realized he had \u201cblocked\u201d them on Twitter, or made it so they couldn\u2019t read his messages. \u201cHas Marc blocked you yet?\u201d Sharma asked. \u201cHe\u2019s blocked me.\u201d", "tags": ["Facebook", "Silicon Valley", "Technology", "Venture capital", "India", "US news", "Business", "Social networking", "South and Central Asia"], "title": "Marc Andreessen's 'colonialism' gaffe?

India\u2019s telecommunications regulatory board banned Facebook\u2019s $45m effort to deliver Free Basics and ruled in favor of net neutrality, writing that \u201cdifferential tariffs arguably disadvantage small content providers who may not be able to participate in such schemes\u201d. This could, the body added, \u201ccreate entry barriers and non-level playing field for these players, stifling innovation\u201d.Those fighting for an open internet in India lauded the ban. \u201cThis is great news,\u201d said Kiran Jonnalagadda, a member of the Save the Internet campaign in favor of net neutrality. \u201cIt is what this country needed and it took a lot of effort pushing for it. It took a lot moral fibre for TRAI to stand up to the telcos.\u201dAndreessen, in his tweets, argued that India rejected it because of corrupt Indian telcos wanting to keep internet access away from poor people.\u201cAnti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?\u201d Facebook swiftly denounced his comments, saying: \u201cWe strongly reject the sentiments expressed by Marc Andreessen last night regarding India.\u201dOn Wednesday afternoon, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg posted a statement on his own Facebook page calling Andreessen\u2019s comments \u201cdeeply upsetting\u201d. \u201cI want to respond to Marc Andreessen\u2019s comments about India yesterday,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.\u201c... they do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all. India has been personally important to me and Facebook ... I\u2019ve been inspired by how much progress India has made in building a strong nation and the largest democracy in the world, and I look forward to strengthening my connection to the country.\u201dFrom the start, the project has raised questions about net neutrality and just how much control Facebook will have over the internet access it brings and whether it would charge more to visit certain sites.As the venture capitalist Om Malik wrote: \u201cI am suspicious of any for-profit company arguing its good intentions and its free gifts.\u201dSilicon Valley, home to some 90,000 Indians, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, reacted swiftly with a collective shudder. As did Indian entrepreneurs.\u201cThe bottom-line is that this ban on differential pricing was not decided by some elitist group of activists who have some un-articulated vested interest to prevent India\u2019s poor folks to come online but by TRAI in an extraordinary democratic process that was both rigorous and comprehensive,\u201d wrote Sumanth Raghavendra, an entrepreneur at Deck App Technologies, a Bangalore-based startup. \u201cAnd remarkably courageous.\u201dOther members of Andreessen\u2019s venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, however, defended the message.8/ Instead the (understandable) anti-colonialist overreaction threw out the capitalist baby with the colonialist bathwater.Another member of the influential firm, Benedict Evans, joked about what he sees as a history of inefficiency in India technological policy:\u2018I don\u2019t understand why people complain about the phones. The 10 year waiting list shows how popular they are\u2019Indian minister, early 1980sIt\u2019s not the first time Silicon Valley has stumbled on clumsy statements about India. Last year, Airbnb cofounder Brian Chesky wrote that  Gandhi wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if India, back then, had tried to limit rentals to a minimum of 30 days.Nor is it the first time Facebook\u2019s political efforts have fallen short. Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s much ballyhooed FWD.us has largely collapsed. By comparing Free Basics to colonialism, Andreessen, an investor in companies like Airbnb and Facebook, drew an interesting parallel between Silicon Valley\u2019s concept of \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 which often comes with strings attached \u2013 and the American history of colonial rule.He was arguing that Silicon Valley is colonial by nature, giving the gift of something free in exchange for a tax of data and control which people don\u2019t quite realize they\u2019re providing. This desire to own and control is often presented by tech evangelists in terms of freedom, equality, and access \u2013 Internet.org, as Facebook calls the umbrella effort under which is puts Free Basics, is not a non-profit. It is a for-profit arm of a for-profit company. Adding the \u201c.org\u201d may have an impact on public opinion or confuse journalists, but the fact remains that Free Basics was an effort for Facebook to make money.By Wednesday morning, apparently chastened by the uproar intense enough to make Andreessen a trending topic in south-east Asia, and with a public relations disaster looming for Facebook, the venture capitalist backtracked.1/Last night on Twitter, I made an ill-informed and ill-advised comment about Indian politics and economics.2/To be clear, I am 100% opposed to colonialism, and 100% in favor of independence and freedom, in any country, including India.3/I am a huge admirer of the nation of India and the Indian people, who have been nothing but kind and generous to me for many years.4/I apologize for any offense my comment caused, and withdraw it in full and without reservation.5/I will leave all future commentary on all of these topics to people with more knowledge and experience than me.Other members of his firm, Benedict Evans and Balaji S Srinivasan, have not retracted their statements.

My wife, son, mother and I arrive early to witness the sunrise, to beat the heat and the exhausting crowds, and to touch the marble walls while they are still cool. Like countless visitors before us, we have our photograph taken in front of the Taj with postcard precision. Our smiles suggest a joy in our own adventures.Later that day we fly home to Bangalore in the south, where my family and I have been living. When the sun rises the following day, we find my mother lying dead on the floor of our flat.With the help of our extraordinary neighbours, a colonel in the Indian army and his wife, the panic of not knowing what steps to take with a dead relative in India is stilled, and within minutes friends and neighbours offer us solace. They knew we\u2019d been travelling with my mother and, to a person, their first words to us are, \u201cShe had a good death.\u201dI\u2019d lost loved ones before, most after long, painful illnesses with lingering spells in hospitals draining them of spirit and vigour. I didn\u2019t believe there was such a thing as a good death. But if I\u2019d known my mother was going to die on that sunny Sunday morning in February, I\u2019d probably have hoped it turned out exactly like it did.My mother, Kristine, had never had any desire to see India. She lived in Toronto, Canada, and the thought of visiting the dusty, crowded chaos of the Asian sub-continent was about as appealing to her as eating a five-alarm prawn curry for breakfast every morning. But as soon as I told her we planned to live for two years in India, she asked when it would be convenient for her to visit.She first travelled to Bangalore to see us in January, 2014, and we took her to Kerala for a backwater houseboat cruise, a delightful beach holiday on the Arabian Sea and a few days in ancient Kochi. Like so many other westerners, my mother was changed by India \u2013 she wrote in her journal that she was no longer afraid, feeling perfectly capable of flagging down an auto-rickshaw by herself and wishing she could share her new love of the country with those who would never get to see it \u2013 shedding her earlier apprehensions and anxious to return.For her second visit a year later, we planned a thrilling two weeks through Rajasthan, home of Mughal empires, distinctive art and architecture. This time she arrived excited and eager.On her last morning, she saw the Taj\u00a0Mahal at sunrise.While many senior citizens scramble\u00a0to meet the demands of their bucket list, Kristine crossed off items that she didn\u2019t even know were on a list, her joy\u00a0greater for the surprises.I knew my mother wanted to be cremated. There are better ways of using precious earth, she\u2019d told me, than burying people in it. And though she might have been happy to have her ashes left in India, it seemed only right that I take them home to Canada to scatter with all of her family present. Besides, it\u2019s easier to transport a small urn than a complete body.A cremation, it turns out, is easy to arrange in India where just obtaining a sim card requires a thick sheaf of paperwork, photo ID and the patience of a saint. It\u2019s also far more rewarding.At the crematorium, I sat with my mother\u2019s body in a quiet tiled room as we waited our turn \u2013 it was a busy day for cremations. Outside the window I heard crying and shouting and singing. The sounds of sadness were mixed with the unmistakable bustle of a collective, accompanied by the floral aromas of burning incense and garlands blanketing the white-bearded man\u2019s body, which was being washed by loved ones. This group was sad and happy, joyously celebrating a life while offering their shared grief to whomever was listening.Looking back at my mother lying there, covered discreetly with a plain white sheet, I thought something was missing. The Indian mourners outside grieved openly under the bright sun, celebrating despite their sorrow. Inside, it was solemn and melancholy. We found some flowers to place over and around her, allowing Kristine to end her bodily existence in a way that she surely would have appreciated since becoming so enraptured with the humanity of India.My friends and I carried her to the oven. I watched her body begin to burn before the door clanged shut.This never could have happened in the society in which I\u2019d grown up. My culture\u2019s habits in dealing with death are private, behind-the-scenes, all arrangements taken care of. If our loved ones are laid out for us to view, they are made beautiful. Funerals are, traditionally, solemn, mournful and gloomy occasions marked by kind reflections and \u201crespectful\u201d whispers. We don\u2019t want to risk offending the mourners or, even worse, the deceased.And when the bereaved are overcome by grief, we don\u2019t know how to react because we can\u2019t stand seeing people in pain. We want them to stop crying, stop wailing, stop sinking deeper and deeper into their own misery because we\u2019re sure that will make them feel better. But really we\u2019re just trying to make it easier for ourselves.With my mother\u2019s good death, accompanied by the celebratory way we dealt with her body, those of us who had lost her were given the permission to find happiness from the end of an extraordinary life. If I learned anything from my fellow Indian mourners, it\u2019s that it\u2019s much easier to be sad when there is joy.\u201cIt was all worth it,\u201d Kristine had said, looking out over the Yamuna river that arcs quietly behind the Taj like a swooping brush-stroke.It wasn\u2019t just the trek through the desert on camels, trains and bicycles, scaling hilltop forts and palaces, waking up before dawn and driving through the dark to the Taj that was worth it. To her, at that moment, everything in her life was worth it. And she\u2019d been able to share the whole adventure with her family.Jon Magidsohn\u2019s book, Immortal Highway, will be published shortly by Iguana. jonmagidsohn.com/memoir/", "tags": ["Family", "Death and dying", "Parents and parenting", "Bereavement", "Life and style"], "title": "My mother\u2019s good death in India"},{"date": "2016-01-13T16:57:39Z", "content": "Pakistan said it had arrested members of the Islamist terror group widely blamed for a four-day attack on an airbase in India that threatened to wreck a thaw in relations between the two countries.Islamabad announced on Wednesday that several individuals belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) had been arrested based on information supplied by India and Pakistan\u2019s own investigations.\u201cThe offices of the organisation are also being traced and sealed,\u201d said a statement from the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif.The government said Pakistan was considering sending its own investigators to Pathankot, where six gunmen assaulted an airbase on 2 January, killing seven soldiers.Past crackdowns on JeM ultimately failed to dismantle an organisation that continues to operate openly in Pakistan through its charity wing and numerous publications.Wednesday\u2019s announcement is nonetheless a potentially significant step against an organisation long patronised by Pakistan\u2019s military establishment as a proxy force against India.The announcement was cheered by peace campaigners, who feared the Pathankot incident had been deliberately mounted to derail a renewal of high-level diplomatic engagement between the two south Asian countries, which have fought four wars since independence in 1947.India\u2019s foreign secretary, Subrahmanyam Jaisankar, is due to travel to Islamabad on Friday to discuss the resumption of the peace process between the neighbouring states, which has been stalled since the Mumbai terror attacks launched by Pakistan-based terrorists on targets in India\u2019s commercial capital in 2008.The meeting has hung in the balance as Delhi waited to see whether Islamabad would respond to the demand by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for Islamabad to take \u201cfirm and immediate\u201d action against those responsible for planning the Pathankot attack.Many analysts suspect the incident, and an assault by gunmen on an Indian consulate in Afghanistan on 3 January, were deliberately intended to spoil historic overtures Modi made on 25 December during a surprise visit to the Pakistani city of Lahore.Some even feared that Pakistan\u2019s powerful military establishment, rumoured to be unhappy with Sharif\u2019s determination for rapid rapprochement with India, may have authorised the attacks.JeM has long been associated with Pakistan\u2019s military intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which used the group as a proxy force to launch attacks inside Indian-held Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state that Pakistan claims for itself.Masood Azhar, the group\u2019s leader, was arrested in the aftermath of a JeM assault on India\u2019s parliament in 2001, but a court released him the following year.Imtiaz Alam, the head of the South Asia Free Media Association, which campaigns for peace between the two countries, said the JeM arrests showed the military were serious in their oft-stated claim to be cracking down on all terrorist groups.\u201cThey are no more supported, even if some elements may have become autonomous and are doing their own private practice,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is a very good omen that Pakistan is taking the investigation seriously. Even hawks like the Indian home minister says he has confidence in the Pakistani investigation.\u201dModi, a Hindu nationalist who won power in a landslide victory in 2014, has repeatedly surprised observers with a series of unorthodox initiatives aimed at engaging with his counterpart in Pakistan.He invited Sharif to his inauguration ceremony, but then allowed the armed forces to take part in a major artillery duel with their Pakistani counterparts after clashes along the contested border.Senior officials later said that both moves had been designed to test Pakistan\u2019s reactions and gauge the strength of its military\u2019s influence on security and foreign policy.The Pathankot assault, which dragged on for days before all the attackers were killed, has prompted fierce domestic criticism of India\u2019s security agenciesand the national security adviser, Ajit Doval.Newspapers have reported poor perimeter security, coordination and decision-making \u2013 the Indian Express described \u201cglaring gaps in planning, command, training and equipment\u201d \u2013 and ministers have been accused of making a series of misleading statements.Underlining the complexity of evolving threats from terrorism in the region, Pakistan suffered an attack on one of its diplomatic missions on Wednesday when three attackers attempted to storm the consulate in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.Local officials said at least seven members of the Afghan security forces were killed in an assault claimed by Islamic State, which has secured a foothold in Nangarhar.The group claimed the attackers had succeeded in killing \u201cseveral Pakistani intelligence officers\u201d, but Islamabad said all of its staff were safe.Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri in Kabul", "tags": ["Pakistan", "India", "Kashmir", "Afghanistan", "Narendra Modi", "Mumbai terror attacks", "South and Central Asia", "World news"], "title": "Pakistan arrests Jaish-e-Mohammad members over India airbase attack"},{"date": "2016-01-13T07:00:04Z", "content": "As a girl, Noorjehan Niaz remembers visiting the famous Muslim shrine of Haji Ali and walking down the long causeway off the coastline in south Mumbai, pushing through the throng to the inner chamber of the mosque where the grave of the 15th century saint lies. Here, her parents taught her to press her head against the grave and shower rose petals on to the green silk draping it. In 2011, as an adult, she was shocked to find the entrance shut. She was allowed into the mosque\u2019s other areas to pray but the shrine\u2019s trustees had decided that only men were allowed inside. \u201cThe trustees said the ban was aimed at \u2018protecting\u2019 female worshippers from sexual attention because, when they bowed, the pallu [loose end] of their saris fell, exposing their chest area which aroused the men who might be looking at them,\u201d says Niaz. She later discovered from the trustees that another reason for the ban was that it was a \u201csin\u201d for women to go near the grave when they were menstruating. Related: Banished for menstruating: the Indian women isolated while they bleed | Gagandeep Kaur As co-founder of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (Indian Muslim Women\u2019s Movement, BMMA), Niaz refused to accept the ban. The BMMA filed a petition in the courts demanding the ban be lifted and pointing out that even saints were born from wombs. Three years later, this bitter legal battle is reaching an end, with the Mumbai high court expected to announce a verdict on 18 January. If the judges rule that the ban must be lifted, it will set a precedent for others fighting discrimination against women in places of worship.In India, it is only in churches where men and women enjoy equal rights of worship. Temples and mosques practise discrimination routinely. In November, a Hindu temple in Maharashtra suspended seven security guards after a female devotee stepped on a platform to worship an idol. Women are barred from the platform and temple priests performed a \u201cpurification\u201d ceremony to rid it of the \u201cpollution\u201d the woman had caused.Many Hindu temples prohibit women who have their period from entering. The Sabarimala temple in Kerala goes a step further \u2013 since it is impossible to know whether a woman is menstruating, it has banned all women aged between 10 and 50. Prayar Gopalakrishnan, president of the board that manages the temple, said women will be allowed to enter only after a machine has been invented and installed to detect if they have their period.Similarly, at the shrine of the saint Nizamuddin Auliya in the Indian capital, Muslim men and women start the journey to the grave on foot together. When they reach the final section, where they remove their shoes, buy wicker baskets of rose petals and walk down winding narrow steps towards the grave, they separate. The women stand behind a carved stone screen. The men go inside to the grave and place consecrated shrouds over it.Aisha Hassan, a 35-year-old teacher from Agra, stood behind the screen, saying a prayer as her husband and son went inside. When asked if it was unfair that women could not touch the grave, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind if I can\u2019t go in. I\u2019d like to but these are century-old rules that have come down to us and we must obey them.\u201dIn this conservative society where internet pornography is popular and sex columns in the newspapers discuss masturbation and premature ejaculation, talk of menstruation is taboo. So many Hindu and Muslim women have internalised the notion that it is unclean that they voluntarily stay away from temples and mosques when they have their periods.But the outcry that followed Gopalakrishnan\u2019s comments turned the tide. Indian women began shouting from the rooftops that menstruation is not unclean, polluting or shameful.Young women across India launched a Happy To Bleed campaign on Facebook to protest against the sexism of the temple authorities. The campaign urged women to hold placards saying \u201cHappy to Bleed\u201d, take a picture of themselves and upload it on to their Facebook profile.Adita Gupta, who created a comic book and website called \u201cMenstrupedia\u201d to educate young women and portray menstruation positively, posted: \u201cMr Prayar Gopalakrishnan and everyone who thinks women are impure during their periods, don\u2019t forget it\u2019s the same \u2018impurity\u2019 you survived on for nine months inside your mother\u2019s womb\u201d.Gupta said: \u201cI am an educated, modern, middle class woman but I too believed that I shouldn\u2019t enter the kitchen, touch any idols or touch the pickle jar or poppadom because I was told as a girl that they will go bad.\u201dDespite women\u2019s anger, BMMA\u2019s lawyer, Raju Moray, believes the court may be unwilling to give a verdict. \u201cThe Indian courts are reluctant to interfere in religion, particularly with a Muslim issue like this where there could be a backlash. Conservative Muslims might say their religion is being targeted by Hindus. No one has the judicial courage to take a stand in favour of women,\u201d he says.\u201cA dozen lawyers approached by the BMMA refused to take this case because they were scared that a militant Muslim group might target them,\u201d he adds.Niaz believes the judges have no choice but to support their petition because the Haji Ali ban is against the equal rights enshrined in the Indian constitution (pdf). \u201cBut if they rule in our favour, that will open the gates for Hindu women to claim the same rights in temples all over India, annoying conservative Hindu groups in addition to conservative Muslim groups. The whole thing is so complex and controversial, I wonder if they will give any verdict at all,\u201d she says.However, a positive ruling, she adds, would send out a powerful message to women from all faiths who have been excluded from their place of worship.

At \u00a350m, the robotic probe, which is still circling the red planet, cost a fraction of earlier similar missions by the US, Russia and European countries.The new observatory, dubbed the AstroSat, is due to be launched from the country\u2019s main space centre at Sriharikota in southern India on Monday. If it is successful, India will be the first state in the developing world to have placed its own telescope in space.\u201cThis is the first time we are launching a dedicated astronomy mission,\u201d said K Suryanarayana Sarma, project director of AstroSat at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Related: India's Mars satellite successfully enters orbit, bringing country into space elite  \u201cThis is a unique mission because \u2026 we have a very wide band of astronomical observation with sophisticated instruments with good resolution and specifications,\u201d Sarma said. First conceived in 1996, the project was given the green light in 2004. It is believed to have cost about \u00a335m. One of the reasons for the decade-long delay is the complexities of one specific instrument, a telescope using x-rays that has 320 aluminium mirrors that need to be positioned with extreme accuracy. The instrument was developed in collaboration with the University of Leicester in the UK. Some commentators have questioned comparisons with the Hubble, launched by Nasa in 1990, which has become known for spectacular photographs of events in deep space. \u201cCalling [the] AstroSat \u2018India\u2019s Hubble\u2019 will imply that ISRO has reached that level of engineering capability when it has not. And making that reference repeatedly will only foster complacency about defining the scale and scope of future missions,\u201d wrote Vasudevan Mukunth, on Indian news website The Wire last week.  As well as being 10 times smaller than the Hubble, the AstroSat has a more limited lifespan of five years. This has however some advantages.\u201cWe intend a mission life of five years for the AstroSat. So the question of repairs, like the ones done by astronauts on the Hubble, doesn\u2019t arise,\u201d said Deviprasad Karnik, an ISRO spokesman. Indian scientists say their observatory has an unprecedented array of telescopes that will allow simultaneous data collection through different means. The mission will also be the first time the country will launch US satellites. The launch comes on the day Narendra Modi, the prime minister, is due to meet Barack Obama during a trip to the US. The successful launch of India\u2019s Mars orbiter last year came just days before Modi travelled to the US on his first trip after a landslide electoral victory. It led TV bulletins and filled front pages. The project aims to study the surface and mineral composition of Mars, and scan its atmosphere for methane, a chemical strongly tied to life on Earth. Modi wants to establish India as a bigger player in the \u00a3200bn space technology market, against stiff competition from neighbouring China with its bigger launchers. The Indian prime minister toured Silicon Valley this weekend, meeting CEOs of major tech firms and addressing a rally of Indian Americans in a bid to promote India as a nation of technological innovation and capabilities. \u201cWe have never launched an American satellite [before] \u2026 Politically and scientifically, India launching four American satellites marks the biggest step yet in Indo-US space collaboration,\u201d said Srinivas Laxman, a space science expert. Preparations to put an Indian in space are under way though there has been \u201cno approval from the government for the mission itself\u201d, said Karnik.  \u201cWe are preparing the physical technology.

The pope has also mentioned that the huge consumption of the developed world has repercussions on the developing world,\u201d Javadekar said.India\u2019s submission to the UN, known as its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), focuses on clean energy, including solar power, which the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has already strongly backed. It also promised to plant more forests by 2030 to absorb carbon emissions.Modi has repeatedly said India would not accept constraints on its development as part of any climate deal. Unlike China\u2019s submission to the UN in June, India\u2019s does not spell out when its emissions might peak.Most environment groups and thinktanks said the plan, which was submitted to the UN late on Thursday, was good and recognised the impacts global warming would have on India.Rhea Suh, the president of the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said: \u201cIndia\u2019s strong climate plan offers a comprehensive approach to curb the worst impacts of climate change.\u201dGermana Canzi, an analyst at UK-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, hailed India\u2019s pledge as significant and said: \u201cThe path of that India will now take in its development is extremely important for the future of the climate, particularly as the country is set to surpass China to become the world\u2019s most populous country by 2028, with 1.45 billion people.\u201dNitin Pandit, CEO of the World Resources Institute in India, said: \u201cAs one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, India recognises the domestic benefits of confronting this issue. Its climate plan does a good job combining opportunities to reduce emissions in the near term, and it includes clear goals to restore landscapes that will bring long-term benefits.\u201dBut Durwood Zaelke, a climate change expert and long-time campaigner on the need to phase out climate-changing gases such as HFCs as part of the effort against global warming, said India \u201ccould do much better\u201d, and \u201ceasily\u201d, if it agreed to phase out HFCs, which are used in air conditioning. Unlike the largely dry language of submissions by the US and EU, India\u2019s contains colourful passages explaining its attitude towards the environment, citing its long tradition of a harmonious relationship between man and nature. Mahatma Gandhi is invoked several times, including his comment that \u201cEarth has enough resources to meet people\u2019s needs, but will never have enough to satisfy people\u2019s greed.\u201dThe Philippines also made an informal indication of its plans to cut its carbon emissions by 70% by 2030 but only if it receives financial assistance, a presidential aide told Reuters news agency on Friday.An analysis of 140 countries\u2019 pledges to the UN so far found this week that they would see temperatures rise to 2.7C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Governments at previous climate talks have committed to holding rises to 2C.The quest for a deal in Paris is intensifying, according to Laurence Tubiana, the French ambassador for climate change, speaking during a Google hangout on Friday.She said that countries must come up with adequate emissions reductions, and that all countries - including the poorest - must be involved in the deal.

How dare you imply otherwise? No.\u201dOn 8 February, India\u2019s telecoms regulator blocked services such as Facebook\u2019s Free Basics, a scheme to offer a small selection of low-bandwidth apps for free to users in the developing world. Net neutrality campaigners have opposed the service, which already operates in 16 other countries, because they say Facebook and its telecoms partners have too much control over which apps can be included, and should not be given what is effectively priority access to a developing market.The general argument for it in Silicon Valley has been that, yes, it comes with potentially unsavory strings attached, but it\u2019s free, and it\u2019s better than nothing.When the news came that India had rejected Facebook, board member and investor Andreessen tweeted the missive that echoed around the world: \u201cAnti-Colonialism has been economically catastrophic for India for decades. Why stop now?\u201dOne sunny San Francisco day later \u2013 after Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg was forced to publicly disavow the tweet \u2013 Sharma was calling in on Arvind Gupta, who invests in and guides a group of early stage startups at his accelerator IndieBio. Their conversation quickly shifted to Free Basics and Andreessen\u2019s message. Culturally, Indians tend to be very wary of strangers bringing gifts in the guise of tradeGupta said he felt Facebook\u2019s stumble was partly due to distance and being out of touch with Indian people.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think this is a good idea 5,000 miles away in your nice apartment,\u201d Gupta said. Sharma saw it as part of a broader issue of homogeneity in Silicon Valley, a region run by a narrow set of oligarchs who famously eschew hiring women or people of color. \u201cWhy is the Valley suddenly so tone deaf? Well, look how badly the Valley does on inclusion in hiring. Bias is the norm here,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cWhy is the Indian user any less capable than anyone else? Why do they have different needs than you do? They don\u2019t. But that thinking is all part of the same problem.\u201dSome Indian leaders in Silicon Valley, though, argue that too much is being made of Andreessen\u2019s comment. Related: Mark Zuckerberg chides board member over 'deeply upsetting' India comments Venky Ganesan, managing director of local investment firm Menlo Ventures, said that Free Basics could seem quite a bit like colonialism: a gift in exchange for some of your freedom. \u201cThe historical dimension that most American companies might not fully appreciate is that Indian schoolchildren, including me when I grew up, are taught that the colonization of India started with the East India Company coming to trade,\u201d Ganesan said. \u201cCulturally, Indians tend to be very wary of strangers bringing gifts in the guise of trade.\u201dBut Ganesan felt the international outrage to Andreessen\u2019s message was overblown: \u201cHonestly the reaction to Marc\u2019s tweets is a tempest in a teapot ... People need to relax.\u201d\u201cFacebook was trying to provide free access to content to the poor in India in a manner that both benefited them and the poor,\u201d Ganesan wrote. \u201cIs some access better than no access? That\u2019s the question.\u201dThis privileged assumption that oh the poor need this, the poor should be happy with this, it\u2019s set us back by yearsAnd, in a way, much of Silicon Valley is a form of colonialism. Facebook, Twitter, Google and the rest offer a free service in exchange for control. Resistance becomes more difficult than assimilation, and so the trade doesn\u2019t seem too bad.Nor are Facebook\u2019s efforts historically unique in western dealings with India, writes historian David Arnold in his book on the topic: \u201cFaith in Britain\u2019s capacity to modernize and civilize India was always fraught with multiple contradictions, among them a recurrent belief that Indians were unready (or unfit) to receive the benefits of scientific modernity, a determination to deny India the competitive advantages that full access to modern science and technology might entail, and a romantically tinged anti-industrialism, in which India was destined to remain a land of princes, peasants and artisans, spared the ugliness and turmoil of modern industrial society.\u201d Back at IndieBio, an industrial office space with a high-end research lab in the basement and, upstairs, some leftover snacks and name tags from an earlier party, Sharma and Gupta agreed Facebook was fighting a losing battle. In the early days of the internet in America, telecommunications companies like AT&T tried to create walled internets in the US, too, Gupta recalled, adding that he worked on some of them and that the strategy obviously hadn\u2019t worked.Sharma said this would set India and Silicon Valley relations back. \u201cI know the entire Facebook team behind this. I know their intention, but why do this?\u201d Sharma wondered. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the companies in India are saints, but we\u2019re just beginning to step out of that. And now this privileged set of assumptions that oh the poor need this, the poor should be happy with this, it\u2019s set us all back by years.\u201dAndreessen, whose venture capital firm has invested $4.3bn in companies like Airbnb and Skype and may be the most powerful investment group in the valley, stirred controversy in the fall when a seemingly-arbitrary group of women and people of color realized he had \u201cblocked\u201d them on Twitter, or made it so they couldn\u2019t read his messages. \u201cHas Marc blocked you yet?\u201d Sharma asked. \u201cHe\u2019s blocked me.\u201d", "tags": ["Facebook", "Silicon Valley", "Technology", "Venture capital", "India", "US news", "Business", "Social networking", "South and Central Asia"], "title": "Marc Andreessen's 'colonialism' gaffe?

India\u2019s telecommunications regulatory board banned Facebook\u2019s $45m effort to deliver Free Basics and ruled in favor of net neutrality, writing that \u201cdifferential tariffs arguably disadvantage small content providers who may not be able to participate in such schemes\u201d.

It took a lot moral fibre for TRAI to stand up to the telcos.\u201dAndreessen, in his tweets, argued that India rejected it because of corrupt Indian telcos wanting to keep internet access away from poor people.\u201cAnti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?\u201d Facebook swiftly denounced his comments, saying: \u201cWe strongly reject the sentiments expressed by Marc Andreessen last night regarding India.\u201dOn Wednesday afternoon, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg posted a statement on his own Facebook page calling Andreessen\u2019s comments \u201cdeeply upsetting\u201d. \u201cI want to respond to Marc Andreessen\u2019s comments about India yesterday,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.\u201c... they do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all. India has been personally important to me and Facebook ... I\u2019ve been inspired by how much progress India has made in building a strong nation and the largest democracy in the world, and I look forward to strengthening my connection to the country.\u201dFrom the start, the project has raised questions about net neutrality and just how much control Facebook will have over the internet access it brings and whether it would charge more to visit certain sites.As the venture capitalist Om Malik wrote: \u201cI am suspicious of any for-profit company arguing its good intentions and its free gifts.\u201dSilicon Valley, home to some 90,000 Indians, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, reacted swiftly with a collective shudder. As did Indian entrepreneurs.\u201cThe bottom-line is that this ban on differential pricing was not decided by some elitist group of activists who have some un-articulated vested interest to prevent India\u2019s poor folks to come online but by TRAI in an extraordinary democratic process that was both rigorous and comprehensive,\u201d wrote Sumanth Raghavendra, an entrepreneur at Deck App Technologies, a Bangalore-based startup. \u201cAnd remarkably courageous.\u201dOther members of Andreessen\u2019s venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, however, defended the message.8/ Instead the (understandable) anti-colonialist overreaction threw out the capitalist baby with the colonialist bathwater.Another member of the influential firm, Benedict Evans, joked about what he sees as a history of inefficiency in India technological policy:\u2018I don\u2019t understand why people complain about the phones. The 10 year waiting list shows how popular they are\u2019Indian minister, early 1980sIt\u2019s not the first time Silicon Valley has stumbled on clumsy statements about India. Last year, Airbnb cofounder Brian Chesky wrote that  Gandhi wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if India, back then, had tried to limit rentals to a minimum of 30 days.Nor is it the first time Facebook\u2019s political efforts have fallen short. Facebook CEO and cofounder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s much ballyhooed FWD.us has largely collapsed. By comparing Free Basics to colonialism, Andreessen, an investor in companies like Airbnb and Facebook, drew an interesting parallel between Silicon Valley\u2019s concept of \u201cfree\u201d \u2013 which often comes with strings attached \u2013 and the American history of colonial rule.He was arguing that Silicon Valley is colonial by nature, giving the gift of something free in exchange for a tax of data and control which people don\u2019t quite realize they\u2019re providing. This desire to own and control is often presented by tech evangelists in terms of freedom, equality, and access \u2013 Internet.org, as Facebook calls the umbrella effort under which is puts Free Basics, is not a non-profit. It is a for-profit arm of a for-profit company. Adding the \u201c.org\u201d may have an impact on public opinion or confuse journalists, but the fact remains that Free Basics was an effort for Facebook to make money.By Wednesday morning, apparently chastened by the uproar intense enough to make Andreessen a trending topic in south-east Asia, and with a public relations disaster looming for Facebook, the venture capitalist backtracked.1/Last night on Twitter, I made an ill-informed and ill-advised comment about Indian politics and economics.2/To be clear, I am 100% opposed to colonialism, and 100% in favor of independence and freedom, in any country, including India.3/I am a huge admirer of the nation of India and the Indian people, who have been nothing but kind and generous to me for many years.4/I apologize for any offense my comment caused, and withdraw it in full and without reservation.5/I will leave all future commentary on all of these topics to people with more knowledge and experience than me.Other members of his firm, Benedict Evans and Balaji S Srinivasan, have not retracted their statements.

When the sun rises the following day, we find my mother lying dead on the floor of our flat.With the help of our extraordinary neighbours, a colonel in the Indian army and his wife, the panic of not knowing what steps to take with a dead relative in India is stilled, and within minutes friends and neighbours offer us solace. They knew we\u2019d been travelling with my mother and, to a person, their first words to us are, \u201cShe had a good death.\u201dI\u2019d lost loved ones before, most after long, painful illnesses with lingering spells in hospitals draining them of spirit and vigour. I didn\u2019t believe there was such a thing as a good death. But if I\u2019d known my mother was going to die on that sunny Sunday morning in February, I\u2019d probably have hoped it turned out exactly like it did.My mother, Kristine, had never had any desire to see India. She lived in Toronto, Canada, and the thought of visiting the dusty, crowded chaos of the Asian sub-continent was about as appealing to her as eating a five-alarm prawn curry for breakfast every morning. But as soon as I told her we planned to live for two years in India, she asked when it would be convenient for her to visit.She first travelled to Bangalore to see us in January, 2014, and we took her to Kerala for a backwater houseboat cruise, a delightful beach holiday on the Arabian Sea and a few days in ancient Kochi. Like so many other westerners, my mother was changed by India \u2013 she wrote in her journal that she was no longer afraid, feeling perfectly capable of flagging down an auto-rickshaw by herself and wishing she could share her new love of the country with those who would never get to see it \u2013 shedding her earlier apprehensions and anxious to return.For her second visit a year later, we planned a thrilling two weeks through Rajasthan, home of Mughal empires, distinctive art and architecture. This time she arrived excited and eager.On her last morning, she saw the Taj\u00a0Mahal at sunrise.While many senior citizens scramble\u00a0to meet the demands of their bucket list, Kristine crossed off items that she didn\u2019t even know were on a list, her joy\u00a0greater for the surprises.I knew my mother wanted to be cremated. There are better ways of using precious earth, she\u2019d told me, than burying people in it. And though she might have been happy to have her ashes left in India, it seemed only right that I take them home to Canada to scatter with all of her family present. Besides, it\u2019s easier to transport a small urn than a complete body.A cremation, it turns out, is easy to arrange in India where just obtaining a sim card requires a thick sheaf of paperwork, photo ID and the patience of a saint. It\u2019s also far more rewarding.At the crematorium, I sat with my mother\u2019s body in a quiet tiled room as we waited our turn \u2013 it was a busy day for cremations. Outside the window I heard crying and shouting and singing. The sounds of sadness were mixed with the unmistakable bustle of a collective, accompanied by the floral aromas of burning incense and garlands blanketing the white-bearded man\u2019s body, which was being washed by loved ones. This group was sad and happy, joyously celebrating a life while offering their shared grief to whomever was listening.Looking back at my mother lying there, covered discreetly with a plain white sheet, I thought something was missing. The Indian mourners outside grieved openly under the bright sun, celebrating despite their sorrow. Inside, it was solemn and melancholy. We found some flowers to place over and around her, allowing Kristine to end her bodily existence in a way that she surely would have appreciated since becoming so enraptured with the humanity of India.My friends and I carried her to the oven. I watched her body begin to burn before the door clanged shut.This never could have happened in the society in which I\u2019d grown up. My culture\u2019s habits in dealing with death are private, behind-the-scenes, all arrangements taken care of. If our loved ones are laid out for us to view, they are made beautiful. Funerals are, traditionally, solemn, mournful and gloomy occasions marked by kind reflections and \u201crespectful\u201d whispers. We don\u2019t want to risk offending the mourners or, even worse, the deceased.And when the bereaved are overcome by grief, we don\u2019t know how to react because we can\u2019t stand seeing people in pain. We want them to stop crying, stop wailing, stop sinking deeper and deeper into their own misery because we\u2019re sure that will make them feel better. But really we\u2019re just trying to make it easier for ourselves.With my mother\u2019s good death, accompanied by the celebratory way we dealt with her body, those of us who had lost her were given the permission to find happiness from the end of an extraordinary life. If I learned anything from my fellow Indian mourners, it\u2019s that it\u2019s much easier to be sad when there is joy.\u201cIt was all worth it,\u201d Kristine had said, looking out over the Yamuna river that arcs quietly behind the Taj like a swooping brush-stroke.It wasn\u2019t just the trek through the desert on camels, trains and bicycles, scaling hilltop forts and palaces, waking up before dawn and driving through the dark to the Taj that was worth it. To her, at that moment, everything in her life was worth it. And she\u2019d been able to share the whole adventure with her family.Jon Magidsohn\u2019s book, Immortal Highway, will be published shortly by Iguana. jonmagidsohn.com/memoir/", "tags": ["Family", "Death and dying", "Parents and parenting", "Bereavement", "Life and style"], "title": "My mother\u2019s good death in India"},{"date": "2016-01-13T16:57:39Z", "content": "Pakistan said it had arrested members of the Islamist terror group widely blamed for a four-day attack on an airbase in India that threatened to wreck a thaw in relations between the two countries.Islamabad announced on Wednesday that several individuals belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) had been arrested based on information supplied by India and Pakistan\u2019s own investigations.\u201cThe offices of the organisation are also being traced and sealed,\u201d said a statement from the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif.The government said Pakistan was considering sending its own investigators to Pathankot, where six gunmen assaulted an airbase on 2 January, killing seven soldiers.Past crackdowns on JeM ultimately failed to dismantle an organisation that continues to operate openly in Pakistan through its charity wing and numerous publications.Wednesday\u2019s announcement is nonetheless a potentially significant step against an organisation long patronised by Pakistan\u2019s military establishment as a proxy force against India.The announcement was cheered by peace campaigners, who feared the Pathankot incident had been deliberately mounted to derail a renewal of high-level diplomatic engagement between the two south Asian countries, which have fought four wars since independence in 1947.India\u2019s foreign secretary, Subrahmanyam Jaisankar, is due to travel to Islamabad on Friday to discuss the resumption of the peace process between the neighbouring states, which has been stalled since the Mumbai terror attacks launched by Pakistan-based terrorists on targets in India\u2019s commercial capital in 2008.The meeting has hung in the balance as Delhi waited to see whether Islamabad would respond to the demand by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, for Islamabad to take \u201cfirm and immediate\u201d action against those responsible for planning the Pathankot attack.Many analysts suspect the incident, and an assault by gunmen on an Indian consulate in Afghanistan on 3 January, were deliberately intended to spoil historic overtures Modi made on 25 December during a surprise visit to the Pakistani city of Lahore.Some even feared that Pakistan\u2019s powerful military establishment, rumoured to be unhappy with Sharif\u2019s determination for rapid rapprochement with India, may have authorised the attacks.JeM has long been associated with Pakistan\u2019s military intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which used the group as a proxy force to launch attacks inside Indian-held Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state that Pakistan claims for itself.Masood Azhar, the group\u2019s leader, was arrested in the aftermath of a JeM assault on India\u2019s parliament in 2001, but a court released him the following year.Imtiaz Alam, the head of the South Asia Free Media Association, which campaigns for peace between the two countries, said the JeM arrests showed the military were serious in their oft-stated claim to be cracking down on all terrorist groups.\u201cThey are no more supported, even if some elements may have become autonomous and are doing their own private practice,\u201d he said.\u201cIt is a very good omen that Pakistan is taking the investigation seriously. Even hawks like the Indian home minister says he has confidence in the Pakistani investigation.\u201dModi, a Hindu nationalist who won power in a landslide victory in 2014, has repeatedly surprised observers with a series of unorthodox initiatives aimed at engaging with his counterpart in Pakistan.He invited Sharif to his inauguration ceremony, but then allowed the armed forces to take part in a major artillery duel with their Pakistani counterparts after clashes along the contested border.Senior officials later said that both moves had been designed to test Pakistan\u2019s reactions and gauge the strength of its military\u2019s influence on security and foreign policy.The Pathankot assault, which dragged on for days before all the attackers were killed, has prompted fierce domestic criticism of India\u2019s security agenciesand the national security adviser, Ajit Doval.Newspapers have reported poor perimeter security, coordination and decision-making \u2013 the Indian Express described \u201cglaring gaps in planning, command, training and equipment\u201d \u2013 and ministers have been accused of making a series of misleading statements.Underlining the complexity of evolving threats from terrorism in the region, Pakistan suffered an attack on one of its diplomatic missions on Wednesday when three attackers attempted to storm the consulate in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.Local officials said at least seven members of the Afghan security forces were killed in an assault claimed by Islamic State, which has secured a foothold in Nangarhar.The group claimed the attackers had succeeded in killing \u201cseveral Pakistani intelligence officers\u201d, but Islamabad said all of its staff were safe.Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri in Kabul", "tags": ["Pakistan", "India", "Kashmir", "Afghanistan", "Narendra Modi", "Mumbai terror attacks", "South and Central Asia", "World news"], "title": "Pakistan arrests Jaish-e-Mohammad members over India airbase attack"},{"date": "2016-01-13T07:00:04Z", "content": "As a girl, Noorjehan Niaz remembers visiting the famous Muslim shrine of Haji Ali and walking down the long causeway off the coastline in south Mumbai, pushing through the throng to the inner chamber of the mosque where the grave of the 15th century saint lies. Here, her parents taught her to press her head against the grave and shower rose petals on to the green silk draping it. In 2011, as an adult, she was shocked to find the entrance shut. She was allowed into the mosque\u2019s other areas to pray but the shrine\u2019s trustees had decided that only men were allowed inside. \u201cThe trustees said the ban was aimed at \u2018protecting\u2019 female worshippers from sexual attention because, when they bowed, the pallu [loose end] of their saris fell, exposing their chest area which aroused the men who might be looking at them,\u201d says Niaz. She later discovered from the trustees that another reason for the ban was that it was a \u201csin\u201d for women to go near the grave when they were menstruating. Related: Banished for menstruating: the Indian women isolated while they bleed | Gagandeep Kaur As co-founder of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (Indian Muslim Women\u2019s Movement, BMMA), Niaz refused to accept the ban. The BMMA filed a petition in the courts demanding the ban be lifted and pointing out that even saints were born from wombs. Three years later, this bitter legal battle is reaching an end, with the Mumbai high court expected to announce a verdict on 18 January. If the judges rule that the ban must be lifted, it will set a precedent for others fighting discrimination against women in places of worship.In India, it is only in churches where men and women enjoy equal rights of worship. Temples and mosques practise discrimination routinely. In November, a Hindu temple in Maharashtra suspended seven security guards after a female devotee stepped on a platform to worship an idol. Women are barred from the platform and temple priests performed a \u201cpurification\u201d ceremony to rid it of the \u201cpollution\u201d the woman had caused.Many Hindu temples prohibit women who have their period from entering. The Sabarimala temple in Kerala goes a step further \u2013 since it is impossible to know whether a woman is menstruating, it has banned all women aged between 10 and 50. Prayar Gopalakrishnan, president of the board that manages the temple, said women will be allowed to enter only after a machine has been invented and installed to detect if they have their period.Similarly, at the shrine of the saint Nizamuddin Auliya in the Indian capital, Muslim men and women start the journey to the grave on foot together. When they reach the final section, where they remove their shoes, buy wicker baskets of rose petals and walk down winding narrow steps towards the grave, they separate. The women stand behind a carved stone screen. The men go inside to the grave and place consecrated shrouds over it.Aisha Hassan, a 35-year-old teacher from Agra, stood behind the screen, saying a prayer as her husband and son went inside. When asked if it was unfair that women could not touch the grave, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind if I can\u2019t go in. I\u2019d like to but these are century-old rules that have come down to us and we must obey them.\u201dIn this conservative society where internet pornography is popular and sex columns in the newspapers discuss masturbation and premature ejaculation, talk of menstruation is taboo. So many Hindu and Muslim women have internalised the notion that it is unclean that they voluntarily stay away from temples and mosques when they have their periods.But the outcry that followed Gopalakrishnan\u2019s comments turned the tide. Indian women began shouting from the rooftops that menstruation is not unclean, polluting or shameful.Young women across India launched a Happy To Bleed campaign on Facebook to protest against the sexism of the temple authorities. The campaign urged women to hold placards saying \u201cHappy to Bleed\u201d, take a picture of themselves and upload it on to their Facebook profile.Adita Gupta, who created a comic book and website called \u201cMenstrupedia\u201d to educate young women and portray menstruation positively, posted: \u201cMr Prayar Gopalakrishnan and everyone who thinks women are impure during their periods, don\u2019t forget it\u2019s the same \u2018impurity\u2019 you survived on for nine months inside your mother\u2019s womb\u201d.Gupta said: \u201cI am an educated, modern, middle class woman but I too believed that I shouldn\u2019t enter the kitchen, touch any idols or touch the pickle jar or poppadom because I was told as a girl that they will go bad.\u201dDespite women\u2019s anger, BMMA\u2019s lawyer, Raju Moray, believes the court may be unwilling to give a verdict. \u201cThe Indian courts are reluctant to interfere in religion, particularly with a Muslim issue like this where there could be a backlash. Conservative Muslims might say their religion is being targeted by Hindus. No one has the judicial courage to take a stand in favour of women,\u201d he says.\u201cA dozen lawyers approached by the BMMA refused to take this case because they were scared that a militant Muslim group might target them,\u201d he adds.Niaz believes the judges have no choice but to support their petition because the Haji Ali ban is against the equal rights enshrined in the Indian constitution (pdf). \u201cBut if they rule in our favour, that will open the gates for Hindu women to claim the same rights in temples all over India, annoying conservative Hindu groups in addition to conservative Muslim groups. The whole thing is so complex and controversial, I wonder if they will give any verdict at all,\u201d she says.However, a positive ruling, she adds, would send out a powerful message to women from all faiths who have been excluded from their place of worship.

At \u00a350m, the robotic probe, which is still circling the red planet, cost a fraction of earlier similar missions by the US, Russia and European countries.The new observatory, dubbed the AstroSat, is due to be launched from the country\u2019s main space centre at Sriharikota in southern India on Monday. If it is successful, India will be the first state in the developing world to have placed its own telescope in space.\u201cThis is the first time we are launching a dedicated astronomy mission,\u201d said K Suryanarayana Sarma, project director of AstroSat at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Related: India's Mars satellite successfully enters orbit, bringing country into space elite  \u201cThis is a unique mission because \u2026 we have a very wide band of astronomical observation with sophisticated instruments with good resolution and specifications,\u201d Sarma said. First conceived in 1996, the project was given the green light in 2004. It is believed to have cost about \u00a335m. One of the reasons for the decade-long delay is the complexities of one specific instrument, a telescope using x-rays that has 320 aluminium mirrors that need to be positioned with extreme accuracy. The instrument was developed in collaboration with the University of Leicester in the UK. Some commentators have questioned comparisons with the Hubble, launched by Nasa in 1990, which has become known for spectacular photographs of events in deep space. \u201cCalling [the] AstroSat \u2018India\u2019s Hubble\u2019 will imply that ISRO has reached that level of engineering capability when it has not. And making that reference repeatedly will only foster complacency about defining the scale and scope of future missions,\u201d wrote Vasudevan Mukunth, on Indian news website The Wire last week.  As well as being 10 times smaller than the Hubble, the AstroSat has a more limited lifespan of five years. This has however some advantages.\u201cWe intend a mission life of five years for the AstroSat. So the question of repairs, like the ones done by astronauts on the Hubble, doesn\u2019t arise,\u201d said Deviprasad Karnik, an ISRO spokesman. Indian scientists say their observatory has an unprecedented array of telescopes that will allow simultaneous data collection through different means. The mission will also be the first time the country will launch US satellites. The launch comes on the day Narendra Modi, the prime minister, is due to meet Barack Obama during a trip to the US. The successful launch of India\u2019s Mars orbiter last year came just days before Modi travelled to the US on his first trip after a landslide electoral victory. It led TV bulletins and filled front pages. The project aims to study the surface and mineral composition of Mars, and scan its atmosphere for methane, a chemical strongly tied to life on Earth. Modi wants to establish India as a bigger player in the \u00a3200bn space technology market, against stiff competition from neighbouring China with its bigger launchers. The Indian prime minister toured Silicon Valley this weekend, meeting CEOs of major tech firms and addressing a rally of Indian Americans in a bid to promote India as a nation of technological innovation and capabilities. \u201cWe have never launched an American satellite [before] \u2026 Politically and scientifically, India launching four American satellites marks the biggest step yet in Indo-US space collaboration,\u201d said Srinivas Laxman, a space science expert. Preparations to put an Indian in space are under way though there has been \u201cno approval from the government for the mission itself\u201d, said Karnik.  \u201cWe are preparing the physical technology.

The reason: his e-visa, for which he had reportedly applied in November, had not been cleared.\u201cThe immigration officials were insensitive and stubborn, and though Bloom was feeling uneasy and needed a doctor he wasn\u2019t even allowed to sit,\u201d said Amar Singh, a prominent Uttar Pradesh politician who had gone to receive the actor. \u201cThey kept saying, \u2018Bloom is an actor, so he is doing drama.\u2019\u201dOfficials refused to provide Bloom with a 72-hour temporary landing permit that would have allowed him to visit Agra.Singh added: \u201cBut Bloom is so humble and down-to-earth \u2026 Even though he was being deported from India, he readily agreed to fly back from Heathrow the same day if I succeeded in arranging his visa. No Bollywood star would\u2019ve done that.\u201dWhile the actor, whose mother was born in India, waited at Heathrow, Singh asked the Indian foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj, to get the Indian high commission in London to open its visa section and provide him with the document.

Last year Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, said that human rights no longer had the profile within his department that they had in the past.The UK\u2019s \u00a35.6m donation was made to Pakistan\u2019s anti-narcotics force, through a five-year UN Office on Drugs and Crime project, despite the fact that the Pakistan government insisted donors could not demand that it be linked to human rights considerations. A UNODC valuation of the programme, published in April 2014, observed that: \u201cUNODC was strongly advised by the GOP [government of Pakistan] to exclude [human rights] considerations from the CP [country programme] design and to advance with an oblique approach, where human rights issues would be addressed indirectly through training and improving criminal justice results [prosecutions based on evidence not interrogation] but not explicitly mentioned.\u201dThe project paid for the acquisition of surveillance vehicles, drug-testing kits and the construction of border control posts, places where drug carriers are frequently arrested, according to human rights groups. It was assessed according to key performance indicators \u2013 notably the number of arrests and successful prosecutions carried out by the ANF.Human rights groups claim the targets encourage capital convictions because drug seizures of more than a kilogramme are punishable by death in Pakistan, which last year executed more than 300 people, overtaking Saudi Arabia to become the world\u2019s third most prolific executing state. In its annual report filed last year, the ANF boasted that it was achieving the sort of results demanded by the UNODC. It noted that it had a successful prosecution rate of 89% \u201cwhich includes five death penalties\u201d.\u201cIt is a scandal that the government is using public money to support raids that send people to death row,\u201d said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve\u2019s death penalty team. \u201cPakistan\u2019s anti-narcotics force aggressively pursues death sentences for people convicted of non-violent drug offences in deeply flawed drug courts.\u201dThe UK funding of the United Nations project project began when Pakistan was holding a moratorium on the death penalty. \u201cWe are not aware of any executions in Pakistan as a result of UK counter-narcotics co-operation,\u201d a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. \u201cThe UK and Pakistan have a shared interest in working to tackle organised crime including the trafficking of drugs, which is a threat to both our societies.\u201dBut even after the moratorium was lifted the UK continued to run counter-narcotics training operations in Pakistan. In November 2015, Border Agency staff were helping to train staff at Karachi airport to detect drug smugglers as part of a programme that is to be rolled out toother airports including Lahore and Islamabad.The UNODC is now seeking donors for a new counter-narcotics programme in Pakistan that will run from 2016 to 2019 and aims to increase \u201cinterdiction, investigations and prosecution of drug traffickers\u201d.

At least that\u2019s the impression you\u2019d get if you read this report from Ars Technica (based on NSA documents leaked by The Intercept), which claims that a machine learning algorithm guiding U.S. drones \u2013 unfortunately named \u2018SKYNET\u2019 \u2013 could have wrongly targeted numerous innocent civilians. Let\u2019s start with the facts. For the last decade or so, the United States has used unmanned drones to attack militants in Pakistan. The number of kills is unknown, but estimates start at over a thousand and range up to maybe four thousand. A key problem for the intelligence services is finding the right people to kill, since the militants are mixed in with the general population and not just sitting in camp together waiting to be bombed.One thing they have is data, which apparently includes metadata from 55 million mobile phone users in Pakistan. For each user they could see which cell towers were pinged, how they moved, who they called, who called them, how long they spent on calls, when phones were switched off, and any of several dozen other statistics. That opened up a possible route for machine learning, neatly summarised on slide 2 of this deck. If we know that some of these 55 million people are couriers, can an algorithm find patterns in their behaviour and spot others who act in a similar way?What exactly is a \u2018courier\u2019 anyway? This is important to understanding some of the errors that The Intercept and Ars Technica made. Courier isn\u2019t a synonym for \u2018terrorist\u2019 as such - it means a specific kind of agent. Terrorist groups are justifiably nervous about using digital communications, and so a lot of messages are still delivered by hand, by couriers. Bin Laden made extensive use of couriers to pass information around, and it was through one of them \u2013 Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (an alias) - that he was eventually found.That\u2019s who the AI was being trained to detect \u2013 not the bin Ladens but the al-Kuwaitis. Not the targets so much as the people who might lead agents to them. Ars Technica implies that somehow the output of this courier detection method was used directly to \u201cgenerate the final kill list\u201d for drone strikes, but there\u2019s zero evidence I can see that this was ever the case, and it would make almost no sense given what the algorithm was actually looking for - you don\u2019t blow up your leads. How did it work? The NSA tried several classification algorithms, and chose what\u2019s known as a random forest approach. It\u2019s actually pretty simple to describe. You have 55 million records, each with 80 different variables or \u2018features\u2019 in them. A random forest algorithm splits this data up into lots of random overlapping bundles of records and features. So you might end up with e.g.:And so on. The next step is to train a decision tree on each bundle of data. A decision tree is, very crudely speaking, an algorithm that takes a record with a number of variables and goes through a series of yes/no questions to reach an answer. So for example, \u2018if this variable is > x1 and that variable is not > x2 and \u2018a third variable\u2019 is > x3\u2026\u2019 (...and so on for perhaps dozens of steps...) \u2018\u2026then this record is a courier.\u2019 The exact values for all the \u2018x\u2019s used are learned by training the algorithm on some test data where the outcomes are known, and you can think of them collectively as a model of the real world. Having created all those trees, you then bring them together to create your metaphorical forest. You run every single tree on each record, and combine the results from all of them to get some probability that the record is a courier. Very broadly speaking, the more the trees agree, the higher the probability is. Obviously this is a really simplified explanation, but hopefully it\u2019s enough to show that we\u2019re not talking about a mysterious black box here. How well did the algorithm do? Both The Intercept and Ars Technica leapt on the fact that the person with the highest probability of being a courier that they found in the data was Ahmad Zaidan, a bureau chief for Al-Jazeera in Islamabad. Cue snorts of derision from Ars Technica:\u201cAs The Intercept reported, Zaidan frequently travels to regions with known terrorist activity in order to interview insurgents and report the news. But rather than questioning the machine learning that produced such a bizarre result, the NSA engineers behind the algorithm instead trumpeted Zaidan as an example of a SKYNET success in their in-house presentation, including a slide that labelled Zaidan as a \u2018MEMBER OF AL-QA\u2019IDA.\u2019\u201dIf you knew nothing about machine learning, or you ignored the goals the algorithm was actually set, it might seem like a bad result. Actually it isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s ignore the NSA\u2019s prior beliefs about the man. The algorithm was trained to look for \u2018couriers\u2019, people who carry messages to and from Al Qaida members. As a journalist, Zaidan was so well connected with Al Qaida members that he interviewed Bin Laden on at least two occasions. This was a man who regularly travelled to, spoke with and carried messages from Al Qaida members. If the purpose of the algorithm had been narrowly to \u2018detect terrorists\u2019 or \u2018identify suicide bombers\u2019 then The Intercept might have a point. But it wasn\u2019t. It was trained to find people tightly linked to Al Qaida who might be carrying useful intelligence. Its identification of Zaidan \u2013 regardless of whether he was acting as a journalist or not \u2013 was entirely correct within the context of those goals. (As an aside, obviously I\u2019m not making any moral statement here about the validity of intelligence agencies tracking journalists and intercepting their communications. I\u2019m talking simply about the performance of the algorithm in carrying out the objectives it was set.) So the one case that The Intercept and Ars Technica highlight as a failure of the algorithm is actually a pretty striking success story. Zaidan is exactly the kind of person the NSA would expect and want the algorithm to highlight. Of course it\u2019s just one example thought, so how well did the algorithm perform over the rest of the data?The answer is: actually pretty well. The challenge here is pretty enormous because while the NSA has data on millions of people, only a tiny handful of them are confirmed couriers. With so little information, it\u2019s pretty hard to create a balanced set of data to train an algorithm on \u2013 an AI could just classify everyone as innocent and still claim to be over 99.99% accurate. A machine learning algorithm\u2019s basic job is to build a model of the world it sees, and when you have so few examples to learn from it can be a very cloudy view. In the end though they were able to train a model with a false positive rate \u2013 the number of people wrongly classed as terrorists - of just 0.008%. That\u2019s a pretty good achievement, but given the size of Pakistan\u2019s population it still means about 15,000 people being wrongly classified as couriers. If you were basing a kill list on that, it would be pretty bloody awful.Here\u2019s where The Intercept and Ars Technica really go off the deep end. The last slide of the deck (from June 2012) clearly states that these are preliminary results. The title paraphrases the conclusion to every other research study ever: \u201cWe\u2019re on the right track, but much remains to be done.\u201d This was an experiment in courier detection and a work in progress, and yet the two publications not only pretend that it was a deployed system, but also imply that the algorithm was used to generate a kill list for drone strokes. You can\u2019t prove a negative of course, but there\u2019s zero evidence here to substantiate the story. In reality of course you would combine the results from this kind of analysis with other intelligence, which is exactly what the NSA do \u2013 another slide shows that \u2018courier machine learning models\u2019 are just one small component of a much larger suite of data analytics used to identify targets, as you\u2019d expect. And of course data analytics will in turn be just one part of a broader intelligence processing effort. Nobody is being killed because of a flaky algorithm. The NSA couldn\u2019t be that stupid and still actually be capable of finding Pakistan on a map.It\u2019s a shame, because there\u2019s a lot to pick apart in this story, from ethical questions about bulk data gathering and tracking journalists to technical ones. Realistically, how well can you evaluate an algorithm when the original data contains so many people whose classification is unknown? And is \u2018courier\u2019 a clear cut category to begin with, or an ever-changing \u2018fuzzy\u2019 set?Finally, it\u2019s a great example of why often the most important thing in artificial intelligence isn\u2019t the fancy algorithms you use but having a really well-defined and well-understood question to start with. It\u2019s only when you fully understand the question that you can truly evaluate the results, as Ars Technica and The Intercept have neatly demonstrated.

At least that\u2019s the impression you\u2019d get if you read this report from Ars Technica (based on NSA documents leaked by The Intercept), which claims that a machine learning algorithm guiding U.S. drones \u2013 unfortunately named \u2018SKYNET\u2019 \u2013 could have wrongly targeted numerous innocent civilians. Let\u2019s start with the facts. For the last decade or so, the United States has used unmanned drones to attack militants in Pakistan. The number of kills is unknown, but estimates start at over a thousand and range up to maybe four thousand. A key problem for the intelligence services is finding the right people to kill, since the militants are mixed in with the general population and not just sitting in camp together waiting to be bombed.One thing they have is data, which apparently includes metadata from 55 million mobile phone users in Pakistan. For each user they could see which cell towers were pinged, how they moved, who they called, who called them, how long they spent on calls, when phones were switched off, and any of several dozen other statistics. That opened up a possible route for machine learning, neatly summarised on slide 2 of this deck. If we know that some of these 55 million people are couriers, can an algorithm find patterns in their behaviour and spot others who act in a similar way?What exactly is a \u2018courier\u2019 anyway? This is important to understanding some of the errors that The Intercept and Ars Technica made. Courier isn\u2019t a synonym for \u2018terrorist\u2019 as such - it means a specific kind of agent. Terrorist groups are justifiably nervous about using digital communications, and so a lot of messages are still delivered by hand, by couriers. Bin Laden made extensive use of couriers to pass information around, and it was through one of them \u2013 Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (an alias) - that he was eventually found.That\u2019s who the AI was being trained to detect \u2013 not the bin Ladens but the al-Kuwaitis. Not the targets so much as the people who might lead agents to them. Ars Technica implies that somehow the output of this courier detection method was used directly to \u201cgenerate the final kill list\u201d for drone strikes, but there\u2019s zero evidence I can see that this was ever the case, and it would make almost no sense given what the algorithm was actually looking for - you don\u2019t blow up your leads. How did it work? The NSA tried several classification algorithms, and chose what\u2019s known as a random forest approach. It\u2019s actually pretty simple to describe. You have 55 million records, each with 80 different variables or \u2018features\u2019 in them. A random forest algorithm splits this data up into lots of random overlapping bundles of records and features. So you might end up with e.g.:And so on. The next step is to train a decision tree on each bundle of data. A decision tree is, very crudely speaking, an algorithm that takes a record with a number of variables and goes through a series of yes/no questions to reach an answer. So for example, \u2018if this variable is > x1 and that variable is not > x2 and \u2018a third variable\u2019 is > x3\u2026\u2019 (...and so on for perhaps dozens of steps...) \u2018\u2026then this record is a courier.\u2019 The exact values for all the \u2018x\u2019s used are learned by training the algorithm on some test data where the outcomes are known, and you can think of them collectively as a model of the real world. Having created all those trees, you then bring them together to create your metaphorical forest. You run every single tree on each record, and combine the results from all of them to get some probability that the record is a courier. Very broadly speaking, the more the trees agree, the higher the probability is. Obviously this is a really simplified explanation, but hopefully it\u2019s enough to show that we\u2019re not talking about a mysterious black box here. How well did the algorithm do? Both The Intercept and Ars Technica leapt on the fact that the person with the highest probability of being a courier that they found in the data was Ahmad Zaidan, a bureau chief for Al-Jazeera in Islamabad. Cue snorts of derision from Ars Technica:\u201cAs The Intercept reported, Zaidan frequently travels to regions with known terrorist activity in order to interview insurgents and report the news. But rather than questioning the machine learning that produced such a bizarre result, the NSA engineers behind the algorithm instead trumpeted Zaidan as an example of a SKYNET success in their in-house presentation, including a slide that labelled Zaidan as a \u2018MEMBER OF AL-QA\u2019IDA.\u2019\u201dIf you knew nothing about machine learning, or you ignored the goals the algorithm was actually set, it might seem like a bad result. Actually it isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s ignore the NSA\u2019s prior beliefs about the man. The algorithm was trained to look for \u2018couriers\u2019, people who carry messages to and from Al Qaida members. As a journalist, Zaidan was so well connected with Al Qaida members that he interviewed Bin Laden on at least two occasions. This was a man who regularly travelled to, spoke with and carried messages from Al Qaida members. If the purpose of the algorithm had been narrowly to \u2018detect terrorists\u2019 or \u2018identify suicide bombers\u2019 then The Intercept might have a point. But it wasn\u2019t. It was trained to find people tightly linked to Al Qaida who might be carrying useful intelligence. Its identification of Zaidan \u2013 regardless of whether he was acting as a journalist or not \u2013 was entirely correct within the context of those goals. (As an aside, obviously I\u2019m not making any moral statement here about the validity of intelligence agencies tracking journalists and intercepting their communications. I\u2019m talking simply about the performance of the algorithm in carrying out the objectives it was set.) So the one case that The Intercept and Ars Technica highlight as a failure of the algorithm is actually a pretty striking success story. Zaidan is exactly the kind of person the NSA would expect and want the algorithm to highlight. Of course it\u2019s just one example thought, so how well did the algorithm perform over the rest of the data?The answer is: actually pretty well. The challenge here is pretty enormous because while the NSA has data on millions of people, only a tiny handful of them are confirmed couriers. With so little information, it\u2019s pretty hard to create a balanced set of data to train an algorithm on \u2013 an AI could just classify everyone as innocent and still claim to be over 99.99% accurate. A machine learning algorithm\u2019s basic job is to build a model of the world it sees, and when you have so few examples to learn from it can be a very cloudy view. In the end though they were able to train a model with a false positive rate \u2013 the number of people wrongly classed as terrorists - of just 0.008%. That\u2019s a pretty good achievement, but given the size of Pakistan\u2019s population it still means about 15,000 people being wrongly classified as couriers. If you were basing a kill list on that, it would be pretty bloody awful.Here\u2019s where The Intercept and Ars Technica really go off the deep end. The last slide of the deck (from June 2012) clearly states that these are preliminary results. The title paraphrases the conclusion to every other research study ever: \u201cWe\u2019re on the right track, but much remains to be done.\u201d This was an experiment in courier detection and a work in progress, and yet the two publications not only pretend that it was a deployed system, but also imply that the algorithm was used to generate a kill list for drone strokes. You can\u2019t prove a negative of course, but there\u2019s zero evidence here to substantiate the story. In reality of course you would combine the results from this kind of analysis with other intelligence, which is exactly what the NSA do \u2013 another slide shows that \u2018courier machine learning models\u2019 are just one small component of a much larger suite of data analytics used to identify targets, as you\u2019d expect. And of course data analytics will in turn be just one part of a broader intelligence processing effort. Nobody is being killed because of a flaky algorithm. The NSA couldn\u2019t be that stupid and still actually be capable of finding Pakistan on a map.It\u2019s a shame, because there\u2019s a lot to pick apart in this story, from ethical questions about bulk data gathering and tracking journalists to technical ones. Realistically, how well can you evaluate an algorithm when the original data contains so many people whose classification is unknown? And is \u2018courier\u2019 a clear cut category to begin with, or an ever-changing \u2018fuzzy\u2019 set?Finally, it\u2019s a great example of why often the most important thing in artificial intelligence isn\u2019t the fancy algorithms you use but having a really well-defined and well-understood question to start with. It\u2019s only when you fully understand the question that you can truly evaluate the results, as Ars Technica and The Intercept have neatly demonstrated.

Related: Legendary Englishman in row over fate of Pakistan school that bears his name The school\u2019s governors swiftly rejected the attempted coup but were powerless in the face of one of Langlands\u2019 most influential former pupils, Chaudhry Nisar, the interior minister, whom the major taught at Aitchison College, an elite Lahore private school.On Langlands\u2019 advice Nisar had blocked Schofield\u2019s application for a new work visa while she was on leave in the UK.\u201cI was left trying to run the school from my kitchen table in Chelsea,\u201d said Schofield, whose period in London coincided with serious flooding and an earthquake in the Chitral valley. \u201cI coped as best I could, but if you are not physically there you do not really know what is going on.\u201dLanglands is well known figure in Pakistan, where he served in the country\u2019s fledgling army after independence in 1947.He later pursued a teaching career that took him to the wild frontier with Afghanistan, where he was once kidnapped by tribesmen, and a long period running the school in Chitral, which was renamed in his honour.  Related: He has been kidnapped and taken tea with princesses: a British major's life teaching in Pakistan's Hindu Kush But the attempt to oust Schofield damaged his reputation among many parents, pupils and staff who credit the former writer with turning round a school that had been in steep decline in the last years of Langlands\u2019 tenure.In September teachers and support staff piled into the school\u2019s bus for the gruelling 24-hour journey through winding mountain passes to Lahore, where Langlands lives in retirement at Aitchison College.Barred from entering the college\u2019s grand campus, the 60-strong group stood on the street outside and held a two-hour meeting with Langlands from either side of the school\u2019s iron gates.\u201cInitially he was very stubborn and refused to accept our point of view,\u201d said Amina Mumtaz, head of early childhood development at the school, who believes the major had been misled about Schofield by aggrieved teachers who she had sacked.\u201cBut after we told him about the realities of Miss Carey and all she has done for the school, he realised he had done a very wrong thing and wanted to help make things right,\u201d she said.Langlands and the teachers decamped to Islamabad the following day to lobby Nisar. Although they were unable to meet the interior minister, one of his top officials promised to grant Schofield a visa, which finally came through in February.Schofield told the Guardian she wanted to continue raising standards at the school, which she said was helping to raise the aspirations of a generation of Chitralis who in the past had only been equipped for work outside the valley as menial jobs.", "tags": ["Pakistan", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Education"], "title": "Exiled head returns to Pakistan school after legendary predecessor relents"},{"date": "2015-09-24T14:59:48Z", "content": "Only 500,000 Pakistanis filed a tax return and paid income tax last year. This is disastrous for the economy. With no sustainable revenue, public debt is spiralling out of control. Despite a robust and thriving private sector, Pakistan is still one of the world\u2019s poorest countries; 30% of children are chronically malnourished.Almost half of government revenue is used to pay debt, which leaves little left for development. Pakistan needs to get better at collecting taxes. Why do so few people pay tax? A public survey by Adam Smith International reveals serious public grievances: people think their money will be misused, or that they should not pay taxes when elites, including politicians, dodge payment. The current tax system is complex, non-transparent and inefficient. Put simply, many people avoid paying tax because the system allows it; others feel they are already taxed a lot on things like fuel and electricity.The good news is people are willing to pay; but not to a flawed system. The bad news is reform efforts have either failed, or been short-lived. Political blockages have slowed down reform efforts and people are disengaged and frustrated. There needs to be greater public demand for a better, more equitable tax system. Advocacy group Research and Advocacy for the Advancement of Allied Reforms (Raftaar) has launched its first campaign that alerts Pakistanis to their role in solving the tax crisis. It engages the public by explaining the linkages between revenue collection and service delivery. Through increased public awareness and advocacy from policy-makers, the group is pushing the government to be accountable for increasing revenue and providing services. The group, funded by the UK\u2019s department for international development and facilitated by Adam Smith International, is advocating for a series of reforms. Currently, there are formal loopholes which allow tax exemptions in certain sectors; this is often politically motivated and leads to significant revenue losses. Raftaar is lobbying for parliamentarians to lead by example and publicly pledge to comply with their tax obligations and reduce unnecessary tax exemptions. It is also putting pressure on the government to remove duties on basic foods items, like wheat and rice. Reducing the price of such items will help lower the prevalence of chronic malnutrition. This is the kind of sustainable development Pakistan needs. To carry out these reforms, the government also needs to improve its legislative, policy and administrative capacity, at both the Federal and provincial level. Provincial reform is essential since revenue collection is decentralised and provinces have a mandate to collect more taxes, namely sales tax on services.Pakistan\u2019s economy depends on it.

This is disastrous for the economy. With no sustainable revenue, public debt is spiralling out of control. Despite a robust and thriving private sector, Pakistan is still one of the world\u2019s poorest countries; 30% of children are chronically malnourished.Almost half of government revenue is used to pay debt, which leaves little left for development. Pakistan needs to get better at collecting taxes. Why do so few people pay tax? A public survey by Adam Smith International reveals serious public grievances: people think their money will be misused, or that they should not pay taxes when elites, including politicians, dodge payment. The current tax system is complex, non-transparent and inefficient. Put simply, many people avoid paying tax because the system allows it; others feel they are already taxed a lot on things like fuel and electricity.The good news is people are willing to pay; but not to a flawed system. The bad news is reform efforts have either failed, or been short-lived. Political blockages have slowed down reform efforts and people are disengaged and frustrated. There needs to be greater public demand for a better, more equitable tax system. Advocacy group Research and Advocacy for the Advancement of Allied Reforms (Raftaar) has launched its first campaign that alerts Pakistanis to their role in solving the tax crisis. It engages the public by explaining the linkages between revenue collection and service delivery. Through increased public awareness and advocacy from policy-makers, the group is pushing the government to be accountable for increasing revenue and providing services. The group, funded by the UK\u2019s department for international development and facilitated by Adam Smith International, is advocating for a series of reforms. Currently, there are formal loopholes which allow tax exemptions in certain sectors; this is often politically motivated and leads to significant revenue losses. Raftaar is lobbying for parliamentarians to lead by example and publicly pledge to comply with their tax obligations and reduce unnecessary tax exemptions. It is also putting pressure on the government to remove duties on basic foods items, like wheat and rice. Reducing the price of such items will help lower the prevalence of chronic malnutrition. This is the kind of sustainable development Pakistan needs. To carry out these reforms, the government also needs to improve its legislative, policy and administrative capacity, at both the Federal and provincial level. Provincial reform is essential since revenue collection is decentralised and provinces have a mandate to collect more taxes, namely sales tax on services.Pakistan\u2019s economy depends on it. Its public debt has increased nearly threefold in seven years and public services are severely lacking.

Last year Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, said that human rights no longer had the profile within his department that they had in the past.The UK\u2019s \u00a35.6m donation was made to Pakistan\u2019s anti-narcotics force, through a five-year UN Office on Drugs and Crime project, despite the fact that the Pakistan government insisted donors could not demand that it be linked to human rights considerations. A UNODC valuation of the programme, published in April 2014, observed that: \u201cUNODC was strongly advised by the GOP [government of Pakistan] to exclude [human rights] considerations from the CP [country programme] design and to advance with an oblique approach, where human rights issues would be addressed indirectly through training and improving criminal justice results [prosecutions based on evidence not interrogation] but not explicitly mentioned.\u201dThe project paid for the acquisition of surveillance vehicles, drug-testing kits and the construction of border control posts, places where drug carriers are frequently arrested, according to human rights groups. It was assessed according to key performance indicators \u2013 notably the number of arrests and successful prosecutions carried out by the ANF.Human rights groups claim the targets encourage capital convictions because drug seizures of more than a kilogramme are punishable by death in Pakistan, which last year executed more than 300 people, overtaking Saudi Arabia to become the world\u2019s third most prolific executing state. In its annual report filed last year, the ANF boasted that it was achieving the sort of results demanded by the UNODC. It noted that it had a successful prosecution rate of 89% \u201cwhich includes five death penalties\u201d.\u201cIt is a scandal that the government is using public money to support raids that send people to death row,\u201d said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve\u2019s death penalty team. \u201cPakistan\u2019s anti-narcotics force aggressively pursues death sentences for people convicted of non-violent drug offences in deeply flawed drug courts.\u201dThe UK funding of the United Nations project project began when Pakistan was holding a moratorium on the death penalty. \u201cWe are not aware of any executions in Pakistan as a result of UK counter-narcotics co-operation,\u201d a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. \u201cThe UK and Pakistan have a shared interest in working to tackle organised crime including the trafficking of drugs, which is a threat to both our societies.\u201dBut even after the moratorium was lifted the UK continued to run counter-narcotics training operations in Pakistan.

It remains unclear as to whether the UK will commit to the programme. The government discontinued funding counter-narcotics programmes in Iran amid concerns about the country\u2019s use of the death penalty.The Foreign Office insists that all government departments must adhere to clear guidance when deciding on funding programmes abroad that have human rights implications.

At least that\u2019s the impression you\u2019d get if you read this report from Ars Technica (based on NSA documents leaked by The Intercept), which claims that a machine learning algorithm guiding U.S. drones \u2013 unfortunately named \u2018SKYNET\u2019 \u2013 could have wrongly targeted numerous innocent civilians. Let\u2019s start with the facts. For the last decade or so, the United States has used unmanned drones to attack militants in Pakistan. The number of kills is unknown, but estimates start at over a thousand and range up to maybe four thousand. A key problem for the intelligence services is finding the right people to kill, since the militants are mixed in with the general population and not just sitting in camp together waiting to be bombed.One thing they have is data, which apparently includes metadata from 55 million mobile phone users in Pakistan. For each user they could see which cell towers were pinged, how they moved, who they called, who called them, how long they spent on calls, when phones were switched off, and any of several dozen other statistics. That opened up a possible route for machine learning, neatly summarised on slide 2 of this deck. If we know that some of these 55 million people are couriers, can an algorithm find patterns in their behaviour and spot others who act in a similar way?What exactly is a \u2018courier\u2019 anyway? This is important to understanding some of the errors that The Intercept and Ars Technica made. Courier isn\u2019t a synonym for \u2018terrorist\u2019 as such - it means a specific kind of agent. Terrorist groups are justifiably nervous about using digital communications, and so a lot of messages are still delivered by hand, by couriers. Bin Laden made extensive use of couriers to pass information around, and it was through one of them \u2013 Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (an alias) - that he was eventually found.That\u2019s who the AI was being trained to detect \u2013 not the bin Ladens but the al-Kuwaitis. Not the targets so much as the people who might lead agents to them. Ars Technica implies that somehow the output of this courier detection method was used directly to \u201cgenerate the final kill list\u201d for drone strikes, but there\u2019s zero evidence I can see that this was ever the case, and it would make almost no sense given what the algorithm was actually looking for - you don\u2019t blow up your leads. How did it work? The NSA tried several classification algorithms, and chose what\u2019s known as a random forest approach. It\u2019s actually pretty simple to describe.

This is disastrous for the economy. With no sustainable revenue, public debt is spiralling out of control. Despite a robust and thriving private sector, Pakistan is still one of the world\u2019s poorest countries; 30% of children are chronically malnourished.Almost half of government revenue is used to pay debt, which leaves little left for development. Pakistan needs to get better at collecting taxes. Why do so few people pay tax? A public survey by Adam Smith International reveals serious public grievances: people think their money will be misused, or that they should not pay taxes when elites, including politicians, dodge payment. The current tax system is complex, non-transparent and inefficient. Put simply, many people avoid paying tax because the system allows it; others feel they are already taxed a lot on things like fuel and electricity.The good news is people are willing to pay; but not to a flawed system. The bad news is reform efforts have either failed, or been short-lived. Political blockages have slowed down reform efforts and people are disengaged and frustrated. There needs to be greater public demand for a better, more equitable tax system. Advocacy group Research and Advocacy for the Advancement of Allied Reforms (Raftaar) has launched its first campaign that alerts Pakistanis to their role in solving the tax crisis. It engages the public by explaining the linkages between revenue collection and service delivery. Through increased public awareness and advocacy from policy-makers, the group is pushing the government to be accountable for increasing revenue and providing services. The group, funded by the UK\u2019s department for international development and facilitated by Adam Smith International, is advocating for a series of reforms. Currently, there are formal loopholes which allow tax exemptions in certain sectors; this is often politically motivated and leads to significant revenue losses. Raftaar is lobbying for parliamentarians to lead by example and publicly pledge to comply with their tax obligations and reduce unnecessary tax exemptions. It is also putting pressure on the government to remove duties on basic foods items, like wheat and rice. Reducing the price of such items will help lower the prevalence of chronic malnutrition. This is the kind of sustainable development Pakistan needs. To carry out these reforms, the government also needs to improve its legislative, policy and administrative capacity, at both the Federal and provincial level. Provincial reform is essential since revenue collection is decentralised and provinces have a mandate to collect more taxes, namely sales tax on services.Pakistan\u2019s economy depends on it. Its public debt has increased nearly threefold in seven years and public services are severely lacking.

Last year Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office, said that human rights no longer had the profile within his department that they had in the past.The UK\u2019s \u00a35.6m donation was made to Pakistan\u2019s anti-narcotics force, through a five-year UN Office on Drugs and Crime project, despite the fact that the Pakistan government insisted donors could not demand that it be linked to human rights considerations. A UNODC valuation of the programme, published in April 2014, observed that: \u201cUNODC was strongly advised by the GOP [government of Pakistan] to exclude [human rights] considerations from the CP [country programme] design and to advance with an oblique approach, where human rights issues would be addressed indirectly through training and improving criminal justice results [prosecutions based on evidence not interrogation] but not explicitly mentioned.\u201dThe project paid for the acquisition of surveillance vehicles, drug-testing kits and the construction of border control posts, places where drug carriers are frequently arrested, according to human rights groups. It was assessed according to key performance indicators \u2013 notably the number of arrests and successful prosecutions carried out by the ANF.Human rights groups claim the targets encourage capital convictions because drug seizures of more than a kilogramme are punishable by death in Pakistan, which last year executed more than 300 people, overtaking Saudi Arabia to become the world\u2019s third most prolific executing state. In its annual report filed last year, the ANF boasted that it was achieving the sort of results demanded by the UNODC. It noted that it had a successful prosecution rate of 89% \u201cwhich includes five death penalties\u201d.\u201cIt is a scandal that the government is using public money to support raids that send people to death row,\u201d said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve\u2019s death penalty team. \u201cPakistan\u2019s anti-narcotics force aggressively pursues death sentences for people convicted of non-violent drug offences in deeply flawed drug courts.\u201dThe UK funding of the United Nations project project began when Pakistan was holding a moratorium on the death penalty. \u201cWe are not aware of any executions in Pakistan as a result of UK counter-narcotics co-operation,\u201d a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. \u201cThe UK and Pakistan have a shared interest in working to tackle organised crime including the trafficking of drugs, which is a threat to both our societies.\u201dBut even after the moratorium was lifted the UK continued to run counter-narcotics training operations in Pakistan.

At least that\u2019s the impression you\u2019d get if you read this report from Ars Technica (based on NSA documents leaked by The Intercept), which claims that a machine learning algorithm guiding U.S. drones \u2013 unfortunately named \u2018SKYNET\u2019 \u2013 could have wrongly targeted numerous innocent civilians. Let\u2019s start with the facts. For the last decade or so, the United States has used unmanned drones to attack militants in Pakistan. The number of kills is unknown, but estimates start at over a thousand and range up to maybe four thousand. A key problem for the intelligence services is finding the right people to kill, since the militants are mixed in with the general population and not just sitting in camp together waiting to be bombed.One thing they have is data, which apparently includes metadata from 55 million mobile phone users in Pakistan. For each user they could see which cell towers were pinged, how they moved, who they called, who called them, how long they spent on calls, when phones were switched off, and any of several dozen other statistics. That opened up a possible route for machine learning, neatly summarised on slide 2 of this deck. If we know that some of these 55 million people are couriers, can an algorithm find patterns in their behaviour and spot others who act in a similar way?What exactly is a \u2018courier\u2019 anyway? This is important to understanding some of the errors that The Intercept and Ars Technica made. Courier isn\u2019t a synonym for \u2018terrorist\u2019 as such - it means a specific kind of agent. Terrorist groups are justifiably nervous about using digital communications, and so a lot of messages are still delivered by hand, by couriers. Bin Laden made extensive use of couriers to pass information around, and it was through one of them \u2013 Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (an alias) - that he was eventually found.That\u2019s who the AI was being trained to detect \u2013 not the bin Ladens but the al-Kuwaitis. Not the targets so much as the people who might lead agents to them. Ars Technica implies that somehow the output of this courier detection method was used directly to \u201cgenerate the final kill list\u201d for drone strikes, but there\u2019s zero evidence I can see that this was ever the case, and it would make almost no sense given what the algorithm was actually looking for - you don\u2019t blow up your leads. How did it work? The NSA tried several classification algorithms, and chose what\u2019s known as a random forest approach. It\u2019s actually pretty simple to describe. You have 55 million records, each with 80 different variables or \u2018features\u2019 in them. A random forest algorithm splits this data up into lots of random overlapping bundles of records and features. So you might end up with e.g.:And so on. The next step is to train a decision tree on each bundle of data. A decision tree is, very crudely speaking, an algorithm that takes a record with a number of variables and goes through a series of yes/no questions to reach an answer. So for example, \u2018if this variable is > x1 and that variable is not > x2 and \u2018a third variable\u2019 is > x3\u2026\u2019 (...and so on for perhaps dozens of steps...) \u2018\u2026then this record is a courier.\u2019 The exact values for all the \u2018x\u2019s used are learned by training the algorithm on some test data where the outcomes are known, and you can think of them collectively as a model of the real world. Having created all those trees, you then bring them together to create your metaphorical forest. You run every single tree on each record, and combine the results from all of them to get some probability that the record is a courier. Very broadly speaking, the more the trees agree, the higher the probability is. Obviously this is a really simplified explanation, but hopefully it\u2019s enough to show that we\u2019re not talking about a mysterious black box here. How well did the algorithm do? Both The Intercept and Ars Technica leapt on the fact that the person with the highest probability of being a courier that they found in the data was Ahmad Zaidan, a bureau chief for Al-Jazeera in Islamabad. Cue snorts of derision from Ars Technica:\u201cAs The Intercept reported, Zaidan frequently travels to regions with known terrorist activity in order to interview insurgents and report the news. But rather than questioning the machine learning that produced such a bizarre result, the NSA engineers behind the algorithm instead trumpeted Zaidan as an example of a SKYNET success in their in-house presentation, including a slide that labelled Zaidan as a \u2018MEMBER OF AL-QA\u2019IDA.\u2019\u201dIf you knew nothing about machine learning, or you ignored the goals the algorithm was actually set, it might seem like a bad result. Actually it isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s ignore the NSA\u2019s prior beliefs about the man. The algorithm was trained to look for \u2018couriers\u2019, people who carry messages to and from Al Qaida members. As a journalist, Zaidan was so well connected with Al Qaida members that he interviewed Bin Laden on at least two occasions. This was a man who regularly travelled to, spoke with and carried messages from Al Qaida members. If the purpose of the algorithm had been narrowly to \u2018detect terrorists\u2019 or \u2018identify suicide bombers\u2019 then The Intercept might have a point. But it wasn\u2019t. It was trained to find people tightly linked to Al Qaida who might be carrying useful intelligence. Its identification of Zaidan \u2013 regardless of whether he was acting as a journalist or not \u2013 was entirely correct within the context of those goals. (As an aside, obviously I\u2019m not making any moral statement here about the validity of intelligence agencies tracking journalists and intercepting their communications. I\u2019m talking simply about the performance of the algorithm in carrying out the objectives it was set.) So the one case that The Intercept and Ars Technica highlight as a failure of the algorithm is actually a pretty striking success story. Zaidan is exactly the kind of person the NSA would expect and want the algorithm to highlight. Of course it\u2019s just one example thought, so how well did the algorithm perform over the rest of the data?The answer is: actually pretty well. The challenge here is pretty enormous because while the NSA has data on millions of people, only a tiny handful of them are confirmed couriers. With so little information, it\u2019s pretty hard to create a balanced set of data to train an algorithm on \u2013 an AI could just classify everyone as innocent and still claim to be over 99.99% accurate. A machine learning algorithm\u2019s basic job is to build a model of the world it sees, and when you have so few examples to learn from it can be a very cloudy view. In the end though they were able to train a model with a false positive rate \u2013 the number of people wrongly classed as terrorists - of just 0.008%. That\u2019s a pretty good achievement, but given the size of Pakistan\u2019s population it still means about 15,000 people being wrongly classified as couriers. If you were basing a kill list on that, it would be pretty bloody awful.Here\u2019s where The Intercept and Ars Technica really go off the deep end. The last slide of the deck (from June 2012) clearly states that these are preliminary results. The title paraphrases the conclusion to every other research study ever: \u201cWe\u2019re on the right track, but much remains to be done.\u201d This was an experiment in courier detection and a work in progress, and yet the two publications not only pretend that it was a deployed system, but also imply that the algorithm was used to generate a kill list for drone strokes. You can\u2019t prove a negative of course, but there\u2019s zero evidence here to substantiate the story. In reality of course you would combine the results from this kind of analysis with other intelligence, which is exactly what the NSA do \u2013 another slide shows that \u2018courier machine learning models\u2019 are just one small component of a much larger suite of data analytics used to identify targets, as you\u2019d expect. And of course data analytics will in turn be just one part of a broader intelligence processing effort. Nobody is being killed because of a flaky algorithm. The NSA couldn\u2019t be that stupid and still actually be capable of finding Pakistan on a map.It\u2019s a shame, because there\u2019s a lot to pick apart in this story, from ethical questions about bulk data gathering and tracking journalists to technical ones. Realistically, how well can you evaluate an algorithm when the original data contains so many people whose classification is unknown? And is \u2018courier\u2019 a clear cut category to begin with, or an ever-changing \u2018fuzzy\u2019 set?Finally, it\u2019s a great example of why often the most important thing in artificial intelligence isn\u2019t the fancy algorithms you use but having a really well-defined and well-understood question to start with. It\u2019s only when you fully understand the question that you can truly evaluate the results, as Ars Technica and The Intercept have neatly demonstrated.

This is disastrous for the economy. With no sustainable revenue, public debt is spiralling out of control. Despite a robust and thriving private sector, Pakistan is still one of the world\u2019s poorest countries; 30% of children are chronically malnourished.Almost half of government revenue is used to pay debt, which leaves little left for development. Pakistan needs to get better at collecting taxes. Why do so few people pay tax? A public survey by Adam Smith International reveals serious public grievances: people think their money will be misused, or that they should not pay taxes when elites, including politicians, dodge payment. The current tax system is complex, non-transparent and inefficient. Put simply, many people avoid paying tax because the system allows it; others feel they are already taxed a lot on things like fuel and electricity.The good news is people are willing to pay; but not to a flawed system. The bad news is reform efforts have either failed, or been short-lived. Political blockages have slowed down reform efforts and people are disengaged and frustrated. There needs to be greater public demand for a better, more equitable tax system. Advocacy group Research and Advocacy for the Advancement of Allied Reforms (Raftaar) has launched its first campaign that alerts Pakistanis to their role in solving the tax crisis. It engages the public by explaining the linkages between revenue collection and service delivery. Through increased public awareness and advocacy from policy-makers, the group is pushing the government to be accountable for increasing revenue and providing services. The group, funded by the UK\u2019s department for international development and facilitated by Adam Smith International, is advocating for a series of reforms. Currently, there are formal loopholes which allow tax exemptions in certain sectors; this is often politically motivated and leads to significant revenue losses. Raftaar is lobbying for parliamentarians to lead by example and publicly pledge to comply with their tax obligations and reduce unnecessary tax exemptions. It is also putting pressure on the government to remove duties on basic foods items, like wheat and rice. Reducing the price of such items will help lower the prevalence of chronic malnutrition. This is the kind of sustainable development Pakistan needs. To carry out these reforms, the government also needs to improve its legislative, policy and administrative capacity, at both the Federal and provincial level. Provincial reform is essential since revenue collection is decentralised and provinces have a mandate to collect more taxes, namely sales tax on services.Pakistan\u2019s economy depends on it. Its public debt has increased nearly threefold in seven years and public services are severely lacking.

A UNODC valuation of the programme, published in April 2014, observed that: \u201cUNODC was strongly advised by the GOP [government of Pakistan] to exclude [human rights] considerations from the CP [country programme] design and to advance with an oblique approach, where human rights issues would be addressed indirectly through training and improving criminal justice results [prosecutions based on evidence not interrogation] but not explicitly mentioned.\u201dThe project paid for the acquisition of surveillance vehicles, drug-testing kits and the construction of border control posts, places where drug carriers are frequently arrested, according to human rights groups. It was assessed according to key performance indicators \u2013 notably the number of arrests and successful prosecutions carried out by the ANF.Human rights groups claim the targets encourage capital convictions because drug seizures of more than a kilogramme are punishable by death in Pakistan, which last year executed more than 300 people, overtaking Saudi Arabia to become the world\u2019s third most prolific executing state. In its annual report filed last year, the ANF boasted that it was achieving the sort of results demanded by the UNODC. It noted that it had a successful prosecution rate of 89% \u201cwhich includes five death penalties\u201d.\u201cIt is a scandal that the government is using public money to support raids that send people to death row,\u201d said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve\u2019s death penalty team. \u201cPakistan\u2019s anti-narcotics force aggressively pursues death sentences for people convicted of non-violent drug offences in deeply flawed drug courts.\u201dThe UK funding of the United Nations project project began when Pakistan was holding a moratorium on the death penalty. \u201cWe are not aware of any executions in Pakistan as a result of UK counter-narcotics co-operation,\u201d a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. \u201cThe UK and Pakistan have a shared interest in working to tackle organised crime including the trafficking of drugs, which is a threat to both our societies.\u201dBut even after the moratorium was lifted the UK continued to run counter-narcotics training operations in Pakistan.

At least that\u2019s the impression you\u2019d get if you read this report from Ars Technica (based on NSA documents leaked by The Intercept), which claims that a machine learning algorithm guiding U.S. drones \u2013 unfortunately named \u2018SKYNET\u2019 \u2013 could have wrongly targeted numerous innocent civilians. Let\u2019s start with the facts. For the last decade or so, the United States has used unmanned drones to attack militants in Pakistan. The number of kills is unknown, but estimates start at over a thousand and range up to maybe four thousand. A key problem for the intelligence services is finding the right people to kill, since the militants are mixed in with the general population and not just sitting in camp together waiting to be bombed.One thing they have is data, which apparently includes metadata from 55 million mobile phone users in Pakistan. For each user they could see which cell towers were pinged, how they moved, who they called, who called them, how long they spent on calls, when phones were switched off, and any of several dozen other statistics. That opened up a possible route for machine learning, neatly summarised on slide 2 of this deck. If we know that some of these 55 million people are couriers, can an algorithm find patterns in their behaviour and spot others who act in a similar way?What exactly is a \u2018courier\u2019 anyway? This is important to understanding some of the errors that The Intercept and Ars Technica made. Courier isn\u2019t a synonym for \u2018terrorist\u2019 as such - it means a specific kind of agent. Terrorist groups are justifiably nervous about using digital communications, and so a lot of messages are still delivered by hand, by couriers. Bin Laden made extensive use of couriers to pass information around, and it was through one of them \u2013 Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (an alias) - that he was eventually found.That\u2019s who the AI was being trained to detect \u2013 not the bin Ladens but the al-Kuwaitis. Not the targets so much as the people who might lead agents to them. Ars Technica implies that somehow the output of this courier detection method was used directly to \u201cgenerate the final kill list\u201d for drone strikes, but there\u2019s zero evidence I can see that this was ever the case, and it would make almost no sense given what the algorithm was actually looking for - you don\u2019t blow up your leads. How did it work? The NSA tried several classification algorithms, and chose what\u2019s known as a random forest approach. It\u2019s actually pretty simple to describe. You have 55 million records, each with 80 different variables or \u2018features\u2019 in them. A random forest algorithm splits this data up into lots of random overlapping bundles of records and features. So you might end up with e.g.:And so on. The next step is to train a decision tree on each bundle of data. A decision tree is, very crudely speaking, an algorithm that takes a record with a number of variables and goes through a series of yes/no questions to reach an answer. So for example, \u2018if this variable is > x1 and that variable is not > x2 and \u2018a third variable\u2019 is > x3\u2026\u2019 (...and so on for perhaps dozens of steps...) \u2018\u2026then this record is a courier.\u2019 The exact values for all the \u2018x\u2019s used are learned by training the algorithm on some test data where the outcomes are known, and you can think of them collectively as a model of the real world. Having created all those trees, you then bring them together to create your metaphorical forest. You run every single tree on each record, and combine the results from all of them to get some probability that the record is a courier. Very broadly speaking, the more the trees agree, the higher the probability is. Obviously this is a really simplified explanation, but hopefully it\u2019s enough to show that we\u2019re not talking about a mysterious black box here. How well did the algorithm do? Both The Intercept and Ars Technica leapt on the fact that the person with the highest probability of being a courier that they found in the data was Ahmad Zaidan, a bureau chief for Al-Jazeera in Islamabad. Cue snorts of derision from Ars Technica:\u201cAs The Intercept reported, Zaidan frequently travels to regions with known terrorist activity in order to interview insurgents and report the news. But rather than questioning the machine learning that produced such a bizarre result, the NSA engineers behind the algorithm instead trumpeted Zaidan as an example of a SKYNET success in their in-house presentation, including a slide that labelled Zaidan as a \u2018MEMBER OF AL-QA\u2019IDA.\u2019\u201dIf you knew nothing about machine learning, or you ignored the goals the algorithm was actually set, it might seem like a bad result. Actually it isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s ignore the NSA\u2019s prior beliefs about the man. The algorithm was trained to look for \u2018couriers\u2019, people who carry messages to and from Al Qaida members. As a journalist, Zaidan was so well connected with Al Qaida members that he interviewed Bin Laden on at least two occasions. This was a man who regularly travelled to, spoke with and carried messages from Al Qaida members. If the purpose of the algorithm had been narrowly to \u2018detect terrorists\u2019 or \u2018identify suicide bombers\u2019 then The Intercept might have a point. But it wasn\u2019t. It was trained to find people tightly linked to Al Qaida who might be carrying useful intelligence. Its identification of Zaidan \u2013 regardless of whether he was acting as a journalist or not \u2013 was entirely correct within the context of those goals. (As an aside, obviously I\u2019m not making any moral statement here about the validity of intelligence agencies tracking journalists and intercepting their communications. I\u2019m talking simply about the performance of the algorithm in carrying out the objectives it was set.) So the one case that The Intercept and Ars Technica highlight as a failure of the algorithm is actually a pretty striking success story. Zaidan is exactly the kind of person the NSA would expect and want the algorithm to highlight. Of course it\u2019s just one example thought, so how well did the algorithm perform over the rest of the data?The answer is: actually pretty well. The challenge here is pretty enormous because while the NSA has data on millions of people, only a tiny handful of them are confirmed couriers. With so little information, it\u2019s pretty hard to create a balanced set of data to train an algorithm on \u2013 an AI could just classify everyone as innocent and still claim to be over 99.99% accurate. A machine learning algorithm\u2019s basic job is to build a model of the world it sees, and when you have so few examples to learn from it can be a very cloudy view. In the end though they were able to train a model with a false positive rate \u2013 the number of people wrongly classed as terrorists - of just 0.008%. That\u2019s a pretty good achievement, but given the size of Pakistan\u2019s population it still means about 15,000 people being wrongly classified as couriers. If you were basing a kill list on that, it would be pretty bloody awful.Here\u2019s where The Intercept and Ars Technica really go off the deep end. The last slide of the deck (from June 2012) clearly states that these are preliminary results. The title paraphrases the conclusion to every other research study ever: \u201cWe\u2019re on the right track, but much remains to be done.\u201d This was an experiment in courier detection and a work in progress, and yet the two publications not only pretend that it was a deployed system, but also imply that the algorithm was used to generate a kill list for drone strokes. You can\u2019t prove a negative of course, but there\u2019s zero evidence here to substantiate the story. In reality of course you would combine the results from this kind of analysis with other intelligence, which is exactly what the NSA do \u2013 another slide shows that \u2018courier machine learning models\u2019 are just one small component of a much larger suite of data analytics used to identify targets, as you\u2019d expect. And of course data analytics will in turn be just one part of a broader intelligence processing effort. Nobody is being killed because of a flaky algorithm. The NSA couldn\u2019t be that stupid and still actually be capable of finding Pakistan on a map.It\u2019s a shame, because there\u2019s a lot to pick apart in this story, from ethical questions about bulk data gathering and tracking journalists to technical ones. Realistically, how well can you evaluate an algorithm when the original data contains so many people whose classification is unknown? And is \u2018courier\u2019 a clear cut category to begin with, or an ever-changing \u2018fuzzy\u2019 set?Finally, it\u2019s a great example of why often the most important thing in artificial intelligence isn\u2019t the fancy algorithms you use but having a really well-defined and well-understood question to start with. It\u2019s only when you fully understand the question that you can truly evaluate the results, as Ars Technica and The Intercept have neatly demonstrated.

They were driven back, but a new threat to Pakistan\u2019s fragile stability had emerged.Over the last six or so years, a combination of drone strikes and military offensives has weakened the movement, killing successive commanders and forcing factions out of their bases.Yet the TTP has retained the capacity to do serious harm, and as pressure has increased since the launch of a military campaign about 18 months ago, various factions have lashed out at Pakistan\u2019s security forces and state. One high-profile attack 13 months ago targeted an army-run school in Peshawar, the western frontier city, killing 148 people, mainly children. Related: Pakistan attacks: at least 30 dead in terror raid at Bacha Khan University That assault prompted widespread anger, grief and revulsion in Pakistan, and authorities launched a more wide-ranging effort to stamp out terrorism afterwards. This involved more military action, the detention of tens of thousands of people and the vigorous implementation of the death penalty.Under further strain, the TTP has fractured further, with many commanders leading their fighters across the frontier into Afghanistan, or simply going to ground.The authority of the nominal leader, Mullah Fazlullah, was already weak, and has now almost disappeared. This lack of unified decision-making explains why one TTP commander could proudly claim responsibility for the attack on the Bacha Khan University, before the principal spokesman for the movement issued a denial in which he described the killing of students in such an establishment as un-Islamic.This lack of solidarity has some advantages however. As its component parts are almost autonomous, the TTP is resilient. If one commander is killed, trafficking racket shut down, or base destroyed, the impact on others is limited. Support networks in towns and cities exist across Pakistan, with key enablers making attacks like today\u2019s possible.The response of the Pakistani authorities to the threat posed by the TTP is based solely on military force and repression. Little or nothing has been done to tackle the deep roots of the problem: the economic and political marginalisation of the frontier zones; the mass of weaponry in those areas; the growth of intolerant conservative religious doctrine over decades; and the spread of a hate-filled worldview.Western policymakers, largely because it is seen to pose a minimal international threat, rarely mention the movement.", "tags": ["Pakistan", "Taliban", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Afghanistan"], "title": "Bacha Khan University attack: what is Tehreek-e-Taliban \u200bPakistan?"},{"date": "2015-09-24T14:59:48Z", "content": "Only 500,000 Pakistanis filed a tax return and paid income tax last year. This is disastrous for the economy. With no sustainable revenue, public debt is spiralling out of control. Despite a robust and thriving private sector, Pakistan is still one of the world\u2019s poorest countries; 30% of children are chronically malnourished.Almost half of government revenue is used to pay debt, which leaves little left for development. Pakistan needs to get better at collecting taxes. Why do so few people pay tax? A public survey by Adam Smith International reveals serious public grievances: people think their money will be misused, or that they should not pay taxes when elites, including politicians, dodge payment. The current tax system is complex, non-transparent and inefficient. Put simply, many people avoid paying tax because the system allows it; others feel they are already taxed a lot on things like fuel and electricity.The good news is people are willing to pay; but not to a flawed system. The bad news is reform efforts have either failed, or been short-lived. Political blockages have slowed down reform efforts and people are disengaged and frustrated. There needs to be greater public demand for a better, more equitable tax system. Advocacy group Research and Advocacy for the Advancement of Allied Reforms (Raftaar) has launched its first campaign that alerts Pakistanis to their role in solving the tax crisis. It engages the public by explaining the linkages between revenue collection and service delivery. Through increased public awareness and advocacy from policy-makers, the group is pushing the government to be accountable for increasing revenue and providing services. The group, funded by the UK\u2019s department for international development and facilitated by Adam Smith International, is advocating for a series of reforms. Currently, there are formal loopholes which allow tax exemptions in certain sectors; this is often politically motivated and leads to significant revenue losses. Raftaar is lobbying for parliamentarians to lead by example and publicly pledge to comply with their tax obligations and reduce unnecessary tax exemptions. It is also putting pressure on the government to remove duties on basic foods items, like wheat and rice. Reducing the price of such items will help lower the prevalence of chronic malnutrition. This is the kind of sustainable development Pakistan needs. To carry out these reforms, the government also needs to improve its legislative, policy and administrative capacity, at both the Federal and provincial level. Provincial reform is essential since revenue collection is decentralised and provinces have a mandate to collect more taxes, namely sales tax on services.Pakistan\u2019s economy depends on it. Its public debt has increased nearly threefold in seven years and public services are severely lacking.

A UNODC valuation of the programme, published in April 2014, observed that: \u201cUNODC was strongly advised by the GOP [government of Pakistan] to exclude [human rights] considerations from the CP [country programme] design and to advance with an oblique approach, where human rights issues would be addressed indirectly through training and improving criminal justice results [prosecutions based on evidence not interrogation] but not explicitly mentioned.\u201dThe project paid for the acquisition of surveillance vehicles, drug-testing kits and the construction of border control posts, places where drug carriers are frequently arrested, according to human rights groups. It was assessed according to key performance indicators \u2013 notably the number of arrests and successful prosecutions carried out by the ANF.Human rights groups claim the targets encourage capital convictions because drug seizures of more than a kilogramme are punishable by death in Pakistan, which last year executed more than 300 people, overtaking Saudi Arabia to become the world\u2019s third most prolific executing state. In its annual report filed last year, the ANF boasted that it was achieving the sort of results demanded by the UNODC. It noted that it had a successful prosecution rate of 89% \u201cwhich includes five death penalties\u201d.\u201cIt is a scandal that the government is using public money to support raids that send people to death row,\u201d said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve\u2019s death penalty team. \u201cPakistan\u2019s anti-narcotics force aggressively pursues death sentences for people convicted of non-violent drug offences in deeply flawed drug courts.\u201dThe UK funding of the United Nations project project began when Pakistan was holding a moratorium on the death penalty. \u201cWe are not aware of any executions in Pakistan as a result of UK counter-narcotics co-operation,\u201d a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. \u201cThe UK and Pakistan have a shared interest in working to tackle organised crime including the trafficking of drugs, which is a threat to both our societies.\u201dBut even after the moratorium was lifted the UK continued to run counter-narcotics training operations in Pakistan.

At least that\u2019s the impression you\u2019d get if you read this report from Ars Technica (based on NSA documents leaked by The Intercept), which claims that a machine learning algorithm guiding U.S. drones \u2013 unfortunately named \u2018SKYNET\u2019 \u2013 could have wrongly targeted numerous innocent civilians. Let\u2019s start with the facts. For the last decade or so, the United States has used unmanned drones to attack militants in Pakistan. The number of kills is unknown, but estimates start at over a thousand and range up to maybe four thousand. A key problem for the intelligence services is finding the right people to kill, since the militants are mixed in with the general population and not just sitting in camp together waiting to be bombed.One thing they have is data, which apparently includes metadata from 55 million mobile phone users in Pakistan. For each user they could see which cell towers were pinged, how they moved, who they called, who called them, how long they spent on calls, when phones were switched off, and any of several dozen other statistics. That opened up a possible route for machine learning, neatly summarised on slide 2 of this deck. If we know that some of these 55 million people are couriers, can an algorithm find patterns in their behaviour and spot others who act in a similar way?What exactly is a \u2018courier\u2019 anyway? This is important to understanding some of the errors that The Intercept and Ars Technica made. Courier isn\u2019t a synonym for \u2018terrorist\u2019 as such - it means a specific kind of agent. Terrorist groups are justifiably nervous about using digital communications, and so a lot of messages are still delivered by hand, by couriers. Bin Laden made extensive use of couriers to pass information around, and it was through one of them \u2013 Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (an alias) - that he was eventually found.That\u2019s who the AI was being trained to detect \u2013 not the bin Ladens but the al-Kuwaitis. Not the targets so much as the people who might lead agents to them. Ars Technica implies that somehow the output of this courier detection method was used directly to \u201cgenerate the final kill list\u201d for drone strikes, but there\u2019s zero evidence I can see that this was ever the case, and it would make almost no sense given what the algorithm was actually looking for - you don\u2019t blow up your leads. How did it work? The NSA tried several classification algorithms, and chose what\u2019s known as a random forest approach. It\u2019s actually pretty simple to describe. You have 55 million records, each with 80 different variables or \u2018features\u2019 in them. A random forest algorithm splits this data up into lots of random overlapping bundles of records and features. So you might end up with e.g.:And so on. The next step is to train a decision tree on each bundle of data. A decision tree is, very crudely speaking, an algorithm that takes a record with a number of variables and goes through a series of yes/no questions to reach an answer. So for example, \u2018if this variable is > x1 and that variable is not > x2 and \u2018a third variable\u2019 is > x3\u2026\u2019 (...and so on for perhaps dozens of steps...) \u2018\u2026then this record is a courier.\u2019 The exact values for all the \u2018x\u2019s used are learned by training the algorithm on some test data where the outcomes are known, and you can think of them collectively as a model of the real world. Having created all those trees, you then bring them together to create your metaphorical forest. You run every single tree on each record, and combine the results from all of them to get some probability that the record is a courier. Very broadly speaking, the more the trees agree, the higher the probability is. Obviously this is a really simplified explanation, but hopefully it\u2019s enough to show that we\u2019re not talking about a mysterious black box here. How well did the algorithm do? Both The Intercept and Ars Technica leapt on the fact that the person with the highest probability of being a courier that they found in the data was Ahmad Zaidan, a bureau chief for Al-Jazeera in Islamabad. Cue snorts of derision from Ars Technica:\u201cAs The Intercept reported, Zaidan frequently travels to regions with known terrorist activity in order to interview insurgents and report the news. But rather than questioning the machine learning that produced such a bizarre result, the NSA engineers behind the algorithm instead trumpeted Zaidan as an example of a SKYNET success in their in-house presentation, including a slide that labelled Zaidan as a \u2018MEMBER OF AL-QA\u2019IDA.\u2019\u201dIf you knew nothing about machine learning, or you ignored the goals the algorithm was actually set, it might seem like a bad result. Actually it isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s ignore the NSA\u2019s prior beliefs about the man. The algorithm was trained to look for \u2018couriers\u2019, people who carry messages to and from Al Qaida members. As a journalist, Zaidan was so well connected with Al Qaida members that he interviewed Bin Laden on at least two occasions. This was a man who regularly travelled to, spoke with and carried messages from Al Qaida members. If the purpose of the algorithm had been narrowly to \u2018detect terrorists\u2019 or \u2018identify suicide bombers\u2019 then The Intercept might have a point. But it wasn\u2019t. It was trained to find people tightly linked to Al Qaida who might be carrying useful intelligence. Its identification of Zaidan \u2013 regardless of whether he was acting as a journalist or not \u2013 was entirely correct within the context of those goals. (As an aside, obviously I\u2019m not making any moral statement here about the validity of intelligence agencies tracking journalists and intercepting their communications. I\u2019m talking simply about the performance of the algorithm in carrying out the objectives it was set.) So the one case that The Intercept and Ars Technica highlight as a failure of the algorithm is actually a pretty striking success story. Zaidan is exactly the kind of person the NSA would expect and want the algorithm to highlight. Of course it\u2019s just one example thought, so how well did the algorithm perform over the rest of the data?The answer is: actually pretty well. The challenge here is pretty enormous because while the NSA has data on millions of people, only a tiny handful of them are confirmed couriers. With so little information, it\u2019s pretty hard to create a balanced set of data to train an algorithm on \u2013 an AI could just classify everyone as innocent and still claim to be over 99.99% accurate. A machine learning algorithm\u2019s basic job is to build a model of the world it sees, and when you have so few examples to learn from it can be a very cloudy view. In the end though they were able to train a model with a false positive rate \u2013 the number of people wrongly classed as terrorists - of just 0.008%. That\u2019s a pretty good achievement, but given the size of Pakistan\u2019s population it still means about 15,000 people being wrongly classified as couriers. If you were basing a kill list on that, it would be pretty bloody awful.Here\u2019s where The Intercept and Ars Technica really go off the deep end. The last slide of the deck (from June 2012) clearly states that these are preliminary results. The title paraphrases the conclusion to every other research study ever: \u201cWe\u2019re on the right track, but much remains to be done.\u201d This was an experiment in courier detection and a work in progress, and yet the two publications not only pretend that it was a deployed system, but also imply that the algorithm was used to generate a kill list for drone strokes. You can\u2019t prove a negative of course, but there\u2019s zero evidence here to substantiate the story. In reality of course you would combine the results from this kind of analysis with other intelligence, which is exactly what the NSA do \u2013 another slide shows that \u2018courier machine learning models\u2019 are just one small component of a much larger suite of data analytics used to identify targets, as you\u2019d expect. And of course data analytics will in turn be just one part of a broader intelligence processing effort. Nobody is being killed because of a flaky algorithm. The NSA couldn\u2019t be that stupid and still actually be capable of finding Pakistan on a map.It\u2019s a shame, because there\u2019s a lot to pick apart in this story, from ethical questions about bulk data gathering and tracking journalists to technical ones. Realistically, how well can you evaluate an algorithm when the original data contains so many people whose classification is unknown? And is \u2018courier\u2019 a clear cut category to begin with, or an ever-changing \u2018fuzzy\u2019 set?Finally, it\u2019s a great example of why often the most important thing in artificial intelligence isn\u2019t the fancy algorithms you use but having a really well-defined and well-understood question to start with. It\u2019s only when you fully understand the question that you can truly evaluate the results, as Ars Technica and The Intercept have neatly demonstrated.

Bajwa said 97 people had been arrested in various raids, including senior members of both al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (Aqis) and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), a Sunni supremacist group responsible for many massacres of Shias and which allegedly was once close to Pakistan\u2019s intelligence establishment.In a sign of the country\u2019s ever-evolving militant scene, Bajwa said the two groups were working together and with the Pakistani Taliban. \u201cOur conclusion is that all of the terrorist groups are trying to cooperate with each other in order to carry out terrorist attacks,\u201d he told a news conference.Among those arrested were suspects accused of involvement in some of the highest-profile terror attacks in Pakistan\u2019s recent history, including on two military airbases, Karachi\u2019s civilian airport, regional intelligence headquarters and police buildings.Six people allegedly planning suicide bombings, a number of foreign nationals and a prison guard who allegedly provided information to the plotters were also among those held.Bajwa said the group had used a number of methods to avoid detection. Explosives and weapons had been moved around the country hidden inside washing machines transported on freight trains. A cover business manufacturing plastic containers had been set up in the Hyderabad house to avoid attracting attention.The formation of Aqis was announced in 2014 by al-Qaida chief, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Bajwa described the group as one of the main terrorist organisations operating in Pakistan\u2019s coastal city of Karachi.It was in Karachi that Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter, was kidnapped in 2002 while researching a story about militant groups in the city.

The women are accused by buying weapons for the militants in the tribal region of Darra Adam Khel.  Related: Pakistan attacks: at least 30 dead in terror raid at Bacha Khan University \u201cThe two women took advantage of the culture and used their veils to bring out the purchased weapons from the tribal region,\u201d Bajwa said. Students and teachers died in the attack, which triggered a fierce gun battle that lasted for about six hours.The Pakistan army spokesman said the attack was masterminded by Umar Mansoor, a Pakistani Taliban militant based in Afghanistan. Pakistani officials say he was also responsible for the December 2014 massacre of 134 children at an army school in Peshawar, the worst such atrocity in Pakistan\u2019s history.On Friday Mansoor released video of the fighters he said carried out the university attack and vowed to carry out more assaults attacks on educational facilities.Afghan officials regard Pakistan\u2019s suggestion that Kabul supports cross-border attacks as an attempt to deflect attention from what they say is Pakistan\u2019s long history of supporting the Taliban.Bajwa clarified that the Pakistan government was not blaming the Afghan government for the attack.

They were driven back, but a new threat to Pakistan\u2019s fragile stability had emerged.Over the last six or so years, a combination of drone strikes and military offensives has weakened the movement, killing successive commanders and forcing factions out of their bases.Yet the TTP has retained the capacity to do serious harm, and as pressure has increased since the launch of a military campaign about 18 months ago, various factions have lashed out at Pakistan\u2019s security forces and state. One high-profile attack 13 months ago targeted an army-run school in Peshawar, the western frontier city, killing 148 people, mainly children. Related: Pakistan attacks: at least 30 dead in terror raid at Bacha Khan University That assault prompted widespread anger, grief and revulsion in Pakistan, and authorities launched a more wide-ranging effort to stamp out terrorism afterwards. This involved more military action, the detention of tens of thousands of people and the vigorous implementation of the death penalty.Under further strain, the TTP has fractured further, with many commanders leading their fighters across the frontier into Afghanistan, or simply going to ground.The authority of the nominal leader, Mullah Fazlullah, was already weak, and has now almost disappeared. This lack of unified decision-making explains why one TTP commander could proudly claim responsibility for the attack on the Bacha Khan University, before the principal spokesman for the movement issued a denial in which he described the killing of students in such an establishment as un-Islamic.This lack of solidarity has some advantages however. As its component parts are almost autonomous, the TTP is resilient. If one commander is killed, trafficking racket shut down, or base destroyed, the impact on others is limited. Support networks in towns and cities exist across Pakistan, with key enablers making attacks like today\u2019s possible.The response of the Pakistani authorities to the threat posed by the TTP is based solely on military force and repression. Little or nothing has been done to tackle the deep roots of the problem: the economic and political marginalisation of the frontier zones; the mass of weaponry in those areas; the growth of intolerant conservative religious doctrine over decades; and the spread of a hate-filled worldview.Western policymakers, largely because it is seen to pose a minimal international threat, rarely mention the movement.", "tags": ["Pakistan", "Taliban", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Afghanistan"], "title": "Bacha Khan University attack: what is Tehreek-e-Taliban \u200bPakistan?"},{"date": "2016-01-18T13:36:47Z", "content": "A gory video game set inside the Pakistani school where more than 130 children were massacred by Taliban gunmen has been withdrawn, weeks after it was released as part of an army-backed campaign to promote peace and tolerance in the country.

But for those not on a tight schedule, it added to the intrigue and fascination of the trip. It also greased the wheels, as it were, of conversation with fellow passengers most of whom were remarkably sanguine about the inconvenience.Travelling any distance by train in the States is a lifestyle choice rather than a function of daily life. Consequently, the attitude was one of wry amusement rather than anger. Most were wearily chipper and enjoyed the adventure, despite the uncertainty. The only non-Americans we encountered were three Australians, including a couple from Adelaide who were on a mammoth train extravaganza around North America. They declared themselves great supporters of Amtrak and envious of the rail network.Then there was Shawna and Bobby Jo, two women who\u2019d never met before but decided to take advantage of the dining car once it emerged that their respective homeward journeys were disrupted. Bottles of Pinot Grigio and a passable steak diluted any frustration they may have felt. Bobby Jo was \u201conly\u201d going as far as Wisconsin Dells, the fifth stop en route, and would in normal circumstances have been home for Sunday evening with her family after the three-and-a-half hour journey, ready for work as a nurse on Monday morning. Not on this occasion. Shawna, also coincidentally a nurse, had a longer trip, to Grand Forks, North Dakota (one stop on from Fargo). Talk was of football, family and farming. Not for nothing are the supporters of the legendary Green Bay Packers American football team known as Cheeseheads: we were heading across the Northern Plains \u2013 dairy country far and wide. Related: Chicago prohibition-style: a city still married to the mob The train wasn\u2019t full in mid-November, but the Empire Builder maintained the policy of \u201ccommunity seating\u201d at meal times. Passengers were instructed to sit side by side with their travelling companion so one is obliged to make eye contact \u2013 and ideally conversation \u2013 with strangers. Of the six meals we had, only one was conducted in silence opposite a guy on his own who was reading. The other five were all friendly and illuminating.The two breakfasts were memorable for the locations. The first, as we crossed the Mississippi river along the state line between Wisconsin and Minnesota, was shared with a woman and her young son. The following morning, as we chugged through the spectacular Glacier National Park in Montana, we had the perfect guides to the scenery: a retired couple from Havre, Montana (population 9,700, enjoying night-time November temperatures of -18C). They were heading to Spokane to see their new grandchild. Spokane is where the Empire Builder splits for the last 300 miles or so to Seattle, or further south to Portland.They could have driven it more quickly, but given that we were on the cusp of winter in the frozen north they preferred to let the train take the strain, and enjoy the views: snow-capped mountains in the distance, rivers and lakes in the foreground with the odd bald eagle scouting for prey from an arboreal perch. Related: Top 10 national and state parks in Washington state  Viewed harshly, the edible fare is aeroplane food on a plate, though in truth it\u2019s better and more varied than that. The \u201csignature\u201d steak for dinner was delicious and cooked as requested. Likewise, a burger was tasty and hearty. There have been wine tastings on board in the past, but given that the Empire Builder lost $34.8m in the six months to March this year, it\u2019s not hard to see why such luxuries might have been dispensed with.The accommodation was comfortable. We opted for a two-berth cabin with bunk beds and its own tiny toilet that doubles as a shower room. There are other toilets and showers on the lower deck that offer more room and comfort. The seats in coach class looked both roomy and comfortable, though the carriages had that permanent state of half-light like a teenager\u2019s bedroom, where someone was always asleep regardless of the time of day.The viewing carriage \u2013 seating upstairs, bar downstairs \u2013 was the perfect place to while away the daylight hours, scouring the vista for wildlife, marvelling at the passing landscape or just reading. There is no WiFi on the Empire Builder, which is surely just a failure to upgrade facilities rather than a deliberate attempt to come between passengers and their digital devices.This was my first long-distance train trip overseas and an experience to repeat. There is a mindset adjustment required to unlock the willingness to enjoy the journey rather than project forward to the destination.

But for those not on a tight schedule, it added to the intrigue and fascination of the trip. It also greased the wheels, as it were, of conversation with fellow passengers most of whom were remarkably sanguine about the inconvenience.Travelling any distance by train in the States is a lifestyle choice rather than a function of daily life. Consequently, the attitude was one of wry amusement rather than anger. Most were wearily chipper and enjoyed the adventure, despite the uncertainty. The only non-Americans we encountered were three Australians, including a couple from Adelaide who were on a mammoth train extravaganza around North America. They declared themselves great supporters of Amtrak and envious of the rail network.Then there was Shawna and Bobby Jo, two women who\u2019d never met before but decided to take advantage of the dining car once it emerged that their respective homeward journeys were disrupted. Bottles of Pinot Grigio and a passable steak diluted any frustration they may have felt. Bobby Jo was \u201conly\u201d going as far as Wisconsin Dells, the fifth stop en route, and would in normal circumstances have been home for Sunday evening with her family after the three-and-a-half hour journey, ready for work as a nurse on Monday morning. Not on this occasion. Shawna, also coincidentally a nurse, had a longer trip, to Grand Forks, North Dakota (one stop on from Fargo). Talk was of football, family and farming. Not for nothing are the supporters of the legendary Green Bay Packers American football team known as Cheeseheads: we were heading across the Northern Plains \u2013 dairy country far and wide. Related: Chicago prohibition-style: a city still married to the mob The train wasn\u2019t full in mid-November, but the Empire Builder maintained the policy of \u201ccommunity seating\u201d at meal times. Passengers were instructed to sit side by side with their travelling companion so one is obliged to make eye contact \u2013 and ideally conversation \u2013 with strangers. Of the six meals we had, only one was conducted in silence opposite a guy on his own who was reading. The other five were all friendly and illuminating.The two breakfasts were memorable for the locations. The first, as we crossed the Mississippi river along the state line between Wisconsin and Minnesota, was shared with a woman and her young son. The following morning, as we chugged through the spectacular Glacier National Park in Montana, we had the perfect guides to the scenery: a retired couple from Havre, Montana (population 9,700, enjoying night-time November temperatures of -18C). They were heading to Spokane to see their new grandchild. Spokane is where the Empire Builder splits for the last 300 miles or so to Seattle, or further south to Portland.They could have driven it more quickly, but given that we were on the cusp of winter in the frozen north they preferred to let the train take the strain, and enjoy the views: snow-capped mountains in the distance, rivers and lakes in the foreground with the odd bald eagle scouting for prey from an arboreal perch. Related: Top 10 national and state parks in Washington state  Viewed harshly, the edible fare is aeroplane food on a plate, though in truth it\u2019s better and more varied than that. The \u201csignature\u201d steak for dinner was delicious and cooked as requested. Likewise, a burger was tasty and hearty. There have been wine tastings on board in the past, but given that the Empire Builder lost $34.8m in the six months to March this year, it\u2019s not hard to see why such luxuries might have been dispensed with.The accommodation was comfortable. We opted for a two-berth cabin with bunk beds and its own tiny toilet that doubles as a shower room. There are other toilets and showers on the lower deck that offer more room and comfort. The seats in coach class looked both roomy and comfortable, though the carriages had that permanent state of half-light like a teenager\u2019s bedroom, where someone was always asleep regardless of the time of day.The viewing carriage \u2013 seating upstairs, bar downstairs \u2013 was the perfect place to while away the daylight hours, scouring the vista for wildlife, marvelling at the passing landscape or just reading. There is no WiFi on the Empire Builder, which is surely just a failure to upgrade facilities rather than a deliberate attempt to come between passengers and their digital devices.This was my first long-distance train trip overseas and an experience to repeat. There is a mindset adjustment required to unlock the willingness to enjoy the journey rather than project forward to the destination.

It may well be a year \u2013 or several \u2013 before the Senate confirms anybody to replace Scalia, who died on Saturday at the age of 79. But that vote will almost assuredly not be unanimous, regardless of who the eventual nominee is: the politics of US supreme court appointments have become as polarized as the rest of American politics.And Scalia himself played a significant role in that very polarization.Scalia\u2019s legacy will be extensively celebrated by conservatives \u2013 Marco Rubio spoke for orthodox Republican opinion when he called Scalia one of the greatest justices in US supreme court history at Saturday\u2019s Republican debate \u2013 and derided by liberals, many of whom wasted little time celebrating his demise and speculating how his absence on the court could affect future cases.But what few political commentators note is that the foundation of his legal and political legacy does not so much stem from his majority opinions: landmark opinions, after all, tend to be written by either the chief justice or by the swing voters, like Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Scalia was neither. He certainly wrote numerous important opinions for the court (most notably the first opinion to find that the second amendment protected an individual right to bear arms in DC v Heller), but his reputation was largely based on his dissents and his remarks off the bench.More than most US supreme court justices, Scalia often wrote to be quoted by a general audience \u2013 and that style was a mixed blessing for him. Scalia was capable of very fine legal writing but, particularly as he aged, his trademark blistering zingers were too often made to mask poorly crafted arguments. (In a 2013 interview, Scalia acknowledged his own concerns about his more recent opinions: \u201cYou always wonder whether you\u2019re losing your grip and whether your current opinions are not as good as your old ones.\u201d)Scalia\u2019s style of late reflected a justice who both strongly influenced the contemporary conservative movement and in turn was heavily influenced by it. At oral argument, he was capable of both devastating arguments and of sounding like a second-string conservative talkshow host. But, at his best, Scalia defended originalism and textualism with a style and wit that could be recognized even by those who fundamentally disagreed with him. In his first decade on the court, Scalia even won some grudging admiration from liberals. Perhaps the high point of his intellectual influence across party lines was represented by his Tanner lectures at Princeton: they were published as a widely discussed book, complete with respectful response essays from prominent liberal scholars like Robert Dworkin and Laurence Tribe. And it\u2019s true that Scalia was not a strict Republican party-liner: there were some cases in which he was willing to make common cause with liberal justices out of principle. In one dissent, he (correctly) characterized the mandatory drug testing of border patrol officers as \u201ca kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to drug use\u201d. He wrote a brilliant dissent, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, upholding the habeas corpus rights of American citizens accused of terrorist activities. And in some fourth and sixth amendment cases, he regularly voted in a civil libertarian direction.Still, these cases were the exception rather than the rule as his tenure wore on, and Scalia increasingly became a partisan lightning rod in court circles and in political circles beyond the court. No discussion of Scalia\u2019s legacy, for instance, can ignore the 2000 decision Bush v Gore, in which the court issued an essentially lawless decision awarding the presidency to the Republican candidate. Scalia did not write the opinion of the court, but he wrote the more nakedly partisan opinion that preceded it and has defended it aggressively in public ever since.Bush v Gore is an extreme example but, despite Scalia\u2019s self-presentation as America\u2019s Last Honest Judge, Scalia had a way of ignoring his self-described legal principles if they conflicted with cherished policy goals. To take one particularly critical example, the joint dissent to the 2012 US supreme court opinion largely upholding the Affordable Care Act co-authored by Scalia was so flagrantly inconsistent with Scalia\u2019s previous jurisprudence that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was able to quote his previous opinions at length in her concurrence. More importantly to some is that, had Scalia\u2019s dissents ultimately shaped America, women would not have reproductive rights, the federal government could not effectively regulate healthcare, LGBT people would not have the right to engage in sexual intercourse without fear of arrest \u2013 let alone alone the right to marry \u2013 and states could single them out for legal disabilities. Women could be excluded from state educational institutions, public schools could teach creationism in science classes and prisoners could be assaulted by prison guards. And, in large part because of Scalia, in America today, the Voting Rights Act has been gutted, the rights of employees and consumers have been curtailed, Brown v Board is more likely to be used to stop integration than to promote it and moneyed interests increasingly dominate elections.But however one evaluates his legacy, Scalia\u2019s untimely death creates a huge political issue that could well become a constitutional crisis. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has already made it clear that the Senate will not confirm anyone President Obama nominates to replace Scalia. That means, for at least a year, the US supreme court will almost certainly operate with eight members and, in cases of a 4-4 split, lower-court opinions will stand, leading to escalating uncertainty about the state of the law.If the 2016 elections result in the White House and Senate being held by the same party, this logjam will probably be broken fairly quickly. Attempts by a Senate minority to serially filibuster nominees would almost certainly result in the filibuster being eliminated (as it already has been for all other federal judicial appointments). But if the 2016 elections result in Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders facing a Republican Senate \u2013 as currently seems likely \u2013 all bets are off. There is no precedent for the Senate simply refusing to allow the president to fill a supreme court vacancy, but in the current partisan climate a new precedent may well be created. And whether political pressure will compel the Senate to approve some presidential nominee is unclear.The politics of replacing Scalia are difficult precisely because the consequences are so important. Depending on the results of the 2016 presidential and senatorial elections, the next person allowed to vote on the US supreme court will be similar to either Elena Kagan or John Roberts \u2013 and the stakes for the reproductive freedom of women, climate change, voting rights, civil rights, the ability of the federal government to regulate the economy and civil liberties can hardly be overstated. In a very real sense, the 2016 elections will ultimately result in the confirmation or repudiation of the jurisprudence for which Justice Scalia most prominently advocated.

But for those not on a tight schedule, it added to the intrigue and fascination of the trip. It also greased the wheels, as it were, of conversation with fellow passengers most of whom were remarkably sanguine about the inconvenience.Travelling any distance by train in the States is a lifestyle choice rather than a function of daily life. Consequently, the attitude was one of wry amusement rather than anger. Most were wearily chipper and enjoyed the adventure, despite the uncertainty. The only non-Americans we encountered were three Australians, including a couple from Adelaide who were on a mammoth train extravaganza around North America. They declared themselves great supporters of Amtrak and envious of the rail network.Then there was Shawna and Bobby Jo, two women who\u2019d never met before but decided to take advantage of the dining car once it emerged that their respective homeward journeys were disrupted. Bottles of Pinot Grigio and a passable steak diluted any frustration they may have felt. Bobby Jo was \u201conly\u201d going as far as Wisconsin Dells, the fifth stop en route, and would in normal circumstances have been home for Sunday evening with her family after the three-and-a-half hour journey, ready for work as a nurse on Monday morning. Not on this occasion. Shawna, also coincidentally a nurse, had a longer trip, to Grand Forks, North Dakota (one stop on from Fargo). Talk was of football, family and farming. Not for nothing are the supporters of the legendary Green Bay Packers American football team known as Cheeseheads: we were heading across the Northern Plains \u2013 dairy country far and wide. Related: Chicago prohibition-style: a city still married to the mob The train wasn\u2019t full in mid-November, but the Empire Builder maintained the policy of \u201ccommunity seating\u201d at meal times. Passengers were instructed to sit side by side with their travelling companion so one is obliged to make eye contact \u2013 and ideally conversation \u2013 with strangers. Of the six meals we had, only one was conducted in silence opposite a guy on his own who was reading. The other five were all friendly and illuminating.The two breakfasts were memorable for the locations. The first, as we crossed the Mississippi river along the state line between Wisconsin and Minnesota, was shared with a woman and her young son. The following morning, as we chugged through the spectacular Glacier National Park in Montana, we had the perfect guides to the scenery: a retired couple from Havre, Montana (population 9,700, enjoying night-time November temperatures of -18C). They were heading to Spokane to see their new grandchild. Spokane is where the Empire Builder splits for the last 300 miles or so to Seattle, or further south to Portland.They could have driven it more quickly, but given that we were on the cusp of winter in the frozen north they preferred to let the train take the strain, and enjoy the views: snow-capped mountains in the distance, rivers and lakes in the foreground with the odd bald eagle scouting for prey from an arboreal perch. Related: Top 10 national and state parks in Washington state  Viewed harshly, the edible fare is aeroplane food on a plate, though in truth it\u2019s better and more varied than that. The \u201csignature\u201d steak for dinner was delicious and cooked as requested. Likewise, a burger was tasty and hearty. There have been wine tastings on board in the past, but given that the Empire Builder lost $34.8m in the six months to March this year, it\u2019s not hard to see why such luxuries might have been dispensed with.The accommodation was comfortable. We opted for a two-berth cabin with bunk beds and its own tiny toilet that doubles as a shower room. There are other toilets and showers on the lower deck that offer more room and comfort. The seats in coach class looked both roomy and comfortable, though the carriages had that permanent state of half-light like a teenager\u2019s bedroom, where someone was always asleep regardless of the time of day.The viewing carriage \u2013 seating upstairs, bar downstairs \u2013 was the perfect place to while away the daylight hours, scouring the vista for wildlife, marvelling at the passing landscape or just reading. There is no WiFi on the Empire Builder, which is surely just a failure to upgrade facilities rather than a deliberate attempt to come between passengers and their digital devices.This was my first long-distance train trip overseas and an experience to repeat. There is a mindset adjustment required to unlock the willingness to enjoy the journey rather than project forward to the destination.

It may well be a year \u2013 or several \u2013 before the Senate confirms anybody to replace Scalia, who died on Saturday at the age of 79. But that vote will almost assuredly not be unanimous, regardless of who the eventual nominee is: the politics of US supreme court appointments have become as polarized as the rest of American politics.And Scalia himself played a significant role in that very polarization.Scalia\u2019s legacy will be extensively celebrated by conservatives \u2013 Marco Rubio spoke for orthodox Republican opinion when he called Scalia one of the greatest justices in US supreme court history at Saturday\u2019s Republican debate \u2013 and derided by liberals, many of whom wasted little time celebrating his demise and speculating how his absence on the court could affect future cases.But what few political commentators note is that the foundation of his legal and political legacy does not so much stem from his majority opinions: landmark opinions, after all, tend to be written by either the chief justice or by the swing voters, like Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Scalia was neither. He certainly wrote numerous important opinions for the court (most notably the first opinion to find that the second amendment protected an individual right to bear arms in DC v Heller), but his reputation was largely based on his dissents and his remarks off the bench.More than most US supreme court justices, Scalia often wrote to be quoted by a general audience \u2013 and that style was a mixed blessing for him. Scalia was capable of very fine legal writing but, particularly as he aged, his trademark blistering zingers were too often made to mask poorly crafted arguments. (In a 2013 interview, Scalia acknowledged his own concerns about his more recent opinions: \u201cYou always wonder whether you\u2019re losing your grip and whether your current opinions are not as good as your old ones.\u201d)Scalia\u2019s style of late reflected a justice who both strongly influenced the contemporary conservative movement and in turn was heavily influenced by it. At oral argument, he was capable of both devastating arguments and of sounding like a second-string conservative talkshow host. But, at his best, Scalia defended originalism and textualism with a style and wit that could be recognized even by those who fundamentally disagreed with him. In his first decade on the court, Scalia even won some grudging admiration from liberals. Perhaps the high point of his intellectual influence across party lines was represented by his Tanner lectures at Princeton: they were published as a widely discussed book, complete with respectful response essays from prominent liberal scholars like Robert Dworkin and Laurence Tribe. And it\u2019s true that Scalia was not a strict Republican party-liner: there were some cases in which he was willing to make common cause with liberal justices out of principle. In one dissent, he (correctly) characterized the mandatory drug testing of border patrol officers as \u201ca kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to drug use\u201d. He wrote a brilliant dissent, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, upholding the habeas corpus rights of American citizens accused of terrorist activities. And in some fourth and sixth amendment cases, he regularly voted in a civil libertarian direction.Still, these cases were the exception rather than the rule as his tenure wore on, and Scalia increasingly became a partisan lightning rod in court circles and in political circles beyond the court. No discussion of Scalia\u2019s legacy, for instance, can ignore the 2000 decision Bush v Gore, in which the court issued an essentially lawless decision awarding the presidency to the Republican candidate. Scalia did not write the opinion of the court, but he wrote the more nakedly partisan opinion that preceded it and has defended it aggressively in public ever since.Bush v Gore is an extreme example but, despite Scalia\u2019s self-presentation as America\u2019s Last Honest Judge, Scalia had a way of ignoring his self-described legal principles if they conflicted with cherished policy goals. To take one particularly critical example, the joint dissent to the 2012 US supreme court opinion largely upholding the Affordable Care Act co-authored by Scalia was so flagrantly inconsistent with Scalia\u2019s previous jurisprudence that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was able to quote his previous opinions at length in her concurrence. More importantly to some is that, had Scalia\u2019s dissents ultimately shaped America, women would not have reproductive rights, the federal government could not effectively regulate healthcare, LGBT people would not have the right to engage in sexual intercourse without fear of arrest \u2013 let alone alone the right to marry \u2013 and states could single them out for legal disabilities. Women could be excluded from state educational institutions, public schools could teach creationism in science classes and prisoners could be assaulted by prison guards. And, in large part because of Scalia, in America today, the Voting Rights Act has been gutted, the rights of employees and consumers have been curtailed, Brown v Board is more likely to be used to stop integration than to promote it and moneyed interests increasingly dominate elections.But however one evaluates his legacy, Scalia\u2019s untimely death creates a huge political issue that could well become a constitutional crisis. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has already made it clear that the Senate will not confirm anyone President Obama nominates to replace Scalia. That means, for at least a year, the US supreme court will almost certainly operate with eight members and, in cases of a 4-4 split, lower-court opinions will stand, leading to escalating uncertainty about the state of the law.If the 2016 elections result in the White House and Senate being held by the same party, this logjam will probably be broken fairly quickly. Attempts by a Senate minority to serially filibuster nominees would almost certainly result in the filibuster being eliminated (as it already has been for all other federal judicial appointments). But if the 2016 elections result in Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders facing a Republican Senate \u2013 as currently seems likely \u2013 all bets are off. There is no precedent for the Senate simply refusing to allow the president to fill a supreme court vacancy, but in the current partisan climate a new precedent may well be created. And whether political pressure will compel the Senate to approve some presidential nominee is unclear.The politics of replacing Scalia are difficult precisely because the consequences are so important. Depending on the results of the 2016 presidential and senatorial elections, the next person allowed to vote on the US supreme court will be similar to either Elena Kagan or John Roberts \u2013 and the stakes for the reproductive freedom of women, climate change, voting rights, civil rights, the ability of the federal government to regulate the economy and civil liberties can hardly be overstated. In a very real sense, the 2016 elections will ultimately result in the confirmation or repudiation of the jurisprudence for which Justice Scalia most prominently advocated.

Yes, Torres Del Paine is slightly more spectacular, but the lack of crowds here (you\u2019ll probably not see another hiker) makes this a more rewarding and enjoyable experience. The tiny village of Cerro Castillo has a few very basic but very charming hospedajes (lodgings).ajtear87My tight budget led me to Hostal Alpes in Huaraz, where I asked about walking in the surrounding snowy mountains. The hike to Lake 69 was recommended, in the Huascaran national park, part of the incredible Cordillera Blanca mountains \u2013 the world\u2019s highest tropical range. The trip, booked through my hostel, cost around \u00a39 per person. It was a three-hour drive to the start and it took just under four hours to reach the lake (although it felt longer due to altitude: 4,650 metres).

For a sense of the region\u2019s best scenic offerings and a break from the tourist vibe of the town, head to Lago Gutierrez by bus from Bariloche in the morning and hike up to Refugio Emilio Frey, about four hours from the lake\u2019s edge. The trek will take you through parched and arid woods at the start but soon you\u2019ll be climbing alongside the river flowing from the mountain \u2013 there may be some snow at the top for the final 500m. Spending the night at Refugio Frey with a shared meal is about \u00a330. Alternatively, you can opt for just a bed and pay a few dollars to use their kitchen, or going further you can camp depending on the weather conditions. The journey down is of course easier, and for a change of scenery take the Cerro Catedral route back near the bottom and grab a sugary waffle in the Catedral ski resort. If you have a couple of days in Bariloche this is an excellent way to spend them.trekbariloche.comjamieisbellIt\u2019s a three-day, 44km hike to get to the Lost City, which involves fording rivers, sleeping in hammocks and, at one point, sharing the path with a mule transporting a wheel-barrow to a far flung Kogi village. Built in about 800 AD by the Tayrona people, the picturesque ruins are deep in the jungle of the Sierra Nevada in northern Colombia. Visitors travel there from Santa Marta; driving into the mountains to the end of the \u201croad\u201d (pot-holes held together by mud) in a clapped-out jeepney. From here, shanks pony is your only transportation. Beautiful scenery, a night spent at the city and seeing the deserted ruins in early morning light more than compensate for the heat, humidity and insect bites.deesmith71This trek in the Cordillera Blanca is stunning. Inexperienced trekkers can do it in four days but if you are a seasoned hiker and find the Santa Cruz trek too short, the Cordillera Blanca has many more trails to follow. Regardless of experience, the South America Explorers club proved invaluable.Dolly SullyFor an alternative to the waiting lists, crowds and expense of the Inca Trail, visit the northern town of Chachapoyas. On arriving, we contacted the I-Peru office, which set us up with Aldo, a local guide with detailed knowledge of the cliffside mausoleums and ruins half hidden in cloud forests. No visit is complete without a trek to the area\u2019s star attraction, the pre-Incan fortress city of Kuelap. We arranged a two-day hike, staying overnight in the village of Tingo. Setting off early for the final stage, a six-mile, 1,200-metre climb to the citadel, we arrived as the city\u2019s immense stone walls emerged from the morning mist. For two hours we explored the deserted ruins; our only company a pair of bemused looking llamas.ID090252Hidden away high in the Andes in the Cotopaxi Province, this ancient volcano\u2019s two-mile wide crater has been collecting rain water for centuries, creating a turquoise lagoon to which you can hike down to. Once there you can kayak on it then either hike back up or go on horseback for a small fee. The more adventurous can hike the rim of this volcanic lagoon. Trails are well-worn and easy to follow and take up to five hours to complete. The trail on the rim is, for the most part, easy and not very technical. Start your hike no later than 7.30am; clouds and rain usually come in mid-afternoon making visibility poor and temperatures quite cold. The trail is mostly sandy which makes hiking the trail very easy after a rainy night. The ultimate adventure would be to hike the three-four day Quilotoa Loop which starts in the town of Sigchos or the crater itself. The town of Quilotoa is made up primarily of hostels.

But for those not on a tight schedule, it added to the intrigue and fascination of the trip. It also greased the wheels, as it were, of conversation with fellow passengers most of whom were remarkably sanguine about the inconvenience.Travelling any distance by train in the States is a lifestyle choice rather than a function of daily life. Consequently, the attitude was one of wry amusement rather than anger. Most were wearily chipper and enjoyed the adventure, despite the uncertainty. The only non-Americans we encountered were three Australians, including a couple from Adelaide who were on a mammoth train extravaganza around North America. They declared themselves great supporters of Amtrak and envious of the rail network.Then there was Shawna and Bobby Jo, two women who\u2019d never met before but decided to take advantage of the dining car once it emerged that their respective homeward journeys were disrupted. Bottles of Pinot Grigio and a passable steak diluted any frustration they may have felt. Bobby Jo was \u201conly\u201d going as far as Wisconsin Dells, the fifth stop en route, and would in normal circumstances have been home for Sunday evening with her family after the three-and-a-half hour journey, ready for work as a nurse on Monday morning. Not on this occasion. Shawna, also coincidentally a nurse, had a longer trip, to Grand Forks, North Dakota (one stop on from Fargo). Talk was of football, family and farming. Not for nothing are the supporters of the legendary Green Bay Packers American football team known as Cheeseheads: we were heading across the Northern Plains \u2013 dairy country far and wide. Related: Chicago prohibition-style: a city still married to the mob The train wasn\u2019t full in mid-November, but the Empire Builder maintained the policy of \u201ccommunity seating\u201d at meal times. Passengers were instructed to sit side by side with their travelling companion so one is obliged to make eye contact \u2013 and ideally conversation \u2013 with strangers. Of the six meals we had, only one was conducted in silence opposite a guy on his own who was reading. The other five were all friendly and illuminating.The two breakfasts were memorable for the locations. The first, as we crossed the Mississippi river along the state line between Wisconsin and Minnesota, was shared with a woman and her young son. The following morning, as we chugged through the spectacular Glacier National Park in Montana, we had the perfect guides to the scenery: a retired couple from Havre, Montana (population 9,700, enjoying night-time November temperatures of -18C). They were heading to Spokane to see their new grandchild. Spokane is where the Empire Builder splits for the last 300 miles or so to Seattle, or further south to Portland.They could have driven it more quickly, but given that we were on the cusp of winter in the frozen north they preferred to let the train take the strain, and enjoy the views: snow-capped mountains in the distance, rivers and lakes in the foreground with the odd bald eagle scouting for prey from an arboreal perch.

The \u201csignature\u201d steak for dinner was delicious and cooked as requested. Likewise, a burger was tasty and hearty. There have been wine tastings on board in the past, but given that the Empire Builder lost $34.8m in the six months to March this year, it\u2019s not hard to see why such luxuries might have been dispensed with.The accommodation was comfortable. We opted for a two-berth cabin with bunk beds and its own tiny toilet that doubles as a shower room. There are other toilets and showers on the lower deck that offer more room and comfort. The seats in coach class looked both roomy and comfortable, though the carriages had that permanent state of half-light like a teenager\u2019s bedroom, where someone was always asleep regardless of the time of day.The viewing carriage \u2013 seating upstairs, bar downstairs \u2013 was the perfect place to while away the daylight hours, scouring the vista for wildlife, marvelling at the passing landscape or just reading. There is no WiFi on the Empire Builder, which is surely just a failure to upgrade facilities rather than a deliberate attempt to come between passengers and their digital devices.This was my first long-distance train trip overseas and an experience to repeat.

It may well be a year \u2013 or several \u2013 before the Senate confirms anybody to replace Scalia, who died on Saturday at the age of 79. But that vote will almost assuredly not be unanimous, regardless of who the eventual nominee is: the politics of US supreme court appointments have become as polarized as the rest of American politics.And Scalia himself played a significant role in that very polarization.Scalia\u2019s legacy will be extensively celebrated by conservatives \u2013 Marco Rubio spoke for orthodox Republican opinion when he called Scalia one of the greatest justices in US supreme court history at Saturday\u2019s Republican debate \u2013 and derided by liberals, many of whom wasted little time celebrating his demise and speculating how his absence on the court could affect future cases.But what few political commentators note is that the foundation of his legal and political legacy does not so much stem from his majority opinions: landmark opinions, after all, tend to be written by either the chief justice or by the swing voters, like Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Scalia was neither. He certainly wrote numerous important opinions for the court (most notably the first opinion to find that the second amendment protected an individual right to bear arms in DC v Heller), but his reputation was largely based on his dissents and his remarks off the bench.More than most US supreme court justices, Scalia often wrote to be quoted by a general audience \u2013 and that style was a mixed blessing for him. Scalia was capable of very fine legal writing but, particularly as he aged, his trademark blistering zingers were too often made to mask poorly crafted arguments. (In a 2013 interview, Scalia acknowledged his own concerns about his more recent opinions: \u201cYou always wonder whether you\u2019re losing your grip and whether your current opinions are not as good as your old ones.\u201d)Scalia\u2019s style of late reflected a justice who both strongly influenced the contemporary conservative movement and in turn was heavily influenced by it. At oral argument, he was capable of both devastating arguments and of sounding like a second-string conservative talkshow host. But, at his best, Scalia defended originalism and textualism with a style and wit that could be recognized even by those who fundamentally disagreed with him. In his first decade on the court, Scalia even won some grudging admiration from liberals. Perhaps the high point of his intellectual influence across party lines was represented by his Tanner lectures at Princeton: they were published as a widely discussed book, complete with respectful response essays from prominent liberal scholars like Robert Dworkin and Laurence Tribe. And it\u2019s true that Scalia was not a strict Republican party-liner: there were some cases in which he was willing to make common cause with liberal justices out of principle. In one dissent, he (correctly) characterized the mandatory drug testing of border patrol officers as \u201ca kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to drug use\u201d. He wrote a brilliant dissent, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, upholding the habeas corpus rights of American citizens accused of terrorist activities. And in some fourth and sixth amendment cases, he regularly voted in a civil libertarian direction.Still, these cases were the exception rather than the rule as his tenure wore on, and Scalia increasingly became a partisan lightning rod in court circles and in political circles beyond the court. No discussion of Scalia\u2019s legacy, for instance, can ignore the 2000 decision Bush v Gore, in which the court issued an essentially lawless decision awarding the presidency to the Republican candidate. Scalia did not write the opinion of the court, but he wrote the more nakedly partisan opinion that preceded it and has defended it aggressively in public ever since.Bush v Gore is an extreme example but, despite Scalia\u2019s self-presentation as America\u2019s Last Honest Judge, Scalia had a way of ignoring his self-described legal principles if they conflicted with cherished policy goals. To take one particularly critical example, the joint dissent to the 2012 US supreme court opinion largely upholding the Affordable Care Act co-authored by Scalia was so flagrantly inconsistent with Scalia\u2019s previous jurisprudence that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was able to quote his previous opinions at length in her concurrence. More importantly to some is that, had Scalia\u2019s dissents ultimately shaped America, women would not have reproductive rights, the federal government could not effectively regulate healthcare, LGBT people would not have the right to engage in sexual intercourse without fear of arrest \u2013 let alone alone the right to marry \u2013 and states could single them out for legal disabilities. Women could be excluded from state educational institutions, public schools could teach creationism in science classes and prisoners could be assaulted by prison guards. And, in large part because of Scalia, in America today, the Voting Rights Act has been gutted, the rights of employees and consumers have been curtailed, Brown v Board is more likely to be used to stop integration than to promote it and moneyed interests increasingly dominate elections.But however one evaluates his legacy, Scalia\u2019s untimely death creates a huge political issue that could well become a constitutional crisis. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has already made it clear that the Senate will not confirm anyone President Obama nominates to replace Scalia. That means, for at least a year, the US supreme court will almost certainly operate with eight members and, in cases of a 4-4 split, lower-court opinions will stand, leading to escalating uncertainty about the state of the law.If the 2016 elections result in the White House and Senate being held by the same party, this logjam will probably be broken fairly quickly. Attempts by a Senate minority to serially filibuster nominees would almost certainly result in the filibuster being eliminated (as it already has been for all other federal judicial appointments). But if the 2016 elections result in Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders facing a Republican Senate \u2013 as currently seems likely \u2013 all bets are off. There is no precedent for the Senate simply refusing to allow the president to fill a supreme court vacancy, but in the current partisan climate a new precedent may well be created. And whether political pressure will compel the Senate to approve some presidential nominee is unclear.The politics of replacing Scalia are difficult precisely because the consequences are so important. Depending on the results of the 2016 presidential and senatorial elections, the next person allowed to vote on the US supreme court will be similar to either Elena Kagan or John Roberts \u2013 and the stakes for the reproductive freedom of women, climate change, voting rights, civil rights, the ability of the federal government to regulate the economy and civil liberties can hardly be overstated. In a very real sense, the 2016 elections will ultimately result in the confirmation or repudiation of the jurisprudence for which Justice Scalia most prominently advocated.

Once there you can kayak on it then either hike back up or go on horseback for a small fee. The more adventurous can hike the rim of this volcanic lagoon. Trails are well-worn and easy to follow and take up to five hours to complete. The trail on the rim is, for the most part, easy and not very technical. Start your hike no later than 7.30am; clouds and rain usually come in mid-afternoon making visibility poor and temperatures quite cold. The trail is mostly sandy which makes hiking the trail very easy after a rainy night. The ultimate adventure would be to hike the three-four day Quilotoa Loop which starts in the town of Sigchos or the crater itself. The town of Quilotoa is made up primarily of hostels.

Most of them prefer it that way. American judges, by contrast, have always been different, not just because the constitutional separation of powers necessarily makes them more prominent, but also because the process of their appointment is overtly politicised. The president nominates new supreme court justices, and the Senate must confirm them. This goes some of the way to explaining why the death at the weekend of Justice Antonin Scalia is such a significant public event. Related: Antonin Scalia: man of his word who shaped America in life and in death Scalia\u2019s death creates a vacancy on a nine-person supreme court that has often split five to four to the conservative side in recent years; not least in the Bush\u00a0v Gore verdict in 2000 that settled the occupancy of the White House. Barack Obama now has the golden opportunity, as well as the responsibility, to put forward a more liberal nominee, but Republicans won\u2019t stand idly by. Within hours of his death, they were arguing that the nomination should be delayed until after November\u2019s presidential election, and they will probably get their way.Yet even this explosive consequence barely touches on Scalia\u2019s extraordinary personal importance, for there has been no more influential figure in American jurisprudence in half a century. Though he was never chief justice, the court on which he sat from 1986, after his appointment by Ronald Reagan, was in a very real sense \u201cthe Scalia court\u201d. His passing is an intellectual event as well as a political one. It would not be an exaggeration to say that without understanding Scalia one cannot understand American constitutional politics of the past three decades. Related: Supreme court justice Antonin Scalia dies: legal and political worlds react Scalia was an ideological social conservative in most respects. He gave striking conservative judgments on issues such as abortion, gay equality, desegregation and capital punishment. Yet what mattered more was his sustained ability to articulate, in trenchant language, a fundamentalist doctrine about the US constitution that has been a beacon to American conservatives in the law and politics for more than a generation.In Scalia\u2019s view, the constitution should be interpreted as closely as possible to the way America\u2019s founders would have conceived it. This \u201coriginalist\u201d approach placed Scalia in outright opposition \u2014 which he often expressed in the liveliest way \u2014 to the liberal view, which saw the constitution as an evolving set of rules that could be adapted to changing values and times. To him, the constitution was close to holy writ. He was as much a believer in the truth of the US constitution as any believer in any religious book. This fundamentalism gave him a status among conservatives that in some ways rivalled that of Reagan.It made Scalia the modern era\u2019s most influential and articulate judicial apostle of non-interference, states\u2019 rights, small federal government and a weak presidency. In this position he undoubtedly shaped the thinking of many young lawyers and politicians, which is why his death will not end his influence.Scalia was also a rock-solid American exceptionalist, maintaining that the constitution was not just the original reference point for the judges, but the only one. Anyone who reads a UK supreme court judgment will find it cites rulings and judgments from not just the European courts but also, frequently, the US and other courts too. Scalia would have none of that internationalism. His jurisprudence was wholly American; only American judgments could be considered, he believed. In this he both spoke for and gave a huge boost to this exceptionalism, with immense consequences that have reached far beyond the courts.Few who ever attended a session of the court in his era could fail to notice his sharpness and judicial star-power, even if his ideology and jurisprudence were mistaken in profound ways on almost every issue.Scalia\u2019s importance and sheer interest value can hardly be exaggerated. He embodied the truth that America is, and will always be, so very different from Britain in countless ways.", "tags": ["US supreme court", "US justice system", "US news", "World news", "Law"], "title": "Antonin Scalia: the judge whose conservatism shaped America | Martin Kettle"},{"date": "2015-11-14T07:00:12Z", "content": "South America is all about the freedom of the great outdoors.

But for those not on a tight schedule, it added to the intrigue and fascination of the trip. It also greased the wheels, as it were, of conversation with fellow passengers most of whom were remarkably sanguine about the inconvenience.Travelling any distance by train in the States is a lifestyle choice rather than a function of daily life. Consequently, the attitude was one of wry amusement rather than anger. Most were wearily chipper and enjoyed the adventure, despite the uncertainty. The only non-Americans we encountered were three Australians, including a couple from Adelaide who were on a mammoth train extravaganza around North America. They declared themselves great supporters of Amtrak and envious of the rail network.Then there was Shawna and Bobby Jo, two women who\u2019d never met before but decided to take advantage of the dining car once it emerged that their respective homeward journeys were disrupted. Bottles of Pinot Grigio and a passable steak diluted any frustration they may have felt. Bobby Jo was \u201conly\u201d going as far as Wisconsin Dells, the fifth stop en route, and would in normal circumstances have been home for Sunday evening with her family after the three-and-a-half hour journey, ready for work as a nurse on Monday morning. Not on this occasion. Shawna, also coincidentally a nurse, had a longer trip, to Grand Forks, North Dakota (one stop on from Fargo). Talk was of football, family and farming. Not for nothing are the supporters of the legendary Green Bay Packers American football team known as Cheeseheads: we were heading across the Northern Plains \u2013 dairy country far and wide. Related: Chicago prohibition-style: a city still married to the mob The train wasn\u2019t full in mid-November, but the Empire Builder maintained the policy of \u201ccommunity seating\u201d at meal times. Passengers were instructed to sit side by side with their travelling companion so one is obliged to make eye contact \u2013 and ideally conversation \u2013 with strangers. Of the six meals we had, only one was conducted in silence opposite a guy on his own who was reading. The other five were all friendly and illuminating.The two breakfasts were memorable for the locations. The first, as we crossed the Mississippi river along the state line between Wisconsin and Minnesota, was shared with a woman and her young son. The following morning, as we chugged through the spectacular Glacier National Park in Montana, we had the perfect guides to the scenery: a retired couple from Havre, Montana (population 9,700, enjoying night-time November temperatures of -18C). They were heading to Spokane to see their new grandchild. Spokane is where the Empire Builder splits for the last 300 miles or so to Seattle, or further south to Portland.They could have driven it more quickly, but given that we were on the cusp of winter in the frozen north they preferred to let the train take the strain, and enjoy the views: snow-capped mountains in the distance, rivers and lakes in the foreground with the odd bald eagle scouting for prey from an arboreal perch.

The \u201csignature\u201d steak for dinner was delicious and cooked as requested. Likewise, a burger was tasty and hearty. There have been wine tastings on board in the past, but given that the Empire Builder lost $34.8m in the six months to March this year, it\u2019s not hard to see why such luxuries might have been dispensed with.The accommodation was comfortable. We opted for a two-berth cabin with bunk beds and its own tiny toilet that doubles as a shower room. There are other toilets and showers on the lower deck that offer more room and comfort. The seats in coach class looked both roomy and comfortable, though the carriages had that permanent state of half-light like a teenager\u2019s bedroom, where someone was always asleep regardless of the time of day.The viewing carriage \u2013 seating upstairs, bar downstairs \u2013 was the perfect place to while away the daylight hours, scouring the vista for wildlife, marvelling at the passing landscape or just reading. There is no WiFi on the Empire Builder, which is surely just a failure to upgrade facilities rather than a deliberate attempt to come between passengers and their digital devices.This was my first long-distance train trip overseas and an experience to repeat.

It may well be a year \u2013 or several \u2013 before the Senate confirms anybody to replace Scalia, who died on Saturday at the age of 79. But that vote will almost assuredly not be unanimous, regardless of who the eventual nominee is: the politics of US supreme court appointments have become as polarized as the rest of American politics.And Scalia himself played a significant role in that very polarization.Scalia\u2019s legacy will be extensively celebrated by conservatives \u2013 Marco Rubio spoke for orthodox Republican opinion when he called Scalia one of the greatest justices in US supreme court history at Saturday\u2019s Republican debate \u2013 and derided by liberals, many of whom wasted little time celebrating his demise and speculating how his absence on the court could affect future cases.But what few political commentators note is that the foundation of his legal and political legacy does not so much stem from his majority opinions: landmark opinions, after all, tend to be written by either the chief justice or by the swing voters, like Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Scalia was neither. He certainly wrote numerous important opinions for the court (most notably the first opinion to find that the second amendment protected an individual right to bear arms in DC v Heller), but his reputation was largely based on his dissents and his remarks off the bench.More than most US supreme court justices, Scalia often wrote to be quoted by a general audience \u2013 and that style was a mixed blessing for him. Scalia was capable of very fine legal writing but, particularly as he aged, his trademark blistering zingers were too often made to mask poorly crafted arguments. (In a 2013 interview, Scalia acknowledged his own concerns about his more recent opinions: \u201cYou always wonder whether you\u2019re losing your grip and whether your current opinions are not as good as your old ones.\u201d)Scalia\u2019s style of late reflected a justice who both strongly influenced the contemporary conservative movement and in turn was heavily influenced by it. At oral argument, he was capable of both devastating arguments and of sounding like a second-string conservative talkshow host. But, at his best, Scalia defended originalism and textualism with a style and wit that could be recognized even by those who fundamentally disagreed with him. In his first decade on the court, Scalia even won some grudging admiration from liberals. Perhaps the high point of his intellectual influence across party lines was represented by his Tanner lectures at Princeton: they were published as a widely discussed book, complete with respectful response essays from prominent liberal scholars like Robert Dworkin and Laurence Tribe. And it\u2019s true that Scalia was not a strict Republican party-liner: there were some cases in which he was willing to make common cause with liberal justices out of principle. In one dissent, he (correctly) characterized the mandatory drug testing of border patrol officers as \u201ca kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to drug use\u201d. He wrote a brilliant dissent, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, upholding the habeas corpus rights of American citizens accused of terrorist activities. And in some fourth and sixth amendment cases, he regularly voted in a civil libertarian direction.Still, these cases were the exception rather than the rule as his tenure wore on, and Scalia increasingly became a partisan lightning rod in court circles and in political circles beyond the court. No discussion of Scalia\u2019s legacy, for instance, can ignore the 2000 decision Bush v Gore, in which the court issued an essentially lawless decision awarding the presidency to the Republican candidate. Scalia did not write the opinion of the court, but he wrote the more nakedly partisan opinion that preceded it and has defended it aggressively in public ever since.Bush v Gore is an extreme example but, despite Scalia\u2019s self-presentation as America\u2019s Last Honest Judge, Scalia had a way of ignoring his self-described legal principles if they conflicted with cherished policy goals. To take one particularly critical example, the joint dissent to the 2012 US supreme court opinion largely upholding the Affordable Care Act co-authored by Scalia was so flagrantly inconsistent with Scalia\u2019s previous jurisprudence that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was able to quote his previous opinions at length in her concurrence. More importantly to some is that, had Scalia\u2019s dissents ultimately shaped America, women would not have reproductive rights, the federal government could not effectively regulate healthcare, LGBT people would not have the right to engage in sexual intercourse without fear of arrest \u2013 let alone alone the right to marry \u2013 and states could single them out for legal disabilities. Women could be excluded from state educational institutions, public schools could teach creationism in science classes and prisoners could be assaulted by prison guards. And, in large part because of Scalia, in America today, the Voting Rights Act has been gutted, the rights of employees and consumers have been curtailed, Brown v Board is more likely to be used to stop integration than to promote it and moneyed interests increasingly dominate elections.But however one evaluates his legacy, Scalia\u2019s untimely death creates a huge political issue that could well become a constitutional crisis. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has already made it clear that the Senate will not confirm anyone President Obama nominates to replace Scalia. That means, for at least a year, the US supreme court will almost certainly operate with eight members and, in cases of a 4-4 split, lower-court opinions will stand, leading to escalating uncertainty about the state of the law.If the 2016 elections result in the White House and Senate being held by the same party, this logjam will probably be broken fairly quickly. Attempts by a Senate minority to serially filibuster nominees would almost certainly result in the filibuster being eliminated (as it already has been for all other federal judicial appointments). But if the 2016 elections result in Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders facing a Republican Senate \u2013 as currently seems likely \u2013 all bets are off. There is no precedent for the Senate simply refusing to allow the president to fill a supreme court vacancy, but in the current partisan climate a new precedent may well be created. And whether political pressure will compel the Senate to approve some presidential nominee is unclear.The politics of replacing Scalia are difficult precisely because the consequences are so important. Depending on the results of the 2016 presidential and senatorial elections, the next person allowed to vote on the US supreme court will be similar to either Elena Kagan or John Roberts \u2013 and the stakes for the reproductive freedom of women, climate change, voting rights, civil rights, the ability of the federal government to regulate the economy and civil liberties can hardly be overstated. In a very real sense, the 2016 elections will ultimately result in the confirmation or repudiation of the jurisprudence for which Justice Scalia most prominently advocated.

Once there you can kayak on it then either hike back up or go on horseback for a small fee. The more adventurous can hike the rim of this volcanic lagoon. Trails are well-worn and easy to follow and take up to five hours to complete. The trail on the rim is, for the most part, easy and not very technical. Start your hike no later than 7.30am; clouds and rain usually come in mid-afternoon making visibility poor and temperatures quite cold. The trail is mostly sandy which makes hiking the trail very easy after a rainy night. The ultimate adventure would be to hike the three-four day Quilotoa Loop which starts in the town of Sigchos or the crater itself. The town of Quilotoa is made up primarily of hostels.

Most of them prefer it that way. American judges, by contrast, have always been different, not just because the constitutional separation of powers necessarily makes them more prominent, but also because the process of their appointment is overtly politicised. The president nominates new supreme court justices, and the Senate must confirm them. This goes some of the way to explaining why the death at the weekend of Justice Antonin Scalia is such a significant public event. Related: Antonin Scalia: man of his word who shaped America in life and in death Scalia\u2019s death creates a vacancy on a nine-person supreme court that has often split five to four to the conservative side in recent years; not least in the Bush\u00a0v Gore verdict in 2000 that settled the occupancy of the White House. Barack Obama now has the golden opportunity, as well as the responsibility, to put forward a more liberal nominee, but Republicans won\u2019t stand idly by. Within hours of his death, they were arguing that the nomination should be delayed until after November\u2019s presidential election, and they will probably get their way.Yet even this explosive consequence barely touches on Scalia\u2019s extraordinary personal importance, for there has been no more influential figure in American jurisprudence in half a century. Though he was never chief justice, the court on which he sat from 1986, after his appointment by Ronald Reagan, was in a very real sense \u201cthe Scalia court\u201d. His passing is an intellectual event as well as a political one. It would not be an exaggeration to say that without understanding Scalia one cannot understand American constitutional politics of the past three decades. Related: Supreme court justice Antonin Scalia dies: legal and political worlds react Scalia was an ideological social conservative in most respects. He gave striking conservative judgments on issues such as abortion, gay equality, desegregation and capital punishment. Yet what mattered more was his sustained ability to articulate, in trenchant language, a fundamentalist doctrine about the US constitution that has been a beacon to American conservatives in the law and politics for more than a generation.In Scalia\u2019s view, the constitution should be interpreted as closely as possible to the way America\u2019s founders would have conceived it. This \u201coriginalist\u201d approach placed Scalia in outright opposition \u2014 which he often expressed in the liveliest way \u2014 to the liberal view, which saw the constitution as an evolving set of rules that could be adapted to changing values and times. To him, the constitution was close to holy writ. He was as much a believer in the truth of the US constitution as any believer in any religious book. This fundamentalism gave him a status among conservatives that in some ways rivalled that of Reagan.It made Scalia the modern era\u2019s most influential and articulate judicial apostle of non-interference, states\u2019 rights, small federal government and a weak presidency. In this position he undoubtedly shaped the thinking of many young lawyers and politicians, which is why his death will not end his influence.Scalia was also a rock-solid American exceptionalist, maintaining that the constitution was not just the original reference point for the judges, but the only one. Anyone who reads a UK supreme court judgment will find it cites rulings and judgments from not just the European courts but also, frequently, the US and other courts too. Scalia would have none of that internationalism. His jurisprudence was wholly American; only American judgments could be considered, he believed. In this he both spoke for and gave a huge boost to this exceptionalism, with immense consequences that have reached far beyond the courts.Few who ever attended a session of the court in his era could fail to notice his sharpness and judicial star-power, even if his ideology and jurisprudence were mistaken in profound ways on almost every issue.Scalia\u2019s importance and sheer interest value can hardly be exaggerated. He embodied the truth that America is, and will always be, so very different from Britain in countless ways.", "tags": ["US supreme court", "US justice system", "US news", "World news", "Law"], "title": "Antonin Scalia: the judge whose conservatism shaped America | Martin Kettle"},{"date": "2016-02-05T09:00:42Z", "content": "An odd thing about reporting on the US president\u2019s State of the Union address is that the press sit high behind him, virtually unable to see him. At this year\u2019s, Barack Obama\u2019s last, I could just about look down on the top of his head and side from a tight angle if I leaned forward on tiptoe. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst seat in the nation,\u201d said one old hand, mindful that TV viewers can see Obama up close.It\u2019s stepping into another man\u2019s shoes like a new Doctor Who.But from that vantage point you can observe the majesty of America\u2019s body politic: the military generals, the supreme court judges, the row upon row of Congressmen, some applauding enthusiastically, others sitting on their hands and scowling, others yawning or taking selfies. All, however, were pleased to hear Obama declare America the powerful nation on the planet, spending more on its military than the next eight nations combined.\u201cOur troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world,\u201d he went on. \u201cNo nation attacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that\u2019s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead - they call us.\u201dSo here I was at the Capitol in the vaunting Rome of our times, five months after being greeted in Mubuga, a remote village in Burundi, by ceremonial drummers and dancers and making a speech about what I was there to write about. The village has never had electricity so its residents must rely on candles, lanterns, firewood and charcoal. I visited many such places during six years as Africa correspondent of the Guardian; now I am based in its Washington office, a short walk from the White House.This is how it goes as a foreign correspondent, shifting from the world\u2019s poorest continent to its richest, from constant sunshine to bone-chilling cold, from roving around nations that many outside Africa would struggle to find on a map to reporting on the world\u2019s most famous politician pardon a Thanksgiving turkey. It\u2019s stepping into another man\u2019s shoes like a new Doctor Who.This particular regeneration involved two marathon flights, chasing two jetlagged toddlers around a hotel lobby at 4am and all the usual teething troubles of a new house with broken fridge and no hot water. But arriving with young kids is a good way to dive straight in rather then dwelling on the shock of the new. Washington lacks the hustling vibrancy of downtown Johannesburg but the parks, playgrounds and zoo are superb, the Smithsonian museums world class and the view of the national mall from the Lincoln memorial quite sublime.In the suburbs of Johannesburg where we lived previously, front gardens are invisible behind crime-conscious high walls; in Washington, we arrived just in time for the spectacle of Halloween, when many front gardens display pumpkins, giant spiders and skeletons and mock graveyards. In the suburbs of Johannesburg, the car is king and walking a rarity; in Washington, we are glad to be on foot, bus and underground train. Restaurants stay open later too, but dining out and hiring a babysitter is financially ruinous. Some differences come as a surprise. While the internet here is a high-speed treat, I realise that Africa is light years ahead of America in online and mobile banking. Washington has forced me to dust off those quaint items, the chequebook and the fax machine. It\u2019s like being catapulted into the 20th and 22nd centuries all at once.Professionally, certain aspects of this job are not so different from the last. Two burning issues in America are inequality and race, just as they were in South Africa. Soon after arriving in America, I reported on protests by black students spreading across university campuses, a trend shaking South Africa at almost exactly the same time. South Africa is notorious for violent crime, but 30,000 Americans are killed by guns every year. The mixed race Obama\u2019s first taste of political activism was the anti-apartheid movement while mixed race Trevor Noah, South Africa\u2019s top comedian, now hosts The Daily Show on Comedy Central. Sometimes, these countries rhyme.Indeed, whereas some African governments are the embodiment of opacity, with spokespeople who seldom return journalists\u2019 calls, America presents itself as a model of transparency with daily press conferences broadcast online and transcribed word-for-word. Yet at second glance, these briefings can often be an elaborate dance in which the spokesperson reads \u201ctalking points\u201d from a script, sprinkles a few crumbs and pleads ignorance to questions of substance. The facade of open government has been established, but what have we truly learned?Likewise, on the surface at least, an American election is regarded as a cheating and corruption-free paragon compared with several polls I covered in Africa, where the question was not who would win but how many people would die. But it should be remembered that the rival frontrunners this time are the spouse of an ex-president and a billionaire demagogue. If this scenario played out in Africa, the watchdogs would decry another tawdry case of nepotism and elitism.Indeed, while US presidents may respect term limits in a way that some African leaders still do not, the political system has its own toxic mix of disenfranchisement, donors, gerrymandering, lobbyists, spin, vested interests and Fox News. It\u2019s just that, after more than two centuries, it\u2019s more subtle and insidious than a tinpot dictator sending in the tanks. For journalists, it can be a knottier code to unravel.One of the greatest challenges for the media in this election is Donald Trump, who defies all the known laws of political physics. He has made offensive comments about women and Muslims and uttered demonstrable falsehoods, which under normal rules ought to be enough to scuttle his candidacy; instead, it only appears to make him stronger with supporters who ask, don\u2019t all politicians lie? His is a candidacy based on celebrity, and so the media are complicit in its rise; but Trump is undoubtedly news, so how can he be ignored?I met a veteran Washington correspondent the other day who said he thinks opinion polling has destroyed political journalism in America. There is an obsession with the \u201chorse race\u201d - who\u2019s up, who\u2019s down - to the detriment of understanding the candidates, their personalities and their policies. And after several recent failures, it will be intriguing to see if the pollsters are leading us up the wrong path.Unlike in Africa, I am one of many Guardian journalists in America, but as a beat it is uniquely intense. People everywhere are more or less familiar with it through film, music, television and others forms of soft power. When something happens in Syria or North Korea or Mali, the media want to know: what does Washington think, what will Washington do? I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.To support Guardian journalism and to become involved in our events and debates sign up to become a Guardian Member.", "tags": ["Membership"], "title": "Inside the Guardian: David Smith's letter from America"},{"date": "2015-11-14T07:00:12Z", "content": "South America is all about the freedom of the great outdoors.

But for those not on a tight schedule, it added to the intrigue and fascination of the trip. It also greased the wheels, as it were, of conversation with fellow passengers most of whom were remarkably sanguine about the inconvenience.Travelling any distance by train in the States is a lifestyle choice rather than a function of daily life. Consequently, the attitude was one of wry amusement rather than anger. Most were wearily chipper and enjoyed the adventure, despite the uncertainty. The only non-Americans we encountered were three Australians, including a couple from Adelaide who were on a mammoth train extravaganza around North America. They declared themselves great supporters of Amtrak and envious of the rail network.Then there was Shawna and Bobby Jo, two women who\u2019d never met before but decided to take advantage of the dining car once it emerged that their respective homeward journeys were disrupted. Bottles of Pinot Grigio and a passable steak diluted any frustration they may have felt. Bobby Jo was \u201conly\u201d going as far as Wisconsin Dells, the fifth stop en route, and would in normal circumstances have been home for Sunday evening with her family after the three-and-a-half hour journey, ready for work as a nurse on Monday morning. Not on this occasion. Shawna, also coincidentally a nurse, had a longer trip, to Grand Forks, North Dakota (one stop on from Fargo). Talk was of football, family and farming. Not for nothing are the supporters of the legendary Green Bay Packers American football team known as Cheeseheads: we were heading across the Northern Plains \u2013 dairy country far and wide. Related: Chicago prohibition-style: a city still married to the mob The train wasn\u2019t full in mid-November, but the Empire Builder maintained the policy of \u201ccommunity seating\u201d at meal times. Passengers were instructed to sit side by side with their travelling companion so one is obliged to make eye contact \u2013 and ideally conversation \u2013 with strangers. Of the six meals we had, only one was conducted in silence opposite a guy on his own who was reading. The other five were all friendly and illuminating.The two breakfasts were memorable for the locations. The first, as we crossed the Mississippi river along the state line between Wisconsin and Minnesota, was shared with a woman and her young son. The following morning, as we chugged through the spectacular Glacier National Park in Montana, we had the perfect guides to the scenery: a retired couple from Havre, Montana (population 9,700, enjoying night-time November temperatures of -18C). They were heading to Spokane to see their new grandchild. Spokane is where the Empire Builder splits for the last 300 miles or so to Seattle, or further south to Portland.They could have driven it more quickly, but given that we were on the cusp of winter in the frozen north they preferred to let the train take the strain, and enjoy the views: snow-capped mountains in the distance, rivers and lakes in the foreground with the odd bald eagle scouting for prey from an arboreal perch. Related: Top 10 national and state parks in Washington state  Viewed harshly, the edible fare is aeroplane food on a plate, though in truth it\u2019s better and more varied than that. The \u201csignature\u201d steak for dinner was delicious and cooked as requested. Likewise, a burger was tasty and hearty. There have been wine tastings on board in the past, but given that the Empire Builder lost $34.8m in the six months to March this year, it\u2019s not hard to see why such luxuries might have been dispensed with.The accommodation was comfortable. We opted for a two-berth cabin with bunk beds and its own tiny toilet that doubles as a shower room. There are other toilets and showers on the lower deck that offer more room and comfort. The seats in coach class looked both roomy and comfortable, though the carriages had that permanent state of half-light like a teenager\u2019s bedroom, where someone was always asleep regardless of the time of day.The viewing carriage \u2013 seating upstairs, bar downstairs \u2013 was the perfect place to while away the daylight hours, scouring the vista for wildlife, marvelling at the passing landscape or just reading. There is no WiFi on the Empire Builder, which is surely just a failure to upgrade facilities rather than a deliberate attempt to come between passengers and their digital devices.This was my first long-distance train trip overseas and an experience to repeat. There is a mindset adjustment required to unlock the willingness to enjoy the journey rather than project forward to the destination.

It may well be a year \u2013 or several \u2013 before the Senate confirms anybody to replace Scalia, who died on Saturday at the age of 79. But that vote will almost assuredly not be unanimous, regardless of who the eventual nominee is: the politics of US supreme court appointments have become as polarized as the rest of American politics.And Scalia himself played a significant role in that very polarization.Scalia\u2019s legacy will be extensively celebrated by conservatives \u2013 Marco Rubio spoke for orthodox Republican opinion when he called Scalia one of the greatest justices in US supreme court history at Saturday\u2019s Republican debate \u2013 and derided by liberals, many of whom wasted little time celebrating his demise and speculating how his absence on the court could affect future cases.But what few political commentators note is that the foundation of his legal and political legacy does not so much stem from his majority opinions: landmark opinions, after all, tend to be written by either the chief justice or by the swing voters, like Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Scalia was neither. He certainly wrote numerous important opinions for the court (most notably the first opinion to find that the second amendment protected an individual right to bear arms in DC v Heller), but his reputation was largely based on his dissents and his remarks off the bench.More than most US supreme court justices, Scalia often wrote to be quoted by a general audience \u2013 and that style was a mixed blessing for him. Scalia was capable of very fine legal writing but, particularly as he aged, his trademark blistering zingers were too often made to mask poorly crafted arguments. (In a 2013 interview, Scalia acknowledged his own concerns about his more recent opinions: \u201cYou always wonder whether you\u2019re losing your grip and whether your current opinions are not as good as your old ones.\u201d)Scalia\u2019s style of late reflected a justice who both strongly influenced the contemporary conservative movement and in turn was heavily influenced by it. At oral argument, he was capable of both devastating arguments and of sounding like a second-string conservative talkshow host. But, at his best, Scalia defended originalism and textualism with a style and wit that could be recognized even by those who fundamentally disagreed with him. In his first decade on the court, Scalia even won some grudging admiration from liberals. Perhaps the high point of his intellectual influence across party lines was represented by his Tanner lectures at Princeton: they were published as a widely discussed book, complete with respectful response essays from prominent liberal scholars like Robert Dworkin and Laurence Tribe. And it\u2019s true that Scalia was not a strict Republican party-liner: there were some cases in which he was willing to make common cause with liberal justices out of principle. In one dissent, he (correctly) characterized the mandatory drug testing of border patrol officers as \u201ca kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to drug use\u201d. He wrote a brilliant dissent, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, upholding the habeas corpus rights of American citizens accused of terrorist activities. And in some fourth and sixth amendment cases, he regularly voted in a civil libertarian direction.Still, these cases were the exception rather than the rule as his tenure wore on, and Scalia increasingly became a partisan lightning rod in court circles and in political circles beyond the court. No discussion of Scalia\u2019s legacy, for instance, can ignore the 2000 decision Bush v Gore, in which the court issued an essentially lawless decision awarding the presidency to the Republican candidate. Scalia did not write the opinion of the court, but he wrote the more nakedly partisan opinion that preceded it and has defended it aggressively in public ever since.Bush v Gore is an extreme example but, despite Scalia\u2019s self-presentation as America\u2019s Last Honest Judge, Scalia had a way of ignoring his self-described legal principles if they conflicted with cherished policy goals. To take one particularly critical example, the joint dissent to the 2012 US supreme court opinion largely upholding the Affordable Care Act co-authored by Scalia was so flagrantly inconsistent with Scalia\u2019s previous jurisprudence that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was able to quote his previous opinions at length in her concurrence. More importantly to some is that, had Scalia\u2019s dissents ultimately shaped America, women would not have reproductive rights, the federal government could not effectively regulate healthcare, LGBT people would not have the right to engage in sexual intercourse without fear of arrest \u2013 let alone alone the right to marry \u2013 and states could single them out for legal disabilities. Women could be excluded from state educational institutions, public schools could teach creationism in science classes and prisoners could be assaulted by prison guards. And, in large part because of Scalia, in America today, the Voting Rights Act has been gutted, the rights of employees and consumers have been curtailed, Brown v Board is more likely to be used to stop integration than to promote it and moneyed interests increasingly dominate elections.But however one evaluates his legacy, Scalia\u2019s untimely death creates a huge political issue that could well become a constitutional crisis. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has already made it clear that the Senate will not confirm anyone President Obama nominates to replace Scalia. That means, for at least a year, the US supreme court will almost certainly operate with eight members and, in cases of a 4-4 split, lower-court opinions will stand, leading to escalating uncertainty about the state of the law.If the 2016 elections result in the White House and Senate being held by the same party, this logjam will probably be broken fairly quickly. Attempts by a Senate minority to serially filibuster nominees would almost certainly result in the filibuster being eliminated (as it already has been for all other federal judicial appointments). But if the 2016 elections result in Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders facing a Republican Senate \u2013 as currently seems likely \u2013 all bets are off. There is no precedent for the Senate simply refusing to allow the president to fill a supreme court vacancy, but in the current partisan climate a new precedent may well be created. And whether political pressure will compel the Senate to approve some presidential nominee is unclear.The politics of replacing Scalia are difficult precisely because the consequences are so important. Depending on the results of the 2016 presidential and senatorial elections, the next person allowed to vote on the US supreme court will be similar to either Elena Kagan or John Roberts \u2013 and the stakes for the reproductive freedom of women, climate change, voting rights, civil rights, the ability of the federal government to regulate the economy and civil liberties can hardly be overstated. In a very real sense, the 2016 elections will ultimately result in the confirmation or repudiation of the jurisprudence for which Justice Scalia most prominently advocated.

The hike to Lake 69 was recommended, in the Huascaran national park, part of the incredible Cordillera Blanca mountains \u2013 the world\u2019s highest tropical range. The trip, booked through my hostel, cost around \u00a39 per person.

The trek will take you through parched and arid woods at the start but soon you\u2019ll be climbing alongside the river flowing from the mountain \u2013 there may be some snow at the top for the final 500m. Spending the night at Refugio Frey with a shared meal is about \u00a330. Alternatively, you can opt for just a bed and pay a few dollars to use their kitchen, or going further you can camp depending on the weather conditions. The journey down is of course easier, and for a change of scenery take the Cerro Catedral route back near the bottom and grab a sugary waffle in the Catedral ski resort. If you have a couple of days in Bariloche this is an excellent way to spend them.trekbariloche.comjamieisbellIt\u2019s a three-day, 44km hike to get to the Lost City, which involves fording rivers, sleeping in hammocks and, at one point, sharing the path with a mule transporting a wheel-barrow to a far flung Kogi village.

Visitors travel there from Santa Marta; driving into the mountains to the end of the \u201croad\u201d (pot-holes held together by mud) in a clapped-out jeepney. From here, shanks pony is your only transportation.

Inexperienced trekkers can do it in four days but if you are a seasoned hiker and find the Santa Cruz trek too short, the Cordillera Blanca has many more trails to follow. Regardless of experience, the South America Explorers club proved invaluable.Dolly SullyFor an alternative to the waiting lists, crowds and expense of the Inca Trail, visit the northern town of Chachapoyas. On arriving, we contacted the I-Peru office, which set us up with Aldo, a local guide with detailed knowledge of the cliffside mausoleums and ruins half hidden in cloud forests. No visit is complete without a trek to the area\u2019s star attraction, the pre-Incan fortress city of Kuelap. We arranged a two-day hike, staying overnight in the village of Tingo. Setting off early for the final stage, a six-mile, 1,200-metre climb to the citadel, we arrived as the city\u2019s immense stone walls emerged from the morning mist. For two hours we explored the deserted ruins; our only company a pair of bemused looking llamas.ID090252Hidden away high in the Andes in the Cotopaxi Province, this ancient volcano\u2019s two-mile wide crater has been collecting rain water for centuries, creating a turquoise lagoon to which you can hike down to. Once there you can kayak on it then either hike back up or go on horseback for a small fee. The more adventurous can hike the rim of this volcanic lagoon. Trails are well-worn and easy to follow and take up to five hours to complete. The trail on the rim is, for the most part, easy and not very technical. Start your hike no later than 7.30am; clouds and rain usually come in mid-afternoon making visibility poor and temperatures quite cold. The trail is mostly sandy which makes hiking the trail very easy after a rainy night. The ultimate adventure would be to hike the three-four day Quilotoa Loop which starts in the town of Sigchos or the crater itself. The town of Quilotoa is made up primarily of hostels.

Most of them prefer it that way. American judges, by contrast, have always been different, not just because the constitutional separation of powers necessarily makes them more prominent, but also because the process of their appointment is overtly politicised. The president nominates new supreme court justices, and the Senate must confirm them. This goes some of the way to explaining why the death at the weekend of Justice Antonin Scalia is such a significant public event. Related: Antonin Scalia: man of his word who shaped America in life and in death Scalia\u2019s death creates a vacancy on a nine-person supreme court that has often split five to four to the conservative side in recent years; not least in the Bush\u00a0v Gore verdict in 2000 that settled the occupancy of the White House. Barack Obama now has the golden opportunity, as well as the responsibility, to put forward a more liberal nominee, but Republicans won\u2019t stand idly by. Within hours of his death, they were arguing that the nomination should be delayed until after November\u2019s presidential election, and they will probably get their way.Yet even this explosive consequence barely touches on Scalia\u2019s extraordinary personal importance, for there has been no more influential figure in American jurisprudence in half a century. Though he was never chief justice, the court on which he sat from 1986, after his appointment by Ronald Reagan, was in a very real sense \u201cthe Scalia court\u201d. His passing is an intellectual event as well as a political one. It would not be an exaggeration to say that without understanding Scalia one cannot understand American constitutional politics of the past three decades. Related: Supreme court justice Antonin Scalia dies: legal and political worlds react Scalia was an ideological social conservative in most respects. He gave striking conservative judgments on issues such as abortion, gay equality, desegregation and capital punishment. Yet what mattered more was his sustained ability to articulate, in trenchant language, a fundamentalist doctrine about the US constitution that has been a beacon to American conservatives in the law and politics for more than a generation.In Scalia\u2019s view, the constitution should be interpreted as closely as possible to the way America\u2019s founders would have conceived it. This \u201coriginalist\u201d approach placed Scalia in outright opposition \u2014 which he often expressed in the liveliest way \u2014 to the liberal view, which saw the constitution as an evolving set of rules that could be adapted to changing values and times. To him, the constitution was close to holy writ. He was as much a believer in the truth of the US constitution as any believer in any religious book. This fundamentalism gave him a status among conservatives that in some ways rivalled that of Reagan.It made Scalia the modern era\u2019s most influential and articulate judicial apostle of non-interference, states\u2019 rights, small federal government and a weak presidency. In this position he undoubtedly shaped the thinking of many young lawyers and politicians, which is why his death will not end his influence.Scalia was also a rock-solid American exceptionalist, maintaining that the constitution was not just the original reference point for the judges, but the only one. Anyone who reads a UK supreme court judgment will find it cites rulings and judgments from not just the European courts but also, frequently, the US and other courts too. Scalia would have none of that internationalism. His jurisprudence was wholly American; only American judgments could be considered, he believed. In this he both spoke for and gave a huge boost to this exceptionalism, with immense consequences that have reached far beyond the courts.Few who ever attended a session of the court in his era could fail to notice his sharpness and judicial star-power, even if his ideology and jurisprudence were mistaken in profound ways on almost every issue.Scalia\u2019s importance and sheer interest value can hardly be exaggerated. He embodied the truth that America is, and will always be, so very different from Britain in countless ways.", "tags": ["US supreme court", "US justice system", "US news", "World news", "Law"], "title": "Antonin Scalia: the judge whose conservatism shaped America | Martin Kettle"},{"date": "2016-02-05T09:00:42Z", "content": "An odd thing about reporting on the US president\u2019s State of the Union address is that the press sit high behind him, virtually unable to see him.

The village has never had electricity so its residents must rely on candles, lanterns, firewood and charcoal. I visited many such places during six years as Africa correspondent of the Guardian; now I am based in its Washington office, a short walk from the White House.This is how it goes as a foreign correspondent, shifting from the world\u2019s poorest continent to its richest, from constant sunshine to bone-chilling cold, from roving around nations that many outside Africa would struggle to find on a map to reporting on the world\u2019s most famous politician pardon a Thanksgiving turkey. It\u2019s stepping into another man\u2019s shoes like a new Doctor Who.This particular regeneration involved two marathon flights, chasing two jetlagged toddlers around a hotel lobby at 4am and all the usual teething troubles of a new house with broken fridge and no hot water. But arriving with young kids is a good way to dive straight in rather then dwelling on the shock of the new. Washington lacks the hustling vibrancy of downtown Johannesburg but the parks, playgrounds and zoo are superb, the Smithsonian museums world class and the view of the national mall from the Lincoln memorial quite sublime.In the suburbs of Johannesburg where we lived previously, front gardens are invisible behind crime-conscious high walls; in Washington, we arrived just in time for the spectacle of Halloween, when many front gardens display pumpkins, giant spiders and skeletons and mock graveyards. In the suburbs of Johannesburg, the car is king and walking a rarity; in Washington, we are glad to be on foot, bus and underground train. Restaurants stay open later too, but dining out and hiring a babysitter is financially ruinous. Some differences come as a surprise. While the internet here is a high-speed treat, I realise that Africa is light years ahead of America in online and mobile banking. Washington has forced me to dust off those quaint items, the chequebook and the fax machine. It\u2019s like being catapulted into the 20th and 22nd centuries all at once.Professionally, certain aspects of this job are not so different from the last. Two burning issues in America are inequality and race, just as they were in South Africa. Soon after arriving in America, I reported on protests by black students spreading across university campuses, a trend shaking South Africa at almost exactly the same time. South Africa is notorious for violent crime, but 30,000 Americans are killed by guns every year. The mixed race Obama\u2019s first taste of political activism was the anti-apartheid movement while mixed race Trevor Noah, South Africa\u2019s top comedian, now hosts The Daily Show on Comedy Central. Sometimes, these countries rhyme.Indeed, whereas some African governments are the embodiment of opacity, with spokespeople who seldom return journalists\u2019 calls, America presents itself as a model of transparency with daily press conferences broadcast online and transcribed word-for-word. Yet at second glance, these briefings can often be an elaborate dance in which the spokesperson reads \u201ctalking points\u201d from a script, sprinkles a few crumbs and pleads ignorance to questions of substance. The facade of open government has been established, but what have we truly learned?Likewise, on the surface at least, an American election is regarded as a cheating and corruption-free paragon compared with several polls I covered in Africa, where the question was not who would win but how many people would die. But it should be remembered that the rival frontrunners this time are the spouse of an ex-president and a billionaire demagogue. If this scenario played out in Africa, the watchdogs would decry another tawdry case of nepotism and elitism.Indeed, while US presidents may respect term limits in a way that some African leaders still do not, the political system has its own toxic mix of disenfranchisement, donors, gerrymandering, lobbyists, spin, vested interests and Fox News. It\u2019s just that, after more than two centuries, it\u2019s more subtle and insidious than a tinpot dictator sending in the tanks. For journalists, it can be a knottier code to unravel.One of the greatest challenges for the media in this election is Donald Trump, who defies all the known laws of political physics. He has made offensive comments about women and Muslims and uttered demonstrable falsehoods, which under normal rules ought to be enough to scuttle his candidacy; instead, it only appears to make him stronger with supporters who ask, don\u2019t all politicians lie? His is a candidacy based on celebrity, and so the media are complicit in its rise; but Trump is undoubtedly news, so how can he be ignored?I met a veteran Washington correspondent the other day who said he thinks opinion polling has destroyed political journalism in America. There is an obsession with the \u201chorse race\u201d - who\u2019s up, who\u2019s down - to the detriment of understanding the candidates, their personalities and their policies. And after several recent failures, it will be intriguing to see if the pollsters are leading us up the wrong path.Unlike in Africa, I am one of many Guardian journalists in America, but as a beat it is uniquely intense. People everywhere are more or less familiar with it through film, music, television and others forms of soft power. When something happens in Syria or North Korea or Mali, the media want to know: what does Washington think, what will Washington do?

New York City recently passed a law that will oblige nearly all shops and restaurants to keep front doors and windows shut while air conditioners are on, a response to the practice of wooing sweaty passers-by with the promise of chilled respite. Innovators are promising more efficient devices in the next decade, including one that makes and stores ice cheaply at night to cool buildings during the day, from a California firm called Ice Energy.Only now is the US waking up to the environmental cost of such massive energy consumption \u2013 and to the chilling prospect that the rest of the world may follow its example. The proportion of homes in Chinese cities with air conditioning rocketed from 8% to 70% between 1995 and 2004. US statistics are bracing. A nation with 318 million people accounting for just 4.5% of world population consumes more energy for air conditioning than the rest of the world combined. It uses more electricity for cooling than Africa, population 1.1 billion, uses for everything. Vehicle air conditioners in the US use 7bn to 10bn gallons of petrol annually. Each home with an air conditioner emits about two tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air each year, according to the US department of energy. Air conditioners employ the same operating principles as refrigerators: transfer heat from the cool interior, be it a fridge, room or building, to the relative warmth outside. This can contribute to an urban heat island effect. A study found that AC units in Phoenix, Arizona, heat the night-time air temperature outside by up to 2C which, of course, encourages residents to blast even more air conditioning to compensate. New York\u2019s subway stations bake in summer at more than 48C, partly because air-conditioned trains are pumping out heat.Freakishly hot weather across the US increases the temptation to ratchet up air conditioning, especially in California, which has endured record heat along with massive wildfires and a drought. During the summer, energy providers often implore people to reduce their use of air conditioners and other devices to avoid crashing the grid. Silicon Valley is another guzzler. The water used to cool California\u2019s estimated 800 data centres each year could fill approximately 158,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Reducing energy consumption can be tricky, according to Aaron James, a professor of philosophy and ethics at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cPeople often feel a sense of entitlement about what they have become accustomed to. So even if it wouldn\u2019t be asking much \u2013 a small behavioural change in the face of a severe problem \u2013 it can make us feel morally defensive.\u201dFilling a recycling bag that neighbours may see, for instance, can feel more important and virtuous than lowering the AC. \u201cIn the US there\u2019s not an established awareness of air conditioning as a climate change problem,\u201d said James, the author of Assholes: A Theory.Orlando in mid-August without air conditioning \u2026 Disney World would be more like Devil\u2019s IslandAir conditioning, it should be stressed, is an important economic and social technology. It saves lives. An average of 618 people in the US die each year from exposure to excessive natural heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a far cry from a century ago when heat killed thousands. It also cuts absenteeism and raises productivity. In a 1957 survey, 90% of US firms named cooled air as the single biggest boost to their productivity.Nelson Polsby, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who died in 2007, suggested air conditioning also reshaped American politics by enabling Republican pensioners to migrate to southern and western states, paving Reagan\u2019s way to the White House.\u201cAir conditioning probably did foster migration in the Sun Belt,\u201d said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cHow many people want to endure Orlando in mid-August without air conditioning? Without it, Disney World would be more like Devil\u2019s Island.\u201dThe technology also influenced the Hollywood blockbuster. In the early 20th century few braved sweltering cinemas in summer. That changed once they installed air conditioning \u2013 an innovation advertised with letters dripping with icicles. It remains a selling point to this day. AMC Theatres, the US\u2019s second largest cinema chain, keeps the temperature at 21C in winter and 23C in summer.Bar Armageddon, the technology is here to to stay, said Basile. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to go back once you\u2019ve been going forward. From a philosophical standpoint I, an air-conditioning junkie, can\u2019t tell someone they can\u2019t have it.\u201dHe feels, however, that the US overuses the technology. \u201cI noticed that cooled spaces in the UK were comfortable, but nowhere near as icy-frigid as their American counterparts.\u201dWith billions of people in warm climates wanting \u201cbearable lives\u201d, the race for efficiency is rather urgent, according to Basile.

But for those not on a tight schedule, it added to the intrigue and fascination of the trip. It also greased the wheels, as it were, of conversation with fellow passengers most of whom were remarkably sanguine about the inconvenience.Travelling any distance by train in the States is a lifestyle choice rather than a function of daily life. Consequently, the attitude was one of wry amusement rather than anger. Most were wearily chipper and enjoyed the adventure, despite the uncertainty. The only non-Americans we encountered were three Australians, including a couple from Adelaide who were on a mammoth train extravaganza around North America. They declared themselves great supporters of Amtrak and envious of the rail network.Then there was Shawna and Bobby Jo, two women who\u2019d never met before but decided to take advantage of the dining car once it emerged that their respective homeward journeys were disrupted. Bottles of Pinot Grigio and a passable steak diluted any frustration they may have felt. Bobby Jo was \u201conly\u201d going as far as Wisconsin Dells, the fifth stop en route, and would in normal circumstances have been home for Sunday evening with her family after the three-and-a-half hour journey, ready for work as a nurse on Monday morning. Not on this occasion. Shawna, also coincidentally a nurse, had a longer trip, to Grand Forks, North Dakota (one stop on from Fargo). Talk was of football, family and farming. Not for nothing are the supporters of the legendary Green Bay Packers American football team known as Cheeseheads: we were heading across the Northern Plains \u2013 dairy country far and wide. Related: Chicago prohibition-style: a city still married to the mob The train wasn\u2019t full in mid-November, but the Empire Builder maintained the policy of \u201ccommunity seating\u201d at meal times. Passengers were instructed to sit side by side with their travelling companion so one is obliged to make eye contact \u2013 and ideally conversation \u2013 with strangers. Of the six meals we had, only one was conducted in silence opposite a guy on his own who was reading. The other five were all friendly and illuminating.The two breakfasts were memorable for the locations. The first, as we crossed the Mississippi river along the state line between Wisconsin and Minnesota, was shared with a woman and her young son. The following morning, as we chugged through the spectacular Glacier National Park in Montana, we had the perfect guides to the scenery: a retired couple from Havre, Montana (population 9,700, enjoying night-time November temperatures of -18C). They were heading to Spokane to see their new grandchild. Spokane is where the Empire Builder splits for the last 300 miles or so to Seattle, or further south to Portland.They could have driven it more quickly, but given that we were on the cusp of winter in the frozen north they preferred to let the train take the strain, and enjoy the views: snow-capped mountains in the distance, rivers and lakes in the foreground with the odd bald eagle scouting for prey from an arboreal perch.

There have been wine tastings on board in the past, but given that the Empire Builder lost $34.8m in the six months to March this year, it\u2019s not hard to see why such luxuries might have been dispensed with.The accommodation was comfortable. We opted for a two-berth cabin with bunk beds and its own tiny toilet that doubles as a shower room. There are other toilets and showers on the lower deck that offer more room and comfort.

There is no WiFi on the Empire Builder, which is surely just a failure to upgrade facilities rather than a deliberate attempt to come between passengers and their digital devices.This was my first long-distance train trip overseas and an experience to repeat.

It may well be a year \u2013 or several \u2013 before the Senate confirms anybody to replace Scalia, who died on Saturday at the age of 79. But that vote will almost assuredly not be unanimous, regardless of who the eventual nominee is: the politics of US supreme court appointments have become as polarized as the rest of American politics.And Scalia himself played a significant role in that very polarization.Scalia\u2019s legacy will be extensively celebrated by conservatives \u2013 Marco Rubio spoke for orthodox Republican opinion when he called Scalia one of the greatest justices in US supreme court history at Saturday\u2019s Republican debate \u2013 and derided by liberals, many of whom wasted little time celebrating his demise and speculating how his absence on the court could affect future cases.But what few political commentators note is that the foundation of his legal and political legacy does not so much stem from his majority opinions: landmark opinions, after all, tend to be written by either the chief justice or by the swing voters, like Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Scalia was neither. He certainly wrote numerous important opinions for the court (most notably the first opinion to find that the second amendment protected an individual right to bear arms in DC v Heller), but his reputation was largely based on his dissents and his remarks off the bench.More than most US supreme court justices, Scalia often wrote to be quoted by a general audience \u2013 and that style was a mixed blessing for him. Scalia was capable of very fine legal writing but, particularly as he aged, his trademark blistering zingers were too often made to mask poorly crafted arguments. (In a 2013 interview, Scalia acknowledged his own concerns about his more recent opinions: \u201cYou always wonder whether you\u2019re losing your grip and whether your current opinions are not as good as your old ones.\u201d)Scalia\u2019s style of late reflected a justice who both strongly influenced the contemporary conservative movement and in turn was heavily influenced by it. At oral argument, he was capable of both devastating arguments and of sounding like a second-string conservative talkshow host. But, at his best, Scalia defended originalism and textualism with a style and wit that could be recognized even by those who fundamentally disagreed with him. In his first decade on the court, Scalia even won some grudging admiration from liberals. Perhaps the high point of his intellectual influence across party lines was represented by his Tanner lectures at Princeton: they were published as a widely discussed book, complete with respectful response essays from prominent liberal scholars like Robert Dworkin and Laurence Tribe. And it\u2019s true that Scalia was not a strict Republican party-liner: there were some cases in which he was willing to make common cause with liberal justices out of principle. In one dissent, he (correctly) characterized the mandatory drug testing of border patrol officers as \u201ca kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to drug use\u201d. He wrote a brilliant dissent, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, upholding the habeas corpus rights of American citizens accused of terrorist activities. And in some fourth and sixth amendment cases, he regularly voted in a civil libertarian direction.Still, these cases were the exception rather than the rule as his tenure wore on, and Scalia increasingly became a partisan lightning rod in court circles and in political circles beyond the court. No discussion of Scalia\u2019s legacy, for instance, can ignore the 2000 decision Bush v Gore, in which the court issued an essentially lawless decision awarding the presidency to the Republican candidate. Scalia did not write the opinion of the court, but he wrote the more nakedly partisan opinion that preceded it and has defended it aggressively in public ever since.Bush v Gore is an extreme example but, despite Scalia\u2019s self-presentation as America\u2019s Last Honest Judge, Scalia had a way of ignoring his self-described legal principles if they conflicted with cherished policy goals. To take one particularly critical example, the joint dissent to the 2012 US supreme court opinion largely upholding the Affordable Care Act co-authored by Scalia was so flagrantly inconsistent with Scalia\u2019s previous jurisprudence that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was able to quote his previous opinions at length in her concurrence. More importantly to some is that, had Scalia\u2019s dissents ultimately shaped America, women would not have reproductive rights, the federal government could not effectively regulate healthcare, LGBT people would not have the right to engage in sexual intercourse without fear of arrest \u2013 let alone alone the right to marry \u2013 and states could single them out for legal disabilities. Women could be excluded from state educational institutions, public schools could teach creationism in science classes and prisoners could be assaulted by prison guards. And, in large part because of Scalia, in America today, the Voting Rights Act has been gutted, the rights of employees and consumers have been curtailed, Brown v Board is more likely to be used to stop integration than to promote it and moneyed interests increasingly dominate elections.But however one evaluates his legacy, Scalia\u2019s untimely death creates a huge political issue that could well become a constitutional crisis. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has already made it clear that the Senate will not confirm anyone President Obama nominates to replace Scalia. That means, for at least a year, the US supreme court will almost certainly operate with eight members and, in cases of a 4-4 split, lower-court opinions will stand, leading to escalating uncertainty about the state of the law.If the 2016 elections result in the White House and Senate being held by the same party, this logjam will probably be broken fairly quickly. Attempts by a Senate minority to serially filibuster nominees would almost certainly result in the filibuster being eliminated (as it already has been for all other federal judicial appointments). But if the 2016 elections result in Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders facing a Republican Senate \u2013 as currently seems likely \u2013 all bets are off. There is no precedent for the Senate simply refusing to allow the president to fill a supreme court vacancy, but in the current partisan climate a new precedent may well be created. And whether political pressure will compel the Senate to approve some presidential nominee is unclear.The politics of replacing Scalia are difficult precisely because the consequences are so important. Depending on the results of the 2016 presidential and senatorial elections, the next person allowed to vote on the US supreme court will be similar to either Elena Kagan or John Roberts \u2013 and the stakes for the reproductive freedom of women, climate change, voting rights, civil rights, the ability of the federal government to regulate the economy and civil liberties can hardly be overstated. In a very real sense, the 2016 elections will ultimately result in the confirmation or repudiation of the jurisprudence for which Justice Scalia most prominently advocated.

Once there you can kayak on it then either hike back up or go on horseback for a small fee. The more adventurous can hike the rim of this volcanic lagoon. Trails are well-worn and easy to follow and take up to five hours to complete. The trail on the rim is, for the most part, easy and not very technical. Start your hike no later than 7.30am; clouds and rain usually come in mid-afternoon making visibility poor and temperatures quite cold. The trail is mostly sandy which makes hiking the trail very easy after a rainy night. The ultimate adventure would be to hike the three-four day Quilotoa Loop which starts in the town of Sigchos or the crater itself. The town of Quilotoa is made up primarily of hostels.

Most of them prefer it that way. American judges, by contrast, have always been different, not just because the constitutional separation of powers necessarily makes them more prominent, but also because the process of their appointment is overtly politicised. The president nominates new supreme court justices, and the Senate must confirm them.

Within hours of his death, they were arguing that the nomination should be delayed until after November\u2019s presidential election, and they will probably get their way.Yet even this explosive consequence barely touches on Scalia\u2019s extraordinary personal importance, for there has been no more influential figure in American jurisprudence in half a century. Though he was never chief justice, the court on which he sat from 1986, after his appointment by Ronald Reagan, was in a very real sense \u201cthe Scalia court\u201d. His passing is an intellectual event as well as a political one. It would not be an exaggeration to say that without understanding Scalia one cannot understand American constitutional politics of the past three decades. Related: Supreme court justice Antonin Scalia dies: legal and political worlds react Scalia was an ideological social conservative in most respects. He gave striking conservative judgments on issues such as abortion, gay equality, desegregation and capital punishment. Yet what mattered more was his sustained ability to articulate, in trenchant language, a fundamentalist doctrine about the US constitution that has been a beacon to American conservatives in the law and politics for more than a generation.In Scalia\u2019s view, the constitution should be interpreted as closely as possible to the way America\u2019s founders would have conceived it. This \u201coriginalist\u201d approach placed Scalia in outright opposition \u2014 which he often expressed in the liveliest way \u2014 to the liberal view, which saw the constitution as an evolving set of rules that could be adapted to changing values and times. To him, the constitution was close to holy writ. He was as much a believer in the truth of the US constitution as any believer in any religious book. This fundamentalism gave him a status among conservatives that in some ways rivalled that of Reagan.It made Scalia the modern era\u2019s most influential and articulate judicial apostle of non-interference, states\u2019 rights, small federal government and a weak presidency. In this position he undoubtedly shaped the thinking of many young lawyers and politicians, which is why his death will not end his influence.Scalia was also a rock-solid American exceptionalist, maintaining that the constitution was not just the original reference point for the judges, but the only one. Anyone who reads a UK supreme court judgment will find it cites rulings and judgments from not just the European courts but also, frequently, the US and other courts too. Scalia would have none of that internationalism. His jurisprudence was wholly American; only American judgments could be considered, he believed. In this he both spoke for and gave a huge boost to this exceptionalism, with immense consequences that have reached far beyond the courts.Few who ever attended a session of the court in his era could fail to notice his sharpness and judicial star-power, even if his ideology and jurisprudence were mistaken in profound ways on almost every issue.Scalia\u2019s importance and sheer interest value can hardly be exaggerated. He embodied the truth that America is, and will always be, so very different from Britain in countless ways.", "tags": ["US supreme court", "US justice system", "US news", "World news", "Law"], "title": "Antonin Scalia: the judge whose conservatism shaped America | Martin Kettle"},{"date": "2016-02-05T09:00:42Z", "content": "An odd thing about reporting on the US president\u2019s State of the Union address is that the press sit high behind him, virtually unable to see him. At this year\u2019s, Barack Obama\u2019s last, I could just about look down on the top of his head and side from a tight angle if I leaned forward on tiptoe. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst seat in the nation,\u201d said one old hand, mindful that TV viewers can see Obama up close.It\u2019s stepping into another man\u2019s shoes like a new Doctor Who.But from that vantage point you can observe the majesty of America\u2019s body politic: the military generals, the supreme court judges, the row upon row of Congressmen, some applauding enthusiastically, others sitting on their hands and scowling, others yawning or taking selfies. All, however, were pleased to hear Obama declare America the powerful nation on the planet, spending more on its military than the next eight nations combined.\u201cOur troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world,\u201d he went on. \u201cNo nation attacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that\u2019s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead - they call us.\u201dSo here I was at the Capitol in the vaunting Rome of our times, five months after being greeted in Mubuga, a remote village in Burundi, by ceremonial drummers and dancers and making a speech about what I was there to write about. The village has never had electricity so its residents must rely on candles, lanterns, firewood and charcoal. I visited many such places during six years as Africa correspondent of the Guardian; now I am based in its Washington office, a short walk from the White House.This is how it goes as a foreign correspondent, shifting from the world\u2019s poorest continent to its richest, from constant sunshine to bone-chilling cold, from roving around nations that many outside Africa would struggle to find on a map to reporting on the world\u2019s most famous politician pardon a Thanksgiving turkey. It\u2019s stepping into another man\u2019s shoes like a new Doctor Who.This particular regeneration involved two marathon flights, chasing two jetlagged toddlers around a hotel lobby at 4am and all the usual teething troubles of a new house with broken fridge and no hot water. But arriving with young kids is a good way to dive straight in rather then dwelling on the shock of the new. Washington lacks the hustling vibrancy of downtown Johannesburg but the parks, playgrounds and zoo are superb, the Smithsonian museums world class and the view of the national mall from the Lincoln memorial quite sublime.In the suburbs of Johannesburg where we lived previously, front gardens are invisible behind crime-conscious high walls; in Washington, we arrived just in time for the spectacle of Halloween, when many front gardens display pumpkins, giant spiders and skeletons and mock graveyards. In the suburbs of Johannesburg, the car is king and walking a rarity; in Washington, we are glad to be on foot, bus and underground train. Restaurants stay open later too, but dining out and hiring a babysitter is financially ruinous. Some differences come as a surprise. While the internet here is a high-speed treat, I realise that Africa is light years ahead of America in online and mobile banking. Washington has forced me to dust off those quaint items, the chequebook and the fax machine. It\u2019s like being catapulted into the 20th and 22nd centuries all at once.Professionally, certain aspects of this job are not so different from the last. Two burning issues in America are inequality and race, just as they were in South Africa. Soon after arriving in America, I reported on protests by black students spreading across university campuses, a trend shaking South Africa at almost exactly the same time. South Africa is notorious for violent crime, but 30,000 Americans are killed by guns every year. The mixed race Obama\u2019s first taste of political activism was the anti-apartheid movement while mixed race Trevor Noah, South Africa\u2019s top comedian, now hosts The Daily Show on Comedy Central. Sometimes, these countries rhyme.Indeed, whereas some African governments are the embodiment of opacity, with spokespeople who seldom return journalists\u2019 calls, America presents itself as a model of transparency with daily press conferences broadcast online and transcribed word-for-word. Yet at second glance, these briefings can often be an elaborate dance in which the spokesperson reads \u201ctalking points\u201d from a script, sprinkles a few crumbs and pleads ignorance to questions of substance. The facade of open government has been established, but what have we truly learned?Likewise, on the surface at least, an American election is regarded as a cheating and corruption-free paragon compared with several polls I covered in Africa, where the question was not who would win but how many people would die. But it should be remembered that the rival frontrunners this time are the spouse of an ex-president and a billionaire demagogue. If this scenario played out in Africa, the watchdogs would decry another tawdry case of nepotism and elitism.Indeed, while US presidents may respect term limits in a way that some African leaders still do not, the political system has its own toxic mix of disenfranchisement, donors, gerrymandering, lobbyists, spin, vested interests and Fox News. It\u2019s just that, after more than two centuries, it\u2019s more subtle and insidious than a tinpot dictator sending in the tanks. For journalists, it can be a knottier code to unravel.One of the greatest challenges for the media in this election is Donald Trump, who defies all the known laws of political physics. He has made offensive comments about women and Muslims and uttered demonstrable falsehoods, which under normal rules ought to be enough to scuttle his candidacy; instead, it only appears to make him stronger with supporters who ask, don\u2019t all politicians lie? His is a candidacy based on celebrity, and so the media are complicit in its rise; but Trump is undoubtedly news, so how can he be ignored?I met a veteran Washington correspondent the other day who said he thinks opinion polling has destroyed political journalism in America. There is an obsession with the \u201chorse race\u201d - who\u2019s up, who\u2019s down - to the detriment of understanding the candidates, their personalities and their policies. And after several recent failures, it will be intriguing to see if the pollsters are leading us up the wrong path.Unlike in Africa, I am one of many Guardian journalists in America, but as a beat it is uniquely intense. People everywhere are more or less familiar with it through film, music, television and others forms of soft power. When something happens in Syria or North Korea or Mali, the media want to know: what does Washington think, what will Washington do? I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.To support Guardian journalism and to become involved in our events and debates sign up to become a Guardian Member.", "tags": ["Membership"], "title": "Inside the Guardian: David Smith's letter from America"},{"date": "2015-10-26T10:23:04Z", "content": "It was a sun-drenched afternoon, with another autumnal heatwave cooking the concrete of Los Angeles, but Joanne Pilecki hugged her green fleece close as she stepped into a cinema foyer.\u201cI don\u2019t take the cold too well,\u201d said the 61-year-old, adjusting to the abrupt drop in temperature. \u201cI have a sweater with me all the time.\u201d Without it she would feel like an icicle by the end of The Intern, even though it was supposedly a heartwarming comedy. \u201cI\u2019m always cold.

New York City recently passed a law that will oblige nearly all shops and restaurants to keep front doors and windows shut while air conditioners are on, a response to the practice of wooing sweaty passers-by with the promise of chilled respite. Innovators are promising more efficient devices in the next decade, including one that makes and stores ice cheaply at night to cool buildings during the day, from a California firm called Ice Energy.Only now is the US waking up to the environmental cost of such massive energy consumption \u2013 and to the chilling prospect that the rest of the world may follow its example. The proportion of homes in Chinese cities with air conditioning rocketed from 8% to 70% between 1995 and 2004. US statistics are bracing. A nation with 318 million people accounting for just 4.5% of world population consumes more energy for air conditioning than the rest of the world combined. It uses more electricity for cooling than Africa, population 1.1 billion, uses for everything. Vehicle air conditioners in the US use 7bn to 10bn gallons of petrol annually. Each home with an air conditioner emits about two tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air each year, according to the US department of energy. Air conditioners employ the same operating principles as refrigerators: transfer heat from the cool interior, be it a fridge, room or building, to the relative warmth outside. This can contribute to an urban heat island effect. A study found that AC units in Phoenix, Arizona, heat the night-time air temperature outside by up to 2C which, of course, encourages residents to blast even more air conditioning to compensate. New York\u2019s subway stations bake in summer at more than 48C, partly because air-conditioned trains are pumping out heat.Freakishly hot weather across the US increases the temptation to ratchet up air conditioning, especially in California, which has endured record heat along with massive wildfires and a drought. During the summer, energy providers often implore people to reduce their use of air conditioners and other devices to avoid crashing the grid. Silicon Valley is another guzzler. The water used to cool California\u2019s estimated 800 data centres each year could fill approximately 158,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Reducing energy consumption can be tricky, according to Aaron James, a professor of philosophy and ethics at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cPeople often feel a sense of entitlement about what they have become accustomed to. So even if it wouldn\u2019t be asking much \u2013 a small behavioural change in the face of a severe problem \u2013 it can make us feel morally defensive.\u201dFilling a recycling bag that neighbours may see, for instance, can feel more important and virtuous than lowering the AC. \u201cIn the US there\u2019s not an established awareness of air conditioning as a climate change problem,\u201d said James, the author of Assholes: A Theory.Orlando in mid-August without air conditioning \u2026 Disney World would be more like Devil\u2019s IslandAir conditioning, it should be stressed, is an important economic and social technology. It saves lives. An average of 618 people in the US die each year from exposure to excessive natural heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a far cry from a century ago when heat killed thousands. It also cuts absenteeism and raises productivity. In a 1957 survey, 90% of US firms named cooled air as the single biggest boost to their productivity.Nelson Polsby, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who died in 2007, suggested air conditioning also reshaped American politics by enabling Republican pensioners to migrate to southern and western states, paving Reagan\u2019s way to the White House.\u201cAir conditioning probably did foster migration in the Sun Belt,\u201d said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cHow many people want to endure Orlando in mid-August without air conditioning? Without it, Disney World would be more like Devil\u2019s Island.\u201dThe technology also influenced the Hollywood blockbuster. In the early 20th century few braved sweltering cinemas in summer. That changed once they installed air conditioning \u2013 an innovation advertised with letters dripping with icicles. It remains a selling point to this day. AMC Theatres, the US\u2019s second largest cinema chain, keeps the temperature at 21C in winter and 23C in summer.Bar Armageddon, the technology is here to to stay, said Basile. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to go back once you\u2019ve been going forward. From a philosophical standpoint I, an air-conditioning junkie, can\u2019t tell someone they can\u2019t have it.\u201dHe feels, however, that the US overuses the technology. \u201cI noticed that cooled spaces in the UK were comfortable, but nowhere near as icy-frigid as their American counterparts.\u201dWith billions of people in warm climates wanting \u201cbearable lives\u201d, the race for efficiency is rather urgent, according to Basile.

But for those not on a tight schedule, it added to the intrigue and fascination of the trip. It also greased the wheels, as it were, of conversation with fellow passengers most of whom were remarkably sanguine about the inconvenience.Travelling any distance by train in the States is a lifestyle choice rather than a function of daily life. Consequently, the attitude was one of wry amusement rather than anger. Most were wearily chipper and enjoyed the adventure, despite the uncertainty. The only non-Americans we encountered were three Australians, including a couple from Adelaide who were on a mammoth train extravaganza around North America. They declared themselves great supporters of Amtrak and envious of the rail network.Then there was Shawna and Bobby Jo, two women who\u2019d never met before but decided to take advantage of the dining car once it emerged that their respective homeward journeys were disrupted. Bottles of Pinot Grigio and a passable steak diluted any frustration they may have felt. Bobby Jo was \u201conly\u201d going as far as Wisconsin Dells, the fifth stop en route, and would in normal circumstances have been home for Sunday evening with her family after the three-and-a-half hour journey, ready for work as a nurse on Monday morning. Not on this occasion. Shawna, also coincidentally a nurse, had a longer trip, to Grand Forks, North Dakota (one stop on from Fargo). Talk was of football, family and farming. Not for nothing are the supporters of the legendary Green Bay Packers American football team known as Cheeseheads: we were heading across the Northern Plains \u2013 dairy country far and wide. Related: Chicago prohibition-style: a city still married to the mob The train wasn\u2019t full in mid-November, but the Empire Builder maintained the policy of \u201ccommunity seating\u201d at meal times. Passengers were instructed to sit side by side with their travelling companion so one is obliged to make eye contact \u2013 and ideally conversation \u2013 with strangers. Of the six meals we had, only one was conducted in silence opposite a guy on his own who was reading. The other five were all friendly and illuminating.The two breakfasts were memorable for the locations. The first, as we crossed the Mississippi river along the state line between Wisconsin and Minnesota, was shared with a woman and her young son. The following morning, as we chugged through the spectacular Glacier National Park in Montana, we had the perfect guides to the scenery: a retired couple from Havre, Montana (population 9,700, enjoying night-time November temperatures of -18C). They were heading to Spokane to see their new grandchild. Spokane is where the Empire Builder splits for the last 300 miles or so to Seattle, or further south to Portland.They could have driven it more quickly, but given that we were on the cusp of winter in the frozen north they preferred to let the train take the strain, and enjoy the views: snow-capped mountains in the distance, rivers and lakes in the foreground with the odd bald eagle scouting for prey from an arboreal perch.

There have been wine tastings on board in the past, but given that the Empire Builder lost $34.8m in the six months to March this year, it\u2019s not hard to see why such luxuries might have been dispensed with.The accommodation was comfortable. We opted for a two-berth cabin with bunk beds and its own tiny toilet that doubles as a shower room. There are other toilets and showers on the lower deck that offer more room and comfort. The seats in coach class looked both roomy and comfortable, though the carriages had that permanent state of half-light like a teenager\u2019s bedroom, where someone was always asleep regardless of the time of day.The viewing carriage \u2013 seating upstairs, bar downstairs \u2013 was the perfect place to while away the daylight hours, scouring the vista for wildlife, marvelling at the passing landscape or just reading. There is no WiFi on the Empire Builder, which is surely just a failure to upgrade facilities rather than a deliberate attempt to come between passengers and their digital devices.This was my first long-distance train trip overseas and an experience to repeat.

It may well be a year \u2013 or several \u2013 before the Senate confirms anybody to replace Scalia, who died on Saturday at the age of 79. But that vote will almost assuredly not be unanimous, regardless of who the eventual nominee is: the politics of US supreme court appointments have become as polarized as the rest of American politics.And Scalia himself played a significant role in that very polarization.Scalia\u2019s legacy will be extensively celebrated by conservatives \u2013 Marco Rubio spoke for orthodox Republican opinion when he called Scalia one of the greatest justices in US supreme court history at Saturday\u2019s Republican debate \u2013 and derided by liberals, many of whom wasted little time celebrating his demise and speculating how his absence on the court could affect future cases.But what few political commentators note is that the foundation of his legal and political legacy does not so much stem from his majority opinions: landmark opinions, after all, tend to be written by either the chief justice or by the swing voters, like Justice Anthony Kennedy, and Scalia was neither. He certainly wrote numerous important opinions for the court (most notably the first opinion to find that the second amendment protected an individual right to bear arms in DC v Heller), but his reputation was largely based on his dissents and his remarks off the bench.More than most US supreme court justices, Scalia often wrote to be quoted by a general audience \u2013 and that style was a mixed blessing for him. Scalia was capable of very fine legal writing but, particularly as he aged, his trademark blistering zingers were too often made to mask poorly crafted arguments. (In a 2013 interview, Scalia acknowledged his own concerns about his more recent opinions: \u201cYou always wonder whether you\u2019re losing your grip and whether your current opinions are not as good as your old ones.\u201d)Scalia\u2019s style of late reflected a justice who both strongly influenced the contemporary conservative movement and in turn was heavily influenced by it. At oral argument, he was capable of both devastating arguments and of sounding like a second-string conservative talkshow host. But, at his best, Scalia defended originalism and textualism with a style and wit that could be recognized even by those who fundamentally disagreed with him. In his first decade on the court, Scalia even won some grudging admiration from liberals. Perhaps the high point of his intellectual influence across party lines was represented by his Tanner lectures at Princeton: they were published as a widely discussed book, complete with respectful response essays from prominent liberal scholars like Robert Dworkin and Laurence Tribe. And it\u2019s true that Scalia was not a strict Republican party-liner: there were some cases in which he was willing to make common cause with liberal justices out of principle. In one dissent, he (correctly) characterized the mandatory drug testing of border patrol officers as \u201ca kind of immolation of privacy and human dignity in symbolic opposition to drug use\u201d. He wrote a brilliant dissent, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, upholding the habeas corpus rights of American citizens accused of terrorist activities. And in some fourth and sixth amendment cases, he regularly voted in a civil libertarian direction.Still, these cases were the exception rather than the rule as his tenure wore on, and Scalia increasingly became a partisan lightning rod in court circles and in political circles beyond the court. No discussion of Scalia\u2019s legacy, for instance, can ignore the 2000 decision Bush v Gore, in which the court issued an essentially lawless decision awarding the presidency to the Republican candidate. Scalia did not write the opinion of the court, but he wrote the more nakedly partisan opinion that preceded it and has defended it aggressively in public ever since.Bush v Gore is an extreme example but, despite Scalia\u2019s self-presentation as America\u2019s Last Honest Judge, Scalia had a way of ignoring his self-described legal principles if they conflicted with cherished policy goals. To take one particularly critical example, the joint dissent to the 2012 US supreme court opinion largely upholding the Affordable Care Act co-authored by Scalia was so flagrantly inconsistent with Scalia\u2019s previous jurisprudence that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was able to quote his previous opinions at length in her concurrence. More importantly to some is that, had Scalia\u2019s dissents ultimately shaped America, women would not have reproductive rights, the federal government could not effectively regulate healthcare, LGBT people would not have the right to engage in sexual intercourse without fear of arrest \u2013 let alone alone the right to marry \u2013 and states could single them out for legal disabilities. Women could be excluded from state educational institutions, public schools could teach creationism in science classes and prisoners could be assaulted by prison guards. And, in large part because of Scalia, in America today, the Voting Rights Act has been gutted, the rights of employees and consumers have been curtailed, Brown v Board is more likely to be used to stop integration than to promote it and moneyed interests increasingly dominate elections.But however one evaluates his legacy, Scalia\u2019s untimely death creates a huge political issue that could well become a constitutional crisis. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has already made it clear that the Senate will not confirm anyone President Obama nominates to replace Scalia. That means, for at least a year, the US supreme court will almost certainly operate with eight members and, in cases of a 4-4 split, lower-court opinions will stand, leading to escalating uncertainty about the state of the law.If the 2016 elections result in the White House and Senate being held by the same party, this logjam will probably be broken fairly quickly. Attempts by a Senate minority to serially filibuster nominees would almost certainly result in the filibuster being eliminated (as it already has been for all other federal judicial appointments). But if the 2016 elections result in Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders facing a Republican Senate \u2013 as currently seems likely \u2013 all bets are off. There is no precedent for the Senate simply refusing to allow the president to fill a supreme court vacancy, but in the current partisan climate a new precedent may well be created. And whether political pressure will compel the Senate to approve some presidential nominee is unclear.The politics of replacing Scalia are difficult precisely because the consequences are so important. Depending on the results of the 2016 presidential and senatorial elections, the next person allowed to vote on the US supreme court will be similar to either Elena Kagan or John Roberts \u2013 and the stakes for the reproductive freedom of women, climate change, voting rights, civil rights, the ability of the federal government to regulate the economy and civil liberties can hardly be overstated. In a very real sense, the 2016 elections will ultimately result in the confirmation or repudiation of the jurisprudence for which Justice Scalia most prominently advocated.

Once there you can kayak on it then either hike back up or go on horseback for a small fee. The more adventurous can hike the rim of this volcanic lagoon. Trails are well-worn and easy to follow and take up to five hours to complete. The trail on the rim is, for the most part, easy and not very technical. Start your hike no later than 7.30am; clouds and rain usually come in mid-afternoon making visibility poor and temperatures quite cold. The trail is mostly sandy which makes hiking the trail very easy after a rainy night. The ultimate adventure would be to hike the three-four day Quilotoa Loop which starts in the town of Sigchos or the crater itself. The town of Quilotoa is made up primarily of hostels.

Most of them prefer it that way. American judges, by contrast, have always been different, not just because the constitutional separation of powers necessarily makes them more prominent, but also because the process of their appointment is overtly politicised. The president nominates new supreme court justices, and the Senate must confirm them. This goes some of the way to explaining why the death at the weekend of Justice Antonin Scalia is such a significant public event. Related: Antonin Scalia: man of his word who shaped America in life and in death Scalia\u2019s death creates a vacancy on a nine-person supreme court that has often split five to four to the conservative side in recent years; not least in the Bush\u00a0v Gore verdict in 2000 that settled the occupancy of the White House. Barack Obama now has the golden opportunity, as well as the responsibility, to put forward a more liberal nominee, but Republicans won\u2019t stand idly by. Within hours of his death, they were arguing that the nomination should be delayed until after November\u2019s presidential election, and they will probably get their way.Yet even this explosive consequence barely touches on Scalia\u2019s extraordinary personal importance, for there has been no more influential figure in American jurisprudence in half a century. Though he was never chief justice, the court on which he sat from 1986, after his appointment by Ronald Reagan, was in a very real sense \u201cthe Scalia court\u201d. His passing is an intellectual event as well as a political one. It would not be an exaggeration to say that without understanding Scalia one cannot understand American constitutional politics of the past three decades. Related: Supreme court justice Antonin Scalia dies: legal and political worlds react Scalia was an ideological social conservative in most respects. He gave striking conservative judgments on issues such as abortion, gay equality, desegregation and capital punishment. Yet what mattered more was his sustained ability to articulate, in trenchant language, a fundamentalist doctrine about the US constitution that has been a beacon to American conservatives in the law and politics for more than a generation.In Scalia\u2019s view, the constitution should be interpreted as closely as possible to the way America\u2019s founders would have conceived it. This \u201coriginalist\u201d approach placed Scalia in outright opposition \u2014 which he often expressed in the liveliest way \u2014 to the liberal view, which saw the constitution as an evolving set of rules that could be adapted to changing values and times. To him, the constitution was close to holy writ. He was as much a believer in the truth of the US constitution as any believer in any religious book. This fundamentalism gave him a status among conservatives that in some ways rivalled that of Reagan.It made Scalia the modern era\u2019s most influential and articulate judicial apostle of non-interference, states\u2019 rights, small federal government and a weak presidency. In this position he undoubtedly shaped the thinking of many young lawyers and politicians, which is why his death will not end his influence.Scalia was also a rock-solid American exceptionalist, maintaining that the constitution was not just the original reference point for the judges, but the only one. Anyone who reads a UK supreme court judgment will find it cites rulings and judgments from not just the European courts but also, frequently, the US and other courts too. Scalia would have none of that internationalism. His jurisprudence was wholly American; only American judgments could be considered, he believed. In this he both spoke for and gave a huge boost to this exceptionalism, with immense consequences that have reached far beyond the courts.Few who ever attended a session of the court in his era could fail to notice his sharpness and judicial star-power, even if his ideology and jurisprudence were mistaken in profound ways on almost every issue.Scalia\u2019s importance and sheer interest value can hardly be exaggerated. He embodied the truth that America is, and will always be, so very different from Britain in countless ways.", "tags": ["US supreme court", "US justice system", "US news", "World news", "Law"], "title": "Antonin Scalia: the judge whose conservatism shaped America | Martin Kettle"},{"date": "2016-02-05T09:00:42Z", "content": "An odd thing about reporting on the US president\u2019s State of the Union address is that the press sit high behind him, virtually unable to see him.

Washington lacks the hustling vibrancy of downtown Johannesburg but the parks, playgrounds and zoo are superb, the Smithsonian museums world class and the view of the national mall from the Lincoln memorial quite sublime.In the suburbs of Johannesburg where we lived previously, front gardens are invisible behind crime-conscious high walls; in Washington, we arrived just in time for the spectacle of Halloween, when many front gardens display pumpkins, giant spiders and skeletons and mock graveyards. In the suburbs of Johannesburg, the car is king and walking a rarity; in Washington, we are glad to be on foot, bus and underground train. Restaurants stay open later too, but dining out and hiring a babysitter is financially ruinous. Some differences come as a surprise. While the internet here is a high-speed treat, I realise that Africa is light years ahead of America in online and mobile banking. Washington has forced me to dust off those quaint items, the chequebook and the fax machine. It\u2019s like being catapulted into the 20th and 22nd centuries all at once.Professionally, certain aspects of this job are not so different from the last. Two burning issues in America are inequality and race, just as they were in South Africa. Soon after arriving in America, I reported on protests by black students spreading across university campuses, a trend shaking South Africa at almost exactly the same time. South Africa is notorious for violent crime, but 30,000 Americans are killed by guns every year. The mixed race Obama\u2019s first taste of political activism was the anti-apartheid movement while mixed race Trevor Noah, South Africa\u2019s top comedian, now hosts The Daily Show on Comedy Central. Sometimes, these countries rhyme.Indeed, whereas some African governments are the embodiment of opacity, with spokespeople who seldom return journalists\u2019 calls, America presents itself as a model of transparency with daily press conferences broadcast online and transcribed word-for-word. Yet at second glance, these briefings can often be an elaborate dance in which the spokesperson reads \u201ctalking points\u201d from a script, sprinkles a few crumbs and pleads ignorance to questions of substance. The facade of open government has been established, but what have we truly learned?Likewise, on the surface at least, an American election is regarded as a cheating and corruption-free paragon compared with several polls I covered in Africa, where the question was not who would win but how many people would die. But it should be remembered that the rival frontrunners this time are the spouse of an ex-president and a billionaire demagogue. If this scenario played out in Africa, the watchdogs would decry another tawdry case of nepotism and elitism.Indeed, while US presidents may respect term limits in a way that some African leaders still do not, the political system has its own toxic mix of disenfranchisement, donors, gerrymandering, lobbyists, spin, vested interests and Fox News. It\u2019s just that, after more than two centuries, it\u2019s more subtle and insidious than a tinpot dictator sending in the tanks. For journalists, it can be a knottier code to unravel.One of the greatest challenges for the media in this election is Donald Trump, who defies all the known laws of political physics. He has made offensive comments about women and Muslims and uttered demonstrable falsehoods, which under normal rules ought to be enough to scuttle his candidacy; instead, it only appears to make him stronger with supporters who ask, don\u2019t all politicians lie? His is a candidacy based on celebrity, and so the media are complicit in its rise; but Trump is undoubtedly news, so how can he be ignored?I met a veteran Washington correspondent the other day who said he thinks opinion polling has destroyed political journalism in America. There is an obsession with the \u201chorse race\u201d - who\u2019s up, who\u2019s down - to the detriment of understanding the candidates, their personalities and their policies. And after several recent failures, it will be intriguing to see if the pollsters are leading us up the wrong path.Unlike in Africa, I am one of many Guardian journalists in America, but as a beat it is uniquely intense. People everywhere are more or less familiar with it through film, music, television and others forms of soft power. When something happens in Syria or North Korea or Mali, the media want to know: what does Washington think, what will Washington do? I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else.To support Guardian journalism and to become involved in our events and debates sign up to become a Guardian Member.", "tags": ["Membership"], "title": "Inside the Guardian: David Smith's letter from America"},{"date": "2015-10-26T10:23:04Z", "content": "It was a sun-drenched afternoon, with another autumnal heatwave cooking the concrete of Los Angeles, but Joanne Pilecki hugged her green fleece close as she stepped into a cinema foyer.\u201cI don\u2019t take the cold too well,\u201d said the 61-year-old, adjusting to the abrupt drop in temperature. \u201cI have a sweater with me all the time.\u201d Without it she would feel like an icicle by the end of The Intern, even though it was supposedly a heartwarming comedy. \u201cI\u2019m always cold. On planes I bring my own blankets.\u201d Other cinema-goers, in contrast, came precisely because it was cool, said Cerise Cobbs, who was manning the ticket booth at the Third Street Promenade shopping centre in Santa Monica. \u201cFolks who don\u2019t have good air con at home come, especially at weekends \u2013 they say they\u2019ve got to get out of the house.\u201d Related: World set to use more energy for cooling than heating Too hot, too cold, just right \u2013 Americans may differ over where to set the dial but they agree air conditioning is integral to modern life.It is ubiquitous, whirring in homes, offices, stores, schools, elevators, factories, cars, trains, gyms, stadiums, tunnels, a communion of cool stretching from California to New York. \u201cIt\u2019s made its way into American life,\u201d said Salvatore Basile, author of Cool: How Air Conditioning Changed Everything. \u201cThis idea for millennia that God made hot weather so you should put up with it \u2013 that attitude has relaxed.\u201dBut with the vertiginous rise of the \u201ccold economy\u201d \u2013 and the energy it demands \u2013 becoming more and more visible, there is finally a growing awareness of the problem in the US. New York City recently passed a law that will oblige nearly all shops and restaurants to keep front doors and windows shut while air conditioners are on, a response to the practice of wooing sweaty passers-by with the promise of chilled respite. Innovators are promising more efficient devices in the next decade, including one that makes and stores ice cheaply at night to cool buildings during the day, from a California firm called Ice Energy.Only now is the US waking up to the environmental cost of such massive energy consumption \u2013 and to the chilling prospect that the rest of the world may follow its example. The proportion of homes in Chinese cities with air conditioning rocketed from 8% to 70% between 1995 and 2004. US statistics are bracing. A nation with 318 million people accounting for just 4.5% of world population consumes more energy for air conditioning than the rest of the world combined. It uses more electricity for cooling than Africa, population 1.1 billion, uses for everything. Vehicle air conditioners in the US use 7bn to 10bn gallons of petrol annually. Each home with an air conditioner emits about two tonnes of carbon dioxide into the air each year, according to the US department of energy. Air conditioners employ the same operating principles as refrigerators: transfer heat from the cool interior, be it a fridge, room or building, to the relative warmth outside. This can contribute to an urban heat island effect. A study found that AC units in Phoenix, Arizona, heat the night-time air temperature outside by up to 2C which, of course, encourages residents to blast even more air conditioning to compensate. New York\u2019s subway stations bake in summer at more than 48C, partly because air-conditioned trains are pumping out heat.Freakishly hot weather across the US increases the temptation to ratchet up air conditioning, especially in California, which has endured record heat along with massive wildfires and a drought. During the summer, energy providers often implore people to reduce their use of air conditioners and other devices to avoid crashing the grid. Silicon Valley is another guzzler. The water used to cool California\u2019s estimated 800 data centres each year could fill approximately 158,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Reducing energy consumption can be tricky, according to Aaron James, a professor of philosophy and ethics at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cPeople often feel a sense of entitlement about what they have become accustomed to. So even if it wouldn\u2019t be asking much \u2013 a small behavioural change in the face of a severe problem \u2013 it can make us feel morally defensive.\u201dFilling a recycling bag that neighbours may see, for instance, can feel more important and virtuous than lowering the AC. \u201cIn the US there\u2019s not an established awareness of air conditioning as a climate change problem,\u201d said James, the author of Assholes: A Theory.Orlando in mid-August without air conditioning \u2026 Disney World would be more like Devil\u2019s IslandAir conditioning, it should be stressed, is an important economic and social technology. It saves lives. An average of 618 people in the US die each year from exposure to excessive natural heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a far cry from a century ago when heat killed thousands. It also cuts absenteeism and raises productivity. In a 1957 survey, 90% of US firms named cooled air as the single biggest boost to their productivity.Nelson Polsby, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, who died in 2007, suggested air conditioning also reshaped American politics by enabling Republican pensioners to migrate to southern and western states, paving Reagan\u2019s way to the White House.\u201cAir conditioning probably did foster migration in the Sun Belt,\u201d said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cHow many people want to endure Orlando in mid-August without air conditioning? Without it, Disney World would be more like Devil\u2019s Island.\u201dThe technology also influenced the Hollywood blockbuster. In the early 20th century few braved sweltering cinemas in summer. That changed once they installed air conditioning \u2013 an innovation advertised with letters dripping with icicles. It remains a selling point to this day. AMC Theatres, the US\u2019s second largest cinema chain, keeps the temperature at 21C in winter and 23C in summer.Bar Armageddon, the technology is here to to stay, said Basile. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to go back once you\u2019ve been going forward. From a philosophical standpoint I, an air-conditioning junkie, can\u2019t tell someone they can\u2019t have it.\u201dHe feels, however, that the US overuses the technology. \u201cI noticed that cooled spaces in the UK were comfortable, but nowhere near as icy-frigid as their American counterparts.\u201dWith billions of people in warm climates wanting \u201cbearable lives\u201d, the race for efficiency is rather urgent, according to Basile. He is optimistic. \u201cWe will get more bang for our buck.\u201d", "tags": ["Energy", "Environment", "US news", "Climate change", "Climate change", "Cop 20: UN climate change conference | Lima", "Global climate talks", "Science", "World news"], "title": "How America became addicted to air conditioning"},{"date": "2016-01-29T17:39:45Z", "content": "Many women across Latin America have been advised to avoid pregnancy amid fears that the rapidly spreading Zika virus may cause severe brain defects in unborn babies.

Related: The People v OJ Simpson: American Crime Story True crime series such as The Jinx and Making a Murderer are some of the hottest things on TV (and on Reddit as well) and this excavation of the OJ Simpson case lands square in the middle of that zeitgeist. ESPN should rush it out now, after its premiere at the Sundance film festival, rather than waiting until June to air it in five installments. It risks eclipse by FX\u2019s The People vs OJ Simpson: American Crime Story, which debuts early next month. An outcropping of ESPN\u2019s 30 for 30 documentary series, this nearly eight-hour examination of one America\u2019s greatest sports stars and most notorious celebrities is absolutely fascinating. The structure is chronological, charting Simpson\u2019s tough start in San Francisco, his Heisman trophy and NFL glory, his Hollywood heyday and his descent into violence and depravity. One of his defense lawyers calls his story a great American tragedy and this film certainly makes a compelling case for that. Not only is it the story of a man; it is also of a country obsessed with race, success at all costs, celebrity and redemption. True crime fans will most enjoy the last three episodes, which examine Simpson\u2019s relationship with and the death of his wife, Nicole, the famous Bronco chase, and of course the trial. The fourth episode picks apart the defense strategy, the prosecution\u2019s blunders, and the racial and economic factors at play in his eventual acquittal. Even for those of us who were glued to the television during the case, this re-examination with more than two decades of hindsight and perspective is absolutely vital. Film-maker Ezra Edelman, a Sundance veteran and longtime producer on Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel, talks to all the key players in Simpson\u2019s life \u2013 though not the man himself or his family members \u2013 and gets the real story. After so much time and with Simpson serving 33 years in prison for armed robbery \u2013 the subject of episode five \u2013 no one has anything to lose. This leads to shocking realizations about the infamous case (the reason the glove didn\u2019t fit was because Simpson stopped taking his arthritis medication, just in case they asked him to try it on) and about the man himself. Edelman\u2019s approach isn\u2019t necessarily artful: there are not nearly as many shots of rusting cars as there are in Making a Murderer. But his straightforward and even-handed approach lets the audience come to its own conclusions. Simpson\u2019s success and downfall seem simple but this impeccably journalistic approach draws out the complexities, as the story deserves. Edelman seems evenhanded and sympathies drift to and from Simpson more times than he ran up and down the gridiron. The result is captivating and binge-worthy. Edelman churns suspense out of a story we all know. Love it or hate it, OJ Simpson is going get everyone talking again. And so will ESPN.If all of its long-form documentaries are going to be this good, it is going to be absolutely vital viewing for both fans of sports and casual viewers.

Faerman denies any wrongdoing.The British engineering group is currently cooperating with Brazilian authorities investigating alleged corruption at Petrobras and its contractors. Earlier this year, allegations emerged that Rolls-Royce had paid bribes to Petrobras executives and politicians via its agent in exchange for a $100m (\u00a367.7m) contract with the oil company.The allegations against Rolls-Royce form part of a widespread, multibillion-dollar scandal that has engulfed Petrobras and other major Brazilian and foreign companies. The scandal, which continues to unfold, has had a profound impact on Brazil\u2019s economy and political landscape.The prosecutors behind Operation Black Blood have charged 12 individuals, including Faerman and his business partner, for their alleged participation in a long-running bribery scheme between Petrobras and one of its major contractors, SBM Offshore, which builds specialist ships for the oil and gas industry. Faerman, a former sales agent for SBM in Brazil, was allegedly involved in arranging multimillion-dollar bribes for the Dutch company. Payments of at least $46m were made via Swiss bank accounts, acccording to a statement from federal prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro.Senior SBM executives, including its current chief executive, are among those charged, as well as former Petrobras executives such as Pedro Barusco, who has alleged in testimony that he received bribes from Rolls-Royce.Rolls-Royce declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about its relationship with Faerman. Echoing previous statements about allegations in Brazil, a spokesman said the company has \u201crepeatedly made clear it will not tolerate business misconduct of any kind\u201d.He said: \u201cWe have confirmed that we are cooperating with investigating authorities in Brazil, but are unable to comment further on the nature of that co-operation.\u201dIn an email, Faerman told the Guardian he has \u201cnot committed any irregularity related to Rolls-Royce\u2019s activities in Brazil\u201d. He said he was unable to comment on the SBM case because of a plea bargain he had signed with the Brazilian authorities. He declined to comment on a report in the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper before Christmas that said he had admitted to paying bribes in the SBM case and been ordered to pay back $54m.The latest development comes as Rolls-Royce is also still under criminal investigation in the UK over bribery allegations in Asia. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched its investigation in December 2013. Three months later, Rolls-Royce said it was also cooperating with investigators at the US Department of Justice.The Guardian understands that the SFO met Brazilian prosecutors earlier this year in connection with the Petrobras affair. The SFO has previously indicated the investigation concerns a number of Rolls-Royce devisions, but declined to comment on whether it is now considering the group\u2019s activities in Brazil. Rolls-Royce is currently undergoing company-wide upheaval after a series of profit warnings over the past two years. Earlier this month, Warren East, who became chief executive in July, ordered a drastic restructuring of the group in an effort to cut costs.In Brazil, the sprawling investigation into the Petrobras affair, known as Operation Car Wash, intensified in December when federal police conducted 53 raids across seven states, including senior politicians\u2019 residences. About 30 foreign companies are believed to be under investigation. Responding to the charges against its senior executives, SBM said in a statement there were \u201cno impediments\u201d to either continuing in their roles. \u201cWe have no doubts regarding the integrity of both,\u201d the company said. In July, the Guardian reported that SBM would receive \u00a334m worth of financial support from the UK\u2019s export finance agency despite its involvement in the scandal. The significant financial support will go towards one of SBM\u2019s flagship oil projects in Brazil.

In Brazil, having sex with girls under 18 is still considered something to be proud of.\u201dWe start very simply, perhaps by asking a boy: do you think that girls should be allowed to play sports?This attitude is encouraged across the media, on television shows and in music, he says. \u201cMany brega, sertanejo and funk songs, which are widely disseminated all over the country by broadcasters and through the internet, include references to girls under 18 as sexual objects, strengthening gender prejudices and macho attitudes.\u201d For the study, researchers asked men why they wanted to marry much younger women. \u201cA man marrying an adolescent can \u2018feel younger\u2019 and is considered by other men as a \u2018lucky man\u2019 and this is accompanied by the fact that he is usually the financial provider in the marriage so he has more decision-making power and can have more control over his spouse,\u201d says Sinesi. \u201cThe lack of financial dependency can lead the young spouse to accept submission and, in some cases, violence.\u201dHe links such attitudes to the high rates of sexual violence against girls and women in Brazil; the Forum of Public Security recorded 42,000 cases of rape in 2014, conceding that the true figure was likely to be 10 times higher. To build a picture of child marriage in Brazil, Plan, Promundo and the University of Par\u00e1 interviewed married girls \u2013 and men \u2013 in the states where rates are highest \u2013 northern Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o. Their report, the first study of its kind in Brazil (She goes with me in my boat), shone a light on a hidden problem; it found that in Brazil violence at home and teenage pregnancy were main factors driving girls into early marriage, and a lack of opportunities led some to see marriage as a \u201cleast worst\u201d alternative.But how do you challenge the male attitudes that are part of the problem? Start young, says Sinesi, citing Plan\u2019s research among boys and girls aged 6-13 that showed wide discrepancies between the number of boys and girls taking part in activities outside the house and between boys and girls doing housework.\u201cWe start very simply, perhaps by asking a boy: do you think that girls should be allowed to play sports?\u201d he says. \u201cThen, we help them to see that their attitudes are not natural \u2013 they are a social construct.\u201d  Related: Buenos Aires: bringing public services to the 'invisible' slums Sinesi and his team work with boys and girls in the north-eastern states of Maranh\u00e3o, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco and Bahia, reaching some 9,500 boys directly in a year through workshops and seminars. One challenge is that boys may fear being isolated if they break from the norm. \u201cIn the classroom, you are expected to be a playboy. It is common to play the Don Juan and if you don\u2019t behave this way, you may be left out.\u201d One 16-year-old sexually harassed his teacher before taking part in workshops that showed him, \u201chis attitudes were not \u2018natural\u2019, as he had thought\u201d. Plan also runs community football projects and invites fathers to watch their daughters doing sports to challenge the notion that they are fragile and need to stay at home. In Brazil, publication of the report in July has renewed debate on its national education plan, which bans discussion of sexuality and gender norms in the classroom. Proposals to bring such topics into the classroom have met resistance from religious groups and politicians \u2013 an impasse Sinesi hopes to break. \u201cWe have to show boys and girls that marriage is one possibility but not the only one. If you invest in studies, in education, in training, in sport and in culture, you will have other possibilities. But it is important that the choice is individual. We do not want to \u2026 ban marriage because that is not going to reduce the number of early unions. We think that if we had more possibilities of education, training and more information, there would be far fewer marriages of adolescents,\u201d he told Epoca magazine earlier this year. \u201cIt is fundamental to include boys and men in this discussion. Without them, we are not going to make progress. The boys of today will be the men of tomorrow and they might be interested in younger women \u2026 you can see that when a boy takes part in workshops about gender inequality, he changes his posture and becomes more conscious of his role in a more respectful way. \u201cThat is why we need to take this into schools.\u201d Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

Faerman denies any wrongdoing.The British engineering group is currently cooperating with Brazilian authorities investigating alleged corruption at Petrobras and its contractors. Earlier this year, allegations emerged that Rolls-Royce had paid bribes to Petrobras executives and politicians via its agent in exchange for a $100m (\u00a367.7m) contract with the oil company.The allegations against Rolls-Royce form part of a widespread, multibillion-dollar scandal that has engulfed Petrobras and other major Brazilian and foreign companies. The scandal, which continues to unfold, has had a profound impact on Brazil\u2019s economy and political landscape.The prosecutors behind Operation Black Blood have charged 12 individuals, including Faerman and his business partner, for their alleged participation in a long-running bribery scheme between Petrobras and one of its major contractors, SBM Offshore, which builds specialist ships for the oil and gas industry. Faerman, a former sales agent for SBM in Brazil, was allegedly involved in arranging multimillion-dollar bribes for the Dutch company. Payments of at least $46m were made via Swiss bank accounts, acccording to a statement from federal prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro.Senior SBM executives, including its current chief executive, are among those charged, as well as former Petrobras executives such as Pedro Barusco, who has alleged in testimony that he received bribes from Rolls-Royce.Rolls-Royce declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about its relationship with Faerman. Echoing previous statements about allegations in Brazil, a spokesman said the company has \u201crepeatedly made clear it will not tolerate business misconduct of any kind\u201d.He said: \u201cWe have confirmed that we are cooperating with investigating authorities in Brazil, but are unable to comment further on the nature of that co-operation.\u201dIn an email, Faerman told the Guardian he has \u201cnot committed any irregularity related to Rolls-Royce\u2019s activities in Brazil\u201d. He said he was unable to comment on the SBM case because of a plea bargain he had signed with the Brazilian authorities. He declined to comment on a report in the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper before Christmas that said he had admitted to paying bribes in the SBM case and been ordered to pay back $54m.The latest development comes as Rolls-Royce is also still under criminal investigation in the UK over bribery allegations in Asia. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched its investigation in December 2013. Three months later, Rolls-Royce said it was also cooperating with investigators at the US Department of Justice.The Guardian understands that the SFO met Brazilian prosecutors earlier this year in connection with the Petrobras affair. The SFO has previously indicated the investigation concerns a number of Rolls-Royce devisions, but declined to comment on whether it is now considering the group\u2019s activities in Brazil. Rolls-Royce is currently undergoing company-wide upheaval after a series of profit warnings over the past two years. Earlier this month, Warren East, who became chief executive in July, ordered a drastic restructuring of the group in an effort to cut costs.In Brazil, the sprawling investigation into the Petrobras affair, known as Operation Car Wash, intensified in December when federal police conducted 53 raids across seven states, including senior politicians\u2019 residences. About 30 foreign companies are believed to be under investigation. Responding to the charges against its senior executives, SBM said in a statement there were \u201cno impediments\u201d to either continuing in their roles. \u201cWe have no doubts regarding the integrity of both,\u201d the company said. In July, the Guardian reported that SBM would receive \u00a334m worth of financial support from the UK\u2019s export finance agency despite its involvement in the scandal. The significant financial support will go towards one of SBM\u2019s flagship oil projects in Brazil.

It covers information about drugs (existing types, effects, how to identify them); how to make safe and responsible choices as well as a variety of other topics, including drug laws and how to resist peer pressure. It\u2019s important to emphasise that education doesn\u2019t stop with the children either. Parents are also included in the programme, and are taught how to help their children cope with pressures and protect children from violence.A key objective of PROERD is to establish the role of the military police in drug prevention and violence and the role of the community in supporting the police in these efforts.

For Sinesi, an Italian native who has lived in Brazil for 13 years and is based in the north-eastern state of Maranh\u00e3o, challenging gender norms among young boys is the first step to tackling the inequality that underpins a raft of social problems.These include child marriage, the current focus of Plan\u2019s advocacy work in Latin America, including Brazil, where until recently the phenomenon had rarely been discussed, despite the country ranking fourth in the world in terms of the absolute numbers of girls who are married or cohabiting by age 15.

We also contribute by enhancing their capacity to manage the project and to measure progress and results.Our community relations team monitors the project by participating in the PROERD classes, as well as by joining the graduation events and analysing the regular report results.The PROERD curriculum is organised into 10 weekly classroom-based lessons and is applied twice a year in public and private schools of the Catal\u00e3o, Ouvidor, Goiandira, Nova Aurora Anhanguera, Cumari, Davin\u00f3polis and Tr\u00eas Ranchos municipalities.Classes are run by police officers who aim to educate students about the harmful consequences of involvement with drugs, with the help of teaching resources, audio-visuals and case studies. It covers information about drugs (existing types, effects, how to identify them); how to make safe and responsible choices as well as a variety of other topics, including drug laws and how to resist peer pressure. It\u2019s important to emphasise that education doesn\u2019t stop with the children either. Parents are also included in the programme, and are taught how to help their children cope with pressures and protect children from violence.A key objective of PROERD is to establish the role of the military police in drug prevention and violence and the role of the community in supporting the police in these efforts.

For Sinesi, an Italian native who has lived in Brazil for 13 years and is based in the north-eastern state of Maranh\u00e3o, challenging gender norms among young boys is the first step to tackling the inequality that underpins a raft of social problems.These include child marriage, the current focus of Plan\u2019s advocacy work in Latin America, including Brazil, where until recently the phenomenon had rarely been discussed, despite the country ranking fourth in the world in terms of the absolute numbers of girls who are married or cohabiting by age 15.  Related: In 155 countries women still face legal discrimination. The consequences are huge Plan was involved in the campaign leading to the recent decision in Guatemala to ban marriage under 18, part of efforts to combat child marriage in Latin America and the Caribbean, the only region where the phenomenon is not declining. According to the latest Brazilian census, in 2010, just over 88,000 girls and boys (aged 10-14) were in unions categorised as consensual, civil or religious. Around 877,000 women (11%) between 20-24 reported having been married by age 15. A culture that strongly sexualises adolescent girls partly accounts for the high prevalence of early marriage in Brazil, says Sinesi. \u201cIn research by our partner [gender equality organisation] Promundo in Rio de Janeiro, 14% of men interviewed declared that at least once they had paid to have sex with girls between 12 and 17; 45% of them said they did it to feel younger and more masculine. In Brazil, having sex with girls under 18 is still considered something to be proud of.\u201dWe start very simply, perhaps by asking a boy: do you think that girls should be allowed to play sports?This attitude is encouraged across the media, on television shows and in music, he says. \u201cMany brega, sertanejo and funk songs, which are widely disseminated all over the country by broadcasters and through the internet, include references to girls under 18 as sexual objects, strengthening gender prejudices and macho attitudes.\u201d For the study, researchers asked men why they wanted to marry much younger women. \u201cA man marrying an adolescent can \u2018feel younger\u2019 and is considered by other men as a \u2018lucky man\u2019 and this is accompanied by the fact that he is usually the financial provider in the marriage so he has more decision-making power and can have more control over his spouse,\u201d says Sinesi. \u201cThe lack of financial dependency can lead the young spouse to accept submission and, in some cases, violence.\u201dHe links such attitudes to the high rates of sexual violence against girls and women in Brazil; the Forum of Public Security recorded 42,000 cases of rape in 2014, conceding that the true figure was likely to be 10 times higher. To build a picture of child marriage in Brazil, Plan, Promundo and the University of Par\u00e1 interviewed married girls \u2013 and men \u2013 in the states where rates are highest \u2013 northern Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o. Their report, the first study of its kind in Brazil (She goes with me in my boat), shone a light on a hidden problem; it found that in Brazil violence at home and teenage pregnancy were main factors driving girls into early marriage, and a lack of opportunities led some to see marriage as a \u201cleast worst\u201d alternative.But how do you challenge the male attitudes that are part of the problem? Start young, says Sinesi, citing Plan\u2019s research among boys and girls aged 6-13 that showed wide discrepancies between the number of boys and girls taking part in activities outside the house and between boys and girls doing housework.\u201cWe start very simply, perhaps by asking a boy: do you think that girls should be allowed to play sports?\u201d he says. \u201cThen, we help them to see that their attitudes are not natural \u2013 they are a social construct.\u201d  Related: Buenos Aires: bringing public services to the 'invisible' slums Sinesi and his team work with boys and girls in the north-eastern states of Maranh\u00e3o, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco and Bahia, reaching some 9,500 boys directly in a year through workshops and seminars. One challenge is that boys may fear being isolated if they break from the norm. \u201cIn the classroom, you are expected to be a playboy. It is common to play the Don Juan and if you don\u2019t behave this way, you may be left out.\u201d One 16-year-old sexually harassed his teacher before taking part in workshops that showed him, \u201chis attitudes were not \u2018natural\u2019, as he had thought\u201d. Plan also runs community football projects and invites fathers to watch their daughters doing sports to challenge the notion that they are fragile and need to stay at home. In Brazil, publication of the report in July has renewed debate on its national education plan, which bans discussion of sexuality and gender norms in the classroom. Proposals to bring such topics into the classroom have met resistance from religious groups and politicians \u2013 an impasse Sinesi hopes to break. \u201cWe have to show boys and girls that marriage is one possibility but not the only one. If you invest in studies, in education, in training, in sport and in culture, you will have other possibilities. But it is important that the choice is individual. We do not want to \u2026 ban marriage because that is not going to reduce the number of early unions. We think that if we had more possibilities of education, training and more information, there would be far fewer marriages of adolescents,\u201d he told Epoca magazine earlier this year. \u201cIt is fundamental to include boys and men in this discussion. Without them, we are not going to make progress. The boys of today will be the men of tomorrow and they might be interested in younger women \u2026 you can see that when a boy takes part in workshops about gender inequality, he changes his posture and becomes more conscious of his role in a more respectful way. \u201cThat is why we need to take this into schools.\u201d Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.

Faerman denies any wrongdoing.The British engineering group is currently cooperating with Brazilian authorities investigating alleged corruption at Petrobras and its contractors. Earlier this year, allegations emerged that Rolls-Royce had paid bribes to Petrobras executives and politicians via its agent in exchange for a $100m (\u00a367.7m) contract with the oil company.The allegations against Rolls-Royce form part of a widespread, multibillion-dollar scandal that has engulfed Petrobras and other major Brazilian and foreign companies. The scandal, which continues to unfold, has had a profound impact on Brazil\u2019s economy and political landscape.The prosecutors behind Operation Black Blood have charged 12 individuals, including Faerman and his business partner, for their alleged participation in a long-running bribery scheme between Petrobras and one of its major contractors, SBM Offshore, which builds specialist ships for the oil and gas industry. Faerman, a former sales agent for SBM in Brazil, was allegedly involved in arranging multimillion-dollar bribes for the Dutch company. Payments of at least $46m were made via Swiss bank accounts, acccording to a statement from federal prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro.Senior SBM executives, including its current chief executive, are among those charged, as well as former Petrobras executives such as Pedro Barusco, who has alleged in testimony that he received bribes from Rolls-Royce.Rolls-Royce declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about its relationship with Faerman. Echoing previous statements about allegations in Brazil, a spokesman said the company has \u201crepeatedly made clear it will not tolerate business misconduct of any kind\u201d.He said: \u201cWe have confirmed that we are cooperating with investigating authorities in Brazil, but are unable to comment further on the nature of that co-operation.\u201dIn an email, Faerman told the Guardian he has \u201cnot committed any irregularity related to Rolls-Royce\u2019s activities in Brazil\u201d. He said he was unable to comment on the SBM case because of a plea bargain he had signed with the Brazilian authorities. He declined to comment on a report in the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper before Christmas that said he had admitted to paying bribes in the SBM case and been ordered to pay back $54m.The latest development comes as Rolls-Royce is also still under criminal investigation in the UK over bribery allegations in Asia. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched its investigation in December 2013. Three months later, Rolls-Royce said it was also cooperating with investigators at the US Department of Justice.The Guardian understands that the SFO met Brazilian prosecutors earlier this year in connection with the Petrobras affair. The SFO has previously indicated the investigation concerns a number of Rolls-Royce devisions, but declined to comment on whether it is now considering the group\u2019s activities in Brazil. Rolls-Royce is currently undergoing company-wide upheaval after a series of profit warnings over the past two years. Earlier this month, Warren East, who became chief executive in July, ordered a drastic restructuring of the group in an effort to cut costs.In Brazil, the sprawling investigation into the Petrobras affair, known as Operation Car Wash, intensified in December when federal police conducted 53 raids across seven states, including senior politicians\u2019 residences. About 30 foreign companies are believed to be under investigation. Responding to the charges against its senior executives, SBM said in a statement there were \u201cno impediments\u201d to either continuing in their roles. \u201cWe have no doubts regarding the integrity of both,\u201d the company said. In July, the Guardian reported that SBM would receive \u00a334m worth of financial support from the UK\u2019s export finance agency despite its involvement in the scandal. The significant financial support will go towards one of SBM\u2019s flagship oil projects in Brazil.

The question was deemed to be controversial, leftist and feminist.Only 397 of Brazil\u2019s 5,565 municipalities have specialised police stations to deal with crimes against women, so those registering sexual assaults must often speak to male police officers who might be unprepared to deal with such crimes. Victim-blaming is not unusual, either; the official police website recommends that women do not walk alone on badly lit streets as a prevention against attacks.Think Olga was created by Juliana de Faria, a journalist from S\u00e3o Paulo who created #ChegaDeFiuFiu (no more catcalls), another game-changing action that put the issue of street harassment on the public\u2019s radar.An online survey of 8,000 women and girls conducted by the Think Olga NGO found that 98% of respondents had suffered some form of harassment. The research also found that 90% of respondents have changed their outfits before leaving the house because they feared harassment, and 81% have given up doing something or going somewhere for the same reason.In response to the findings, Think Olga started an online campaign to educate men and women about street harassment and how it impacts women\u2019s day-to-day lives. \u201cThe first step was to make society see catcalls as a problem, so we could collectively find a solution,\u201d says De Faria.

Related: Death by 1,000 defamations: Brazil riven by slow-burn impeachment struggle After months of jockeying, the removal proceedings were pushed forward by her political nemesis \u2013 the lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha \u2013 as Brazil slipped deeper into a crisis that has hamstrung decision-making even while the economy suffers its worst downturn since the Great Depression.On Wednesday night, Cunha finally gave the green light to an opposition motion for the country\u2019s first female president to be ejected from office on allegations that she broke fiscal laws by window dressing government accounts ahead of her re-election last year.Rousseff came out fighting. \u201cI have received with indignation the decision by the head of the lower chamber to [launch] the impeachment process,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no wrongful act committed by me, nor are there any suspicions that I have misused public money.\u201d In a televised address to the nation, Rousseff expressed her \u201coutrage\u201d at Cunha\u2019s decision and said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by her. \u201cI\u2019ve committed no illicit act, there is no suspicion hanging over me of any misuse of public money,\u201d the president said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any offshore bank accounts, I have no hidden assets.\u201d Her comment was a direct jab at Cunha, who has been charged with taking millions in bribes in connection to a kickbacks scheme that has embroiled state-run oil company Petrobras. Activists from the ruling Workers Party accuse Cunha and his supporters of plotting a coup.Earlier this year, Cunha acknowledged that an impeachment, which would be the first since 1992, would be a \u201cbackwards step for democracy\u201d. For months, he has sat on more than half a dozen previous opposition proposals to remove an elected head of state who has served only one year of her four-year mandate.However, he has changed his tone as his own position has come under threat. Julius Camargo, one of the whistleblowers in the Lava Jato investigation into corruption at Petrobras, has testified that the Cunha asked him for a $5m bribe \u2013 a claim that the speaker denies. As pressure on Cunha mounted on Wednesday, he finally accepted a case lodged by opposition lawyers H\u00e9lio Bicudo, Miguel Reale and Jana\u00edna Paschoal. It appeared at least partly motivated by self-defence, coming just hours after lawmakers the Workers Party ethics committee announced plans to seek his dismissal on grounds of corruption.Cunha dismissed the idea that his decision was motivated by personal or political reasons. \u201cThe basis of this [impeachment proceeding] is purely technical,\u201d he claimed.On his Facebook page, he wrote that he was responding to the demands of anti-government protests earlier this year. \u201cThe demonstrations that took place throughout Brazil \u2013 on March 15, April 12 and August 16 \u2013 were not in vain!\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe [impeachment] process will be followed by the entire population.\u201dTo proceed, the removal proposal needs the support of at least two-thirds of the deputies, or 342 of the 513 votes in the lower house.If that is successful, Rousseff will have to hand over power to vice-president, Michel Temer \u2013 who is from the same Democratic Movement party (PMDB) as Cunha \u2013 for several months while an inquiry is conducted by the senate. A final decision would then have to be approved by a two-thirds majority in the upper house.Rousseff, who won a narrow but uncontested mandate, may have the votes needed to remain in power, but the escalation of conflict between two of the country\u2019s most powerful figures looks set to worsen the already gloomy outlook for Brazil. Luciano Dias, a political consultant at the Brasilia-based Analise Politica firm, said: \u201cThe chances of President Rousseff being impeached aren\u2019t as big as politicians say now, despite this bold move by Cunha.\u201d\u201cThey are not insignificant, but they are not huge.\u201dThe impeachment debate adds to an already long list of problems for the president: the worst scandal in the country\u2019s history, popularity ratings that have slumped into single digits and a worsening recession.

Flat La Mancha gives way to mountainous Extremadura and then comes the sea in Andaluc\u00eda. The birdwatching is fantastic: on my way down south this time, I saw storks, vultures, eagles and the odd falcon sitting on a pole.I was also reminded of how noisy we are. At a road restaurant in Almaraz, I could barely make myself heard when asking for the key to the toilet. Yes, cliches can make sense: Spaniards are lively and stubborn; they like to make their point sometimes simply by yelling.We all like to think our own country is distinct, but over the past few days, Spain has felt different from the rest of Europe.Our big event takes place on Christmas Eve, Nochebuena, when families gather together to eat and celebrate after the king\u2019s speech at 9pm. This Nochebuena, 40 years after Franco\u2019s death, Felipe VI decided to talk for the first time from the royal palace in central Madrid. The sumptous palace has remained uninhabited since 14 April 1931, when Felipe\u2019s great-grandfather Alfonso XIII was forced to leave the country after the Republican victory in the elections.The king\u2019s decision only added to the extraordinary times that we have been living through. For the past four years of conservative rule, change has been in the air and last weekend citizens stamped change firmly on their votes. The elections dealt a severe blow to bipartidismo, the system that has prevailed since Franco\u2019s death, with the conservative Partido Popular (PP) and socialist Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (PSOE) taking turns to govern.Last Sunday, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy won the greatest number of votes but lost his parliamentary majority. His PP, which just four years ago won a landslide victory, lost more than 3\u00a0million votes, securing only 28% of those cast. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, PSOE\u2019s leader, lost more than a million votes, although it\u2019s been only 18 months since he replaced Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba, the new face in theory replacing the old guard. S\u00e1nchez, however, won only 21% of the vote.Where did those million of \u201clost\u201d votes go? To the left, with Podemos, where pony-tailed Pablo Iglesias, a 37-year-old political scientist, took more than 20% of the vote. And to the centre, with Ciudadanos, where baby-faced Albert Rivera, a 36-year-old Catalan lawyer, ended up in fourth place with nearly 14% of the vote.Why has this happened? A key reason is that PP and PSOE represent a way of doing politics that many Spaniards now deem obsolete and at the root of many of the country\u2019s ills, including chronic corruption. Rajoy\u2019s shaky political standing is also, of course, down to austerity. But it can\u2019t explain S\u00e1nchez\u2019s poor results: he has not been governing, or even leading, his party for most of the past four years.Podemos, a heir of the social protests that swept Spain from May 2011, was founded by a group of university professors, with origins on the far left. But its charismatic leader, Iglesias, has worked hard in the past months to drive Podemos into the mainstream, and he will have a lot to say in my country\u2019s future. He is smart and ambitious, and has learned from what went right and wrong for Syriza in Greece.Ciudadanos is business-friendly and anti-corruption. But, according to a tall tale that\u2019s being put around, big companies (the Ibex 35, the Spanish stock exchange) funded Rivera to stop Podemos taking the whole of the protest vote. The rumour worked well and Ciudadanos failed to meet expectations. Rivera, however, remains an important player in a fragmented political\u00a0scenario.For all the changes, 40 years after Franco Spain still divides almost perfectly along the left-right lines that took us to the 1936 civil war. In parliament, the sum of PP and Ciudadanos seats is 163 while PSOE and Podemos, together, hold 159.But there is more to these numbers than ideology. We are also in the realm of morals. Much in the way that popular discontent led, last year, to the premature abdication of King Juan Carlos, last Sunday Spaniards said \u201cenough\u201d to quite a few things.First of all, to austerity. The economic recovery has been distinctly unequal. London is the new mecca for overqualified young Spaniards \u2013 engineers, architects, doctors. Many are waiters, a grim reminder of those other Spaniards forced to leave in the 1960s. Many families miss their new \u201cexiles\u201d, as Iglesias likes to call them.The country is growing at a 3% rate this year, but unemployment remains at 21%. In some provinces, such as Cadiz, from where I write, unemployment among the under-25s is as high as 69%. This is unbearable.Second, but felt very intesely, is corruption. Political cronyism has grown to a degree that was unknown even under Franco\u2019s rotten regime. PSOE kickstarted this wretched tendency in the 80s under Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez. Under Mariano Rajoy\u2019s PP it has reached its highest levels yet.There will be weeks of uncertainty as politicians try to form a coalition governmentOnly last week we learned that Rodrigo Rato, a former PP economic minister and a fomer IMF chief, will face charges for using his so-called black credit card to buy both alcohol and religious pieces of art. The card was a freebie from Bankia, the bank he used to head. In June 2012, the European Union had to partially rescue Spain with \u20ac41,000m to stop Bankia\u2019s fall from creating a meltdown in our banking system. This is deeply \u00a0embarrassing.Anger then lies behind the highly fragmented parliament. There will be weeks of uncertainty as politicians try to form a coalition government. Because of our bloody history, we fear instability. These days, there are two further powerful reasons to shy away from it: Spain is slowly recovering from the economic crisis and it faces the challenge of the independent movement, particularly in Catalonia, where up to two million people do not want to belong to Spain.Most parties agree that there needs to be constitutional reform to include these Spaniards who want to be something else (Basques or Galicians as well as Catalans). But politicians do not agree on what exactly to change. Spain\u2019s unity is regarded as a red line for PP, PSOE and Ciudadanos. The right to decide (or to vote) is another for Podemos and the nationalist parties.A new Spain was born on 20 December 2015. Politicians must now try to master the art of compromise. What\u2019s more, if Spaniards learn at the same time how to lower their voice when talking, political instability will have come to us with a silver lining.Ana Romero is an award-winning political journalist for El Espa\u00f1ol.

This Nochebuena, 40 years after Franco\u2019s death, Felipe VI decided to talk for the first time from the royal palace in central Madrid.

His PP, which just four years ago won a landslide victory, lost more than 3\u00a0million votes, securing only 28% of those cast. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, PSOE\u2019s leader, lost more than a million votes, although it\u2019s been only 18 months since he replaced Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba, the new face in theory replacing the old guard.

And to the centre, with Ciudadanos, where baby-faced Albert Rivera, a 36-year-old Catalan lawyer, ended up in fourth place with nearly 14% of the vote.Why has this happened? A key reason is that PP and PSOE represent a way of doing politics that many Spaniards now deem obsolete and at the root of many of the country\u2019s ills, including chronic corruption. Rajoy\u2019s shaky political standing is also, of course, down to austerity. But it can\u2019t explain S\u00e1nchez\u2019s poor results: he has not been governing, or even leading, his party for most of the past four years.Podemos, a heir of the social protests that swept Spain from May 2011, was founded by a group of university professors, with origins on the far left.

If the candidate fails to obtain an absolute majority, followed by a simple majority in a vote of confidence, the king must put forward a new candidate. If no government is formed within two months, new elections must be held.On Monday morning, as many in Spain waded through the potential scenarios, the Socialist party ruled out any possibility of backing the PP. \u201cThe Socialists will vote no to Rajoy. We\u2019re going to vote no to the PP,\u201d said C\u00e9sar Luena, one of the party\u2019s senior officials. The Socialists came second in Sunday\u2019s election, earning 90 seats and 22% of the vote. Despite a result that ranked as their worst ever, the party is now central to the question of what comes next. \u201cSpaniards voted for change and the left and we\u2019re going to translate that to the confidence vote,\u201d said Luena.  Related: Podemos: how Europe\u2019s political centre is being eaten by the radical left and nationalist right Anti-austerity party Podemos, which won 69 seats and 21% of the vote, said it would also block any attempt by Rajoy to form a government. \u201cOn no account will Podemos allow the PP to govern,\u201d the leader, Pablo Iglesias, told reporters on Monday, ruling out the possibility of even abstaining during the vote of confidence. \u201cThe PP cannot form part of the future government of this country,\u201d said Iglesias.By contrast, Ciudadanos\u2019s leader, Albert Rivera, said his party would abstain from the confidence vote to allow the PP to form a minority government and urged the Socialists to do the same. \u201cThe Socialists need to show that they\u2019re thinking more about Spain than what\u2019s left of their party,\u201d Rivera told Spanish media on Monday. \u201cSpain cannot allow itself to be Greece. Spain cannot allow itself to be a chaotic country.\u201d In the lead-up to the election, analysts predicted that Ciudadanos would be a key player in propping up a PP minority. The centre-right party won only 40 seats on Sunday, however, not enough to shield the PP from the no votes promised by the Socialists and Podemos. Rivera has consistently said he will not enter any kind of pact with the PP. As a result a Socialist government backed by Podemos seems increasingly likely. Related: The Guardian view on the Spanish elections: the end of an era | Editorial While both parties will find common ground in the appeal for change, the pairing comes with its perils; whereas the Socialists have pushed for constitutional reform to address the issue of Catalan independence, Iglesias said on Monday that a referendum on independence would be crucial for any party to secure Podemos\u2019s support. Both parties will also have to weigh the risk of alienating their voter base, made up of rural, older voters in the case of the Socialists, and for Podemos, voters intent on doing away with the establishment parties. As Podemos ran under coalitions in several regions, any agreement with the Socialists could potentially be complicated by the stamp of approval needed from several other leftist movements, such as Barcelona en Com\u00fa or Comprom\u00eds in Valencia. An alliance of the Socialists and Podemos would likely still need the support of other parties to advance their agenda, whether it be Ciudadanos or regional parties, such as the Republican Left of Catalonia and Artur Mas\u2019s Democratic Convergence party. The necessity of more votes could amplify the importance of the smattering of separatist parties in the parliament and see the Socialists wrestled into concessions on Catalan independence as the price of gaining support. The option of Ciudadanos as a partner is complicated by Rivera\u2019s strong stance in backing Rajoy as leader of the next government.If the Socialists are able to gather enough support to form a government they could find themselves at loggerheads with the country\u2019s senate \u2013 which emerged from Sunday\u2019s election with a PP majority \u2013 as the party tries to push forward initiatives such as constitutional reform.  Related: 'We are in uncharted waters': readers react to the Spanish general election On Monday, the PP urged its rivals to take a step back and consider the bigger picture. \u201cI am asking everyone to show responsibility, because the stability of Spain is at stake, progress in the economic recovery is at stake,\u201d PP official Fernando Mart\u00ednez-Maillo told broadcaster Cadena Ser. The messy affair has shone new light on the role of King Felipe. While his father Juan Carlos\u2019s abdication sent tens of thousands of Spaniards into the streets to demand a referendum on the future of the monarchy, polls suggest Felipe\u2019s approval levels have since risen. His growth in popularity has been explained by his careful prudence, with speeches that steer clear of the push for democratic and institutional regeneration in Spain. But Sunday\u2019s election result will likely force the king to wade into the crux of the issue, with the monarch central to what comes next. With Felipe set to deliver his televised Christmas eve speech on Thursday, many will be watching carefully for clues on what the future of the country\u2019s government could look like.

It took months of negotiating and a deal that was sealed only hours before the deadline for fresh elections, but the new president, Carles Puigdemont, finally won the support of parliament late on Sunday. The aim is to make Catalonia the next new state in the EU. If only it were that simple.Puigdemont, the former mayor of Girona and a man few outside Catalonia have ever heard of, belongs to the most boldly separatist wing of the outgoing president Artur Mas\u2019s Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC), which has run the wealthy, north-eastern region of Spain for most of the past four decades. He emerged as a last-minute compromise candidate only after the radical Popular United Candidacy (CUP) refused point-blank to support Mas, who has overseen years of austerity. \u201cWe have consigned Mas to the dustbin of history,\u201d a CUP deputy, Benet Salellas, gleefully announced. Related: Catalan separatists to form regional government after president steps aside It is a strange alliance. Puigdemont\u2019s CDC, which led a separatist coalition called Together for Yes into regional elections on 27 September, is variously described as liberal, business-friendly or, at its most leftwing, social democrat. CUP is avowedly anti-capitalist. There could be nothing more dissimilar than the disciplined if corruption-prone party machinery of the CDC and the open, disputatious assemblies and rotating leadership of the CUP.Only one thing could possibly bring such strange bed-companions together, and that is the push towards Catalan independence, with a stated target of 18 months.Yet things are not black and white. Puigdemont says his government will be a \u201cpre-independence\u201d one, which will follow an agreed roadmap to set up independent Catalan institutions that might eventually take over from state institutions. The road is fraught with obstacles, some of them seemingly unsurmountable.First and foremost is the constitution, which states that Spain is indivisible and makes the armed forces the guarantors of its territorial integrity. In theory, this means that should Catalonia ever unilaterally declare itself independent, as some want, a central Spanish government could send tanks trundling down Barcelona\u2019s tree-lined central avenue, the Ramblas. Related: Catalonia plunged into uncertainty as leftwing CUP rejects Mas No one seriously imagines events would ever go that far. More likely is that the constitutional court would use its recently beefed-up powers to deal with separatists if they were to assume powers that the constitution does not allow them. Central government can also, if necessary, suspend the region\u2019s self-government.Separatists can be expected to test the limits continually, hoping that dramatic moves against them will boost support and bolster their argument that Catalonia is a victim of Spanish high-handedness. Some may even be prepared to seek political martyrdom, being taken to court or banned from public office.All of this could be avoided if Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, Mariano Rajoy of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), agreed to talk to Puigdemont about a referendum. Rajoy, however, has spent four years refusing to consider the idea. Having lost a third of his seats in parliament in elections on 20 December, he now leads a provisional government.  Related: Spain's Socialists refuse to back Rajoy's attempts to stay in power The fractured new parliament in Madrid, with insurgents Podemos and Ciudadanos taking a third of the seats, makes forming a new government either complex or impossible.

It took months of negotiating and a deal that was sealed only hours before the deadline for fresh elections, but the new president, Carles Puigdemont, finally won the support of parliament late on Sunday. The aim is to make Catalonia the next new state in the EU. If only it were that simple.Puigdemont, the former mayor of Girona and a man few outside Catalonia have ever heard of, belongs to the most boldly separatist wing of the outgoing president Artur Mas\u2019s Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC), which has run the wealthy, north-eastern region of Spain for most of the past four decades. He emerged as a last-minute compromise candidate only after the radical Popular United Candidacy (CUP) refused point-blank to support Mas, who has overseen years of austerity. \u201cWe have consigned Mas to the dustbin of history,\u201d a CUP deputy, Benet Salellas, gleefully announced. Related: Catalan separatists to form regional government after president steps aside It is a strange alliance. Puigdemont\u2019s CDC, which led a separatist coalition called Together for Yes into regional elections on 27 September, is variously described as liberal, business-friendly or, at its most leftwing, social democrat. CUP is avowedly anti-capitalist. There could be nothing more dissimilar than the disciplined if corruption-prone party machinery of the CDC and the open, disputatious assemblies and rotating leadership of the CUP.Only one thing could possibly bring such strange bed-companions together, and that is the push towards Catalan independence, with a stated target of 18 months.Yet things are not black and white. Puigdemont says his government will be a \u201cpre-independence\u201d one, which will follow an agreed roadmap to set up independent Catalan institutions that might eventually take over from state institutions. The road is fraught with obstacles, some of them seemingly unsurmountable.First and foremost is the constitution, which states that Spain is indivisible and makes the armed forces the guarantors of its territorial integrity. In theory, this means that should Catalonia ever unilaterally declare itself independent, as some want, a central Spanish government could send tanks trundling down Barcelona\u2019s tree-lined central avenue, the Ramblas. Related: Catalonia plunged into uncertainty as leftwing CUP rejects Mas No one seriously imagines events would ever go that far. More likely is that the constitutional court would use its recently beefed-up powers to deal with separatists if they were to assume powers that the constitution does not allow them. Central government can also, if necessary, suspend the region\u2019s self-government.Separatists can be expected to test the limits continually, hoping that dramatic moves against them will boost support and bolster their argument that Catalonia is a victim of Spanish high-handedness. Some may even be prepared to seek political martyrdom, being taken to court or banned from public office.All of this could be avoided if Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, Mariano Rajoy of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), agreed to talk to Puigdemont about a referendum. Rajoy, however, has spent four years refusing to consider the idea. Having lost a third of his seats in parliament in elections on 20 December, he now leads a provisional government.  Related: Spain's Socialists refuse to back Rajoy's attempts to stay in power The fractured new parliament in Madrid, with insurgents Podemos and Ciudadanos taking a third of the seats, makes forming a new government either complex or impossible. Fresh elections may be needed in May. In the meantime, Rajoy plans to maintain a hardline anti-referendum stance that gains votes elsewhere in Spain.A final question is about the degree of support for independence. The roadmap separatists, including the CUP, won 48% of the vote at a regional election that they billed as a de facto referendum. Under the Catalan electoral system that was enough to win a majority of seats, but even within separatist ranks there is concern that it is not enough support for a confrontation with the Spanish state. Some are worried too that the CUP will frighten off cautious, middle-class converts to the cause.Separatists are playing a long game, with the support of younger generations key to the movement\u2019s future. There are many halfway solutions that could dampen support for a split \u2013 from a simple in-out referendum to new tax-gathering rules, a properly federal Spain or a confederation between Catalonia and the rest of the country.All of these require political dexterity. Socialists propose some kind of federalisation while Podemos wants a referendum. Rajoy has limited himself to vague talk about studying constitutional reform and, even if his PP loses control of the government, he has enough parliamentary seats to block it.

Flat La Mancha gives way to mountainous Extremadura and then comes the sea in Andaluc\u00eda. The birdwatching is fantastic: on my way down south this time, I saw storks, vultures, eagles and the odd falcon sitting on a pole.I was also reminded of how noisy we are. At a road restaurant in Almaraz, I could barely make myself heard when asking for the key to the toilet. Yes, cliches can make sense: Spaniards are lively and stubborn; they like to make their point sometimes simply by yelling.We all like to think our own country is distinct, but over the past few days, Spain has felt different from the rest of Europe.Our big event takes place on Christmas Eve, Nochebuena, when families gather together to eat and celebrate after the king\u2019s speech at 9pm. This Nochebuena, 40 years after Franco\u2019s death, Felipe VI decided to talk for the first time from the royal palace in central Madrid. The sumptous palace has remained uninhabited since 14 April 1931, when Felipe\u2019s great-grandfather Alfonso XIII was forced to leave the country after the Republican victory in the elections.The king\u2019s decision only added to the extraordinary times that we have been living through. For the past four years of conservative rule, change has been in the air and last weekend citizens stamped change firmly on their votes. The elections dealt a severe blow to bipartidismo, the system that has prevailed since Franco\u2019s death, with the conservative Partido Popular (PP) and socialist Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (PSOE) taking turns to govern.Last Sunday, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy won the greatest number of votes but lost his parliamentary majority. His PP, which just four years ago won a landslide victory, lost more than 3\u00a0million votes, securing only 28% of those cast. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, PSOE\u2019s leader, lost more than a million votes, although it\u2019s been only 18 months since he replaced Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba, the new face in theory replacing the old guard. S\u00e1nchez, however, won only 21% of the vote.Where did those million of \u201clost\u201d votes go? To the left, with Podemos, where pony-tailed Pablo Iglesias, a 37-year-old political scientist, took more than 20% of the vote. And to the centre, with Ciudadanos, where baby-faced Albert Rivera, a 36-year-old Catalan lawyer, ended up in fourth place with nearly 14% of the vote.Why has this happened? A key reason is that PP and PSOE represent a way of doing politics that many Spaniards now deem obsolete and at the root of many of the country\u2019s ills, including chronic corruption. Rajoy\u2019s shaky political standing is also, of course, down to austerity. But it can\u2019t explain S\u00e1nchez\u2019s poor results: he has not been governing, or even leading, his party for most of the past four years.Podemos, a heir of the social protests that swept Spain from May 2011, was founded by a group of university professors, with origins on the far left. But its charismatic leader, Iglesias, has worked hard in the past months to drive Podemos into the mainstream, and he will have a lot to say in my country\u2019s future. He is smart and ambitious, and has learned from what went right and wrong for Syriza in Greece.Ciudadanos is business-friendly and anti-corruption. But, according to a tall tale that\u2019s being put around, big companies (the Ibex 35, the Spanish stock exchange) funded Rivera to stop Podemos taking the whole of the protest vote. The rumour worked well and Ciudadanos failed to meet expectations. Rivera, however, remains an important player in a fragmented political\u00a0scenario.For all the changes, 40 years after Franco Spain still divides almost perfectly along the left-right lines that took us to the 1936 civil war. In parliament, the sum of PP and Ciudadanos seats is 163 while PSOE and Podemos, together, hold 159.But there is more to these numbers than ideology. We are also in the realm of morals. Much in the way that popular discontent led, last year, to the premature abdication of King Juan Carlos, last Sunday Spaniards said \u201cenough\u201d to quite a few things.First of all, to austerity. The economic recovery has been distinctly unequal. London is the new mecca for overqualified young Spaniards \u2013 engineers, architects, doctors. Many are waiters, a grim reminder of those other Spaniards forced to leave in the 1960s. Many families miss their new \u201cexiles\u201d, as Iglesias likes to call them.The country is growing at a 3% rate this year, but unemployment remains at 21%. In some provinces, such as Cadiz, from where I write, unemployment among the under-25s is as high as 69%. This is unbearable.Second, but felt very intesely, is corruption. Political cronyism has grown to a degree that was unknown even under Franco\u2019s rotten regime. PSOE kickstarted this wretched tendency in the 80s under Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez. Under Mariano Rajoy\u2019s PP it has reached its highest levels yet.There will be weeks of uncertainty as politicians try to form a coalition governmentOnly last week we learned that Rodrigo Rato, a former PP economic minister and a fomer IMF chief, will face charges for using his so-called black credit card to buy both alcohol and religious pieces of art. The card was a freebie from Bankia, the bank he used to head. In June 2012, the European Union had to partially rescue Spain with \u20ac41,000m to stop Bankia\u2019s fall from creating a meltdown in our banking system. This is deeply \u00a0embarrassing.Anger then lies behind the highly fragmented parliament. There will be weeks of uncertainty as politicians try to form a coalition government. Because of our bloody history, we fear instability. These days, there are two further powerful reasons to shy away from it: Spain is slowly recovering from the economic crisis and it faces the challenge of the independent movement, particularly in Catalonia, where up to two million people do not want to belong to Spain.Most parties agree that there needs to be constitutional reform to include these Spaniards who want to be something else (Basques or Galicians as well as Catalans). But politicians do not agree on what exactly to change. Spain\u2019s unity is regarded as a red line for PP, PSOE and Ciudadanos. The right to decide (or to vote) is another for Podemos and the nationalist parties.A new Spain was born on 20 December 2015. Politicians must now try to master the art of compromise. What\u2019s more, if Spaniards learn at the same time how to lower their voice when talking, political instability will have come to us with a silver lining.Ana Romero is an award-winning political journalist for El Espa\u00f1ol.

It is, to put it mildly, topical. \u201cI strongly hope that the fear Muslims have of becoming the new Jews of Europe will not come true,\u201d she says to her audience of overwhelmingly white, well-heeled and middle-aged citizens.Fischer \u2013 the author of Aim\u00e9e & Jaguar, the bestselling novel about the second world war love affair between two women, one a Jew, the other married to a Nazi \u2013 has reason to worry. A recent poll found that 60% of Germans believe their country cannot cope with the numbers of new arrivals, which reached 1.1 million in 2015, while 42% fear their cultural values are under threat.More than 70 years ago, Germans murdered millions of their Jewish neighbours, or stood by while they were sent to their deaths. In this beautiful old city, now a Unesco world heritage site, a community of more than 500 Jews was deported, most to be murdered in death camps or in the forests around Riga.Last August, Der Spiegel carried this front page headline: \u201cXenophobia is poisoning Germany.\u201d Since then, resentment of immigrants has risen. Recent examples include pubs and clubs in Freiburg banning immigrants and a swimming pool in Bornheim refusing to admit male refugees. Fischer mentions Cologne where, on New Year\u2019s Eve, sexual attacks against women were blamed on immigrant men. \u201cThose events,\u201d she says, \u201chave led to a renaissance of a very xenophobic, patriarchal and ultimately misogynistic climate in Germany.\u201dIn this toxic climate, the American artist Ken Aptekar is staging a show called Nachbarn, or Neighbours, using video, paintings and silverpoint drawings to explore what neighbourliness means. He was thinking about the theme long before Germany\u2019s \u2013 and Europe\u2019s \u2013 current refugee crisis. In 2006, he visited L\u00fcbeck and was struck by how the St Annen-Museum, a former Augustinian nunnery, was next door to one of the few German synagogues not to be burned down during Kristallnacht in 1938. How, Aptekar wondered, did these Christian and Jewish neighbours get along before and during the Holocaust?\u201cI wanted to do something that would speak to young L\u00fcbeckers,\u201d says Aptekar. \u201cI wanted to shift the Holocaust narrative from being about victimisation to otherness, immigration and community. Can people recognise and respect their profound differences and together build a vibrant community?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know 10 years ago how topical these questions would become, in a Europe still reeling after the Paris attacks. Strikingly, the names of the works have translations into German, English, Russian and Turkish. Why Russian and Turkish? Because L\u00fcbeck\u2019s synagogue is now a thriving place of worship for a 900-strong community of Jews, mostly from Russia; while, within walking distance of the museum, there are three mosques, whose worshippers are mostly Turkish-speaking.Aptekar is known as an appropriation artist. When I first interviewed him 16 years ago, he had an exhibition at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum called Q&A that involved him showing works from the museum\u2019s European collection to focus groups: redheads, African-Caribbean women, art students. He sandblasted their most interesting responses on to sheets of glass. Then he painted copies of details from the pictures discussed and attached the glass to them. He has done something similar in L\u00fcbeck, recycling imagery from Christian altarpieces in the St Annen collection, and overlaying them with texts carrying present day resonances. One room in Nachbarn features Aptekar\u2019s Carlebach Suite, six paintings dramatising the true story of a Jewish family from L\u00fcbeck.In the first painting, a detail from a 1475 altarpiece is overlaid with an unfurling, Torah-like scroll bearing the words: \u201c1941: Food rations for the Simson Carlebach family are reduced. Jews are not permitted to buy meat, milk, white bread or cigarettes and can shop only between the hours of 4pm and 5pm.\u201d The next painting\u2019s text reads: \u201cAfter nightfall, neighbours secretly provide the family with food that they leave outside their garden gate, a crime severely punished by the Nazis.\u201d The third reads: \u201cWhen the Carlebachs find out the Nazis are coming to pick them up, they tie a monogrammed kitchen towel to the garden gate, a final thank you and farewell.\u201d Most of the Carlebach family were deported to Riga in 1942 and murdered. But not all: son Felix managed to flee to Manchester where, from 1947 until his retirement in 1984, he was a rabbi at South Manchester Synagogue.'The smoke from your barbecue is really annoying,' reads the text on one paintingAlmost five decades after his family\u2019s murder, Felix Carlebach was invited back to L\u00fcbeck to be made an honorary citizen. During the ceremony in 1987, a woman approached him. \u201cOur parents were neighbours. I brought something that belongs to you,\u201d she said, and handed the rabbi the kitchen towel. The scene is commemorated in the last painting. \u201cWhat impressed me most,\u201d says Aptekar, \u201cis that the woman then just disappeared. She didn\u2019t want anything. She wanted to give and receive nothing back, not recognition, atonement, nothing.\u201d In the centre of the room is a vitrine containing that towel, brought from Manchester for the exhibition. Aptekar also tackles the everyday reality of having to live next door to someone whose values drive you nuts. \u201cYour dog shat in my kid\u2019s sandbox again,\u201d reads the scrolling text of one silverpoint drawing. \u201cThe smoke from your barbecues is really annoying,\u201d reads another.One of the most affecting parts of the show is a video installation Aptekar made after interviewing Rodolfo Hoffmann, the last surviving bar mitzvah boy from prewar L\u00fcbeck. Aptekar tracked him down to Santiago, Chile, where he filmed the 91-year-old recalling his childhood. Hoffmann describes a time of innocence, when he played with other kids, celebrating Christmas as well as marking Jewish holidays. Hoffmann says he scarcely felt Jewish: it took Hitler to do that.Hoffmann\u2019s father was partner in a shoe shop called Blumenthal\u2019s. When the Nazis came to power, a traffic cop would narrowly eye anybody who dared to go inside the Jewish-run business. Few did, trade collapsed, and Blumenthal\u2019s was sold at a rock-bottom price. The buyers were non-Jews who ran the shop under the name Sch\u00fcmann Schuhe until last October. Hoffmann\u2019s family managed to flee to Chile in 1936, just a few months after Rodolfo celebrated his bar mitzvah at the L\u00fcbeck synagogue, which the Nazis soon converted into a gym. Sad-eyed Hoffman remembers travelling halfway around the world to escape murder by Nazis only to be find himself living in a ghetto. His family would invite neighbours over for meals, but the offer was never reciprocated. \u201cSo we lived in a ghetto that we made ourselves,\u201d says Hoffman. At the end of the exhibition is the Jewish artist Max Liebermann\u2019s notorious 1879 painting The Twelve-Year-Old Jesus in the Temple, loaned from Hamburg\u2019s Kunsthalle. It\u2019s notorious because Liebermann repainted it following an antisemitic outcry over his depiction of Christ as a poor, barefoot Jewish urchin. Liebermann obligingly gave the boy blond hair and sandals, making him look less poor and less Jewish. In the context of Aptekar\u2019s show, the painting has an allegorical function: it\u2019s about the grotesqueness of forced integration, about what happens when difference is not respected but obliterated.Next to it, Aptekar has repainted Liebermann\u2019s repainted Jesus. He keeps the blond hair and the sandals but overlays the image with the words: \u201cDie Juden in die St Annen-Kirche\u201d (Jews in the St Anne Church).

But based on surveys and data out from individual countries it appeared household spending was doing the heavy lifting, they said. Meanwhile, manufacturers have been struggling with a slowdown in global demand on the back of China\u2019s downturn and turmoil in other emerging market economies.\u201cConsumers probably saved the day for the eurozone economy in the third quarter. Both the renewed fall in energy prices and the declining unemployment rate have likely boosted disposable income, supporting consumption, in our view the single most important driver of the expansion at this moment,\u201d said Peter Vanden Houte at ING Financial Markets.\u201cBottom line: the eurozone recovery is continuing, but it seems like driving with the handbrake on.

Sad-eyed Hoffman remembers travelling halfway around the world to escape murder by Nazis only to be find himself living in a ghetto. His family would invite neighbours over for meals, but the offer was never reciprocated. \u201cSo we lived in a ghetto that we made ourselves,\u201d says Hoffman. At the end of the exhibition is the Jewish artist Max Liebermann\u2019s notorious 1879 painting The Twelve-Year-Old Jesus in the Temple, loaned from Hamburg\u2019s Kunsthalle. It\u2019s notorious because Liebermann repainted it following an antisemitic outcry over his depiction of Christ as a poor, barefoot Jewish urchin. Liebermann obligingly gave the boy blond hair and sandals, making him look less poor and less Jewish. In the context of Aptekar\u2019s show, the painting has an allegorical function: it\u2019s about the grotesqueness of forced integration, about what happens when difference is not respected but obliterated.Next to it, Aptekar has repainted Liebermann\u2019s repainted Jesus. He keeps the blond hair and the sandals but overlays the image with the words: \u201cDie Juden in die St Annen-Kirche\u201d (Jews in the St Anne Church). It serves as a reminder that all those figures in the museum\u2019s great Christian art collection were Jews, different from yet equal to Christians \u2013 just like its neighbours in the synagogue next door.\u2022 Nachbarn is at St Annen-Museum, L\u00fcbeck, until 29 May.", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Painting", "Exhibition", "Exhibitions", "Video art", "Drawing", "Holocaust", "Religion", "Culture", "Judaism", "Germany", "Europe"], "title": "What my blond Jesus could teach Germany"},{"date": "2015-11-13T11:25:21Z", "content": "The eurozone\u2019s economy lost steam in the latest quarter as Portugal stalled, Germany slowed and debt-stricken Greece contracted.Gross domestic product (GDP) across the 19 countries in the single currency bloc rose just 0.3% in the third quarter, according to Eurostat.

The coach carries a sign saying Reisegenuss, meaning \u201ctravel in comfort\u201d.Saxony\u2019s interior minister Markus Ulbig, a member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic party, said: \u201cAs much need for a discussion there may be over the refugee question: I find it deeply shameful to see how people are being treated here.\u201d Related: Germany braces for rise in anti-immigrant attacks The mayor of Rechenberg-Bienenm\u00fchle, the municipality where the video was recorded, said he too felt ashamed by the incident, while claiming that the protests were not directed at the refugees themselves. \u201cThis was about politics, not the people themselves,\u201d said Michael Funke.According to police reports, 100 anti-refugee protesters gathered on Thursday evening at about 7.20pm outside the asylum seekers\u2019 accommodation in the village of Clausnitz, 19 miles south of Dresden.

It is, to put it mildly, topical. \u201cI strongly hope that the fear Muslims have of becoming the new Jews of Europe will not come true,\u201d she says to her audience of overwhelmingly white, well-heeled and middle-aged citizens.Fischer \u2013 the author of Aim\u00e9e & Jaguar, the bestselling novel about the second world war love affair between two women, one a Jew, the other married to a Nazi \u2013 has reason to worry. A recent poll found that 60% of Germans believe their country cannot cope with the numbers of new arrivals, which reached 1.1 million in 2015, while 42% fear their cultural values are under threat.More than 70 years ago, Germans murdered millions of their Jewish neighbours, or stood by while they were sent to their deaths. In this beautiful old city, now a Unesco world heritage site, a community of more than 500 Jews was deported, most to be murdered in death camps or in the forests around Riga.Last August, Der Spiegel carried this front page headline: \u201cXenophobia is poisoning Germany.\u201d Since then, resentment of immigrants has risen. Recent examples include pubs and clubs in Freiburg banning immigrants and a swimming pool in Bornheim refusing to admit male refugees. Fischer mentions Cologne where, on New Year\u2019s Eve, sexual attacks against women were blamed on immigrant men. \u201cThose events,\u201d she says, \u201chave led to a renaissance of a very xenophobic, patriarchal and ultimately misogynistic climate in Germany.\u201dIn this toxic climate, the American artist Ken Aptekar is staging a show called Nachbarn, or Neighbours, using video, paintings and silverpoint drawings to explore what neighbourliness means. He was thinking about the theme long before Germany\u2019s \u2013 and Europe\u2019s \u2013 current refugee crisis. In 2006, he visited L\u00fcbeck and was struck by how the St Annen-Museum, a former Augustinian nunnery, was next door to one of the few German synagogues not to be burned down during Kristallnacht in 1938. How, Aptekar wondered, did these Christian and Jewish neighbours get along before and during the Holocaust?\u201cI wanted to do something that would speak to young L\u00fcbeckers,\u201d says Aptekar. \u201cI wanted to shift the Holocaust narrative from being about victimisation to otherness, immigration and community. Can people recognise and respect their profound differences and together build a vibrant community?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know 10 years ago how topical these questions would become, in a Europe still reeling after the Paris attacks. Strikingly, the names of the works have translations into German, English, Russian and Turkish. Why Russian and Turkish? Because L\u00fcbeck\u2019s synagogue is now a thriving place of worship for a 900-strong community of Jews, mostly from Russia; while, within walking distance of the museum, there are three mosques, whose worshippers are mostly Turkish-speaking.Aptekar is known as an appropriation artist. When I first interviewed him 16 years ago, he had an exhibition at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum called Q&A that involved him showing works from the museum\u2019s European collection to focus groups: redheads, African-Caribbean women, art students. He sandblasted their most interesting responses on to sheets of glass. Then he painted copies of details from the pictures discussed and attached the glass to them. He has done something similar in L\u00fcbeck, recycling imagery from Christian altarpieces in the St Annen collection, and overlaying them with texts carrying present day resonances. One room in Nachbarn features Aptekar\u2019s Carlebach Suite, six paintings dramatising the true story of a Jewish family from L\u00fcbeck.In the first painting, a detail from a 1475 altarpiece is overlaid with an unfurling, Torah-like scroll bearing the words: \u201c1941: Food rations for the Simson Carlebach family are reduced. Jews are not permitted to buy meat, milk, white bread or cigarettes and can shop only between the hours of 4pm and 5pm.\u201d The next painting\u2019s text reads: \u201cAfter nightfall, neighbours secretly provide the family with food that they leave outside their garden gate, a crime severely punished by the Nazis.\u201d The third reads: \u201cWhen the Carlebachs find out the Nazis are coming to pick them up, they tie a monogrammed kitchen towel to the garden gate, a final thank you and farewell.\u201d Most of the Carlebach family were deported to Riga in 1942 and murdered. But not all: son Felix managed to flee to Manchester where, from 1947 until his retirement in 1984, he was a rabbi at South Manchester Synagogue.'The smoke from your barbecue is really annoying,' reads the text on one paintingAlmost five decades after his family\u2019s murder, Felix Carlebach was invited back to L\u00fcbeck to be made an honorary citizen. During the ceremony in 1987, a woman approached him. \u201cOur parents were neighbours. I brought something that belongs to you,\u201d she said, and handed the rabbi the kitchen towel. The scene is commemorated in the last painting. \u201cWhat impressed me most,\u201d says Aptekar, \u201cis that the woman then just disappeared. She didn\u2019t want anything. She wanted to give and receive nothing back, not recognition, atonement, nothing.\u201d In the centre of the room is a vitrine containing that towel, brought from Manchester for the exhibition. Aptekar also tackles the everyday reality of having to live next door to someone whose values drive you nuts. \u201cYour dog shat in my kid\u2019s sandbox again,\u201d reads the scrolling text of one silverpoint drawing. \u201cThe smoke from your barbecues is really annoying,\u201d reads another.One of the most affecting parts of the show is a video installation Aptekar made after interviewing Rodolfo Hoffmann, the last surviving bar mitzvah boy from prewar L\u00fcbeck. Aptekar tracked him down to Santiago, Chile, where he filmed the 91-year-old recalling his childhood. Hoffmann describes a time of innocence, when he played with other kids, celebrating Christmas as well as marking Jewish holidays. Hoffmann says he scarcely felt Jewish: it took Hitler to do that.Hoffmann\u2019s father was partner in a shoe shop called Blumenthal\u2019s. When the Nazis came to power, a traffic cop would narrowly eye anybody who dared to go inside the Jewish-run business. Few did, trade collapsed, and Blumenthal\u2019s was sold at a rock-bottom price. The buyers were non-Jews who ran the shop under the name Sch\u00fcmann Schuhe until last October. Hoffmann\u2019s family managed to flee to Chile in 1936, just a few months after Rodolfo celebrated his bar mitzvah at the L\u00fcbeck synagogue, which the Nazis soon converted into a gym. Sad-eyed Hoffman remembers travelling halfway around the world to escape murder by Nazis only to be find himself living in a ghetto.

In a sign that the industry is fast developing, year-on-year wind turbine orders were up 75% last year. Offshore platforms were built further out to sea - 43km on average - and in deeper waters, typically around 27m.Europe\u2019s three offshore leaders - Germany, the UK and the Netherlands - are still working on six offshore projects, whose grid connection should add another 15% of offshore capacity to Europe\u2019s power system.  \u201cThe financing is there, the order book is strong, now we need policymakers to come forward with a regulatory vision that will inspire confidence for investors and developers post-2020,\u201d the EWEA spokesman said.E.ON was the industry\u2019s largest developer in 2014, with 17% of connections, followed closely by RWE and EnBW.Offshore\u2019s rapid growth was not confined to Europe, with the number of global platforms growing by a factor of four to provide 4,000 MW of grid-connected electricity, twice the previous record set in 2013, according to BNEF.China had the most eye-catching achievement, installing 29,000 MW, a 40% increase on its previous record and almost as much as the rest of the world combined. \u201c2015 was a fantastic year for the wind industry.\u201d said Amy Grace, head of Wind Insight for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cChina was by far the biggest surprise.

But not all: son Felix managed to flee to Manchester where, from 1947 until his retirement in 1984, he was a rabbi at South Manchester Synagogue.'The smoke from your barbecue is really annoying,' reads the text on one paintingAlmost five decades after his family\u2019s murder, Felix Carlebach was invited back to L\u00fcbeck to be made an honorary citizen. During the ceremony in 1987, a woman approached him. \u201cOur parents were neighbours. I brought something that belongs to you,\u201d she said, and handed the rabbi the kitchen towel. The scene is commemorated in the last painting. \u201cWhat impressed me most,\u201d says Aptekar, \u201cis that the woman then just disappeared. She didn\u2019t want anything. She wanted to give and receive nothing back, not recognition, atonement, nothing.\u201d In the centre of the room is a vitrine containing that towel, brought from Manchester for the exhibition. Aptekar also tackles the everyday reality of having to live next door to someone whose values drive you nuts. \u201cYour dog shat in my kid\u2019s sandbox again,\u201d reads the scrolling text of one silverpoint drawing. \u201cThe smoke from your barbecues is really annoying,\u201d reads another.One of the most affecting parts of the show is a video installation Aptekar made after interviewing Rodolfo Hoffmann, the last surviving bar mitzvah boy from prewar L\u00fcbeck. Aptekar tracked him down to Santiago, Chile, where he filmed the 91-year-old recalling his childhood. Hoffmann describes a time of innocence, when he played with other kids, celebrating Christmas as well as marking Jewish holidays. Hoffmann says he scarcely felt Jewish: it took Hitler to do that.Hoffmann\u2019s father was partner in a shoe shop called Blumenthal\u2019s. When the Nazis came to power, a traffic cop would narrowly eye anybody who dared to go inside the Jewish-run business. Few did, trade collapsed, and Blumenthal\u2019s was sold at a rock-bottom price. The buyers were non-Jews who ran the shop under the name Sch\u00fcmann Schuhe until last October. Hoffmann\u2019s family managed to flee to Chile in 1936, just a few months after Rodolfo celebrated his bar mitzvah at the L\u00fcbeck synagogue, which the Nazis soon converted into a gym. Sad-eyed Hoffman remembers travelling halfway around the world to escape murder by Nazis only to be find himself living in a ghetto. His family would invite neighbours over for meals, but the offer was never reciprocated. \u201cSo we lived in a ghetto that we made ourselves,\u201d says Hoffman. At the end of the exhibition is the Jewish artist Max Liebermann\u2019s notorious 1879 painting The Twelve-Year-Old Jesus in the Temple, loaned from Hamburg\u2019s Kunsthalle. It\u2019s notorious because Liebermann repainted it following an antisemitic outcry over his depiction of Christ as a poor, barefoot Jewish urchin. Liebermann obligingly gave the boy blond hair and sandals, making him look less poor and less Jewish. In the context of Aptekar\u2019s show, the painting has an allegorical function: it\u2019s about the grotesqueness of forced integration, about what happens when difference is not respected but obliterated.Next to it, Aptekar has repainted Liebermann\u2019s repainted Jesus. He keeps the blond hair and the sandals but overlays the image with the words: \u201cDie Juden in die St Annen-Kirche\u201d (Jews in the St Anne Church). It serves as a reminder that all those figures in the museum\u2019s great Christian art collection were Jews, different from yet equal to Christians \u2013 just like its neighbours in the synagogue next door.\u2022 Nachbarn is at St Annen-Museum, L\u00fcbeck, until 29 May.", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Painting", "Exhibition", "Exhibitions", "Video art", "Drawing", "Holocaust", "Religion", "Culture", "Judaism", "Germany", "Europe"], "title": "What my blond Jesus could teach Germany"},{"date": "2015-11-13T11:25:21Z", "content": "The eurozone\u2019s economy lost steam in the latest quarter as Portugal stalled, Germany slowed and debt-stricken Greece contracted.Gross domestic product (GDP) across the 19 countries in the single currency bloc rose just 0.3% in the third quarter, according to Eurostat.

Meanwhile, manufacturers have been struggling with a slowdown in global demand on the back of China\u2019s downturn and turmoil in other emerging market economies.\u201cConsumers probably saved the day for the eurozone economy in the third quarter.

The coach carries a sign saying Reisegenuss, meaning \u201ctravel in comfort\u201d.Saxony\u2019s interior minister Markus Ulbig, a member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic party, said: \u201cAs much need for a discussion there may be over the refugee question: I find it deeply shameful to see how people are being treated here.\u201d Related: Germany braces for rise in anti-immigrant attacks The mayor of Rechenberg-Bienenm\u00fchle, the municipality where the video was recorded, said he too felt ashamed by the incident, while claiming that the protests were not directed at the refugees themselves. \u201cThis was about politics, not the people themselves,\u201d said Michael Funke.According to police reports, 100 anti-refugee protesters gathered on Thursday evening at about 7.20pm outside the asylum seekers\u2019 accommodation in the village of Clausnitz, 19 miles south of Dresden. Vehicles were used to block access to the building.One of the protesters threatened the group inside the bus with a cut-throat gesture, a witness told Freie Presse newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace, this hatred people feel towards people they know nothing about,\u201d an anonymous witness said.

The UK still has the most installed offshore wind power in Europe, at 5,061MW to Germany\u2019s total of 3,295MW.A spokesman for the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA), which published the figures, said that the UK had attracted more investment than Germany last year, but installed less capacity, as Germany cleared a backlog that had built up in 2014.\u201cGermany was the engine behind the record year in 2015 and we would expect it to continue its lead,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cGermany will be a big offshore story towards 2020 certainly.\u201d The offshore wind industry is generally positive towards the subsidy regime promised by UK energy secretary, Amber Rudd, of three more \u201ccontracts for difference\u201d auctions before 2020. But the spokesman said: \u201cclarity on the arrangement of these auctions is essential.\u201dOverall offshore wind investment in Europe doubled to \u20ac13.3bn last year, in a record year for the budding green tech sector.But a dip in grid connections is expected in 2016, with more capacity coming online towards the decade\u2019s end. In a sign that the industry is fast developing, year-on-year wind turbine orders were up 75% last year. Offshore platforms were built further out to sea - 43km on average - and in deeper waters, typically around 27m.Europe\u2019s three offshore leaders - Germany, the UK and the Netherlands - are still working on six offshore projects, whose grid connection should add another 15% of offshore capacity to Europe\u2019s power system.  \u201cThe financing is there, the order book is strong, now we need policymakers to come forward with a regulatory vision that will inspire confidence for investors and developers post-2020,\u201d the EWEA spokesman said.E.ON was the industry\u2019s largest developer in 2014, with 17% of connections, followed closely by RWE and EnBW.Offshore\u2019s rapid growth was not confined to Europe, with the number of global platforms growing by a factor of four to provide 4,000 MW of grid-connected electricity, twice the previous record set in 2013, according to BNEF.China had the most eye-catching achievement, installing 29,000 MW, a 40% increase on its previous record and almost as much as the rest of the world combined. \u201c2015 was a fantastic year for the wind industry.\u201d said Amy Grace, head of Wind Insight for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cChina was by far the biggest surprise.

His hands were clammy and his heart was beating fast, but he took a deep breath as he stepped inside the ivy-clad red-brick building of the Charit\u00e9 hospital and climbed the stairs to meet the group. When he saw them, he got his next shock.\u201cThere were thin, fat, tall and short men, aged between 20 and 60. I found out there was a banker, a church warden, a doctor, a student, an unemployed bloke, an actor \u2013 people from all walks of life.\u201d What Weber, then an engineering student in his mid-20s, had in common with the others was that they were all diagnosed paedophiles who had come voluntarily to receive treatment at the Charit\u00e9\u2019s institute for sexual medicine. \u201cIt was amazing for me to see how different everyone was,\u201d said Weber. \u201cI\u2019d never met another paedophile before.\u201dThe institute has been running the prevention project Dunkelfeld (which means dark field) for a decade. Since 2011, it has gradually developed into a nationwide network called \u201cdon\u2019t offend\u201d. What started in Berlin has spread to 10 other cities, with more centres planned so that eventually the programme will be easily accessible for anyone in Germany.There is a radical difference between the treatment offered to paedophiles in Germany and that in other countries. Strict patient-doctor confidentiality rules mean the men can be assured they will not be reported to the police. They would only be excluded from the programme if there was an active prosecution against them. Related: Paedophilia: bringing dark desires to light \u201cI did not have to give my name and address, and I was given a pin number to connect me to my diagnosis data,\u201d Weber, his chosen pseudonym, told the Guardian in a burger bar in central Berlin.Those who run Dunkelfeld insist that the confidentiality clause is central to the unique project\u2019s success and also accounts for its popularity. \u201cAccording to the German legal code, therapists are forbidden from revealing anything that happens in the context of treatment,\u201d said Laura Kuhle, a clinical psychologist and one of Dunkelfeld\u2019s therapists. \u201cIf people mention anything in therapy that could make them criminally culpable, they are protected. In other countries, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Kuhle is convinced that, if patients were not guaranteed that confidentiality, most would not turn up at all and those that did would not be truly honest.\u201cWe need them to be completely open about what has happened in their pasts, so that we can work with them as effectively as possible. What situations have they found themselves in? What were the individual events that led up to what\u2019s happened to them until now? You can\u2019t answer questions like that if you are afraid,\u201d Kuhle said.For Weber, who is keen to stress he has never offended although he admits to having been dangerously close to doing so, the confidentiality clause was key. \u201cI was so petrified of anyone even finding out I was thinking of doing it, because of the obvious stigma attached to being a paedophile, I memorised the telephone number before calling the centre, out of fear that someone might find the number on me. That way no one could suspect me of anything,\u201d he said. It was during puberty that Weber first recognised his sexual attraction towards young girls. \u201cI found the feelings threatening, exceptionally unpleasant, but I couldn\u2019t really put a name to them,\u201d he said. . \u201cI recognised that this had the potential to get very dangerous when I was in my early 20s, particularly after one encounter I had with a girl on a beach. I recognised I was drawn towards doing something sexual with the girl, at the same time as not wanting to do it at all because I knew it was wrong.\u201dThree times he planned to carry out what he calls \u201cconcrete assaults\u201d on young children. Three times he was prevented from doing so by a mix of circumstance and his own fear. His mother, who apparently knew nothing of his tendencies, pointed out a television advert for Dunkelfeld. The ad asked: \u201cDo you love children more than you\u2019d like to?\u201d and promised free therapy with medical confidentiality. Related: Channel 4 film features paedophile confessing attraction to children Weber took down the number and went to a phone box to ring the hotline. \u201cIt felt surreal as it was the first time in my life I had talked to anyone about it, and the woman on the other end was so friendly, she talked to me as naturally as if she was giving me a recipe for biscuits,\u201d he said. At a subsequent appointment, Weber was diagnosed as a heteropaedophile because his feelings of sexual attraction for women were clearly subordinated by a stronger attraction towards young girls. He began the weekly three-hour therapy sessions, overseen by two therapists, with between six to 10 participants. The sessions took place at the end of a normal working day and were based on cognitive behavioural therapy methods.\u201cAt the start of each session, the participants talk about their experiences of the past week and what is on their minds,\u201d said Kuhle. The treatment includes helping participants to understand the child\u2019s perspective, learning to cope in potentially difficult situations such as birthday parties, and developing ways to overcome bad habits such as viewing pornographic images or having sexual fantasies, which can increase the likelihood of a paedophile offending. \u201cSometimes,\u201d said Weber, \u201cthe survival tactics involve something as simple as saying to yourself \u2018count backwards from 100, in units of seven\u2019.\u201d But Weber was told early on that paedophilia, according to current understandings, is a non-curable mental disorder without a known cause.Sessions accordingly touched on what could realistically be changed and what would stay the same. \u201cThat was a blow, to know I couldn\u2019t be cured, but at the same time, there was relief to know it wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cVital for me was finally being able to look at myself in the mirror and say \u2018you\u2019re not a monster, you\u2019re a paedophile\u2019, and that\u2019s okay as long as you don\u2019t abuse a child.\u201dLearning to control his feelings was the most important aspect of the sessions. \u201cI am responsible for my behaviour. If someone says they can\u2019t control themselves, that\u2019s just not true.\u201d Which is not to say he didn\u2019t struggle. \u201cThere were several times I wanted to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re taking yourself apart and putting yourself back together again with the tools to cope and it was incredibly scary.\u201dWeber, who runs a support group for non-offending paedophiles called Schicksal und Herausforderung (fate and challenge) sports a beard and a burgundy T-shirt. He is not someone who would stand out in a crowd.  Related: Reducing harm done by and to paedophiles | Letters Statistics gathered by the Charit\u00e9\u2019s therapists indicate that, of 440 paedophile patients they have so far treated, the average age is 37, 71% are employed, 39% are in relationships, while 36% are the caregivers for one or more children. They are almost always male. \u201cWe have been contacted by 17 women in the last decade. Only one of these would I say had a paedophilic disorder,\u201d said Kuhle.Perhaps surprisingly, the project has the strong backing of Germany\u2019s conservatives. The ruling Christian Democratic party (CDU) of Angela Merkel is highly supportive and pushing for health insurers to fund the therapy, which costs \u20ac5m-\u20ac8m a year. So far financing has come from government and charitable grants.In a recent policy paper on the subject, the CDU argued that the best protection for children \u201cwould be for people with a paedophilic disposition (of whom it is estimated there are around 250,000 in Germany) not to become offenders in the first place\u201d. \u201cBut in order to lessen the number of attacks by paedophiles, our healthcare system must provide sufficient and low-threshold treatment possibilities for them \u2026 on a financially sustainable and anonymous basis,\u201d it advised.By its very nature, it is almost impossible to evaluate the project\u2019s success. While a paedophile who has participated might be asked if the treatment had prevented him from offending, any answer is likely to be highly subjective and possibly unreliable. To measure its success according to the number of recorded cases of child abuse is also problematic, as those rates are known to have gone up if only because of the increasing number of abuse victims who feel prepared to come forward as the subject has become less taboo.But experts like Kuhle say the popularity of Dunkelfeld among paedophiles is proof of how vital it is. \u201cI meet many colleagues from other countries, particularly the UK and the US, who would like to introduce this therapy and are in the process of trying to roll it out, but are often hindered from doing so by the legal restrictions.\u201dAfter Channel 4 screened the documentary The Paedophile Next Door, which featured the institute\u2019s unique style of therapy, last November, Dunkelfeld\u2019s hotline was inundated with calls from Britons with paedophilic disorders. Therapists say they were frustrated at not being able to help.One British man was so desperate, he moved to Germany to be able to access a Dunkelfeld programme. In an email exchange with the Guardian, the man, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote: \u201cSo far, all I have ever received from the NHS is doors slammed in my face.\u201cDespite paedophilia being listed as a mental illness in the DSM (the standard classification of mental disorders), they don\u2019t want to help you, they just want to see you locked up or perhaps even burnt at the stake. I am so sick and tired of UK medical \u2018professionals\u2019 looking at me as if I\u2019ve grown horns and a barbed tail.\u201cI moved to Germany for therapy, I am learning German and I have a social worker helping me. (Yes, a social worker helping paedophiles!).\u201dAlthough Dunkelfeld has come in for criticism for focusing on the potential abusers rather than the abused, it has been supported by victims\u2019 groups in Germany and elsewhere. The family of April Jones, the five-year-old Welsh girl who was murdered by Mark Bridger in 2012, have appealed for help for paedophiles who seek it. \u201cIf someone says to the doctor: \u2018I have these feelings, can I have help?\u2019 it would be better to try to help them before they ruin someone else\u2019s family,\u201d Coral Jones said this year.Anne, now in her mid-20s, was abused as a child by her policeman stepfather and later discovered the man she was in a relationship with had a paedophilic disorder. She assists relatives and friends of paedophiles by helping them to access therapy. \u201cIf people search for help but can\u2019t get it, then there\u2019s something wrong with us as a society,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to think of the many children who I\u2019ve no doubt are saved because this therapy exists. It also prevents these men as well as the mothers and wives who so often protect them, from hiding from themselves anymore.\u201d", "tags": ["Mental health", "Health", "Society", "Germany", "Europe", "World news", "Child protection"], "title": "How Germany treats paedophiles before they offend"},{"date": "2016-02-16T08:00:06Z", "content": "In the St Annen-Museum in the northern German city of L\u00fcbeck, the novelist Erica Fischer is making a speech to open a new exhibition about how Germans get on with their neighbours. It is, to put it mildly, topical. \u201cI strongly hope that the fear Muslims have of becoming the new Jews of Europe will not come true,\u201d she says to her audience of overwhelmingly white, well-heeled and middle-aged citizens.Fischer \u2013 the author of Aim\u00e9e & Jaguar, the bestselling novel about the second world war love affair between two women, one a Jew, the other married to a Nazi \u2013 has reason to worry. A recent poll found that 60% of Germans believe their country cannot cope with the numbers of new arrivals, which reached 1.1 million in 2015, while 42% fear their cultural values are under threat.More than 70 years ago, Germans murdered millions of their Jewish neighbours, or stood by while they were sent to their deaths. In this beautiful old city, now a Unesco world heritage site, a community of more than 500 Jews was deported, most to be murdered in death camps or in the forests around Riga.Last August, Der Spiegel carried this front page headline: \u201cXenophobia is poisoning Germany.\u201d Since then, resentment of immigrants has risen. Recent examples include pubs and clubs in Freiburg banning immigrants and a swimming pool in Bornheim refusing to admit male refugees. Fischer mentions Cologne where, on New Year\u2019s Eve, sexual attacks against women were blamed on immigrant men. \u201cThose events,\u201d she says, \u201chave led to a renaissance of a very xenophobic, patriarchal and ultimately misogynistic climate in Germany.\u201dIn this toxic climate, the American artist Ken Aptekar is staging a show called Nachbarn, or Neighbours, using video, paintings and silverpoint drawings to explore what neighbourliness means. He was thinking about the theme long before Germany\u2019s \u2013 and Europe\u2019s \u2013 current refugee crisis. In 2006, he visited L\u00fcbeck and was struck by how the St Annen-Museum, a former Augustinian nunnery, was next door to one of the few German synagogues not to be burned down during Kristallnacht in 1938. How, Aptekar wondered, did these Christian and Jewish neighbours get along before and during the Holocaust?\u201cI wanted to do something that would speak to young L\u00fcbeckers,\u201d says Aptekar. \u201cI wanted to shift the Holocaust narrative from being about victimisation to otherness, immigration and community. Can people recognise and respect their profound differences and together build a vibrant community?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know 10 years ago how topical these questions would become, in a Europe still reeling after the Paris attacks. Strikingly, the names of the works have translations into German, English, Russian and Turkish. Why Russian and Turkish? Because L\u00fcbeck\u2019s synagogue is now a thriving place of worship for a 900-strong community of Jews, mostly from Russia; while, within walking distance of the museum, there are three mosques, whose worshippers are mostly Turkish-speaking.Aptekar is known as an appropriation artist. When I first interviewed him 16 years ago, he had an exhibition at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum called Q&A that involved him showing works from the museum\u2019s European collection to focus groups: redheads, African-Caribbean women, art students. He sandblasted their most interesting responses on to sheets of glass. Then he painted copies of details from the pictures discussed and attached the glass to them. He has done something similar in L\u00fcbeck, recycling imagery from Christian altarpieces in the St Annen collection, and overlaying them with texts carrying present day resonances. One room in Nachbarn features Aptekar\u2019s Carlebach Suite, six paintings dramatising the true story of a Jewish family from L\u00fcbeck.In the first painting, a detail from a 1475 altarpiece is overlaid with an unfurling, Torah-like scroll bearing the words: \u201c1941: Food rations for the Simson Carlebach family are reduced. Jews are not permitted to buy meat, milk, white bread or cigarettes and can shop only between the hours of 4pm and 5pm.\u201d The next painting\u2019s text reads: \u201cAfter nightfall, neighbours secretly provide the family with food that they leave outside their garden gate, a crime severely punished by the Nazis.\u201d The third reads: \u201cWhen the Carlebachs find out the Nazis are coming to pick them up, they tie a monogrammed kitchen towel to the garden gate, a final thank you and farewell.\u201d Most of the Carlebach family were deported to Riga in 1942 and murdered. But not all: son Felix managed to flee to Manchester where, from 1947 until his retirement in 1984, he was a rabbi at South Manchester Synagogue.'The smoke from your barbecue is really annoying,' reads the text on one paintingAlmost five decades after his family\u2019s murder, Felix Carlebach was invited back to L\u00fcbeck to be made an honorary citizen. During the ceremony in 1987, a woman approached him. \u201cOur parents were neighbours. I brought something that belongs to you,\u201d she said, and handed the rabbi the kitchen towel. The scene is commemorated in the last painting. \u201cWhat impressed me most,\u201d says Aptekar, \u201cis that the woman then just disappeared. She didn\u2019t want anything. She wanted to give and receive nothing back, not recognition, atonement, nothing.\u201d In the centre of the room is a vitrine containing that towel, brought from Manchester for the exhibition. Aptekar also tackles the everyday reality of having to live next door to someone whose values drive you nuts. \u201cYour dog shat in my kid\u2019s sandbox again,\u201d reads the scrolling text of one silverpoint drawing. \u201cThe smoke from your barbecues is really annoying,\u201d reads another.One of the most affecting parts of the show is a video installation Aptekar made after interviewing Rodolfo Hoffmann, the last surviving bar mitzvah boy from prewar L\u00fcbeck. Aptekar tracked him down to Santiago, Chile, where he filmed the 91-year-old recalling his childhood. Hoffmann describes a time of innocence, when he played with other kids, celebrating Christmas as well as marking Jewish holidays. Hoffmann says he scarcely felt Jewish: it took Hitler to do that.Hoffmann\u2019s father was partner in a shoe shop called Blumenthal\u2019s. When the Nazis came to power, a traffic cop would narrowly eye anybody who dared to go inside the Jewish-run business. Few did, trade collapsed, and Blumenthal\u2019s was sold at a rock-bottom price. The buyers were non-Jews who ran the shop under the name Sch\u00fcmann Schuhe until last October. Hoffmann\u2019s family managed to flee to Chile in 1936, just a few months after Rodolfo celebrated his bar mitzvah at the L\u00fcbeck synagogue, which the Nazis soon converted into a gym. Sad-eyed Hoffman remembers travelling halfway around the world to escape murder by Nazis only to be find himself living in a ghetto. His family would invite neighbours over for meals, but the offer was never reciprocated. \u201cSo we lived in a ghetto that we made ourselves,\u201d says Hoffman. At the end of the exhibition is the Jewish artist Max Liebermann\u2019s notorious 1879 painting The Twelve-Year-Old Jesus in the Temple, loaned from Hamburg\u2019s Kunsthalle. It\u2019s notorious because Liebermann repainted it following an antisemitic outcry over his depiction of Christ as a poor, barefoot Jewish urchin. Liebermann obligingly gave the boy blond hair and sandals, making him look less poor and less Jewish. In the context of Aptekar\u2019s show, the painting has an allegorical function: it\u2019s about the grotesqueness of forced integration, about what happens when difference is not respected but obliterated.Next to it, Aptekar has repainted Liebermann\u2019s repainted Jesus. He keeps the blond hair and the sandals but overlays the image with the words: \u201cDie Juden in die St Annen-Kirche\u201d (Jews in the St Anne Church). It serves as a reminder that all those figures in the museum\u2019s great Christian art collection were Jews, different from yet equal to Christians \u2013 just like its neighbours in the synagogue next door.\u2022 Nachbarn is at St Annen-Museum, L\u00fcbeck, until 29 May.", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Painting", "Exhibition", "Exhibitions", "Video art", "Drawing", "Holocaust", "Religion", "Culture", "Judaism", "Germany", "Europe"], "title": "What my blond Jesus could teach Germany"},{"date": "2015-11-13T11:25:21Z", "content": "The eurozone\u2019s economy lost steam in the latest quarter as Portugal stalled, Germany slowed and debt-stricken Greece contracted.Gross domestic product (GDP) across the 19 countries in the single currency bloc rose just 0.3% in the third quarter, according to Eurostat.

Meanwhile, manufacturers have been struggling with a slowdown in global demand on the back of China\u2019s downturn and turmoil in other emerging market economies.\u201cConsumers probably saved the day for the eurozone economy in the third quarter.

The coach carries a sign saying Reisegenuss, meaning \u201ctravel in comfort\u201d.Saxony\u2019s interior minister Markus Ulbig, a member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic party, said: \u201cAs much need for a discussion there may be over the refugee question: I find it deeply shameful to see how people are being treated here.\u201d Related: Germany braces for rise in anti-immigrant attacks The mayor of Rechenberg-Bienenm\u00fchle, the municipality where the video was recorded, said he too felt ashamed by the incident, while claiming that the protests were not directed at the refugees themselves. \u201cThis was about politics, not the people themselves,\u201d said Michael Funke.According to police reports, 100 anti-refugee protesters gathered on Thursday evening at about 7.20pm outside the asylum seekers\u2019 accommodation in the village of Clausnitz, 19 miles south of Dresden. Vehicles were used to block access to the building.One of the protesters threatened the group inside the bus with a cut-throat gesture, a witness told Freie Presse newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace, this hatred people feel towards people they know nothing about,\u201d an anonymous witness said.

The UK still has the most installed offshore wind power in Europe, at 5,061MW to Germany\u2019s total of 3,295MW.A spokesman for the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA), which published the figures, said that the UK had attracted more investment than Germany last year, but installed less capacity, as Germany cleared a backlog that had built up in 2014.\u201cGermany was the engine behind the record year in 2015 and we would expect it to continue its lead,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cGermany will be a big offshore story towards 2020 certainly.\u201d The offshore wind industry is generally positive towards the subsidy regime promised by UK energy secretary, Amber Rudd, of three more \u201ccontracts for difference\u201d auctions before 2020. But the spokesman said: \u201cclarity on the arrangement of these auctions is essential.\u201dOverall offshore wind investment in Europe doubled to \u20ac13.3bn last year, in a record year for the budding green tech sector.But a dip in grid connections is expected in 2016, with more capacity coming online towards the decade\u2019s end. In a sign that the industry is fast developing, year-on-year wind turbine orders were up 75% last year. Offshore platforms were built further out to sea - 43km on average - and in deeper waters, typically around 27m.Europe\u2019s three offshore leaders - Germany, the UK and the Netherlands - are still working on six offshore projects, whose grid connection should add another 15% of offshore capacity to Europe\u2019s power system.  \u201cThe financing is there, the order book is strong, now we need policymakers to come forward with a regulatory vision that will inspire confidence for investors and developers post-2020,\u201d the EWEA spokesman said.E.ON was the industry\u2019s largest developer in 2014, with 17% of connections, followed closely by RWE and EnBW.Offshore\u2019s rapid growth was not confined to Europe, with the number of global platforms growing by a factor of four to provide 4,000 MW of grid-connected electricity, twice the previous record set in 2013, according to BNEF.China had the most eye-catching achievement, installing 29,000 MW, a 40% increase on its previous record and almost as much as the rest of the world combined. \u201c2015 was a fantastic year for the wind industry.\u201d said Amy Grace, head of Wind Insight for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cChina was by far the biggest surprise.

His hands were clammy and his heart was beating fast, but he took a deep breath as he stepped inside the ivy-clad red-brick building of the Charit\u00e9 hospital and climbed the stairs to meet the group. When he saw them, he got his next shock.\u201cThere were thin, fat, tall and short men, aged between 20 and 60. I found out there was a banker, a church warden, a doctor, a student, an unemployed bloke, an actor \u2013 people from all walks of life.\u201d What Weber, then an engineering student in his mid-20s, had in common with the others was that they were all diagnosed paedophiles who had come voluntarily to receive treatment at the Charit\u00e9\u2019s institute for sexual medicine. \u201cIt was amazing for me to see how different everyone was,\u201d said Weber. \u201cI\u2019d never met another paedophile before.\u201dThe institute has been running the prevention project Dunkelfeld (which means dark field) for a decade. Since 2011, it has gradually developed into a nationwide network called \u201cdon\u2019t offend\u201d. What started in Berlin has spread to 10 other cities, with more centres planned so that eventually the programme will be easily accessible for anyone in Germany.There is a radical difference between the treatment offered to paedophiles in Germany and that in other countries. Strict patient-doctor confidentiality rules mean the men can be assured they will not be reported to the police. They would only be excluded from the programme if there was an active prosecution against them. Related: Paedophilia: bringing dark desires to light \u201cI did not have to give my name and address, and I was given a pin number to connect me to my diagnosis data,\u201d Weber, his chosen pseudonym, told the Guardian in a burger bar in central Berlin.Those who run Dunkelfeld insist that the confidentiality clause is central to the unique project\u2019s success and also accounts for its popularity. \u201cAccording to the German legal code, therapists are forbidden from revealing anything that happens in the context of treatment,\u201d said Laura Kuhle, a clinical psychologist and one of Dunkelfeld\u2019s therapists. \u201cIf people mention anything in therapy that could make them criminally culpable, they are protected. In other countries, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Kuhle is convinced that, if patients were not guaranteed that confidentiality, most would not turn up at all and those that did would not be truly honest.\u201cWe need them to be completely open about what has happened in their pasts, so that we can work with them as effectively as possible. What situations have they found themselves in? What were the individual events that led up to what\u2019s happened to them until now? You can\u2019t answer questions like that if you are afraid,\u201d Kuhle said.For Weber, who is keen to stress he has never offended although he admits to having been dangerously close to doing so, the confidentiality clause was key. \u201cI was so petrified of anyone even finding out I was thinking of doing it, because of the obvious stigma attached to being a paedophile, I memorised the telephone number before calling the centre, out of fear that someone might find the number on me. That way no one could suspect me of anything,\u201d he said. It was during puberty that Weber first recognised his sexual attraction towards young girls. \u201cI found the feelings threatening, exceptionally unpleasant, but I couldn\u2019t really put a name to them,\u201d he said. . \u201cI recognised that this had the potential to get very dangerous when I was in my early 20s, particularly after one encounter I had with a girl on a beach. I recognised I was drawn towards doing something sexual with the girl, at the same time as not wanting to do it at all because I knew it was wrong.\u201dThree times he planned to carry out what he calls \u201cconcrete assaults\u201d on young children. Three times he was prevented from doing so by a mix of circumstance and his own fear. His mother, who apparently knew nothing of his tendencies, pointed out a television advert for Dunkelfeld. The ad asked: \u201cDo you love children more than you\u2019d like to?\u201d and promised free therapy with medical confidentiality. Related: Channel 4 film features paedophile confessing attraction to children Weber took down the number and went to a phone box to ring the hotline. \u201cIt felt surreal as it was the first time in my life I had talked to anyone about it, and the woman on the other end was so friendly, she talked to me as naturally as if she was giving me a recipe for biscuits,\u201d he said. At a subsequent appointment, Weber was diagnosed as a heteropaedophile because his feelings of sexual attraction for women were clearly subordinated by a stronger attraction towards young girls. He began the weekly three-hour therapy sessions, overseen by two therapists, with between six to 10 participants. The sessions took place at the end of a normal working day and were based on cognitive behavioural therapy methods.\u201cAt the start of each session, the participants talk about their experiences of the past week and what is on their minds,\u201d said Kuhle. The treatment includes helping participants to understand the child\u2019s perspective, learning to cope in potentially difficult situations such as birthday parties, and developing ways to overcome bad habits such as viewing pornographic images or having sexual fantasies, which can increase the likelihood of a paedophile offending. \u201cSometimes,\u201d said Weber, \u201cthe survival tactics involve something as simple as saying to yourself \u2018count backwards from 100, in units of seven\u2019.\u201d But Weber was told early on that paedophilia, according to current understandings, is a non-curable mental disorder without a known cause.Sessions accordingly touched on what could realistically be changed and what would stay the same. \u201cThat was a blow, to know I couldn\u2019t be cured, but at the same time, there was relief to know it wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cVital for me was finally being able to look at myself in the mirror and say \u2018you\u2019re not a monster, you\u2019re a paedophile\u2019, and that\u2019s okay as long as you don\u2019t abuse a child.\u201dLearning to control his feelings was the most important aspect of the sessions. \u201cI am responsible for my behaviour. If someone says they can\u2019t control themselves, that\u2019s just not true.\u201d Which is not to say he didn\u2019t struggle. \u201cThere were several times I wanted to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re taking yourself apart and putting yourself back together again with the tools to cope and it was incredibly scary.\u201dWeber, who runs a support group for non-offending paedophiles called Schicksal und Herausforderung (fate and challenge) sports a beard and a burgundy T-shirt. He is not someone who would stand out in a crowd.  Related: Reducing harm done by and to paedophiles | Letters Statistics gathered by the Charit\u00e9\u2019s therapists indicate that, of 440 paedophile patients they have so far treated, the average age is 37, 71% are employed, 39% are in relationships, while 36% are the caregivers for one or more children. They are almost always male. \u201cWe have been contacted by 17 women in the last decade. Only one of these would I say had a paedophilic disorder,\u201d said Kuhle.Perhaps surprisingly, the project has the strong backing of Germany\u2019s conservatives. The ruling Christian Democratic party (CDU) of Angela Merkel is highly supportive and pushing for health insurers to fund the therapy, which costs \u20ac5m-\u20ac8m a year. So far financing has come from government and charitable grants.In a recent policy paper on the subject, the CDU argued that the best protection for children \u201cwould be for people with a paedophilic disposition (of whom it is estimated there are around 250,000 in Germany) not to become offenders in the first place\u201d. \u201cBut in order to lessen the number of attacks by paedophiles, our healthcare system must provide sufficient and low-threshold treatment possibilities for them \u2026 on a financially sustainable and anonymous basis,\u201d it advised.By its very nature, it is almost impossible to evaluate the project\u2019s success. While a paedophile who has participated might be asked if the treatment had prevented him from offending, any answer is likely to be highly subjective and possibly unreliable. To measure its success according to the number of recorded cases of child abuse is also problematic, as those rates are known to have gone up if only because of the increasing number of abuse victims who feel prepared to come forward as the subject has become less taboo.But experts like Kuhle say the popularity of Dunkelfeld among paedophiles is proof of how vital it is. \u201cI meet many colleagues from other countries, particularly the UK and the US, who would like to introduce this therapy and are in the process of trying to roll it out, but are often hindered from doing so by the legal restrictions.\u201dAfter Channel 4 screened the documentary The Paedophile Next Door, which featured the institute\u2019s unique style of therapy, last November, Dunkelfeld\u2019s hotline was inundated with calls from Britons with paedophilic disorders. Therapists say they were frustrated at not being able to help.One British man was so desperate, he moved to Germany to be able to access a Dunkelfeld programme. In an email exchange with the Guardian, the man, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote: \u201cSo far, all I have ever received from the NHS is doors slammed in my face.\u201cDespite paedophilia being listed as a mental illness in the DSM (the standard classification of mental disorders), they don\u2019t want to help you, they just want to see you locked up or perhaps even burnt at the stake. I am so sick and tired of UK medical \u2018professionals\u2019 looking at me as if I\u2019ve grown horns and a barbed tail.\u201cI moved to Germany for therapy, I am learning German and I have a social worker helping me. (Yes, a social worker helping paedophiles!).\u201dAlthough Dunkelfeld has come in for criticism for focusing on the potential abusers rather than the abused, it has been supported by victims\u2019 groups in Germany and elsewhere. The family of April Jones, the five-year-old Welsh girl who was murdered by Mark Bridger in 2012, have appealed for help for paedophiles who seek it. \u201cIf someone says to the doctor: \u2018I have these feelings, can I have help?\u2019 it would be better to try to help them before they ruin someone else\u2019s family,\u201d Coral Jones said this year.Anne, now in her mid-20s, was abused as a child by her policeman stepfather and later discovered the man she was in a relationship with had a paedophilic disorder. She assists relatives and friends of paedophiles by helping them to access therapy. \u201cIf people search for help but can\u2019t get it, then there\u2019s something wrong with us as a society,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to think of the many children who I\u2019ve no doubt are saved because this therapy exists. It also prevents these men as well as the mothers and wives who so often protect them, from hiding from themselves anymore.\u201d", "tags": ["Mental health", "Health", "Society", "Germany", "Europe", "World news", "Child protection"], "title": "How Germany treats paedophiles before they offend"},{"date": "2015-10-14T20:30:18Z", "content": "An intense heatwave in southern California smashed records last Friday as temperatures topped 40C (104F).

It is, to put it mildly, topical. \u201cI strongly hope that the fear Muslims have of becoming the new Jews of Europe will not come true,\u201d she says to her audience of overwhelmingly white, well-heeled and middle-aged citizens.Fischer \u2013 the author of Aim\u00e9e & Jaguar, the bestselling novel about the second world war love affair between two women, one a Jew, the other married to a Nazi \u2013 has reason to worry. A recent poll found that 60% of Germans believe their country cannot cope with the numbers of new arrivals, which reached 1.1 million in 2015, while 42% fear their cultural values are under threat.More than 70 years ago, Germans murdered millions of their Jewish neighbours, or stood by while they were sent to their deaths. In this beautiful old city, now a Unesco world heritage site, a community of more than 500 Jews was deported, most to be murdered in death camps or in the forests around Riga.Last August, Der Spiegel carried this front page headline: \u201cXenophobia is poisoning Germany.\u201d Since then, resentment of immigrants has risen. Recent examples include pubs and clubs in Freiburg banning immigrants and a swimming pool in Bornheim refusing to admit male refugees. Fischer mentions Cologne where, on New Year\u2019s Eve, sexual attacks against women were blamed on immigrant men. \u201cThose events,\u201d she says, \u201chave led to a renaissance of a very xenophobic, patriarchal and ultimately misogynistic climate in Germany.\u201dIn this toxic climate, the American artist Ken Aptekar is staging a show called Nachbarn, or Neighbours, using video, paintings and silverpoint drawings to explore what neighbourliness means. He was thinking about the theme long before Germany\u2019s \u2013 and Europe\u2019s \u2013 current refugee crisis. In 2006, he visited L\u00fcbeck and was struck by how the St Annen-Museum, a former Augustinian nunnery, was next door to one of the few German synagogues not to be burned down during Kristallnacht in 1938. How, Aptekar wondered, did these Christian and Jewish neighbours get along before and during the Holocaust?\u201cI wanted to do something that would speak to young L\u00fcbeckers,\u201d says Aptekar. \u201cI wanted to shift the Holocaust narrative from being about victimisation to otherness, immigration and community. Can people recognise and respect their profound differences and together build a vibrant community?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know 10 years ago how topical these questions would become, in a Europe still reeling after the Paris attacks. Strikingly, the names of the works have translations into German, English, Russian and Turkish. Why Russian and Turkish? Because L\u00fcbeck\u2019s synagogue is now a thriving place of worship for a 900-strong community of Jews, mostly from Russia; while, within walking distance of the museum, there are three mosques, whose worshippers are mostly Turkish-speaking.Aptekar is known as an appropriation artist. When I first interviewed him 16 years ago, he had an exhibition at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum called Q&A that involved him showing works from the museum\u2019s European collection to focus groups: redheads, African-Caribbean women, art students. He sandblasted their most interesting responses on to sheets of glass. Then he painted copies of details from the pictures discussed and attached the glass to them. He has done something similar in L\u00fcbeck, recycling imagery from Christian altarpieces in the St Annen collection, and overlaying them with texts carrying present day resonances. One room in Nachbarn features Aptekar\u2019s Carlebach Suite, six paintings dramatising the true story of a Jewish family from L\u00fcbeck.In the first painting, a detail from a 1475 altarpiece is overlaid with an unfurling, Torah-like scroll bearing the words: \u201c1941: Food rations for the Simson Carlebach family are reduced. Jews are not permitted to buy meat, milk, white bread or cigarettes and can shop only between the hours of 4pm and 5pm.\u201d The next painting\u2019s text reads: \u201cAfter nightfall, neighbours secretly provide the family with food that they leave outside their garden gate, a crime severely punished by the Nazis.\u201d The third reads: \u201cWhen the Carlebachs find out the Nazis are coming to pick them up, they tie a monogrammed kitchen towel to the garden gate, a final thank you and farewell.\u201d Most of the Carlebach family were deported to Riga in 1942 and murdered. But not all: son Felix managed to flee to Manchester where, from 1947 until his retirement in 1984, he was a rabbi at South Manchester Synagogue.'The smoke from your barbecue is really annoying,' reads the text on one paintingAlmost five decades after his family\u2019s murder, Felix Carlebach was invited back to L\u00fcbeck to be made an honorary citizen. During the ceremony in 1987, a woman approached him. \u201cOur parents were neighbours. I brought something that belongs to you,\u201d she said, and handed the rabbi the kitchen towel. The scene is commemorated in the last painting. \u201cWhat impressed me most,\u201d says Aptekar, \u201cis that the woman then just disappeared. She didn\u2019t want anything. She wanted to give and receive nothing back, not recognition, atonement, nothing.\u201d In the centre of the room is a vitrine containing that towel, brought from Manchester for the exhibition. Aptekar also tackles the everyday reality of having to live next door to someone whose values drive you nuts. \u201cYour dog shat in my kid\u2019s sandbox again,\u201d reads the scrolling text of one silverpoint drawing. \u201cThe smoke from your barbecues is really annoying,\u201d reads another.One of the most affecting parts of the show is a video installation Aptekar made after interviewing Rodolfo Hoffmann, the last surviving bar mitzvah boy from prewar L\u00fcbeck. Aptekar tracked him down to Santiago, Chile, where he filmed the 91-year-old recalling his childhood. Hoffmann describes a time of innocence, when he played with other kids, celebrating Christmas as well as marking Jewish holidays. Hoffmann says he scarcely felt Jewish: it took Hitler to do that.Hoffmann\u2019s father was partner in a shoe shop called Blumenthal\u2019s. When the Nazis came to power, a traffic cop would narrowly eye anybody who dared to go inside the Jewish-run business. Few did, trade collapsed, and Blumenthal\u2019s was sold at a rock-bottom price. The buyers were non-Jews who ran the shop under the name Sch\u00fcmann Schuhe until last October. Hoffmann\u2019s family managed to flee to Chile in 1936, just a few months after Rodolfo celebrated his bar mitzvah at the L\u00fcbeck synagogue, which the Nazis soon converted into a gym. Sad-eyed Hoffman remembers travelling halfway around the world to escape murder by Nazis only to be find himself living in a ghetto. His family would invite neighbours over for meals, but the offer was never reciprocated. \u201cSo we lived in a ghetto that we made ourselves,\u201d says Hoffman. At the end of the exhibition is the Jewish artist Max Liebermann\u2019s notorious 1879 painting The Twelve-Year-Old Jesus in the Temple, loaned from Hamburg\u2019s Kunsthalle. It\u2019s notorious because Liebermann repainted it following an antisemitic outcry over his depiction of Christ as a poor, barefoot Jewish urchin. Liebermann obligingly gave the boy blond hair and sandals, making him look less poor and less Jewish. In the context of Aptekar\u2019s show, the painting has an allegorical function: it\u2019s about the grotesqueness of forced integration, about what happens when difference is not respected but obliterated.Next to it, Aptekar has repainted Liebermann\u2019s repainted Jesus. He keeps the blond hair and the sandals but overlays the image with the words: \u201cDie Juden in die St Annen-Kirche\u201d (Jews in the St Anne Church). It serves as a reminder that all those figures in the museum\u2019s great Christian art collection were Jews, different from yet equal to Christians \u2013 just like its neighbours in the synagogue next door.\u2022 Nachbarn is at St Annen-Museum, L\u00fcbeck, until 29 May.", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Painting", "Exhibition", "Exhibitions", "Video art", "Drawing", "Holocaust", "Religion", "Culture", "Judaism", "Germany", "Europe"], "title": "What my blond Jesus could teach Germany"},{"date": "2015-11-13T11:25:21Z", "content": "The eurozone\u2019s economy lost steam in the latest quarter as Portugal stalled, Germany slowed and debt-stricken Greece contracted.Gross domestic product (GDP) across the 19 countries in the single currency bloc rose just 0.3% in the third quarter, according to Eurostat.

The UK still has the most installed offshore wind power in Europe, at 5,061MW to Germany\u2019s total of 3,295MW.A spokesman for the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA), which published the figures, said that the UK had attracted more investment than Germany last year, but installed less capacity, as Germany cleared a backlog that had built up in 2014.\u201cGermany was the engine behind the record year in 2015 and we would expect it to continue its lead,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cGermany will be a big offshore story towards 2020 certainly.\u201d The offshore wind industry is generally positive towards the subsidy regime promised by UK energy secretary, Amber Rudd, of three more \u201ccontracts for difference\u201d auctions before 2020. But the spokesman said: \u201cclarity on the arrangement of these auctions is essential.\u201dOverall offshore wind investment in Europe doubled to \u20ac13.3bn last year, in a record year for the budding green tech sector.But a dip in grid connections is expected in 2016, with more capacity coming online towards the decade\u2019s end. In a sign that the industry is fast developing, year-on-year wind turbine orders were up 75% last year. Offshore platforms were built further out to sea - 43km on average - and in deeper waters, typically around 27m.Europe\u2019s three offshore leaders - Germany, the UK and the Netherlands - are still working on six offshore projects, whose grid connection should add another 15% of offshore capacity to Europe\u2019s power system.  \u201cThe financing is there, the order book is strong, now we need policymakers to come forward with a regulatory vision that will inspire confidence for investors and developers post-2020,\u201d the EWEA spokesman said.E.ON was the industry\u2019s largest developer in 2014, with 17% of connections, followed closely by RWE and EnBW.Offshore\u2019s rapid growth was not confined to Europe, with the number of global platforms growing by a factor of four to provide 4,000 MW of grid-connected electricity, twice the previous record set in 2013, according to BNEF.China had the most eye-catching achievement, installing 29,000 MW, a 40% increase on its previous record and almost as much as the rest of the world combined. \u201c2015 was a fantastic year for the wind industry.\u201d said Amy Grace, head of Wind Insight for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cChina was by far the biggest surprise.

His hands were clammy and his heart was beating fast, but he took a deep breath as he stepped inside the ivy-clad red-brick building of the Charit\u00e9 hospital and climbed the stairs to meet the group. When he saw them, he got his next shock.\u201cThere were thin, fat, tall and short men, aged between 20 and 60. I found out there was a banker, a church warden, a doctor, a student, an unemployed bloke, an actor \u2013 people from all walks of life.\u201d What Weber, then an engineering student in his mid-20s, had in common with the others was that they were all diagnosed paedophiles who had come voluntarily to receive treatment at the Charit\u00e9\u2019s institute for sexual medicine. \u201cIt was amazing for me to see how different everyone was,\u201d said Weber. \u201cI\u2019d never met another paedophile before.\u201dThe institute has been running the prevention project Dunkelfeld (which means dark field) for a decade. Since 2011, it has gradually developed into a nationwide network called \u201cdon\u2019t offend\u201d. What started in Berlin has spread to 10 other cities, with more centres planned so that eventually the programme will be easily accessible for anyone in Germany.There is a radical difference between the treatment offered to paedophiles in Germany and that in other countries. Strict patient-doctor confidentiality rules mean the men can be assured they will not be reported to the police. They would only be excluded from the programme if there was an active prosecution against them. Related: Paedophilia: bringing dark desires to light \u201cI did not have to give my name and address, and I was given a pin number to connect me to my diagnosis data,\u201d Weber, his chosen pseudonym, told the Guardian in a burger bar in central Berlin.Those who run Dunkelfeld insist that the confidentiality clause is central to the unique project\u2019s success and also accounts for its popularity. \u201cAccording to the German legal code, therapists are forbidden from revealing anything that happens in the context of treatment,\u201d said Laura Kuhle, a clinical psychologist and one of Dunkelfeld\u2019s therapists. \u201cIf people mention anything in therapy that could make them criminally culpable, they are protected. In other countries, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Kuhle is convinced that, if patients were not guaranteed that confidentiality, most would not turn up at all and those that did would not be truly honest.\u201cWe need them to be completely open about what has happened in their pasts, so that we can work with them as effectively as possible. What situations have they found themselves in? What were the individual events that led up to what\u2019s happened to them until now? You can\u2019t answer questions like that if you are afraid,\u201d Kuhle said.For Weber, who is keen to stress he has never offended although he admits to having been dangerously close to doing so, the confidentiality clause was key. \u201cI was so petrified of anyone even finding out I was thinking of doing it, because of the obvious stigma attached to being a paedophile, I memorised the telephone number before calling the centre, out of fear that someone might find the number on me. That way no one could suspect me of anything,\u201d he said. It was during puberty that Weber first recognised his sexual attraction towards young girls. \u201cI found the feelings threatening, exceptionally unpleasant, but I couldn\u2019t really put a name to them,\u201d he said. . \u201cI recognised that this had the potential to get very dangerous when I was in my early 20s, particularly after one encounter I had with a girl on a beach. I recognised I was drawn towards doing something sexual with the girl, at the same time as not wanting to do it at all because I knew it was wrong.\u201dThree times he planned to carry out what he calls \u201cconcrete assaults\u201d on young children. Three times he was prevented from doing so by a mix of circumstance and his own fear. His mother, who apparently knew nothing of his tendencies, pointed out a television advert for Dunkelfeld. The ad asked: \u201cDo you love children more than you\u2019d like to?\u201d and promised free therapy with medical confidentiality. Related: Channel 4 film features paedophile confessing attraction to children Weber took down the number and went to a phone box to ring the hotline. \u201cIt felt surreal as it was the first time in my life I had talked to anyone about it, and the woman on the other end was so friendly, she talked to me as naturally as if she was giving me a recipe for biscuits,\u201d he said. At a subsequent appointment, Weber was diagnosed as a heteropaedophile because his feelings of sexual attraction for women were clearly subordinated by a stronger attraction towards young girls. He began the weekly three-hour therapy sessions, overseen by two therapists, with between six to 10 participants. The sessions took place at the end of a normal working day and were based on cognitive behavioural therapy methods.\u201cAt the start of each session, the participants talk about their experiences of the past week and what is on their minds,\u201d said Kuhle. The treatment includes helping participants to understand the child\u2019s perspective, learning to cope in potentially difficult situations such as birthday parties, and developing ways to overcome bad habits such as viewing pornographic images or having sexual fantasies, which can increase the likelihood of a paedophile offending. \u201cSometimes,\u201d said Weber, \u201cthe survival tactics involve something as simple as saying to yourself \u2018count backwards from 100, in units of seven\u2019.\u201d But Weber was told early on that paedophilia, according to current understandings, is a non-curable mental disorder without a known cause.Sessions accordingly touched on what could realistically be changed and what would stay the same. \u201cThat was a blow, to know I couldn\u2019t be cured, but at the same time, there was relief to know it wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cVital for me was finally being able to look at myself in the mirror and say \u2018you\u2019re not a monster, you\u2019re a paedophile\u2019, and that\u2019s okay as long as you don\u2019t abuse a child.\u201dLearning to control his feelings was the most important aspect of the sessions. \u201cI am responsible for my behaviour. If someone says they can\u2019t control themselves, that\u2019s just not true.\u201d Which is not to say he didn\u2019t struggle. \u201cThere were several times I wanted to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re taking yourself apart and putting yourself back together again with the tools to cope and it was incredibly scary.\u201dWeber, who runs a support group for non-offending paedophiles called Schicksal und Herausforderung (fate and challenge) sports a beard and a burgundy T-shirt. He is not someone who would stand out in a crowd.  Related: Reducing harm done by and to paedophiles | Letters Statistics gathered by the Charit\u00e9\u2019s therapists indicate that, of 440 paedophile patients they have so far treated, the average age is 37, 71% are employed, 39% are in relationships, while 36% are the caregivers for one or more children. They are almost always male. \u201cWe have been contacted by 17 women in the last decade. Only one of these would I say had a paedophilic disorder,\u201d said Kuhle.Perhaps surprisingly, the project has the strong backing of Germany\u2019s conservatives. The ruling Christian Democratic party (CDU) of Angela Merkel is highly supportive and pushing for health insurers to fund the therapy, which costs \u20ac5m-\u20ac8m a year. So far financing has come from government and charitable grants.In a recent policy paper on the subject, the CDU argued that the best protection for children \u201cwould be for people with a paedophilic disposition (of whom it is estimated there are around 250,000 in Germany) not to become offenders in the first place\u201d. \u201cBut in order to lessen the number of attacks by paedophiles, our healthcare system must provide sufficient and low-threshold treatment possibilities for them \u2026 on a financially sustainable and anonymous basis,\u201d it advised.By its very nature, it is almost impossible to evaluate the project\u2019s success. While a paedophile who has participated might be asked if the treatment had prevented him from offending, any answer is likely to be highly subjective and possibly unreliable. To measure its success according to the number of recorded cases of child abuse is also problematic, as those rates are known to have gone up if only because of the increasing number of abuse victims who feel prepared to come forward as the subject has become less taboo.But experts like Kuhle say the popularity of Dunkelfeld among paedophiles is proof of how vital it is. \u201cI meet many colleagues from other countries, particularly the UK and the US, who would like to introduce this therapy and are in the process of trying to roll it out, but are often hindered from doing so by the legal restrictions.\u201dAfter Channel 4 screened the documentary The Paedophile Next Door, which featured the institute\u2019s unique style of therapy, last November, Dunkelfeld\u2019s hotline was inundated with calls from Britons with paedophilic disorders. Therapists say they were frustrated at not being able to help.One British man was so desperate, he moved to Germany to be able to access a Dunkelfeld programme. In an email exchange with the Guardian, the man, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote: \u201cSo far, all I have ever received from the NHS is doors slammed in my face.\u201cDespite paedophilia being listed as a mental illness in the DSM (the standard classification of mental disorders), they don\u2019t want to help you, they just want to see you locked up or perhaps even burnt at the stake. I am so sick and tired of UK medical \u2018professionals\u2019 looking at me as if I\u2019ve grown horns and a barbed tail.\u201cI moved to Germany for therapy, I am learning German and I have a social worker helping me. (Yes, a social worker helping paedophiles!).\u201dAlthough Dunkelfeld has come in for criticism for focusing on the potential abusers rather than the abused, it has been supported by victims\u2019 groups in Germany and elsewhere. The family of April Jones, the five-year-old Welsh girl who was murdered by Mark Bridger in 2012, have appealed for help for paedophiles who seek it. \u201cIf someone says to the doctor: \u2018I have these feelings, can I have help?\u2019 it would be better to try to help them before they ruin someone else\u2019s family,\u201d Coral Jones said this year.Anne, now in her mid-20s, was abused as a child by her policeman stepfather and later discovered the man she was in a relationship with had a paedophilic disorder. She assists relatives and friends of paedophiles by helping them to access therapy. \u201cIf people search for help but can\u2019t get it, then there\u2019s something wrong with us as a society,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to think of the many children who I\u2019ve no doubt are saved because this therapy exists.

But this is a case where geopolitics can hardly be ignored, and where history looms heavily.German-Polish rapprochement has been a staple of European stability and enlargement over the past 25 yearsFor Europe, the biggest risk over Poland relates not just to the rule of law but to the damage that could be done to one of Europe\u2019s key pillars: German-Polish post-cold war reconciliation.Just as Franco-German reconciliation was essential to the European project from its founding in the 1950s, German-Polish rapprochement has been a staple of European stability and enlargement over the past 25 years. That picture has suddenly turned bleak.Germany is being framed by the new Polish ruling elite as an enemy, with one magazine even depicting Angela Merkel in a Nazi uniform. The contrast could not be starker with the message given five years ago by the then Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski, who described Germany as \u201cEurope\u2019s indispensable nation\u201d and said he feared \u201cGerman power less than German inactivity\u201d. No doubt Sikorski had the eurozone crisis in mind at the time, but the historical sweep of his language was obvious.That the new Polish government wants to conflate Germany with all the woes it sees in the EU is one thing \u2013 other critics of Brussels, in Greece and elsewhere, have resorted to similar reflexes in recent years. But this time a strategic divide risks opening up in the heart of Europe.It is significant that Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, who runs Poland\u2019s majority party, held a long one-to-one meeting with Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n last week, seemingly aimed at consolidating a central European populistic, illiberal axis, intended to counter pressure from Brussels or western European nations. This is one development Britain should pay closer attention to \u2013 and not just because Cameron has a wishlist.United by an authoritarian, nationalistic streak, Poland and Hungary can now work on spreading their political alliance to neighbouring states, where populism is on the rise. The refugee issue is an obvious rallying point. On this issue as on others, from climate change to sanctions, the ability of EU states to act together is ultimately at stake.With Britain more or less out of the picture, and with France more focused on counter-terrorism, it will be yet again up to Merkel to try to address this new problem of European cohesion. On one hand, that is a shame, because for many historical reasons Britain and France have a special relationship with Poland. On the other hand, it is hardly surprising. Poland\u2019s economy is closely connected to Germany\u2019s.Merkel has stayed remarkably aloof from the dispute, playing for time as she often does. Meanwhile Martin Schulz, the German head of the European parliament \u2013 which is due to debate Poland\u2019s democratic backsliding on Tuesday \u2013 has lashed out at the Kaczy\u0144ski team with talk of a \u201ccoup\u201d and of a \u201cPutinisation of European politics\u201d. Some EU officials say they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Merkel suddenly met the new Polish prime minister for a hard-headed conversation, just as she did with Orb\u00e1n last year when the Ukrainian crisis required European unity.Of course, it doesn\u2019t help that the EU has mostly let Orb\u00e1n off the hook over his autocratic methods. Coming down hard now on Poland, however justified it may be, could be taken as a double standard. Stepping back, all this shows the extent to which Europe\u2019s reunification after 1989 remains a work in progress, even if the process has brought so many accomplishments and has inspired so many, in Ukraine and beyond. There is no risk of Poland dropping out of the EU \u2013 unlike Britain \u2013 but, taken together, the faultlines are dangerous. British politicians would be mistaken to think the German-Polish split is somebody else\u2019s business, far away.", "tags": ["European Union", "Poland", "Germany", "Europe", "World news", "Hungary", "Angela Merkel"], "title": "A new faultline has opened up between Germany and Poland | Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de"},{"date": "2016-02-16T08:00:06Z", "content": "In the St Annen-Museum in the northern German city of L\u00fcbeck, the novelist Erica Fischer is making a speech to open a new exhibition about how Germans get on with their neighbours. It is, to put it mildly, topical. \u201cI strongly hope that the fear Muslims have of becoming the new Jews of Europe will not come true,\u201d she says to her audience of overwhelmingly white, well-heeled and middle-aged citizens.Fischer \u2013 the author of Aim\u00e9e & Jaguar, the bestselling novel about the second world war love affair between two women, one a Jew, the other married to a Nazi \u2013 has reason to worry. A recent poll found that 60% of Germans believe their country cannot cope with the numbers of new arrivals, which reached 1.1 million in 2015, while 42% fear their cultural values are under threat.More than 70 years ago, Germans murdered millions of their Jewish neighbours, or stood by while they were sent to their deaths. In this beautiful old city, now a Unesco world heritage site, a community of more than 500 Jews was deported, most to be murdered in death camps or in the forests around Riga.Last August, Der Spiegel carried this front page headline: \u201cXenophobia is poisoning Germany.\u201d Since then, resentment of immigrants has risen. Recent examples include pubs and clubs in Freiburg banning immigrants and a swimming pool in Bornheim refusing to admit male refugees. Fischer mentions Cologne where, on New Year\u2019s Eve, sexual attacks against women were blamed on immigrant men. \u201cThose events,\u201d she says, \u201chave led to a renaissance of a very xenophobic, patriarchal and ultimately misogynistic climate in Germany.\u201dIn this toxic climate, the American artist Ken Aptekar is staging a show called Nachbarn, or Neighbours, using video, paintings and silverpoint drawings to explore what neighbourliness means. He was thinking about the theme long before Germany\u2019s \u2013 and Europe\u2019s \u2013 current refugee crisis. In 2006, he visited L\u00fcbeck and was struck by how the St Annen-Museum, a former Augustinian nunnery, was next door to one of the few German synagogues not to be burned down during Kristallnacht in 1938. How, Aptekar wondered, did these Christian and Jewish neighbours get along before and during the Holocaust?\u201cI wanted to do something that would speak to young L\u00fcbeckers,\u201d says Aptekar. \u201cI wanted to shift the Holocaust narrative from being about victimisation to otherness, immigration and community. Can people recognise and respect their profound differences and together build a vibrant community?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know 10 years ago how topical these questions would become, in a Europe still reeling after the Paris attacks. Strikingly, the names of the works have translations into German, English, Russian and Turkish. Why Russian and Turkish? Because L\u00fcbeck\u2019s synagogue is now a thriving place of worship for a 900-strong community of Jews, mostly from Russia; while, within walking distance of the museum, there are three mosques, whose worshippers are mostly Turkish-speaking.Aptekar is known as an appropriation artist. When I first interviewed him 16 years ago, he had an exhibition at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum called Q&A that involved him showing works from the museum\u2019s European collection to focus groups: redheads, African-Caribbean women, art students. He sandblasted their most interesting responses on to sheets of glass. Then he painted copies of details from the pictures discussed and attached the glass to them. He has done something similar in L\u00fcbeck, recycling imagery from Christian altarpieces in the St Annen collection, and overlaying them with texts carrying present day resonances. One room in Nachbarn features Aptekar\u2019s Carlebach Suite, six paintings dramatising the true story of a Jewish family from L\u00fcbeck.In the first painting, a detail from a 1475 altarpiece is overlaid with an unfurling, Torah-like scroll bearing the words: \u201c1941: Food rations for the Simson Carlebach family are reduced. Jews are not permitted to buy meat, milk, white bread or cigarettes and can shop only between the hours of 4pm and 5pm.\u201d The next painting\u2019s text reads: \u201cAfter nightfall, neighbours secretly provide the family with food that they leave outside their garden gate, a crime severely punished by the Nazis.\u201d The third reads: \u201cWhen the Carlebachs find out the Nazis are coming to pick them up, they tie a monogrammed kitchen towel to the garden gate, a final thank you and farewell.\u201d Most of the Carlebach family were deported to Riga in 1942 and murdered. But not all: son Felix managed to flee to Manchester where, from 1947 until his retirement in 1984, he was a rabbi at South Manchester Synagogue.'The smoke from your barbecue is really annoying,' reads the text on one paintingAlmost five decades after his family\u2019s murder, Felix Carlebach was invited back to L\u00fcbeck to be made an honorary citizen. During the ceremony in 1987, a woman approached him. \u201cOur parents were neighbours. I brought something that belongs to you,\u201d she said, and handed the rabbi the kitchen towel. The scene is commemorated in the last painting. \u201cWhat impressed me most,\u201d says Aptekar, \u201cis that the woman then just disappeared. She didn\u2019t want anything. She wanted to give and receive nothing back, not recognition, atonement, nothing.\u201d In the centre of the room is a vitrine containing that towel, brought from Manchester for the exhibition. Aptekar also tackles the everyday reality of having to live next door to someone whose values drive you nuts. \u201cYour dog shat in my kid\u2019s sandbox again,\u201d reads the scrolling text of one silverpoint drawing. \u201cThe smoke from your barbecues is really annoying,\u201d reads another.One of the most affecting parts of the show is a video installation Aptekar made after interviewing Rodolfo Hoffmann, the last surviving bar mitzvah boy from prewar L\u00fcbeck. Aptekar tracked him down to Santiago, Chile, where he filmed the 91-year-old recalling his childhood. Hoffmann describes a time of innocence, when he played with other kids, celebrating Christmas as well as marking Jewish holidays. Hoffmann says he scarcely felt Jewish: it took Hitler to do that.Hoffmann\u2019s father was partner in a shoe shop called Blumenthal\u2019s. When the Nazis came to power, a traffic cop would narrowly eye anybody who dared to go inside the Jewish-run business. Few did, trade collapsed, and Blumenthal\u2019s was sold at a rock-bottom price. The buyers were non-Jews who ran the shop under the name Sch\u00fcmann Schuhe until last October. Hoffmann\u2019s family managed to flee to Chile in 1936, just a few months after Rodolfo celebrated his bar mitzvah at the L\u00fcbeck synagogue, which the Nazis soon converted into a gym. Sad-eyed Hoffman remembers travelling halfway around the world to escape murder by Nazis only to be find himself living in a ghetto. His family would invite neighbours over for meals, but the offer was never reciprocated. \u201cSo we lived in a ghetto that we made ourselves,\u201d says Hoffman. At the end of the exhibition is the Jewish artist Max Liebermann\u2019s notorious 1879 painting The Twelve-Year-Old Jesus in the Temple, loaned from Hamburg\u2019s Kunsthalle. It\u2019s notorious because Liebermann repainted it following an antisemitic outcry over his depiction of Christ as a poor, barefoot Jewish urchin. Liebermann obligingly gave the boy blond hair and sandals, making him look less poor and less Jewish. In the context of Aptekar\u2019s show, the painting has an allegorical function: it\u2019s about the grotesqueness of forced integration, about what happens when difference is not respected but obliterated.Next to it, Aptekar has repainted Liebermann\u2019s repainted Jesus. He keeps the blond hair and the sandals but overlays the image with the words: \u201cDie Juden in die St Annen-Kirche\u201d (Jews in the St Anne Church). It serves as a reminder that all those figures in the museum\u2019s great Christian art collection were Jews, different from yet equal to Christians \u2013 just like its neighbours in the synagogue next door.\u2022 Nachbarn is at St Annen-Museum, L\u00fcbeck, until 29 May.", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Painting", "Exhibition", "Exhibitions", "Video art", "Drawing", "Holocaust", "Religion", "Culture", "Judaism", "Germany", "Europe"], "title": "What my blond Jesus could teach Germany"},{"date": "2015-11-13T11:25:21Z", "content": "The eurozone\u2019s economy lost steam in the latest quarter as Portugal stalled, Germany slowed and debt-stricken Greece contracted.Gross domestic product (GDP) across the 19 countries in the single currency bloc rose just 0.3% in the third quarter, according to Eurostat.

The UK still has the most installed offshore wind power in Europe, at 5,061MW to Germany\u2019s total of 3,295MW.A spokesman for the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA), which published the figures, said that the UK had attracted more investment than Germany last year, but installed less capacity, as Germany cleared a backlog that had built up in 2014.\u201cGermany was the engine behind the record year in 2015 and we would expect it to continue its lead,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cGermany will be a big offshore story towards 2020 certainly.\u201d The offshore wind industry is generally positive towards the subsidy regime promised by UK energy secretary, Amber Rudd, of three more \u201ccontracts for difference\u201d auctions before 2020. But the spokesman said: \u201cclarity on the arrangement of these auctions is essential.\u201dOverall offshore wind investment in Europe doubled to \u20ac13.3bn last year, in a record year for the budding green tech sector.But a dip in grid connections is expected in 2016, with more capacity coming online towards the decade\u2019s end. In a sign that the industry is fast developing, year-on-year wind turbine orders were up 75% last year. Offshore platforms were built further out to sea - 43km on average - and in deeper waters, typically around 27m.Europe\u2019s three offshore leaders - Germany, the UK and the Netherlands - are still working on six offshore projects, whose grid connection should add another 15% of offshore capacity to Europe\u2019s power system.  \u201cThe financing is there, the order book is strong, now we need policymakers to come forward with a regulatory vision that will inspire confidence for investors and developers post-2020,\u201d the EWEA spokesman said.E.ON was the industry\u2019s largest developer in 2014, with 17% of connections, followed closely by RWE and EnBW.Offshore\u2019s rapid growth was not confined to Europe, with the number of global platforms growing by a factor of four to provide 4,000 MW of grid-connected electricity, twice the previous record set in 2013, according to BNEF.China had the most eye-catching achievement, installing 29,000 MW, a 40% increase on its previous record and almost as much as the rest of the world combined. \u201c2015 was a fantastic year for the wind industry.\u201d said Amy Grace, head of Wind Insight for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cChina was by far the biggest surprise.

His hands were clammy and his heart was beating fast, but he took a deep breath as he stepped inside the ivy-clad red-brick building of the Charit\u00e9 hospital and climbed the stairs to meet the group. When he saw them, he got his next shock.\u201cThere were thin, fat, tall and short men, aged between 20 and 60. I found out there was a banker, a church warden, a doctor, a student, an unemployed bloke, an actor \u2013 people from all walks of life.\u201d What Weber, then an engineering student in his mid-20s, had in common with the others was that they were all diagnosed paedophiles who had come voluntarily to receive treatment at the Charit\u00e9\u2019s institute for sexual medicine. \u201cIt was amazing for me to see how different everyone was,\u201d said Weber. \u201cI\u2019d never met another paedophile before.\u201dThe institute has been running the prevention project Dunkelfeld (which means dark field) for a decade. Since 2011, it has gradually developed into a nationwide network called \u201cdon\u2019t offend\u201d. What started in Berlin has spread to 10 other cities, with more centres planned so that eventually the programme will be easily accessible for anyone in Germany.There is a radical difference between the treatment offered to paedophiles in Germany and that in other countries. Strict patient-doctor confidentiality rules mean the men can be assured they will not be reported to the police. They would only be excluded from the programme if there was an active prosecution against them. Related: Paedophilia: bringing dark desires to light \u201cI did not have to give my name and address, and I was given a pin number to connect me to my diagnosis data,\u201d Weber, his chosen pseudonym, told the Guardian in a burger bar in central Berlin.Those who run Dunkelfeld insist that the confidentiality clause is central to the unique project\u2019s success and also accounts for its popularity. \u201cAccording to the German legal code, therapists are forbidden from revealing anything that happens in the context of treatment,\u201d said Laura Kuhle, a clinical psychologist and one of Dunkelfeld\u2019s therapists. \u201cIf people mention anything in therapy that could make them criminally culpable, they are protected. In other countries, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Kuhle is convinced that, if patients were not guaranteed that confidentiality, most would not turn up at all and those that did would not be truly honest.\u201cWe need them to be completely open about what has happened in their pasts, so that we can work with them as effectively as possible. What situations have they found themselves in? What were the individual events that led up to what\u2019s happened to them until now? You can\u2019t answer questions like that if you are afraid,\u201d Kuhle said.For Weber, who is keen to stress he has never offended although he admits to having been dangerously close to doing so, the confidentiality clause was key. \u201cI was so petrified of anyone even finding out I was thinking of doing it, because of the obvious stigma attached to being a paedophile, I memorised the telephone number before calling the centre, out of fear that someone might find the number on me. That way no one could suspect me of anything,\u201d he said. It was during puberty that Weber first recognised his sexual attraction towards young girls. \u201cI found the feelings threatening, exceptionally unpleasant, but I couldn\u2019t really put a name to them,\u201d he said. . \u201cI recognised that this had the potential to get very dangerous when I was in my early 20s, particularly after one encounter I had with a girl on a beach. I recognised I was drawn towards doing something sexual with the girl, at the same time as not wanting to do it at all because I knew it was wrong.\u201dThree times he planned to carry out what he calls \u201cconcrete assaults\u201d on young children. Three times he was prevented from doing so by a mix of circumstance and his own fear. His mother, who apparently knew nothing of his tendencies, pointed out a television advert for Dunkelfeld. The ad asked: \u201cDo you love children more than you\u2019d like to?\u201d and promised free therapy with medical confidentiality. Related: Channel 4 film features paedophile confessing attraction to children Weber took down the number and went to a phone box to ring the hotline. \u201cIt felt surreal as it was the first time in my life I had talked to anyone about it, and the woman on the other end was so friendly, she talked to me as naturally as if she was giving me a recipe for biscuits,\u201d he said. At a subsequent appointment, Weber was diagnosed as a heteropaedophile because his feelings of sexual attraction for women were clearly subordinated by a stronger attraction towards young girls. He began the weekly three-hour therapy sessions, overseen by two therapists, with between six to 10 participants. The sessions took place at the end of a normal working day and were based on cognitive behavioural therapy methods.\u201cAt the start of each session, the participants talk about their experiences of the past week and what is on their minds,\u201d said Kuhle. The treatment includes helping participants to understand the child\u2019s perspective, learning to cope in potentially difficult situations such as birthday parties, and developing ways to overcome bad habits such as viewing pornographic images or having sexual fantasies, which can increase the likelihood of a paedophile offending. \u201cSometimes,\u201d said Weber, \u201cthe survival tactics involve something as simple as saying to yourself \u2018count backwards from 100, in units of seven\u2019.\u201d But Weber was told early on that paedophilia, according to current understandings, is a non-curable mental disorder without a known cause.Sessions accordingly touched on what could realistically be changed and what would stay the same. \u201cThat was a blow, to know I couldn\u2019t be cured, but at the same time, there was relief to know it wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cVital for me was finally being able to look at myself in the mirror and say \u2018you\u2019re not a monster, you\u2019re a paedophile\u2019, and that\u2019s okay as long as you don\u2019t abuse a child.\u201dLearning to control his feelings was the most important aspect of the sessions. \u201cI am responsible for my behaviour. If someone says they can\u2019t control themselves, that\u2019s just not true.\u201d Which is not to say he didn\u2019t struggle. \u201cThere were several times I wanted to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re taking yourself apart and putting yourself back together again with the tools to cope and it was incredibly scary.\u201dWeber, who runs a support group for non-offending paedophiles called Schicksal und Herausforderung (fate and challenge) sports a beard and a burgundy T-shirt. He is not someone who would stand out in a crowd.  Related: Reducing harm done by and to paedophiles | Letters Statistics gathered by the Charit\u00e9\u2019s therapists indicate that, of 440 paedophile patients they have so far treated, the average age is 37, 71% are employed, 39% are in relationships, while 36% are the caregivers for one or more children. They are almost always male. \u201cWe have been contacted by 17 women in the last decade. Only one of these would I say had a paedophilic disorder,\u201d said Kuhle.Perhaps surprisingly, the project has the strong backing of Germany\u2019s conservatives. The ruling Christian Democratic party (CDU) of Angela Merkel is highly supportive and pushing for health insurers to fund the therapy, which costs \u20ac5m-\u20ac8m a year. So far financing has come from government and charitable grants.In a recent policy paper on the subject, the CDU argued that the best protection for children \u201cwould be for people with a paedophilic disposition (of whom it is estimated there are around 250,000 in Germany) not to become offenders in the first place\u201d. \u201cBut in order to lessen the number of attacks by paedophiles, our healthcare system must provide sufficient and low-threshold treatment possibilities for them \u2026 on a financially sustainable and anonymous basis,\u201d it advised.By its very nature, it is almost impossible to evaluate the project\u2019s success. While a paedophile who has participated might be asked if the treatment had prevented him from offending, any answer is likely to be highly subjective and possibly unreliable. To measure its success according to the number of recorded cases of child abuse is also problematic, as those rates are known to have gone up if only because of the increasing number of abuse victims who feel prepared to come forward as the subject has become less taboo.But experts like Kuhle say the popularity of Dunkelfeld among paedophiles is proof of how vital it is. \u201cI meet many colleagues from other countries, particularly the UK and the US, who would like to introduce this therapy and are in the process of trying to roll it out, but are often hindered from doing so by the legal restrictions.\u201dAfter Channel 4 screened the documentary The Paedophile Next Door, which featured the institute\u2019s unique style of therapy, last November, Dunkelfeld\u2019s hotline was inundated with calls from Britons with paedophilic disorders. Therapists say they were frustrated at not being able to help.One British man was so desperate, he moved to Germany to be able to access a Dunkelfeld programme. In an email exchange with the Guardian, the man, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote: \u201cSo far, all I have ever received from the NHS is doors slammed in my face.\u201cDespite paedophilia being listed as a mental illness in the DSM (the standard classification of mental disorders), they don\u2019t want to help you, they just want to see you locked up or perhaps even burnt at the stake. I am so sick and tired of UK medical \u2018professionals\u2019 looking at me as if I\u2019ve grown horns and a barbed tail.\u201cI moved to Germany for therapy, I am learning German and I have a social worker helping me. (Yes, a social worker helping paedophiles!).\u201dAlthough Dunkelfeld has come in for criticism for focusing on the potential abusers rather than the abused, it has been supported by victims\u2019 groups in Germany and elsewhere. The family of April Jones, the five-year-old Welsh girl who was murdered by Mark Bridger in 2012, have appealed for help for paedophiles who seek it. \u201cIf someone says to the doctor: \u2018I have these feelings, can I have help?\u2019 it would be better to try to help them before they ruin someone else\u2019s family,\u201d Coral Jones said this year.Anne, now in her mid-20s, was abused as a child by her policeman stepfather and later discovered the man she was in a relationship with had a paedophilic disorder. She assists relatives and friends of paedophiles by helping them to access therapy. \u201cIf people search for help but can\u2019t get it, then there\u2019s something wrong with us as a society,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to think of the many children who I\u2019ve no doubt are saved because this therapy exists. It also prevents these men as well as the mothers and wives who so often protect them, from hiding from themselves anymore.\u201d", "tags": ["Mental health", "Health", "Society", "Germany", "Europe", "World news", "Child protection"], "title": "How Germany treats paedophiles before they offend"},{"date": "2015-10-14T20:30:18Z", "content": "An intense heatwave in southern California smashed records last Friday as temperatures topped 40C (104F).

If there ever was a sign of British influence on the wane, this is it. Related: Brussels launches unprecedented EU inquiry into rule of law in Poland Nor is it reassuring that, amid the domestic squabbling of the \u201cBrexit\u201d debate, the wider European strategic picture has all but dropped out of sight. Yet there are things going on that Britain would do well to pay closer attention to. As if Europe didn\u2019t have enough problems, a new faultline has appeared: Poland is now under EU commission supervision, through a \u201crule of law mechanism\u201d activated this week in Brussels for the first time.The largest central European country, long a poster child of post-communist transition, and which has had an important say in European policies towards the east and Russia, has in effect been blacklisted. Reasons for this lie in the policies of its new nationalist, conservative and Eurosceptic Law and Justice government, elected last October. There has been a worrying rush to discipline the media, the judiciary and parts of the civil service \u2013 in effect, trampling over key checks and balances.That EU institutions have put Poland\u2019s new leaders under special measures is a good thing. After all, European democratic norms only exist if they are protected. But this is a case where geopolitics can hardly be ignored, and where history looms heavily.German-Polish rapprochement has been a staple of European stability and enlargement over the past 25 yearsFor Europe, the biggest risk over Poland relates not just to the rule of law but to the damage that could be done to one of Europe\u2019s key pillars: German-Polish post-cold war reconciliation.Just as Franco-German reconciliation was essential to the European project from its founding in the 1950s, German-Polish rapprochement has been a staple of European stability and enlargement over the past 25 years. That picture has suddenly turned bleak.Germany is being framed by the new Polish ruling elite as an enemy, with one magazine even depicting Angela Merkel in a Nazi uniform. The contrast could not be starker with the message given five years ago by the then Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski, who described Germany as \u201cEurope\u2019s indispensable nation\u201d and said he feared \u201cGerman power less than German inactivity\u201d. No doubt Sikorski had the eurozone crisis in mind at the time, but the historical sweep of his language was obvious.That the new Polish government wants to conflate Germany with all the woes it sees in the EU is one thing \u2013 other critics of Brussels, in Greece and elsewhere, have resorted to similar reflexes in recent years. But this time a strategic divide risks opening up in the heart of Europe.It is significant that Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, who runs Poland\u2019s majority party, held a long one-to-one meeting with Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n last week, seemingly aimed at consolidating a central European populistic, illiberal axis, intended to counter pressure from Brussels or western European nations. This is one development Britain should pay closer attention to \u2013 and not just because Cameron has a wishlist.United by an authoritarian, nationalistic streak, Poland and Hungary can now work on spreading their political alliance to neighbouring states, where populism is on the rise. The refugee issue is an obvious rallying point. On this issue as on others, from climate change to sanctions, the ability of EU states to act together is ultimately at stake.With Britain more or less out of the picture, and with France more focused on counter-terrorism, it will be yet again up to Merkel to try to address this new problem of European cohesion. On one hand, that is a shame, because for many historical reasons Britain and France have a special relationship with Poland. On the other hand, it is hardly surprising. Poland\u2019s economy is closely connected to Germany\u2019s.Merkel has stayed remarkably aloof from the dispute, playing for time as she often does. Meanwhile Martin Schulz, the German head of the European parliament \u2013 which is due to debate Poland\u2019s democratic backsliding on Tuesday \u2013 has lashed out at the Kaczy\u0144ski team with talk of a \u201ccoup\u201d and of a \u201cPutinisation of European politics\u201d. Some EU officials say they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Merkel suddenly met the new Polish prime minister for a hard-headed conversation, just as she did with Orb\u00e1n last year when the Ukrainian crisis required European unity.Of course, it doesn\u2019t help that the EU has mostly let Orb\u00e1n off the hook over his autocratic methods. Coming down hard now on Poland, however justified it may be, could be taken as a double standard. Stepping back, all this shows the extent to which Europe\u2019s reunification after 1989 remains a work in progress, even if the process has brought so many accomplishments and has inspired so many, in Ukraine and beyond. There is no risk of Poland dropping out of the EU \u2013 unlike Britain \u2013 but, taken together, the faultlines are dangerous.

In 1985, my husband Rolf and I were running a wholesale cheese shop and a market stall. It was hard work \u2013 six days a week, from morning to evening. Sunday was our day off, so, with our two children grown up, the two of us would catch a bus and go for walks around the city. I would wear my fur coat. I had my everyday clothes for work days, but my coat was special. Nobody wears real fur any more, but we did back then. It was cold; you can see the snow on the ground.Essen is an industrial city. I\u2019m standing on a road bridge that spans a motorway \u2013 it cuts Essen in two, north and south. We lived on the edge of the city in a leafy garden neighbourhood called Margarethenh\u00f6he. At the time, the photographer, Rudi Meisel, lived around the corner: his flat overlooked our balcony. He was a student, and we had got to know him a little from our market stall. Yet I never knew he\u2019d taken a photograph of me that day, and neither did he.Many years later, when we had become friends, he dropped a get-well card for Rolf through our letterbox; he had just come out of hospital. It was a postcard made from one of his own photographs following an exhibition years earlier. To my utter amazement, there I was. It was a total coincidence. The picture was just a passing snapshot, a reflex, Rudi told me; he took it quickly, spoke to no one and moved on, not knowing if the light or the composition were any good.It\u2019s such an ordinary scene that I sometimes wonder why people care. But this sort of spontaneous \u201cstreet\u201d photography depicts real life, and that\u2019s always interesting. It tells you what everyday life was like back then. I often think I should know the two girls in the foreground, but I don\u2019t recognise them. And I\u2019ve always wondered about the case with the American flag on it: it was a real icon in Germany then, so it could have caught Rudi\u2019s eye.

But many East Germans will tell you otherwise.We did visit once, in the 1960s: a distant uncle in East Berlin. We took a bus from West Berlin across the border, just for the day. My abiding memory is of no flowers, no colour and no fun. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, we visited the former East often, particularly cities such as Dresden and the northern lake district of Mecklenburg. The people and the scenery were wonderful.We still live in the same flat in Essen, and have now been there for 50 years.

It is, to put it mildly, topical. \u201cI strongly hope that the fear Muslims have of becoming the new Jews of Europe will not come true,\u201d she says to her audience of overwhelmingly white, well-heeled and middle-aged citizens.Fischer \u2013 the author of Aim\u00e9e & Jaguar, the bestselling novel about the second world war love affair between two women, one a Jew, the other married to a Nazi \u2013 has reason to worry. A recent poll found that 60% of Germans believe their country cannot cope with the numbers of new arrivals, which reached 1.1 million in 2015, while 42% fear their cultural values are under threat.More than 70 years ago, Germans murdered millions of their Jewish neighbours, or stood by while they were sent to their deaths. In this beautiful old city, now a Unesco world heritage site, a community of more than 500 Jews was deported, most to be murdered in death camps or in the forests around Riga.Last August, Der Spiegel carried this front page headline: \u201cXenophobia is poisoning Germany.\u201d Since then, resentment of immigrants has risen. Recent examples include pubs and clubs in Freiburg banning immigrants and a swimming pool in Bornheim refusing to admit male refugees. Fischer mentions Cologne where, on New Year\u2019s Eve, sexual attacks against women were blamed on immigrant men. \u201cThose events,\u201d she says, \u201chave led to a renaissance of a very xenophobic, patriarchal and ultimately misogynistic climate in Germany.\u201dIn this toxic climate, the American artist Ken Aptekar is staging a show called Nachbarn, or Neighbours, using video, paintings and silverpoint drawings to explore what neighbourliness means. He was thinking about the theme long before Germany\u2019s \u2013 and Europe\u2019s \u2013 current refugee crisis. In 2006, he visited L\u00fcbeck and was struck by how the St Annen-Museum, a former Augustinian nunnery, was next door to one of the few German synagogues not to be burned down during Kristallnacht in 1938. How, Aptekar wondered, did these Christian and Jewish neighbours get along before and during the Holocaust?\u201cI wanted to do something that would speak to young L\u00fcbeckers,\u201d says Aptekar. \u201cI wanted to shift the Holocaust narrative from being about victimisation to otherness, immigration and community. Can people recognise and respect their profound differences and together build a vibrant community?\u201dHe didn\u2019t know 10 years ago how topical these questions would become, in a Europe still reeling after the Paris attacks. Strikingly, the names of the works have translations into German, English, Russian and Turkish. Why Russian and Turkish? Because L\u00fcbeck\u2019s synagogue is now a thriving place of worship for a 900-strong community of Jews, mostly from Russia; while, within walking distance of the museum, there are three mosques, whose worshippers are mostly Turkish-speaking.Aptekar is known as an appropriation artist. When I first interviewed him 16 years ago, he had an exhibition at London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum called Q&A that involved him showing works from the museum\u2019s European collection to focus groups: redheads, African-Caribbean women, art students. He sandblasted their most interesting responses on to sheets of glass. Then he painted copies of details from the pictures discussed and attached the glass to them. He has done something similar in L\u00fcbeck, recycling imagery from Christian altarpieces in the St Annen collection, and overlaying them with texts carrying present day resonances. One room in Nachbarn features Aptekar\u2019s Carlebach Suite, six paintings dramatising the true story of a Jewish family from L\u00fcbeck.In the first painting, a detail from a 1475 altarpiece is overlaid with an unfurling, Torah-like scroll bearing the words: \u201c1941: Food rations for the Simson Carlebach family are reduced. Jews are not permitted to buy meat, milk, white bread or cigarettes and can shop only between the hours of 4pm and 5pm.\u201d The next painting\u2019s text reads: \u201cAfter nightfall, neighbours secretly provide the family with food that they leave outside their garden gate, a crime severely punished by the Nazis.\u201d The third reads: \u201cWhen the Carlebachs find out the Nazis are coming to pick them up, they tie a monogrammed kitchen towel to the garden gate, a final thank you and farewell.\u201d Most of the Carlebach family were deported to Riga in 1942 and murdered. But not all: son Felix managed to flee to Manchester where, from 1947 until his retirement in 1984, he was a rabbi at South Manchester Synagogue.'The smoke from your barbecue is really annoying,' reads the text on one paintingAlmost five decades after his family\u2019s murder, Felix Carlebach was invited back to L\u00fcbeck to be made an honorary citizen. During the ceremony in 1987, a woman approached him. \u201cOur parents were neighbours. I brought something that belongs to you,\u201d she said, and handed the rabbi the kitchen towel. The scene is commemorated in the last painting. \u201cWhat impressed me most,\u201d says Aptekar, \u201cis that the woman then just disappeared. She didn\u2019t want anything. She wanted to give and receive nothing back, not recognition, atonement, nothing.\u201d In the centre of the room is a vitrine containing that towel, brought from Manchester for the exhibition. Aptekar also tackles the everyday reality of having to live next door to someone whose values drive you nuts. \u201cYour dog shat in my kid\u2019s sandbox again,\u201d reads the scrolling text of one silverpoint drawing. \u201cThe smoke from your barbecues is really annoying,\u201d reads another.One of the most affecting parts of the show is a video installation Aptekar made after interviewing Rodolfo Hoffmann, the last surviving bar mitzvah boy from prewar L\u00fcbeck. Aptekar tracked him down to Santiago, Chile, where he filmed the 91-year-old recalling his childhood. Hoffmann describes a time of innocence, when he played with other kids, celebrating Christmas as well as marking Jewish holidays. Hoffmann says he scarcely felt Jewish: it took Hitler to do that.Hoffmann\u2019s father was partner in a shoe shop called Blumenthal\u2019s. When the Nazis came to power, a traffic cop would narrowly eye anybody who dared to go inside the Jewish-run business. Few did, trade collapsed, and Blumenthal\u2019s was sold at a rock-bottom price. The buyers were non-Jews who ran the shop under the name Sch\u00fcmann Schuhe until last October. Hoffmann\u2019s family managed to flee to Chile in 1936, just a few months after Rodolfo celebrated his bar mitzvah at the L\u00fcbeck synagogue, which the Nazis soon converted into a gym. Sad-eyed Hoffman remembers travelling halfway around the world to escape murder by Nazis only to be find himself living in a ghetto. His family would invite neighbours over for meals, but the offer was never reciprocated. \u201cSo we lived in a ghetto that we made ourselves,\u201d says Hoffman. At the end of the exhibition is the Jewish artist Max Liebermann\u2019s notorious 1879 painting The Twelve-Year-Old Jesus in the Temple, loaned from Hamburg\u2019s Kunsthalle. It\u2019s notorious because Liebermann repainted it following an antisemitic outcry over his depiction of Christ as a poor, barefoot Jewish urchin. Liebermann obligingly gave the boy blond hair and sandals, making him look less poor and less Jewish. In the context of Aptekar\u2019s show, the painting has an allegorical function: it\u2019s about the grotesqueness of forced integration, about what happens when difference is not respected but obliterated.Next to it, Aptekar has repainted Liebermann\u2019s repainted Jesus. He keeps the blond hair and the sandals but overlays the image with the words: \u201cDie Juden in die St Annen-Kirche\u201d (Jews in the St Anne Church). It serves as a reminder that all those figures in the museum\u2019s great Christian art collection were Jews, different from yet equal to Christians \u2013 just like its neighbours in the synagogue next door.\u2022 Nachbarn is at St Annen-Museum, L\u00fcbeck, until 29 May.", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Painting", "Exhibition", "Exhibitions", "Video art", "Drawing", "Holocaust", "Religion", "Culture", "Judaism", "Germany", "Europe"], "title": "What my blond Jesus could teach Germany"},{"date": "2015-11-13T11:25:21Z", "content": "The eurozone\u2019s economy lost steam in the latest quarter as Portugal stalled, Germany slowed and debt-stricken Greece contracted.Gross domestic product (GDP) across the 19 countries in the single currency bloc rose just 0.3% in the third quarter, according to Eurostat.

Offshore platforms were built further out to sea - 43km on average - and in deeper waters, typically around 27m.Europe\u2019s three offshore leaders - Germany, the UK and the Netherlands - are still working on six offshore projects, whose grid connection should add another 15% of offshore capacity to Europe\u2019s power system.  \u201cThe financing is there, the order book is strong, now we need policymakers to come forward with a regulatory vision that will inspire confidence for investors and developers post-2020,\u201d the EWEA spokesman said.E.ON was the industry\u2019s largest developer in 2014, with 17% of connections, followed closely by RWE and EnBW.Offshore\u2019s rapid growth was not confined to Europe, with the number of global platforms growing by a factor of four to provide 4,000 MW of grid-connected electricity, twice the previous record set in 2013, according to BNEF.China had the most eye-catching achievement, installing 29,000 MW, a 40% increase on its previous record and almost as much as the rest of the world combined. \u201c2015 was a fantastic year for the wind industry.\u201d said Amy Grace, head of Wind Insight for Bloomberg New Energy Finance. \u201cChina was by far the biggest surprise.

His hands were clammy and his heart was beating fast, but he took a deep breath as he stepped inside the ivy-clad red-brick building of the Charit\u00e9 hospital and climbed the stairs to meet the group. When he saw them, he got his next shock.\u201cThere were thin, fat, tall and short men, aged between 20 and 60. I found out there was a banker, a church warden, a doctor, a student, an unemployed bloke, an actor \u2013 people from all walks of life.\u201d What Weber, then an engineering student in his mid-20s, had in common with the others was that they were all diagnosed paedophiles who had come voluntarily to receive treatment at the Charit\u00e9\u2019s institute for sexual medicine. \u201cIt was amazing for me to see how different everyone was,\u201d said Weber. \u201cI\u2019d never met another paedophile before.\u201dThe institute has been running the prevention project Dunkelfeld (which means dark field) for a decade. Since 2011, it has gradually developed into a nationwide network called \u201cdon\u2019t offend\u201d. What started in Berlin has spread to 10 other cities, with more centres planned so that eventually the programme will be easily accessible for anyone in Germany.There is a radical difference between the treatment offered to paedophiles in Germany and that in other countries. Strict patient-doctor confidentiality rules mean the men can be assured they will not be reported to the police. They would only be excluded from the programme if there was an active prosecution against them. Related: Paedophilia: bringing dark desires to light \u201cI did not have to give my name and address, and I was given a pin number to connect me to my diagnosis data,\u201d Weber, his chosen pseudonym, told the Guardian in a burger bar in central Berlin.Those who run Dunkelfeld insist that the confidentiality clause is central to the unique project\u2019s success and also accounts for its popularity. \u201cAccording to the German legal code, therapists are forbidden from revealing anything that happens in the context of treatment,\u201d said Laura Kuhle, a clinical psychologist and one of Dunkelfeld\u2019s therapists. \u201cIf people mention anything in therapy that could make them criminally culpable, they are protected. In other countries, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Kuhle is convinced that, if patients were not guaranteed that confidentiality, most would not turn up at all and those that did would not be truly honest.\u201cWe need them to be completely open about what has happened in their pasts, so that we can work with them as effectively as possible. What situations have they found themselves in? What were the individual events that led up to what\u2019s happened to them until now? You can\u2019t answer questions like that if you are afraid,\u201d Kuhle said.For Weber, who is keen to stress he has never offended although he admits to having been dangerously close to doing so, the confidentiality clause was key. \u201cI was so petrified of anyone even finding out I was thinking of doing it, because of the obvious stigma attached to being a paedophile, I memorised the telephone number before calling the centre, out of fear that someone might find the number on me. That way no one could suspect me of anything,\u201d he said. It was during puberty that Weber first recognised his sexual attraction towards young girls. \u201cI found the feelings threatening, exceptionally unpleasant, but I couldn\u2019t really put a name to them,\u201d he said. . \u201cI recognised that this had the potential to get very dangerous when I was in my early 20s, particularly after one encounter I had with a girl on a beach. I recognised I was drawn towards doing something sexual with the girl, at the same time as not wanting to do it at all because I knew it was wrong.\u201dThree times he planned to carry out what he calls \u201cconcrete assaults\u201d on young children. Three times he was prevented from doing so by a mix of circumstance and his own fear. His mother, who apparently knew nothing of his tendencies, pointed out a television advert for Dunkelfeld. The ad asked: \u201cDo you love children more than you\u2019d like to?\u201d and promised free therapy with medical confidentiality. Related: Channel 4 film features paedophile confessing attraction to children Weber took down the number and went to a phone box to ring the hotline. \u201cIt felt surreal as it was the first time in my life I had talked to anyone about it, and the woman on the other end was so friendly, she talked to me as naturally as if she was giving me a recipe for biscuits,\u201d he said. At a subsequent appointment, Weber was diagnosed as a heteropaedophile because his feelings of sexual attraction for women were clearly subordinated by a stronger attraction towards young girls. He began the weekly three-hour therapy sessions, overseen by two therapists, with between six to 10 participants. The sessions took place at the end of a normal working day and were based on cognitive behavioural therapy methods.\u201cAt the start of each session, the participants talk about their experiences of the past week and what is on their minds,\u201d said Kuhle. The treatment includes helping participants to understand the child\u2019s perspective, learning to cope in potentially difficult situations such as birthday parties, and developing ways to overcome bad habits such as viewing pornographic images or having sexual fantasies, which can increase the likelihood of a paedophile offending. \u201cSometimes,\u201d said Weber, \u201cthe survival tactics involve something as simple as saying to yourself \u2018count backwards from 100, in units of seven\u2019.\u201d But Weber was told early on that paedophilia, according to current understandings, is a non-curable mental disorder without a known cause.Sessions accordingly touched on what could realistically be changed and what would stay the same. \u201cThat was a blow, to know I couldn\u2019t be cured, but at the same time, there was relief to know it wasn\u2019t my fault,\u201d he said. \u201cVital for me was finally being able to look at myself in the mirror and say \u2018you\u2019re not a monster, you\u2019re a paedophile\u2019, and that\u2019s okay as long as you don\u2019t abuse a child.\u201dLearning to control his feelings was the most important aspect of the sessions. \u201cI am responsible for my behaviour. If someone says they can\u2019t control themselves, that\u2019s just not true.\u201d Which is not to say he didn\u2019t struggle. \u201cThere were several times I wanted to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re taking yourself apart and putting yourself back together again with the tools to cope and it was incredibly scary.\u201dWeber, who runs a support group for non-offending paedophiles called Schicksal und Herausforderung (fate and challenge) sports a beard and a burgundy T-shirt. He is not someone who would stand out in a crowd.  Related: Reducing harm done by and to paedophiles | Letters Statistics gathered by the Charit\u00e9\u2019s therapists indicate that, of 440 paedophile patients they have so far treated, the average age is 37, 71% are employed, 39% are in relationships, while 36% are the caregivers for one or more children. They are almost always male. \u201cWe have been contacted by 17 women in the last decade. Only one of these would I say had a paedophilic disorder,\u201d said Kuhle.Perhaps surprisingly, the project has the strong backing of Germany\u2019s conservatives. The ruling Christian Democratic party (CDU) of Angela Merkel is highly supportive and pushing for health insurers to fund the therapy, which costs \u20ac5m-\u20ac8m a year. So far financing has come from government and charitable grants.In a recent policy paper on the subject, the CDU argued that the best protection for children \u201cwould be for people with a paedophilic disposition (of whom it is estimated there are around 250,000 in Germany) not to become offenders in the first place\u201d. \u201cBut in order to lessen the number of attacks by paedophiles, our healthcare system must provide sufficient and low-threshold treatment possibilities for them \u2026 on a financially sustainable and anonymous basis,\u201d it advised.By its very nature, it is almost impossible to evaluate the project\u2019s success. While a paedophile who has participated might be asked if the treatment had prevented him from offending, any answer is likely to be highly subjective and possibly unreliable. To measure its success according to the number of recorded cases of child abuse is also problematic, as those rates are known to have gone up if only because of the increasing number of abuse victims who feel prepared to come forward as the subject has become less taboo.But experts like Kuhle say the popularity of Dunkelfeld among paedophiles is proof of how vital it is. \u201cI meet many colleagues from other countries, particularly the UK and the US, who would like to introduce this therapy and are in the process of trying to roll it out, but are often hindered from doing so by the legal restrictions.\u201dAfter Channel 4 screened the documentary The Paedophile Next Door, which featured the institute\u2019s unique style of therapy, last November, Dunkelfeld\u2019s hotline was inundated with calls from Britons with paedophilic disorders. Therapists say they were frustrated at not being able to help.One British man was so desperate, he moved to Germany to be able to access a Dunkelfeld programme. In an email exchange with the Guardian, the man, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote: \u201cSo far, all I have ever received from the NHS is doors slammed in my face.\u201cDespite paedophilia being listed as a mental illness in the DSM (the standard classification of mental disorders), they don\u2019t want to help you, they just want to see you locked up or perhaps even burnt at the stake. I am so sick and tired of UK medical \u2018professionals\u2019 looking at me as if I\u2019ve grown horns and a barbed tail.\u201cI moved to Germany for therapy, I am learning German and I have a social worker helping me. (Yes, a social worker helping paedophiles!).\u201dAlthough Dunkelfeld has come in for criticism for focusing on the potential abusers rather than the abused, it has been supported by victims\u2019 groups in Germany and elsewhere. The family of April Jones, the five-year-old Welsh girl who was murdered by Mark Bridger in 2012, have appealed for help for paedophiles who seek it. \u201cIf someone says to the doctor: \u2018I have these feelings, can I have help?\u2019 it would be better to try to help them before they ruin someone else\u2019s family,\u201d Coral Jones said this year.Anne, now in her mid-20s, was abused as a child by her policeman stepfather and later discovered the man she was in a relationship with had a paedophilic disorder. She assists relatives and friends of paedophiles by helping them to access therapy. \u201cIf people search for help but can\u2019t get it, then there\u2019s something wrong with us as a society,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to think of the many children who I\u2019ve no doubt are saved because this therapy exists.

If there ever was a sign of British influence on the wane, this is it. Related: Brussels launches unprecedented EU inquiry into rule of law in Poland Nor is it reassuring that, amid the domestic squabbling of the \u201cBrexit\u201d debate, the wider European strategic picture has all but dropped out of sight. Yet there are things going on that Britain would do well to pay closer attention to. As if Europe didn\u2019t have enough problems, a new faultline has appeared: Poland is now under EU commission supervision, through a \u201crule of law mechanism\u201d activated this week in Brussels for the first time.The largest central European country, long a poster child of post-communist transition, and which has had an important say in European policies towards the east and Russia, has in effect been blacklisted. Reasons for this lie in the policies of its new nationalist, conservative and Eurosceptic Law and Justice government, elected last October. There has been a worrying rush to discipline the media, the judiciary and parts of the civil service \u2013 in effect, trampling over key checks and balances.That EU institutions have put Poland\u2019s new leaders under special measures is a good thing. After all, European democratic norms only exist if they are protected. But this is a case where geopolitics can hardly be ignored, and where history looms heavily.German-Polish rapprochement has been a staple of European stability and enlargement over the past 25 yearsFor Europe, the biggest risk over Poland relates not just to the rule of law but to the damage that could be done to one of Europe\u2019s key pillars: German-Polish post-cold war reconciliation.Just as Franco-German reconciliation was essential to the European project from its founding in the 1950s, German-Polish rapprochement has been a staple of European stability and enlargement over the past 25 years. That picture has suddenly turned bleak.Germany is being framed by the new Polish ruling elite as an enemy, with one magazine even depicting Angela Merkel in a Nazi uniform. The contrast could not be starker with the message given five years ago by the then Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski, who described Germany as \u201cEurope\u2019s indispensable nation\u201d and said he feared \u201cGerman power less than German inactivity\u201d. No doubt Sikorski had the eurozone crisis in mind at the time, but the historical sweep of his language was obvious.That the new Polish government wants to conflate Germany with all the woes it sees in the EU is one thing \u2013 other critics of Brussels, in Greece and elsewhere, have resorted to similar reflexes in recent years. But this time a strategic divide risks opening up in the heart of Europe.It is significant that Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, who runs Poland\u2019s majority party, held a long one-to-one meeting with Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n last week, seemingly aimed at consolidating a central European populistic, illiberal axis, intended to counter pressure from Brussels or western European nations. This is one development Britain should pay closer attention to \u2013 and not just because Cameron has a wishlist.United by an authoritarian, nationalistic streak, Poland and Hungary can now work on spreading their political alliance to neighbouring states, where populism is on the rise. The refugee issue is an obvious rallying point. On this issue as on others, from climate change to sanctions, the ability of EU states to act together is ultimately at stake.With Britain more or less out of the picture, and with France more focused on counter-terrorism, it will be yet again up to Merkel to try to address this new problem of European cohesion. On one hand, that is a shame, because for many historical reasons Britain and France have a special relationship with Poland. On the other hand, it is hardly surprising. Poland\u2019s economy is closely connected to Germany\u2019s.Merkel has stayed remarkably aloof from the dispute, playing for time as she often does. Meanwhile Martin Schulz, the German head of the European parliament \u2013 which is due to debate Poland\u2019s democratic backsliding on Tuesday \u2013 has lashed out at the Kaczy\u0144ski team with talk of a \u201ccoup\u201d and of a \u201cPutinisation of European politics\u201d. Some EU officials say they wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Merkel suddenly met the new Polish prime minister for a hard-headed conversation, just as she did with Orb\u00e1n last year when the Ukrainian crisis required European unity.Of course, it doesn\u2019t help that the EU has mostly let Orb\u00e1n off the hook over his autocratic methods. Coming down hard now on Poland, however justified it may be, could be taken as a double standard. Stepping back, all this shows the extent to which Europe\u2019s reunification after 1989 remains a work in progress, even if the process has brought so many accomplishments and has inspired so many, in Ukraine and beyond. There is no risk of Poland dropping out of the EU \u2013 unlike Britain \u2013 but, taken together, the faultlines are dangerous.

Yet I never knew he\u2019d taken a photograph of me that day, and neither did he.Many years later, when we had become friends, he dropped a get-well card for Rolf through our letterbox; he had just come out of hospital. It was a postcard made from one of his own photographs following an exhibition years earlier. To my utter amazement, there I was. It was a total coincidence. The picture was just a passing snapshot, a reflex, Rudi told me; he took it quickly, spoke to no one and moved on, not knowing if the light or the composition were any good.It\u2019s such an ordinary scene that I sometimes wonder why people care. But this sort of spontaneous \u201cstreet\u201d photography depicts real life, and that\u2019s always interesting. It tells you what everyday life was like back then.

Some bar owners offer more than just nuts and olives but, basically, the custom belongs to an old-style Italy, where mamma\u2019s food is best and the family gathers round her table each night. Related: 10 of the best places to stay in Italy for foodies But that is changing: mamma may be out at work herself, rather than in the kitchen hand-rolling tortelloni. In the past few years, starting in Milan and Turin, a new twist on the custom caters for students and a younger crowd \u2013 who perhaps don\u2019t have the funds for a restaurant dinner, or the time to go home and eat before hitting the clubs. This is the apericena (formed by adding cena \u2013 dinner \u2013 to aperitivo).Bars started offering a buffet of homemade hot and cold dishes with evening drinks \u2013 substantial enough to constitute a light dinner \u2013 at a relatively light price \u2013 often \u20ac10 for one drink and the buffet. High-end spots, with a great view or setting, say, rarely charge more than \u20ac20. Now, to the consternation of traditional restaurateurs, apericena joints have sprung up in many university cities \u2013 in Pisa, Florence, Bologna and Padua.Crostini, bruschette, salads, roasted vegetables, cured meats, baked pastas, risottos and hot and cold meat and fish dishes, plus desserts from tarts to ice-creams, make satisfying and affordable fuel for a night on the tiles. Related: Elena Ferrante\u2019s Ischia: an Italian island paradise In Milan, apericena\u2019s spiritual home, the Exotic restaurant and bar, a short walk from the university, makes a feature of it on Monday nights, with a \u20ac10 buffet of salads, pastas, meats and vegetable dishes. At 10pm it is replaced by a dessert buffet: nutella-stuffed pastries, ice-cream and fruit. In Turin, those in the know make for studenty, cinema-themed Lobelix Cafe on Via Corte d\u2019Appello. It\u2019s decorated with old film posters and strips of film, and \u20ac11 buys a drink (aperitif, glass of wine or draught beer) plus unlimited visits to the buffet of pasta, veg, meat and fish dishes \u2013 with glass covers to keep everything fresh and appetising. Food can be eaten on the closed-in terrace with views of the eponymous obelisk in Piazza Savoia.Visitors to Italy\u2019s tourist meccas can also enjoy the trend: studenty areas are the best bet. In Florence, Kitsch bar on Viale Gramsci is as ornate as the name suggests, and does a generous buffet of pastas and meat and veg dishes, plus fruit and cake (\u20ac10 for first drink, subsequent drinks \u20ac4). It\u2019s mostly Tuscan food, but does occasional themed nights, such as Mexican. There is another branch, Kitsch Devx, near the station.Apericena is harder to find in the south, but Bar Pappagallo (via Anastasio II 45), behind the Vatican gardens in Rome, does an amazing value one for \u20ac8 every night until 10pm, with a cocktail, beer or wine, plus risottos, house-made pasta, veg, cold meats and cheese, and tasty nibbles like arancini.And from this winter, you don\u2019t even have to go to Italy for an apericena: northern wine bar chain Veeno does an unlimited buffet of Italian food (\u00a37 for first drink) every Wednesday in its Manchester, York and Leeds branches.", "tags": ["Italy holidays", "Food and drink", "Europe holidays", "Travel", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "title": "Italy embraces apericena: the student supper"},{"date": "2016-02-19T18:12:12Z", "content": "Italy is the original tourist destination, an open museum for pilgrims, Grand Tourists, foodies, beach bums and church crawlers. The country \u2013 the fifth most visited in the world, with almost 47 million visitors spending a total of \u00a332bn a year \u2013 is assiduous in promoting tourism. It takes a brave person to turn those kind of gushing taps off. But in some overwhelmed parts of the country, that is what is happening.This week Italian authorities declared they are going to limit the number of visitors to the Cinque Terre, a collection of five fishing villages in Liguria. Tourist numbers will be capped at 1.5 million (a million less than last year) because these tiny communities are unable to cope with the influx. The announcement follows a ban last year on huge cruise ships entering the Venetian lagoon. Related: Italy to impose limits on visitors to Cinque Terre with tourist 'ticket' system It\u2019s a counter-intuitive move, because most tourist destinations want as many visitors as possible. And it shows up tourism as a Faustian pact: the more visitors you have and the more money you make, the less you are the naive, folkloric, authentic, untouched place of\u00a0the tourists\u2019 imagination.The defence of tourism has always been that it \u201cbroadens the mind\u201d. We imagine that hanging out with exotic peoples in unusual places will remove from us any petty provincialism. But in an age of mass tourism, the interaction with those peoples and places has lost its depth. Our exchange has become merely commercial.I remember years ago asking for directions in a package-tour area of Jamaica. A man pointed me in the right direction and, just as I was imagining that he and I had broken down some kind of cultural or racial barrier, he asked me for a dollar in a mildly menacing way. Tourism has become equivalent to a one-night stand, with each side grabbing what they want: the tourist gets a selfie in front of an iconic building and the locals empty visitors\u2019 pockets as thoroughly as possible.The observer, of course, always affects the observed, and travel can ruin the places we come to see. The nearest tourist attraction to where I live is Glastonbury Tor in Somerset. It\u2019s a lovely, petite hill with views stretching far over the finest county in England. But so many people walk it that the path is now made of concrete, and we\u2019re\u00a0warned, in a notice at the kissing gate, that we mustn\u2019t stray. It hardly makes for a stroll amidst nature.That\u2019s why so many tourist destinations are brutally dismissive of those they receive. Every country has a similar term to the West Country\u2019s \u201cgrockle\u201d or Spain\u2019s \u201cguiri\u201d: words which express disdain for these gawking, ungainly visitors.The most painful recent example was the toe-curling story of the couple who went to the Maldives to renew their marriage vows. The hotel charged them \u00a3820 for a ceremony in which hotel staff, speaking Dhivehi which they didn\u2019t understand, viciously insulted them. That dreadful story captured the weird world of westerners longing for a paradise, for virginal land; and of locals ripping them off and belittling them.Some countries address the dilemma with innovation. Bhutan doesn\u2019t limit its number of tourists, but it does force them \u2013 through package tours \u2013 to spend $250 a day in high season ($200 in low), which apparently funds education, healthcare and so on. Other places, such as Venice, have vastly differing costs for tourist attractions according to whether you are a resident or not. But those measures only underline that the relationship with you really is primarily commercial. Other destinations (like Costa Rica or the Gal\u00e1pagos) encourage tourists to see themselves as eco-benefactors or as witnesses to sustainability. But eco-tourism is a blatant contradiction in terms.Part of the problem is that our escapism often serves to emphasise the epic inequality in our world. It\u2019s entirely understandable (especially if you\u2019re from northern Europe) to chase sunshine and sandy beaches. But then every year we see those heart-wrenching images of refugees crawling ashore in Lampedusa as Europeans slap on the sun cream. We are those privileged Europeans, whether we\u2019re in\u00a0that photo or not.We will keep travelling manically because we\u2019re instinctive wanderers. Curiosity is a good thing, and it really does open the heart and mind as much as it does the wallet. No one wants it to\u00a0end. If the tourism industry stopped existing tomorrow, the global economy would massively suffer. Tourism accounts for almost a third of the world\u2019s services.But maybe we should put the sandal on the other foot.

However, the budget must also be approved by Brussels, which only last week warned the rightwing government of Mariano Rajoy in Spain that proposals to relax austerity measures in its 2016 budget could be rejected.New fiscal rules, adopted after the eurozone debt crisis, give the European commission power to seek amendments to national budgets.Renzi, who has made tax cuts a rallying cry ever since he came to office in February last year, appears to be prepared for a fight against the Brussels elite that wants Italy to take the opportunity of its recent recovery to step up fiscal tightening.Alessandro Zattoni, an economics professor at the LUISS business school in Rome, said the EU commission is concerned that the deterioration in world trade following the slowdown in China could hurt the Italian economy, hitting tax revenues and further widening the budget deficit.Last month, the government increased its target for 2016\u2019s deficit to 2.2% of output, up from 1.8%, and said it expected the national debt to hit 131.4% of national income (GDP), up from a previous forecast of 130.9%. Renzi said that nonetheless, the debt-to-GDP ratio would begin to fall next year for the first time in nine years, and said other countries that were critical of Italy did not themselves respect the EU\u2019s fiscal rules. Zattoni said Brussels was likely to give Renzi a fair hearing after he imposed stringent austerity measures last year and was forced to increase spending this year to cope with the refugee crisis.\u201cIt is about the feeling in Brussels. And I think that has improved after a series of reforms and Renzi\u2019s handling of the refugee situation,\u201d he said.\u201cBut Brussels will want to keep an eye on Rome because it is concerned that the economy and the budget could be vulnerable to a deterioration in global trade.\u201dHe said business-friendly tax cuts and reforms were good news for the business community and especially entrepreneurs, which have struggled against a tax system that can sometimes charge more than 100% of profits.Reforms to the pension system, allowing older workers to work part-time while drawing their pension, could also free up jobs for younger workers, he said.A tax break for employers who hire staff on unlimited contracts will be continued, although the benefit to employers could be cut after it proved hugely successful.The government ams to limit the growth in short-term contracts that have played a dominant role since the financial crash but have also left millions of younger workers on low pay with little job security.", "tags": ["Austerity", "Eurozone", "Italy", "Business", "Europe", "World news", "Economics"], "title": "Italy budget: Renzi risks Brussels battle"},{"date": "2015-10-06T14:00:21Z", "content": "The conflict in Syria has created the biggest refugee crisis since the second world war, with over 11 million people forced from their homes and more than 200,000 killed.

If the shadow foreign secretary has serious designs on becoming the next great Labour leader, he could start by not taking questions quite so literally. Camelot was built on myth and legend, not breakfast menus.Then again, he could have been distracted by John McDonnell\u2019s appearance on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI thought it was great oratory,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. \u201cIt reminded me of Tony Blair\u2019s speech when taking us to war in Iraq.\u201d As Nick Robinson pointed out this seemed to be more of a slap than a compliment, as McDonnell considers Blair a war criminal. \u201cThat\u2019s not the language I\u2019m using,\u201d McDonnell insisted. But it was. It was precisely the language he was using; McDonnell doesn\u2019t do unintentional.Maybe this early backlash failed to penetrate Benn\u2019s shield of moral certainty. The shield that turns whirlwinds into zephyrs and ploughshares into swords. Or maybe Benn just is nerdily literal. The Breezeblock Camelot. Normal, Jim, but not as we know it. Maybe Benn\u2019s compelling closing speech during Wednesday night\u2019s debate on launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, had just been a 15-minute aberration in an otherwise routinely dull 62 years.That\u2019s certainly the impression Normal Hilary was out to give as he took his seat on the government\u2019s front bench to listen to an urgent question about the overseas territory joint ministerial council. It was a parliamentary session that took place in a near empty chamber and was every bit as dull as the subject matter suggested. There was no need for Normal Hilary to be there as he was not required to speak. He could have been doing the round of all the media outlets clamouring to talk to him. He could even have allowed himself another croissant. Perhaps even, as a special treat, a pain au chocolat. But Normal Hilary was abnormally keen to be normal and that\u2019s why he was there. Another day, the same as any other dayNot even Abnormally Normal Hilary could pretend to be interested for a full hour, however, as two junior ministers went head to head on financial governance, climate change and sports participation in Britain\u2019s overseas territory. So, as his eyes closed in contemplation, perhaps he did allow himself a moment to consider where his oratory had taken him. How many civilian deaths could his conscience take? And what of Syria?

It recently pledged to double funding to the crisis to more than \u00a32.3bn by 2020 to fund education, jobs and humanitarian protection in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.But the report \u2013 which focuses on February 2012 to June 2014 \u2013 notes that the department, like the UK government, originally believed the fighting would tail off, paving the way for a more stable regime.\u201cFor a significant period \u2026 DfID\u2019s strategic position appeared to assume (and the UK appeared to desire) that the conflict would be limited, a new regime would be put in place and that displacement of refugees would be temporary,\u201d it says.\u201cAs a result, DfID did not want to commit long-term staff resources to the crisis.\u201dThe report suggests that while the department has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to work in fragile states, cope with disasters and engage in traditional development work, it had never been confronted with a complex emergency in a comparatively well developed region. \u201cDfID corporately does not yet have a clear idea how it should respond to a crisis like Syria,\u201d says the report, which was handed to DfID in January last year but only published by the department this week.\u201cDfID was not, and remains not, sufficiently ready to manage a blended crisis at scale \u2013 ie a regional conflict in middle-income countries that does not fit within in its standard delivery models.\u201dIt concedes that DfID had a difficult start as it, like many others, had no presence in the region.But it says the department would have done better to set up a dedicated unit of experienced staff led by a senior civil servant, rather than handing responsibility to its Middle East and North African department (Menad) \u2013 as it did initially. The decision to let Menad manage the response gave rise to \u201ctwo internal \u2018tribes\u2019\u201d: technical experts brought in on contracts, and London-based DfID staff, most of whom had little experience of managing rapidly changing emergencies. It adds: \u201cGiven the Syria crisis has been the largest humanitarian response that DfID has ever committed to, it is surprising that more experienced staff were not put in place.\u201dBy May 2013 \u2013 two years after the outbreak of civil war \u2013 DfID decided to set up a dedicated crisis unit (SCU). But once again, there were staffing problems. Difficulties in recruiting led to a dependence on temporary and contracted staff, including recent graduates. The report says their inexperience \u2013 combined with the \u201csclerotic\u201d effect of having to provide constant spending updates to senior management \u2013 led to \u201cpoor prioritisation, overwork and undue stress\u201d.

But while the report is intended to help DfID learn lessons rather than hold it to account, it contains a blunt warning that the coming emergencies are likely to be Syria-shaped \u2013 and that far more needs to be done: \u201cWe note that, with increasing and persistent instability likely, DfID will almost certainly be called on to respond to similar crises in the future and suggest it develops a clearer view of how to rapidly put in place a fully capable resource.\u201dDfID said the Syria strategy was superseded in 2014 by \u201ccountry-specific operational plans\u201d that were underpinned by a \u201cseries of scenarios\u201d for the region.

Maybe Benn\u2019s compelling closing speech during Wednesday night\u2019s debate on launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, had just been a 15-minute aberration in an otherwise routinely dull 62 years.That\u2019s certainly the impression Normal Hilary was out to give as he took his seat on the government\u2019s front bench to listen to an urgent question about the overseas territory joint ministerial council. It was a parliamentary session that took place in a near empty chamber and was every bit as dull as the subject matter suggested. There was no need for Normal Hilary to be there as he was not required to speak. He could have been doing the round of all the media outlets clamouring to talk to him. He could even have allowed himself another croissant. Perhaps even, as a special treat, a pain au chocolat. But Normal Hilary was abnormally keen to be normal and that\u2019s why he was there.

In particular, the house just off Regent\u2019s Park of the theatre impresario Cameron Mackintosh.\u201cSir Cameron is most unhappy,\u201d said Meyric Lewis, Mackintosh\u2019s lawyer. So unhappy that he was thinking of mounting a new production of Springtime for Camden and HS2, in London\u2019s West End.

It\u2019s about politics and diplomacy and humanitarian aid, all of which we need to bring to bear to bring peace to Syria, but to make sure we protect our national interest of fighting against this appalling terrorist organisation.\u201dThe prime minister said he had led the process carefully in the run-up to the vote because the danger faced by Britain\u2019s armed forces preyed on his mind. \u201cThis has been a very deliberate and proper process \u2013 a cabinet meeting, legal advice, a proper motion in front of the House of Commons, 10-and-a-half-hours\u2019 debate tomorrow in the House of Commons and obviously we should think of our brave armed forces and their families for the risk that they take on our behalf.

Related: How will MPs vote on Syria airstrikes? The Labour leader highlighted the bitter divisions at the highest level of the party when he said that the shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, and other supporters of airstrikes would be guilty of approving the killing of civilians in Syria.Speaking on the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2, Corbyn said of Benn: \u201cHis belief is that we can get rid of Isil by bombing them. My reply to him and everybody else that supports bombing: when you bomb a town like Raqqa \u2013 where there are several hundred thousand people living there, who may or may not wish to be under Isil control, indeed many are trying to escape from there \u2013 we are going to kill people; we are going to kill people in their homes by our bombs. I think we should be very careful about that.\u201dCorbyn explained why he was allowing his MPs a free vote. \u201cI am saying to every MP: you make up your own mind, there is no hiding place behind a whipping arrangement or not: your decision, on behalf of your constituents, whether or not we should commit British troops into yet another war in the Middle East with no endgame in sight, no proper plan in sight, a mythical 75,000-strong apparently unknown Free Syrian Army operation which is also infiltrated by a lot of jihadist elements.

It recently pledged to double funding to the crisis to more than \u00a32.3bn by 2020 to fund education, jobs and humanitarian protection in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.But the report \u2013 which focuses on February 2012 to June 2014 \u2013 notes that the department, like the UK government, originally believed the fighting would tail off, paving the way for a more stable regime.\u201cFor a significant period \u2026 DfID\u2019s strategic position appeared to assume (and the UK appeared to desire) that the conflict would be limited, a new regime would be put in place and that displacement of refugees would be temporary,\u201d it says.\u201cAs a result, DfID did not want to commit long-term staff resources to the crisis.\u201dThe report suggests that while the department has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to work in fragile states, cope with disasters and engage in traditional development work, it had never been confronted with a complex emergency in a comparatively well developed region. \u201cDfID corporately does not yet have a clear idea how it should respond to a crisis like Syria,\u201d says the report, which was handed to DfID in January last year but only published by the department this week.\u201cDfID was not, and remains not, sufficiently ready to manage a blended crisis at scale \u2013 ie a regional conflict in middle-income countries that does not fit within in its standard delivery models.\u201dIt concedes that DfID had a difficult start as it, like many others, had no presence in the region.But it says the department would have done better to set up a dedicated unit of experienced staff led by a senior civil servant, rather than handing responsibility to its Middle East and North African department (Menad) \u2013 as it did initially. The decision to let Menad manage the response gave rise to \u201ctwo internal \u2018tribes\u2019\u201d: technical experts brought in on contracts, and London-based DfID staff, most of whom had little experience of managing rapidly changing emergencies. It adds: \u201cGiven the Syria crisis has been the largest humanitarian response that DfID has ever committed to, it is surprising that more experienced staff were not put in place.\u201dBy May 2013 \u2013 two years after the outbreak of civil war \u2013 DfID decided to set up a dedicated crisis unit (SCU). But once again, there were staffing problems. Difficulties in recruiting led to a dependence on temporary and contracted staff, including recent graduates. The report says their inexperience \u2013 combined with the \u201csclerotic\u201d effect of having to provide constant spending updates to senior management \u2013 led to \u201cpoor prioritisation, overwork and undue stress\u201d. The large number of SCU staff based in London conspired to make \u201cthe concerns of Whitehall and HQ \u2026 more immediate and dominant\u201d than those of people in the field.\u201cWe understand that there are resource constraints to placing more staff in the field, but this appears to be a false economy,\u201d says the report.The response was also hampered by a lack of foresight and planning.

We had a meeting of the cabinet this morning and have agreed the motion that will be put in front of the House of Commons. \u201cThat motion talks about, yes, the necessity of taking military action agains Isil in Syria as well as Iraq, but it is part of a broader strategy. It\u2019s about politics and diplomacy and humanitarian aid, all of which we need to bring to bear to bring peace to Syria, but to make sure we protect our national interest of fighting against this appalling terrorist organisation.\u201dThe prime minister said he had led the process carefully in the run-up to the vote because the danger faced by Britain\u2019s armed forces preyed on his mind. \u201cThis has been a very deliberate and proper process \u2013 a cabinet meeting, legal advice, a proper motion in front of the House of Commons, 10-and-a-half-hours\u2019 debate tomorrow in the House of Commons and obviously we should think of our brave armed forces and their families for the risk that they take on our behalf. That obviously preys very heavily on my mind.\u201dCorbyn rejected the claim by Downing Street that the motion incorporated the Labour party conference motion on the grounds that the recent UN security council resolution had not been agreed under the chapter seven procedure.  Related: How will MPs vote on Syria airstrikes? The Labour leader highlighted the bitter divisions at the highest level of the party when he said that the shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, and other supporters of airstrikes would be guilty of approving the killing of civilians in Syria.Speaking on the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2, Corbyn said of Benn: \u201cHis belief is that we can get rid of Isil by bombing them. My reply to him and everybody else that supports bombing: when you bomb a town like Raqqa \u2013 where there are several hundred thousand people living there, who may or may not wish to be under Isil control, indeed many are trying to escape from there \u2013 we are going to kill people; we are going to kill people in their homes by our bombs. I think we should be very careful about that.\u201dCorbyn explained why he was allowing his MPs a free vote. \u201cI am saying to every MP: you make up your own mind, there is no hiding place behind a whipping arrangement or not: your decision, on behalf of your constituents, whether or not we should commit British troops into yet another war in the Middle East with no endgame in sight, no proper plan in sight, a mythical 75,000-strong apparently unknown Free Syrian Army operation which is also infiltrated by a lot of jihadist elements. We are going into a very dangerous situation altogether.\u201d Related: We need Chilcot\u2019s lessons from Iraq now \u2013 before we bomb Syria | Richard Norton-Taylor The main contributions at the cabinet meeting that agreed the motion came from Theresa May, who addressed national security issues, Michael Fallon, who outlined the UK\u2019s military capabilities, the attorney general, Jeremy Wright, who outlined the legal basis, and the international development secretary, Justine Greening, who spoke about plans for humanitarian stabilisation in Syria.The motion says Isis presents a direct threat to the UK and quotes the recent UN security council resolution to say that it constitutes an \u201cunprecedented threat to international peace and security\u201d and to say that member states should take \u201call necessary measures\u201d to prevent terrorist acts by Isis.

It recently pledged to double funding to the crisis to more than \u00a32.3bn by 2020 to fund education, jobs and humanitarian protection in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.But the report \u2013 which focuses on February 2012 to June 2014 \u2013 notes that the department, like the UK government, originally believed the fighting would tail off, paving the way for a more stable regime.\u201cFor a significant period \u2026 DfID\u2019s strategic position appeared to assume (and the UK appeared to desire) that the conflict would be limited, a new regime would be put in place and that displacement of refugees would be temporary,\u201d it says.\u201cAs a result, DfID did not want to commit long-term staff resources to the crisis.\u201dThe report suggests that while the department has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to work in fragile states, cope with disasters and engage in traditional development work, it had never been confronted with a complex emergency in a comparatively well developed region. \u201cDfID corporately does not yet have a clear idea how it should respond to a crisis like Syria,\u201d says the report, which was handed to DfID in January last year but only published by the department this week.\u201cDfID was not, and remains not, sufficiently ready to manage a blended crisis at scale \u2013 ie a regional conflict in middle-income countries that does not fit within in its standard delivery models.\u201dIt concedes that DfID had a difficult start as it, like many others, had no presence in the region.But it says the department would have done better to set up a dedicated unit of experienced staff led by a senior civil servant, rather than handing responsibility to its Middle East and North African department (Menad) \u2013 as it did initially. The decision to let Menad manage the response gave rise to \u201ctwo internal \u2018tribes\u2019\u201d: technical experts brought in on contracts, and London-based DfID staff, most of whom had little experience of managing rapidly changing emergencies. It adds: \u201cGiven the Syria crisis has been the largest humanitarian response that DfID has ever committed to, it is surprising that more experienced staff were not put in place.\u201dBy May 2013 \u2013 two years after the outbreak of civil war \u2013 DfID decided to set up a dedicated crisis unit (SCU). But once again, there were staffing problems. Difficulties in recruiting led to a dependence on temporary and contracted staff, including recent graduates. The report says their inexperience \u2013 combined with the \u201csclerotic\u201d effect of having to provide constant spending updates to senior management \u2013 led to \u201cpoor prioritisation, overwork and undue stress\u201d. The large number of SCU staff based in London conspired to make \u201cthe concerns of Whitehall and HQ \u2026 more immediate and dominant\u201d than those of people in the field.\u201cWe understand that there are resource constraints to placing more staff in the field, but this appears to be a false economy,\u201d says the report.The response was also hampered by a lack of foresight and planning. Although the SCU agreed to provide an NGO with \u00a35m to help it prepare winter resources in December 2013, the decision came too late to allow the NGO to deliver on time.The study does, however, acknowledge the enormous complexity of the crisis. \u201cAnticipation and early action were not possible in the early stages of the Syrian conflict,\u201d it says.\u201cThe international community failed to anticipate the extent to which the Arab spring \u2026 would reconfigure the region\u2019s political and social landscape.\u201dIt also recognises that DfID brought its Syria programme on to a \u201cmore stable footing\u201d during 2014, increasing its longer-term focus, resilience work and multi-year funding. But while the report is intended to help DfID learn lessons rather than hold it to account, it contains a blunt warning that the coming emergencies are likely to be Syria-shaped \u2013 and that far more needs to be done: \u201cWe note that, with increasing and persistent instability likely, DfID will almost certainly be called on to respond to similar crises in the future and suggest it develops a clearer view of how to rapidly put in place a fully capable resource.\u201dDfID said the Syria strategy was superseded in 2014 by \u201ccountry-specific operational plans\u201d that were underpinned by a \u201cseries of scenarios\u201d for the region. The department added: \u201cThe DfID Syria team is committed to sharing learning across DfID to help other teams better prepare for and manage future response to crises whilst recognising that each context is very different.\u201dSince fighting broke out in Syria in March 2011, 7.6 million people have been internally displaced and almost 4.7 million forced to flee as refugees. A recent report from the Syrian Centre for Policy Research put the number of deaths caused by the war, directly and indirectly, at 470,000 \u2013 almost double the figure of 250,000 used by the UN until it stopped collecting statistics 18 months ago.", "tags": ["Global development", "Humanitarian response", "Aid", "Department for International Development (DfID)", "Politics", "Syria", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "title": "Syria crisis blindsided UK government, says report"},{"date": "2015-12-02T08:44:12Z", "content": "Here is the text of the Commons motion on Syria tabled by the prime minister, David Cameron, the chancellor, George Osborne, the home secretary, Theresa May, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, and the international development secretary, Justine Greening:\u201cThat this House notes that Isil [Islamic State] poses a direct threat to the United Kingdom; welcomes United Nations security council resolution 2249 which determines that Isil constitutes an \u2018unprecedented threat to international peace and security\u2019 and calls on states to take \u2018all necessary measures\u2019 to prevent terrorist acts by Isil and to \u2018eradicate the safe haven they have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria\u2019; further notes the clear legal basis to defend the UK and our allies in accordance with the UN charter; notes that military action against Isil is only one component of a broader strategy to bring peace and stability to Syria; welcomes the renewed impetus behind the Vienna talks on a ceasefire and political settlement; welcomes the government\u2019s continuing commitment to providing humanitarian support to Syrian refugees; underlines the importance of planning for post-conflict stabilisation and reconstruction in Syria; welcomes the government\u2019s continued determination to cut Isil\u2019s sources of finance, fighters and weapons; notes the requests from France, the US and regional allies for UK military assistance; acknowledges the importance of seeking to avoid civilian casualties, using the UK\u2019s particular capabilities; notes the government will not deploy UK troops in ground combat operations; welcomes the government\u2019s commitment to provide quarterly progress reports to the House; and accordingly supports Her Majesty\u2019s government in taking military action, specifically airstrikes, exclusively against Isil in Syria; and offers its wholehearted support to Her Majesty\u2019s armed forces.\u201d ", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "Politics", "UK news", "World news"], "title": "The Syria motion on airstrikes: full text"},{"date": "2015-12-01T11:43:51Z", "content": "MPs are to debate and vote on a government motion to extend UK airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria on Wednesday. David Cameron will almost certainly get enough votes as about 60 Labour MPs \u2013 in a free vote agreed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 are expected to vote with the government. The vote comes two years after parliament rejected a motion for the UK to take military action against Bashar al-Assad after a suspected chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. Here are where British papers stand on the eve of the vote.The Daily Telegraph favours military action but has many reservations.When the vote comes, a majority for action would be sensible and in line with public opinion, but Mr Cameron should take nothing for granted here. Many who will support him will do so with very reasonable concerns about what happens next. How will the ground forces needed to defeat Isil be constituted and directed? What will become of the Assad regime? What can be done to prevent the monstrous ideology that drives Isil erupting in some other place after Syria? Mr Cameron has been assiduous in trying to answer such questions, but he can still do more. He should also be realistic about what British military force can accomplish; despite plans for welcome increases in defence spending, RAF capability in the region is limited.The Financial Times is troubled by the lack of international unity and the absence of ground troops, but thinks Cameron\u2019s arguments are valid. (paywall)The UN security council has called on member states to take all necessary measures to \u201ceradicate the safe haven [Isis] have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria\u201d. This gives a strong legal grounding to what is primarily a political and moral case for action. After the Paris attacks, Britain has a duty to demonstrate that it is in lock step with its neighbour. As Mr Cameron has said, if the UK does not stand with France at this moment, its allies could be forgiven for asking: \u201cIf not now, when?\u201dFor all western governments, Syria presents an exceptionally difficult diplomatic and military problem. That should not stop the UK, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, from playing the fullest possible role in seeking to resolve it. This will not happen if Britain stays on the sidelines of the anti-Isis campaign in Syria.The Independent says British airstrikes are useful but only if accompanied by strong diplomacy.The case for Britain sending RAF fighters into the skies above Raqqa has merit \u2013 so long as the drawbacks are acknowledged, and the relative military insignificance of such a move is understood... But Isis will not be defeated by air strikes, and Britain should not fool itself that it is possible to do so. The deployment of the RAF is useful \u2013 but only in so far as it lays the ground for more muscular diplomacy.The Daily Express hammers Corbyn while coming out in favour of hitting Isis in Syria.We know that the terrorist tribe laying waste to Iraq and Syria, and whose tentacles have spread bloodshed around the world, are experts at the internet and social media. If they are following Calamity Corbyn\u2019s antics on the news websites they must be chuckling in their desert foxholes. It is high time to wipe the smiles off their faces - and for Labour\u2019s leader to grow up.The Sunday Times argues that it is absurd for British warplanes to target Isis in Iraq but not Syria. (paywall)The situation in Syria is complex but the case for airstrikes is straightforward. It is an absurdity that Britain is allowed to target Isis in Iraq, but not across the border in its Syrian heartlands. And it would be wrong not to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies \u2014 and against those who would still seek to kill us whether or not we remain on the sidelines. The Guardian does not think Cameron has come up with a convincing strategy for defeating Isis and urges MPs to vote no.The UK government does not have to pretend any of these questions are easy. They are not. But it needs to offer more than an RAF wing and a prayer. If Mr Cameron had come to parliament with a wide-ranging international strategy for defeating Isis on every front \u2013 cultural and financial, through both the intelligence agencies and the military \u2013 we would have been open to that. We could be open to it still. But so far he has failed that test. Admittedly, the bar is higher now, the public more sceptical after Iraq than before. But as things stand, we believe MPs should say no.The Daily Mail would have favoured a western army of occupation if it had been an option, but bemoans the lack of a coherent strategy and comes out against.We would urge Britain to join Barack Obama and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande if they were proposing a mass, UK-Franco-American army of occupation. This would include, imperatively, Arab states in the region and, more vitally, a ten-year plan for establishing a UN protectorate. But if these less-than-impressive leaders, or Mr Cameron himself, have any coherent strategy for what happens after the bombers go in, we have yet to hear it. So, yes, it sickens the Mail to find ourselves in the same camp as Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, who pose as peace-lovers while nursing a soft spot for terrorists. Even more, it distresses us to know that many of our readers, for whom we have enormous respect, may disagree with us. But on balance, and with many misgivings, this paper believes the case for bombing Syria has not yet been made.The Observer argues that the struggle against Isis is essentially one of ideas rather than bombs. If Isis is destroyed but not discredited, debunked and exposed for the evil sham it is, other, possibly ever more extreme Islamist groups will likely take its place. As we said Britain is already at war. It is already assisting its French and American allies militarily. But at bottom, it is a war of values and ideas, not of more and more bombs. This is the fight we must win, however long it takes. Mr Cameron has failed to make the case for expanded military action in Syria. His proposal should not be supported.The Daily Mirror criticises what it calls a rush to vote and is not convinced that Cameron has persuaded the majority of the British public. (In today\u2019s paper but not on its site)Mr Cameron is wrong to rush to a vote tomorrow after a single day\u2019s discussion instead of pausing for the detailed two-day debate demanded by labour leaser Jeremy Corbyn and backed by the SNP and anti-war Conservatives...

If the shadow foreign secretary has serious designs on becoming the next great Labour leader, he could start by not taking questions quite so literally. Camelot was built on myth and legend, not breakfast menus.Then again, he could have been distracted by John McDonnell\u2019s appearance on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI thought it was great oratory,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. \u201cIt reminded me of Tony Blair\u2019s speech when taking us to war in Iraq.\u201d As Nick Robinson pointed out this seemed to be more of a slap than a compliment, as McDonnell considers Blair a war criminal. \u201cThat\u2019s not the language I\u2019m using,\u201d McDonnell insisted. But it was. It was precisely the language he was using; McDonnell doesn\u2019t do unintentional.Maybe this early backlash failed to penetrate Benn\u2019s shield of moral certainty. The shield that turns whirlwinds into zephyrs and ploughshares into swords. Or maybe Benn just is nerdily literal. The Breezeblock Camelot. Normal, Jim, but not as we know it. Maybe Benn\u2019s compelling closing speech during Wednesday night\u2019s debate on launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, had just been a 15-minute aberration in an otherwise routinely dull 62 years.That\u2019s certainly the impression Normal Hilary was out to give as he took his seat on the government\u2019s front bench to listen to an urgent question about the overseas territory joint ministerial council. It was a parliamentary session that took place in a near empty chamber and was every bit as dull as the subject matter suggested. There was no need for Normal Hilary to be there as he was not required to speak. He could have been doing the round of all the media outlets clamouring to talk to him. He could even have allowed himself another croissant. Perhaps even, as a special treat, a pain au chocolat. But Normal Hilary was abnormally keen to be normal and that\u2019s why he was there. Another day, the same as any other dayNot even Abnormally Normal Hilary could pretend to be interested for a full hour, however, as two junior ministers went head to head on financial governance, climate change and sports participation in Britain\u2019s overseas territory. So, as his eyes closed in contemplation, perhaps he did allow himself a moment to consider where his oratory had taken him. How many civilian deaths could his conscience take? And what of Syria? What would Raqqa look like when and if the bombing campaign was over?Had he used the time to wander over to the HS2 committee \u2013 the Jarndyce v Jarndyce of committees \u2013 he would have realised that post-war reconstruction might be a lot trickier and a great deal more expensive than even the most pessimistic of forecasts would have it.Having spent more than a year considering the plight of badgers, cycle tracks, endangered newts and property prices along the planned HS2 rail route, the committee has now reached Camden in London. In particular, the house just off Regent\u2019s Park of the theatre impresario Cameron Mackintosh.\u201cSir Cameron is most unhappy,\u201d said Meyric Lewis, Mackintosh\u2019s lawyer. So unhappy that he was thinking of mounting a new production of Springtime for Camden and HS2, in London\u2019s West End. What was holding him back was the intense worry about noise levels and the possibility that the volume of lorry traffic would make him a virtual prisoner in his own home. As the committee stared intently at slide P11272(6) from the Standard Pack, Mackintosh could not contain himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to be forced to move if it becomes intolerable,\u201d he declared morosely.Eager to avert this humanitarian tragedy, Tim Smart, HS2\u2019s head of engineering, produced slide P11309 which showed that, even at its worst, only 200 lorries would trundle past Mackintosh\u2019s door each day. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot less than in the St Pancras redevelopment,\u201d he said soothingly. Mackintosh stared at Smart as if he was an idiot. Didn\u2019t he know there was a huge difference between Camden and King\u2019s Cross? Worried the proceedings might be drawing to a halt rather too quickly, Lewis asked for clarification that the pre-survey survey of any land settlement above 10mm that had been agreed the day before had actually been agreed. It had.Abnormally Normally Hilary sighed. If it took so many people and so much time to agree the noise levels near one house, just think how much time it would take to rebuild an entire city. Even if the war were over by Christmas, the reconstruction of Raqqa would not be complete until February 2307. Perhaps sooner if the Syrians weren\u2019t quite so fussy. After all, Raqqa had always been a bit of a dump.

It recently pledged to double funding to the crisis to more than \u00a32.3bn by 2020 to fund education, jobs and humanitarian protection in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.But the report \u2013 which focuses on February 2012 to June 2014 \u2013 notes that the department, like the UK government, originally believed the fighting would tail off, paving the way for a more stable regime.\u201cFor a significant period \u2026 DfID\u2019s strategic position appeared to assume (and the UK appeared to desire) that the conflict would be limited, a new regime would be put in place and that displacement of refugees would be temporary,\u201d it says.\u201cAs a result, DfID did not want to commit long-term staff resources to the crisis.\u201dThe report suggests that while the department has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to work in fragile states, cope with disasters and engage in traditional development work, it had never been confronted with a complex emergency in a comparatively well developed region. \u201cDfID corporately does not yet have a clear idea how it should respond to a crisis like Syria,\u201d says the report, which was handed to DfID in January last year but only published by the department this week.\u201cDfID was not, and remains not, sufficiently ready to manage a blended crisis at scale \u2013 ie a regional conflict in middle-income countries that does not fit within in its standard delivery models.\u201dIt concedes that DfID had a difficult start as it, like many others, had no presence in the region.But it says the department would have done better to set up a dedicated unit of experienced staff led by a senior civil servant, rather than handing responsibility to its Middle East and North African department (Menad) \u2013 as it did initially. The decision to let Menad manage the response gave rise to \u201ctwo internal \u2018tribes\u2019\u201d: technical experts brought in on contracts, and London-based DfID staff, most of whom had little experience of managing rapidly changing emergencies. It adds: \u201cGiven the Syria crisis has been the largest humanitarian response that DfID has ever committed to, it is surprising that more experienced staff were not put in place.\u201dBy May 2013 \u2013 two years after the outbreak of civil war \u2013 DfID decided to set up a dedicated crisis unit (SCU). But once again, there were staffing problems. Difficulties in recruiting led to a dependence on temporary and contracted staff, including recent graduates. The report says their inexperience \u2013 combined with the \u201csclerotic\u201d effect of having to provide constant spending updates to senior management \u2013 led to \u201cpoor prioritisation, overwork and undue stress\u201d. The large number of SCU staff based in London conspired to make \u201cthe concerns of Whitehall and HQ \u2026 more immediate and dominant\u201d than those of people in the field.\u201cWe understand that there are resource constraints to placing more staff in the field, but this appears to be a false economy,\u201d says the report.The response was also hampered by a lack of foresight and planning. Although the SCU agreed to provide an NGO with \u00a35m to help it prepare winter resources in December 2013, the decision came too late to allow the NGO to deliver on time.The study does, however, acknowledge the enormous complexity of the crisis. \u201cAnticipation and early action were not possible in the early stages of the Syrian conflict,\u201d it says.\u201cThe international community failed to anticipate the extent to which the Arab spring \u2026 would reconfigure the region\u2019s political and social landscape.\u201dIt also recognises that DfID brought its Syria programme on to a \u201cmore stable footing\u201d during 2014, increasing its longer-term focus, resilience work and multi-year funding. But while the report is intended to help DfID learn lessons rather than hold it to account, it contains a blunt warning that the coming emergencies are likely to be Syria-shaped \u2013 and that far more needs to be done: \u201cWe note that, with increasing and persistent instability likely, DfID will almost certainly be called on to respond to similar crises in the future and suggest it develops a clearer view of how to rapidly put in place a fully capable resource.\u201dDfID said the Syria strategy was superseded in 2014 by \u201ccountry-specific operational plans\u201d that were underpinned by a \u201cseries of scenarios\u201d for the region. The department added: \u201cThe DfID Syria team is committed to sharing learning across DfID to help other teams better prepare for and manage future response to crises whilst recognising that each context is very different.\u201dSince fighting broke out in Syria in March 2011, 7.6 million people have been internally displaced and almost 4.7 million forced to flee as refugees. A recent report from the Syrian Centre for Policy Research put the number of deaths caused by the war, directly and indirectly, at 470,000 \u2013 almost double the figure of 250,000 used by the UN until it stopped collecting statistics 18 months ago.", "tags": ["Global development", "Humanitarian response", "Aid", "Department for International Development (DfID)", "Politics", "Syria", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "title": "Syria crisis blindsided UK government, says report"},{"date": "2015-12-02T08:44:12Z", "content": "Here is the text of the Commons motion on Syria tabled by the prime minister, David Cameron, the chancellor, George Osborne, the home secretary, Theresa May, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, and the international development secretary, Justine Greening:\u201cThat this House notes that Isil [Islamic State] poses a direct threat to the United Kingdom; welcomes United Nations security council resolution 2249 which determines that Isil constitutes an \u2018unprecedented threat to international peace and security\u2019 and calls on states to take \u2018all necessary measures\u2019 to prevent terrorist acts by Isil and to \u2018eradicate the safe haven they have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria\u2019; further notes the clear legal basis to defend the UK and our allies in accordance with the UN charter; notes that military action against Isil is only one component of a broader strategy to bring peace and stability to Syria; welcomes the renewed impetus behind the Vienna talks on a ceasefire and political settlement; welcomes the government\u2019s continuing commitment to providing humanitarian support to Syrian refugees; underlines the importance of planning for post-conflict stabilisation and reconstruction in Syria; welcomes the government\u2019s continued determination to cut Isil\u2019s sources of finance, fighters and weapons; notes the requests from France, the US and regional allies for UK military assistance; acknowledges the importance of seeking to avoid civilian casualties, using the UK\u2019s particular capabilities; notes the government will not deploy UK troops in ground combat operations; welcomes the government\u2019s commitment to provide quarterly progress reports to the House; and accordingly supports Her Majesty\u2019s government in taking military action, specifically airstrikes, exclusively against Isil in Syria; and offers its wholehearted support to Her Majesty\u2019s armed forces.\u201d ", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "Politics", "UK news", "World news"], "title": "The Syria motion on airstrikes: full text"},{"date": "2015-12-01T11:43:51Z", "content": "MPs are to debate and vote on a government motion to extend UK airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria on Wednesday. David Cameron will almost certainly get enough votes as about 60 Labour MPs \u2013 in a free vote agreed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 are expected to vote with the government. The vote comes two years after parliament rejected a motion for the UK to take military action against Bashar al-Assad after a suspected chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. Here are where British papers stand on the eve of the vote.The Daily Telegraph favours military action but has many reservations.When the vote comes, a majority for action would be sensible and in line with public opinion, but Mr Cameron should take nothing for granted here. Many who will support him will do so with very reasonable concerns about what happens next. How will the ground forces needed to defeat Isil be constituted and directed? What will become of the Assad regime? What can be done to prevent the monstrous ideology that drives Isil erupting in some other place after Syria? Mr Cameron has been assiduous in trying to answer such questions, but he can still do more. He should also be realistic about what British military force can accomplish; despite plans for welcome increases in defence spending, RAF capability in the region is limited.The Financial Times is troubled by the lack of international unity and the absence of ground troops, but thinks Cameron\u2019s arguments are valid. (paywall)The UN security council has called on member states to take all necessary measures to \u201ceradicate the safe haven [Isis] have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria\u201d. This gives a strong legal grounding to what is primarily a political and moral case for action. After the Paris attacks, Britain has a duty to demonstrate that it is in lock step with its neighbour. As Mr Cameron has said, if the UK does not stand with France at this moment, its allies could be forgiven for asking: \u201cIf not now, when?\u201dFor all western governments, Syria presents an exceptionally difficult diplomatic and military problem. That should not stop the UK, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, from playing the fullest possible role in seeking to resolve it. This will not happen if Britain stays on the sidelines of the anti-Isis campaign in Syria.The Independent says British airstrikes are useful but only if accompanied by strong diplomacy.The case for Britain sending RAF fighters into the skies above Raqqa has merit \u2013 so long as the drawbacks are acknowledged, and the relative military insignificance of such a move is understood... But Isis will not be defeated by air strikes, and Britain should not fool itself that it is possible to do so. The deployment of the RAF is useful \u2013 but only in so far as it lays the ground for more muscular diplomacy.The Daily Express hammers Corbyn while coming out in favour of hitting Isis in Syria.We know that the terrorist tribe laying waste to Iraq and Syria, and whose tentacles have spread bloodshed around the world, are experts at the internet and social media. If they are following Calamity Corbyn\u2019s antics on the news websites they must be chuckling in their desert foxholes. It is high time to wipe the smiles off their faces - and for Labour\u2019s leader to grow up.The Sunday Times argues that it is absurd for British warplanes to target Isis in Iraq but not Syria. (paywall)The situation in Syria is complex but the case for airstrikes is straightforward. It is an absurdity that Britain is allowed to target Isis in Iraq, but not across the border in its Syrian heartlands. And it would be wrong not to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies \u2014 and against those who would still seek to kill us whether or not we remain on the sidelines. The Guardian does not think Cameron has come up with a convincing strategy for defeating Isis and urges MPs to vote no.The UK government does not have to pretend any of these questions are easy. They are not. But it needs to offer more than an RAF wing and a prayer. If Mr Cameron had come to parliament with a wide-ranging international strategy for defeating Isis on every front \u2013 cultural and financial, through both the intelligence agencies and the military \u2013 we would have been open to that. We could be open to it still. But so far he has failed that test. Admittedly, the bar is higher now, the public more sceptical after Iraq than before. But as things stand, we believe MPs should say no.The Daily Mail would have favoured a western army of occupation if it had been an option, but bemoans the lack of a coherent strategy and comes out against.We would urge Britain to join Barack Obama and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande if they were proposing a mass, UK-Franco-American army of occupation. This would include, imperatively, Arab states in the region and, more vitally, a ten-year plan for establishing a UN protectorate. But if these less-than-impressive leaders, or Mr Cameron himself, have any coherent strategy for what happens after the bombers go in, we have yet to hear it. So, yes, it sickens the Mail to find ourselves in the same camp as Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, who pose as peace-lovers while nursing a soft spot for terrorists. Even more, it distresses us to know that many of our readers, for whom we have enormous respect, may disagree with us. But on balance, and with many misgivings, this paper believes the case for bombing Syria has not yet been made.The Observer argues that the struggle against Isis is essentially one of ideas rather than bombs. If Isis is destroyed but not discredited, debunked and exposed for the evil sham it is, other, possibly ever more extreme Islamist groups will likely take its place. As we said Britain is already at war. It is already assisting its French and American allies militarily. But at bottom, it is a war of values and ideas, not of more and more bombs. This is the fight we must win, however long it takes. Mr Cameron has failed to make the case for expanded military action in Syria. His proposal should not be supported.The Daily Mirror criticises what it calls a rush to vote and is not convinced that Cameron has persuaded the majority of the British public. (In today\u2019s paper but not on its site)Mr Cameron is wrong to rush to a vote tomorrow after a single day\u2019s discussion instead of pausing for the detailed two-day debate demanded by labour leaser Jeremy Corbyn and backed by the SNP and anti-war Conservatives... Yet the fact is, as things sand, the Prime Minister will soon secure Parliamentary approval to bomb Islamic State in Syria, and Britain will soon be in another war.\u201d", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "Syria", "Islamic State", "Newspapers & magazines", "Newspapers", "Daily Telegraph", "Financial Times", "The Independent", "Daily Express", "Sunday Times", "The Guardian", "Daily Mail", "The Observer", "Daily Mirror", "Media", "Politics", "World news", "UK news", "National newspapers"], "title": "Syria airstrikes: where do British papers stand?"},{"date": "2015-12-01T10:22:06Z", "content": "As Jeremy Corbyn offers his party a free vote over military action in Syria what are the arguments for and against the UK extending its air campaign against Islamic State militants?The government is planning to hold a Commons vote on Wednesday on extending Britain\u2019s bombing campaign against Isis from Iraq to Syria as public alarm about the extremist group\u2019s continuing strength increases in the wake of the attacks in Paris. David Cameron set out the \u201cmoral\u201d and \u201csecurity\u201d case for bombing Isis in Syria in the Commons last week, saying it was morally unacceptable to leave the US, France and other allies to carry the burden. \u201cIf not now, when?\u201d he asked MPs. The issue has exposed deep divisions in the Labour party. In 2013 Labour\u2019s opposition helped inflict a surprise defeat against Cameron and his plans to launch airstrikes against the regime of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, over his use of chemical weapons. More than two years later many in the parliamentary Labour party, including half the shadow cabinet, are much more convinced by the case for airstrikes in Syria against Isis, which has seized and held territory amid the civil war. Corbyn, the party leader, is opposed.There have been almost 3,000 airstrikes against Isis targets in Syria since a US-led campaign began in September 2014. More than 95% of these have been conducted by the United States, according to the US monitoring group Airwars. From the start, America\u2019s Gulf allies \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar \u2013 have all taken part in some of the airstrikes. In September, France joined the campaign, and has since stepped up its airstrikes in Syria in the wake of the Paris attacks with a \u201cmassive\u201d attack on the Isis stronghold of Raqqa in the north-east of the country. In September, Russia also launched airstrikes \u201cagainst terrorist groups\u201d in Syria. Fewer than 10% of its initial strikes were against Isis targets, the majority have been against anti-Assad groups, some backed by the US and Turkey. Isis controls large swaths of north-east Syria including its stronghold of Raqqa and a number of lucrative gas and oil fields in the east. It controls most of the territory along the banks of the Euphrates including strategically important dams. It only controls one of Syria\u2019s top 10 cities by population \u2013 Deir Ezzor near the border with Iraq.The number of people fighting for Isis is more difficult to gauge. In 2014 the CIA estimated its strength at up to 31,500 fighters in both Iraq and Syria. Since airstrikes began the US says it has killed at least 10,000 militants in both countries, though the arrival of fresh fighters from outside the country may not have significantly hit its overall strength. Some have estimated there are up to 50,000 Isis fighters in the region. Citing British intelligence, Cameron said there were about 70,000 non-extremist Syrian opposition fighters who could help fight Isis. What he didn\u2019t emphasise is that these fighters are split into at least 100 to 120 different groups, with various aims, and differing in size from thousands to just 100 to 200 members. So far they have not shown much interest in focusing on Isis, being too preoccupied fighting Assad\u2019s Syrian army. Related: Who are these 70,000 Syrian fighters David Cameron is relying on? The most effective groups militarily in the opposition are among the most hardline. Two groups currently dominant are Jaish al-Islam and Ahrar al-Sham, which have a combined strength of 27,500 fighters, according to analyst Charles Lister from the Brookings Doha centre. \u201cBoth of these groups and perhaps a small number of others are definitely not natural western allies, no doubt about it. But they vehemently oppose [Isis] being in Syria and have fought it successfully in the past \u2013 with far better results than our currently favoured allies, the Kurds,\u201d he points out. One of the other most powerful forces is the al-Qaida linked group, Jabhat al-Nusra, which has also been banned by the US. Both Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham have been heavily involved in ousting Isis fighters from Syria\u2019s Idlib province and the Aleppo countryside in the north.The alliances of \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition fighters in Syria is constantly shifting, but many still fight under the broad banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). They control much of the territory in and around the western Syrian cities of Hama and Homs. They include groups such as Tajamu Ala\u2019Azza and Liwa Suqor al-Jebel which have received CIA training and weapons. Groups allied with the FSA also control areas around Syria\u2019s southern border with Jordan. But after years of disunity and faltering advances the influence of the FSA is on the wane, according to the Guardian\u2019s Syria specialist, Martin Chulov. There are a series of global, regional and religious conflicts being played out in Syria that make the conflict so potentially explosive and complicated. These are the main battles: Whether the UK should get involved in this conflict is the subject of a debate that has exposed serious divisions in the Labour party, but also unease among some government backbenchers. The government\u2019s case is built on the argument that such action would disrupt the ability of Isis to organise attacks in Europe, while containing the extremist group by denying it territory and access to finance, primarily through oil exports. The investigation into the Paris attacks showed that at least half the perpetrators had undergone some kind of centrally organised training with Isis.The experience of the fight against al-Qaida suggests that precise targeting of training camps and leaders reduced its capacity to strike western capitals. Documents recovered by US navy seals at Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound showed that drone strikes had made it near impossible for al-Qaida to host and train foreign fighters in the main area under its control, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) in western Pakistan.However, there are also signs that Isis has learned from al-Qaida\u2019s mistakes, and now avoids structured training camps, preferring to live and organise in residential buildings among civilians.\u201cIn Raqqa, Deir Ezzor and Mosul, Isis is living almost totally among civilians, so you can\u2019t hit them,\u201d said Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. He pointed out that thousands of foreign jihadi had managed to travel to and from Syria for the past few years through Turkey and questioned the wisdom of now trying to stop militants with bombs when they could have been stopped with tighter border controls.The Paris conspirators, including the presumed ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, were able to travel between Belgium, France and Syria while the US-led airstrikes targeting Isis command and control were in full swing.US-led airstrikes helped stop Isis capturing key strategic points such as Kobane on the Turkish border, and the Kurdish stronghold of Irbil. In neighbouring Iraq, they were instrumental in preventing the fall of Baghdad when Isis\u2019s power was at its zenith. UK air support also played a role in the liberation of the Iraqi town of Sinjar by Kurdish peshmerga forces.Counter-terrorism experts say that such defeats damage Isis\u2019s international appeal to foreign jihadis, which depends on the image of a constantly expanding \u201ccaliphate\u201d.However, further gains against Isis will require something that has so far eluded the western coalition, a working alliance with other Sunni rebel groups in Syria. Hassan Hassan, a Syria expert at the Chatham House thinktank and co-author of Isis: Inside the Army of Terror, said that persuading other Sunni armed groups to fight Isis as well as the Assad regime may ultimately be the key to success, but that requires a great deal of local knowledge and political commitment.\u201cThe answer is not dropping more bombs,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cThe answer is to find a way to support these groups on the ground. It\u2019s not about money or even weapons. It is about helping them with tactics and an overall strategy that has been missing.\u201dHe argued that the expensive US efforts to build an anti-Isis rebel movement failed because it worked with the wrong people and lacked long-term political commitment. The success of any British military contribution, Hassan added, will lie in the UK\u2019s ability to \u201cbreak out of the constraints\u201d of Washington\u2019s current strategy.The recent emphasis on striking tankers carrying Isis oil exports is likely to dent the group\u2019s vast financial resources but may not affect its immediate fighting capacity. Hassan said Isis scored its most significant victories before it captured the oil fields.Airstrikes on Raqqa last week are reported to have killed at least 12 people, including five children, when bombs fell near a school. It was not clear whether the bombs were dropped by Russian, American or French planes.\u201cThe number of civilian casualties from Russian bombardment is far higher than the number caused by American and French airstrikes,\u201d said Wael Aleji, spokesman for the Syrian Network for Human Rights. \u201cThis can be attributed to technology. The Russians use more \u2018dumb\u2019 bombs and have less advanced guidance systems.\u201dIn his memorandum to the Commons, Cameron pointed to the enhanced precision of the UK\u2019s Brimstone missile as one of the contributions Britain can make to the air campaign. But avoiding civilian casualties will also depend on good intelligence. One of the worst civilian tolls attributed by human rights activists to a US strike was on 1 May near Aleppo, where more than 60 civilians were said to have been killed, perhaps more than half of them children. Abdurrahman said: \u201cWe think they got the wrong information. They thought it was Isis, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201dAs it becomes harder to find genuine Isis targets, as the terrorist group gets better at melting in with the surrounding population, the civilian toll is likely to rise. And Syrians on the receiving end are unlikely to make the distinction between British warplanes and Russian bombers sent by Assad\u2019s chief ally.\u201cThis is likely to generate support for Isis, or at least create indifference among local people,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cThese are the risks of unintended consequences.\u201dAntiwar demonstrators gathered outside Downing Street and other locations across the UK on Saturday, but a YouGov poll for the Times found that the majority of voters (59%) back airstrikes in Syria. There was clear backing even among Labour voters with 52% saying they would approve of airstrikes compared with 26% against. But Labour members, especially those who voted for Corbyn in the leadership contest, were overwhelming opposed to the move. Meanwhile Labour said a random sample of full individual Labour party members showed 75% were against UK bombing in Syria, 13% were in favour and 11% were undecided.Diane Abbott keeps saying the public are opposed to air strikes on Syria.

If the shadow foreign secretary has serious designs on becoming the next great Labour leader, he could start by not taking questions quite so literally. Camelot was built on myth and legend, not breakfast menus.Then again, he could have been distracted by John McDonnell\u2019s appearance on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI thought it was great oratory,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. \u201cIt reminded me of Tony Blair\u2019s speech when taking us to war in Iraq.\u201d As Nick Robinson pointed out this seemed to be more of a slap than a compliment, as McDonnell considers Blair a war criminal. \u201cThat\u2019s not the language I\u2019m using,\u201d McDonnell insisted. But it was. It was precisely the language he was using; McDonnell doesn\u2019t do unintentional.Maybe this early backlash failed to penetrate Benn\u2019s shield of moral certainty. The shield that turns whirlwinds into zephyrs and ploughshares into swords. Or maybe Benn just is nerdily literal. The Breezeblock Camelot. Normal, Jim, but not as we know it. Maybe Benn\u2019s compelling closing speech during Wednesday night\u2019s debate on launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, had just been a 15-minute aberration in an otherwise routinely dull 62 years.That\u2019s certainly the impression Normal Hilary was out to give as he took his seat on the government\u2019s front bench to listen to an urgent question about the overseas territory joint ministerial council. It was a parliamentary session that took place in a near empty chamber and was every bit as dull as the subject matter suggested. There was no need for Normal Hilary to be there as he was not required to speak. He could have been doing the round of all the media outlets clamouring to talk to him. He could even have allowed himself another croissant. Perhaps even, as a special treat, a pain au chocolat. But Normal Hilary was abnormally keen to be normal and that\u2019s why he was there. Another day, the same as any other dayNot even Abnormally Normal Hilary could pretend to be interested for a full hour, however, as two junior ministers went head to head on financial governance, climate change and sports participation in Britain\u2019s overseas territory. So, as his eyes closed in contemplation, perhaps he did allow himself a moment to consider where his oratory had taken him. How many civilian deaths could his conscience take? And what of Syria? What would Raqqa look like when and if the bombing campaign was over?Had he used the time to wander over to the HS2 committee \u2013 the Jarndyce v Jarndyce of committees \u2013 he would have realised that post-war reconstruction might be a lot trickier and a great deal more expensive than even the most pessimistic of forecasts would have it.Having spent more than a year considering the plight of badgers, cycle tracks, endangered newts and property prices along the planned HS2 rail route, the committee has now reached Camden in London.

So unhappy that he was thinking of mounting a new production of Springtime for Camden and HS2, in London\u2019s West End. What was holding him back was the intense worry about noise levels and the possibility that the volume of lorry traffic would make him a virtual prisoner in his own home. As the committee stared intently at slide P11272(6) from the Standard Pack, Mackintosh could not contain himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to be forced to move if it becomes intolerable,\u201d he declared morosely.Eager to avert this humanitarian tragedy, Tim Smart, HS2\u2019s head of engineering, produced slide P11309 which showed that, even at its worst, only 200 lorries would trundle past Mackintosh\u2019s door each day. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot less than in the St Pancras redevelopment,\u201d he said soothingly. Mackintosh stared at Smart as if he was an idiot. Didn\u2019t he know there was a huge difference between Camden and King\u2019s Cross? Worried the proceedings might be drawing to a halt rather too quickly, Lewis asked for clarification that the pre-survey survey of any land settlement above 10mm that had been agreed the day before had actually been agreed. It had.Abnormally Normally Hilary sighed. If it took so many people and so much time to agree the noise levels near one house, just think how much time it would take to rebuild an entire city. Even if the war were over by Christmas, the reconstruction of Raqqa would not be complete until February 2307. Perhaps sooner if the Syrians weren\u2019t quite so fussy. After all, Raqqa had always been a bit of a dump.

We had a meeting of the cabinet this morning and have agreed the motion that will be put in front of the House of Commons. \u201cThat motion talks about, yes, the necessity of taking military action agains Isil in Syria as well as Iraq, but it is part of a broader strategy. It\u2019s about politics and diplomacy and humanitarian aid, all of which we need to bring to bear to bring peace to Syria, but to make sure we protect our national interest of fighting against this appalling terrorist organisation.\u201dThe prime minister said he had led the process carefully in the run-up to the vote because the danger faced by Britain\u2019s armed forces preyed on his mind. \u201cThis has been a very deliberate and proper process \u2013 a cabinet meeting, legal advice, a proper motion in front of the House of Commons, 10-and-a-half-hours\u2019 debate tomorrow in the House of Commons and obviously we should think of our brave armed forces and their families for the risk that they take on our behalf. That obviously preys very heavily on my mind.\u201dCorbyn rejected the claim by Downing Street that the motion incorporated the Labour party conference motion on the grounds that the recent UN security council resolution had not been agreed under the chapter seven procedure.  Related: How will MPs vote on Syria airstrikes? The Labour leader highlighted the bitter divisions at the highest level of the party when he said that the shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, and other supporters of airstrikes would be guilty of approving the killing of civilians in Syria.Speaking on the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2, Corbyn said of Benn: \u201cHis belief is that we can get rid of Isil by bombing them. My reply to him and everybody else that supports bombing: when you bomb a town like Raqqa \u2013 where there are several hundred thousand people living there, who may or may not wish to be under Isil control, indeed many are trying to escape from there \u2013 we are going to kill people; we are going to kill people in their homes by our bombs. I think we should be very careful about that.\u201dCorbyn explained why he was allowing his MPs a free vote. \u201cI am saying to every MP: you make up your own mind, there is no hiding place behind a whipping arrangement or not: your decision, on behalf of your constituents, whether or not we should commit British troops into yet another war in the Middle East with no endgame in sight, no proper plan in sight, a mythical 75,000-strong apparently unknown Free Syrian Army operation which is also infiltrated by a lot of jihadist elements.

It recently pledged to double funding to the crisis to more than \u00a32.3bn by 2020 to fund education, jobs and humanitarian protection in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.But the report \u2013 which focuses on February 2012 to June 2014 \u2013 notes that the department, like the UK government, originally believed the fighting would tail off, paving the way for a more stable regime.\u201cFor a significant period \u2026 DfID\u2019s strategic position appeared to assume (and the UK appeared to desire) that the conflict would be limited, a new regime would be put in place and that displacement of refugees would be temporary,\u201d it says.\u201cAs a result, DfID did not want to commit long-term staff resources to the crisis.\u201dThe report suggests that while the department has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to work in fragile states, cope with disasters and engage in traditional development work, it had never been confronted with a complex emergency in a comparatively well developed region. \u201cDfID corporately does not yet have a clear idea how it should respond to a crisis like Syria,\u201d says the report, which was handed to DfID in January last year but only published by the department this week.\u201cDfID was not, and remains not, sufficiently ready to manage a blended crisis at scale \u2013 ie a regional conflict in middle-income countries that does not fit within in its standard delivery models.\u201dIt concedes that DfID had a difficult start as it, like many others, had no presence in the region.But it says the department would have done better to set up a dedicated unit of experienced staff led by a senior civil servant, rather than handing responsibility to its Middle East and North African department (Menad) \u2013 as it did initially. The decision to let Menad manage the response gave rise to \u201ctwo internal \u2018tribes\u2019\u201d: technical experts brought in on contracts, and London-based DfID staff, most of whom had little experience of managing rapidly changing emergencies. It adds: \u201cGiven the Syria crisis has been the largest humanitarian response that DfID has ever committed to, it is surprising that more experienced staff were not put in place.\u201dBy May 2013 \u2013 two years after the outbreak of civil war \u2013 DfID decided to set up a dedicated crisis unit (SCU). But once again, there were staffing problems. Difficulties in recruiting led to a dependence on temporary and contracted staff, including recent graduates. The report says their inexperience \u2013 combined with the \u201csclerotic\u201d effect of having to provide constant spending updates to senior management \u2013 led to \u201cpoor prioritisation, overwork and undue stress\u201d. The large number of SCU staff based in London conspired to make \u201cthe concerns of Whitehall and HQ \u2026 more immediate and dominant\u201d than those of people in the field.\u201cWe understand that there are resource constraints to placing more staff in the field, but this appears to be a false economy,\u201d says the report.The response was also hampered by a lack of foresight and planning. Although the SCU agreed to provide an NGO with \u00a35m to help it prepare winter resources in December 2013, the decision came too late to allow the NGO to deliver on time.The study does, however, acknowledge the enormous complexity of the crisis. \u201cAnticipation and early action were not possible in the early stages of the Syrian conflict,\u201d it says.\u201cThe international community failed to anticipate the extent to which the Arab spring \u2026 would reconfigure the region\u2019s political and social landscape.\u201dIt also recognises that DfID brought its Syria programme on to a \u201cmore stable footing\u201d during 2014, increasing its longer-term focus, resilience work and multi-year funding. But while the report is intended to help DfID learn lessons rather than hold it to account, it contains a blunt warning that the coming emergencies are likely to be Syria-shaped \u2013 and that far more needs to be done: \u201cWe note that, with increasing and persistent instability likely, DfID will almost certainly be called on to respond to similar crises in the future and suggest it develops a clearer view of how to rapidly put in place a fully capable resource.\u201dDfID said the Syria strategy was superseded in 2014 by \u201ccountry-specific operational plans\u201d that were underpinned by a \u201cseries of scenarios\u201d for the region. The department added: \u201cThe DfID Syria team is committed to sharing learning across DfID to help other teams better prepare for and manage future response to crises whilst recognising that each context is very different.\u201dSince fighting broke out in Syria in March 2011, 7.6 million people have been internally displaced and almost 4.7 million forced to flee as refugees. A recent report from the Syrian Centre for Policy Research put the number of deaths caused by the war, directly and indirectly, at 470,000 \u2013 almost double the figure of 250,000 used by the UN until it stopped collecting statistics 18 months ago.", "tags": ["Global development", "Humanitarian response", "Aid", "Department for International Development (DfID)", "Politics", "Syria", "UK news", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "title": "Syria crisis blindsided UK government, says report"},{"date": "2015-12-02T08:44:12Z", "content": "Here is the text of the Commons motion on Syria tabled by the prime minister, David Cameron, the chancellor, George Osborne, the home secretary, Theresa May, the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, and the international development secretary, Justine Greening:\u201cThat this House notes that Isil [Islamic State] poses a direct threat to the United Kingdom; welcomes United Nations security council resolution 2249 which determines that Isil constitutes an \u2018unprecedented threat to international peace and security\u2019 and calls on states to take \u2018all necessary measures\u2019 to prevent terrorist acts by Isil and to \u2018eradicate the safe haven they have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria\u2019; further notes the clear legal basis to defend the UK and our allies in accordance with the UN charter; notes that military action against Isil is only one component of a broader strategy to bring peace and stability to Syria; welcomes the renewed impetus behind the Vienna talks on a ceasefire and political settlement; welcomes the government\u2019s continuing commitment to providing humanitarian support to Syrian refugees; underlines the importance of planning for post-conflict stabilisation and reconstruction in Syria; welcomes the government\u2019s continued determination to cut Isil\u2019s sources of finance, fighters and weapons; notes the requests from France, the US and regional allies for UK military assistance; acknowledges the importance of seeking to avoid civilian casualties, using the UK\u2019s particular capabilities; notes the government will not deploy UK troops in ground combat operations; welcomes the government\u2019s commitment to provide quarterly progress reports to the House; and accordingly supports Her Majesty\u2019s government in taking military action, specifically airstrikes, exclusively against Isil in Syria; and offers its wholehearted support to Her Majesty\u2019s armed forces.\u201d ", "tags": ["Foreign policy", "Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "Politics", "UK news", "World news"], "title": "The Syria motion on airstrikes: full text"},{"date": "2015-12-01T11:43:51Z", "content": "MPs are to debate and vote on a government motion to extend UK airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria on Wednesday. David Cameron will almost certainly get enough votes as about 60 Labour MPs \u2013 in a free vote agreed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 are expected to vote with the government. The vote comes two years after parliament rejected a motion for the UK to take military action against Bashar al-Assad after a suspected chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. Here are where British papers stand on the eve of the vote.The Daily Telegraph favours military action but has many reservations.When the vote comes, a majority for action would be sensible and in line with public opinion, but Mr Cameron should take nothing for granted here. Many who will support him will do so with very reasonable concerns about what happens next. How will the ground forces needed to defeat Isil be constituted and directed? What will become of the Assad regime? What can be done to prevent the monstrous ideology that drives Isil erupting in some other place after Syria? Mr Cameron has been assiduous in trying to answer such questions, but he can still do more. He should also be realistic about what British military force can accomplish; despite plans for welcome increases in defence spending, RAF capability in the region is limited.The Financial Times is troubled by the lack of international unity and the absence of ground troops, but thinks Cameron\u2019s arguments are valid. (paywall)The UN security council has called on member states to take all necessary measures to \u201ceradicate the safe haven [Isis] have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria\u201d. This gives a strong legal grounding to what is primarily a political and moral case for action. After the Paris attacks, Britain has a duty to demonstrate that it is in lock step with its neighbour. As Mr Cameron has said, if the UK does not stand with France at this moment, its allies could be forgiven for asking: \u201cIf not now, when?\u201dFor all western governments, Syria presents an exceptionally difficult diplomatic and military problem. That should not stop the UK, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, from playing the fullest possible role in seeking to resolve it. This will not happen if Britain stays on the sidelines of the anti-Isis campaign in Syria.The Independent says British airstrikes are useful but only if accompanied by strong diplomacy.The case for Britain sending RAF fighters into the skies above Raqqa has merit \u2013 so long as the drawbacks are acknowledged, and the relative military insignificance of such a move is understood... But Isis will not be defeated by air strikes, and Britain should not fool itself that it is possible to do so. The deployment of the RAF is useful \u2013 but only in so far as it lays the ground for more muscular diplomacy.The Daily Express hammers Corbyn while coming out in favour of hitting Isis in Syria.We know that the terrorist tribe laying waste to Iraq and Syria, and whose tentacles have spread bloodshed around the world, are experts at the internet and social media. If they are following Calamity Corbyn\u2019s antics on the news websites they must be chuckling in their desert foxholes. It is high time to wipe the smiles off their faces - and for Labour\u2019s leader to grow up.The Sunday Times argues that it is absurd for British warplanes to target Isis in Iraq but not Syria. (paywall)The situation in Syria is complex but the case for airstrikes is straightforward. It is an absurdity that Britain is allowed to target Isis in Iraq, but not across the border in its Syrian heartlands. And it would be wrong not to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies \u2014 and against those who would still seek to kill us whether or not we remain on the sidelines. The Guardian does not think Cameron has come up with a convincing strategy for defeating Isis and urges MPs to vote no.The UK government does not have to pretend any of these questions are easy. They are not. But it needs to offer more than an RAF wing and a prayer. If Mr Cameron had come to parliament with a wide-ranging international strategy for defeating Isis on every front \u2013 cultural and financial, through both the intelligence agencies and the military \u2013 we would have been open to that. We could be open to it still. But so far he has failed that test. Admittedly, the bar is higher now, the public more sceptical after Iraq than before. But as things stand, we believe MPs should say no.The Daily Mail would have favoured a western army of occupation if it had been an option, but bemoans the lack of a coherent strategy and comes out against.We would urge Britain to join Barack Obama and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande if they were proposing a mass, UK-Franco-American army of occupation. This would include, imperatively, Arab states in the region and, more vitally, a ten-year plan for establishing a UN protectorate. But if these less-than-impressive leaders, or Mr Cameron himself, have any coherent strategy for what happens after the bombers go in, we have yet to hear it. So, yes, it sickens the Mail to find ourselves in the same camp as Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, who pose as peace-lovers while nursing a soft spot for terrorists. Even more, it distresses us to know that many of our readers, for whom we have enormous respect, may disagree with us. But on balance, and with many misgivings, this paper believes the case for bombing Syria has not yet been made.The Observer argues that the struggle against Isis is essentially one of ideas rather than bombs. If Isis is destroyed but not discredited, debunked and exposed for the evil sham it is, other, possibly ever more extreme Islamist groups will likely take its place. As we said Britain is already at war. It is already assisting its French and American allies militarily. But at bottom, it is a war of values and ideas, not of more and more bombs. This is the fight we must win, however long it takes. Mr Cameron has failed to make the case for expanded military action in Syria. His proposal should not be supported.The Daily Mirror criticises what it calls a rush to vote and is not convinced that Cameron has persuaded the majority of the British public. (In today\u2019s paper but not on its site)Mr Cameron is wrong to rush to a vote tomorrow after a single day\u2019s discussion instead of pausing for the detailed two-day debate demanded by labour leaser Jeremy Corbyn and backed by the SNP and anti-war Conservatives...

David Cameron set out the \u201cmoral\u201d and \u201csecurity\u201d case for bombing Isis in Syria in the Commons last week, saying it was morally unacceptable to leave the US, France and other allies to carry the burden. \u201cIf not now, when?\u201d he asked MPs. The issue has exposed deep divisions in the Labour party. In 2013 Labour\u2019s opposition helped inflict a surprise defeat against Cameron and his plans to launch airstrikes against the regime of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, over his use of chemical weapons. More than two years later many in the parliamentary Labour party, including half the shadow cabinet, are much more convinced by the case for airstrikes in Syria against Isis, which has seized and held territory amid the civil war. Corbyn, the party leader, is opposed.There have been almost 3,000 airstrikes against Isis targets in Syria since a US-led campaign began in September 2014. More than 95% of these have been conducted by the United States, according to the US monitoring group Airwars. From the start, America\u2019s Gulf allies \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar \u2013 have all taken part in some of the airstrikes. In September, France joined the campaign, and has since stepped up its airstrikes in Syria in the wake of the Paris attacks with a \u201cmassive\u201d attack on the Isis stronghold of Raqqa in the north-east of the country. In September, Russia also launched airstrikes \u201cagainst terrorist groups\u201d in Syria. Fewer than 10% of its initial strikes were against Isis targets, the majority have been against anti-Assad groups, some backed by the US and Turkey. Isis controls large swaths of north-east Syria including its stronghold of Raqqa and a number of lucrative gas and oil fields in the east. It controls most of the territory along the banks of the Euphrates including strategically important dams. It only controls one of Syria\u2019s top 10 cities by population \u2013 Deir Ezzor near the border with Iraq.The number of people fighting for Isis is more difficult to gauge. In 2014 the CIA estimated its strength at up to 31,500 fighters in both Iraq and Syria. Since airstrikes began the US says it has killed at least 10,000 militants in both countries, though the arrival of fresh fighters from outside the country may not have significantly hit its overall strength. Some have estimated there are up to 50,000 Isis fighters in the region. Citing British intelligence, Cameron said there were about 70,000 non-extremist Syrian opposition fighters who could help fight Isis. What he didn\u2019t emphasise is that these fighters are split into at least 100 to 120 different groups, with various aims, and differing in size from thousands to just 100 to 200 members. So far they have not shown much interest in focusing on Isis, being too preoccupied fighting Assad\u2019s Syrian army. Related: Who are these 70,000 Syrian fighters David Cameron is relying on? The most effective groups militarily in the opposition are among the most hardline. Two groups currently dominant are Jaish al-Islam and Ahrar al-Sham, which have a combined strength of 27,500 fighters, according to analyst Charles Lister from the Brookings Doha centre. \u201cBoth of these groups and perhaps a small number of others are definitely not natural western allies, no doubt about it. But they vehemently oppose [Isis] being in Syria and have fought it successfully in the past \u2013 with far better results than our currently favoured allies, the Kurds,\u201d he points out. One of the other most powerful forces is the al-Qaida linked group, Jabhat al-Nusra, which has also been banned by the US. Both Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham have been heavily involved in ousting Isis fighters from Syria\u2019s Idlib province and the Aleppo countryside in the north.The alliances of \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition fighters in Syria is constantly shifting, but many still fight under the broad banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). They control much of the territory in and around the western Syrian cities of Hama and Homs. They include groups such as Tajamu Ala\u2019Azza and Liwa Suqor al-Jebel which have received CIA training and weapons. Groups allied with the FSA also control areas around Syria\u2019s southern border with Jordan. But after years of disunity and faltering advances the influence of the FSA is on the wane, according to the Guardian\u2019s Syria specialist, Martin Chulov. There are a series of global, regional and religious conflicts being played out in Syria that make the conflict so potentially explosive and complicated. These are the main battles: Whether the UK should get involved in this conflict is the subject of a debate that has exposed serious divisions in the Labour party, but also unease among some government backbenchers. The government\u2019s case is built on the argument that such action would disrupt the ability of Isis to organise attacks in Europe, while containing the extremist group by denying it territory and access to finance, primarily through oil exports. The investigation into the Paris attacks showed that at least half the perpetrators had undergone some kind of centrally organised training with Isis.The experience of the fight against al-Qaida suggests that precise targeting of training camps and leaders reduced its capacity to strike western capitals. Documents recovered by US navy seals at Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound showed that drone strikes had made it near impossible for al-Qaida to host and train foreign fighters in the main area under its control, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) in western Pakistan.However, there are also signs that Isis has learned from al-Qaida\u2019s mistakes, and now avoids structured training camps, preferring to live and organise in residential buildings among civilians.\u201cIn Raqqa, Deir Ezzor and Mosul, Isis is living almost totally among civilians, so you can\u2019t hit them,\u201d said Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. He pointed out that thousands of foreign jihadi had managed to travel to and from Syria for the past few years through Turkey and questioned the wisdom of now trying to stop militants with bombs when they could have been stopped with tighter border controls.The Paris conspirators, including the presumed ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, were able to travel between Belgium, France and Syria while the US-led airstrikes targeting Isis command and control were in full swing.US-led airstrikes helped stop Isis capturing key strategic points such as Kobane on the Turkish border, and the Kurdish stronghold of Irbil. In neighbouring Iraq, they were instrumental in preventing the fall of Baghdad when Isis\u2019s power was at its zenith. UK air support also played a role in the liberation of the Iraqi town of Sinjar by Kurdish peshmerga forces.Counter-terrorism experts say that such defeats damage Isis\u2019s international appeal to foreign jihadis, which depends on the image of a constantly expanding \u201ccaliphate\u201d.However, further gains against Isis will require something that has so far eluded the western coalition, a working alliance with other Sunni rebel groups in Syria. Hassan Hassan, a Syria expert at the Chatham House thinktank and co-author of Isis: Inside the Army of Terror, said that persuading other Sunni armed groups to fight Isis as well as the Assad regime may ultimately be the key to success, but that requires a great deal of local knowledge and political commitment.\u201cThe answer is not dropping more bombs,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cThe answer is to find a way to support these groups on the ground. It\u2019s not about money or even weapons. It is about helping them with tactics and an overall strategy that has been missing.\u201dHe argued that the expensive US efforts to build an anti-Isis rebel movement failed because it worked with the wrong people and lacked long-term political commitment. The success of any British military contribution, Hassan added, will lie in the UK\u2019s ability to \u201cbreak out of the constraints\u201d of Washington\u2019s current strategy.The recent emphasis on striking tankers carrying Isis oil exports is likely to dent the group\u2019s vast financial resources but may not affect its immediate fighting capacity. Hassan said Isis scored its most significant victories before it captured the oil fields.Airstrikes on Raqqa last week are reported to have killed at least 12 people, including five children, when bombs fell near a school. It was not clear whether the bombs were dropped by Russian, American or French planes.\u201cThe number of civilian casualties from Russian bombardment is far higher than the number caused by American and French airstrikes,\u201d said Wael Aleji, spokesman for the Syrian Network for Human Rights. \u201cThis can be attributed to technology. The Russians use more \u2018dumb\u2019 bombs and have less advanced guidance systems.\u201dIn his memorandum to the Commons, Cameron pointed to the enhanced precision of the UK\u2019s Brimstone missile as one of the contributions Britain can make to the air campaign. But avoiding civilian casualties will also depend on good intelligence. One of the worst civilian tolls attributed by human rights activists to a US strike was on 1 May near Aleppo, where more than 60 civilians were said to have been killed, perhaps more than half of them children. Abdurrahman said: \u201cWe think they got the wrong information. They thought it was Isis, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201dAs it becomes harder to find genuine Isis targets, as the terrorist group gets better at melting in with the surrounding population, the civilian toll is likely to rise. And Syrians on the receiving end are unlikely to make the distinction between British warplanes and Russian bombers sent by Assad\u2019s chief ally.\u201cThis is likely to generate support for Isis, or at least create indifference among local people,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cThese are the risks of unintended consequences.\u201dAntiwar demonstrators gathered outside Downing Street and other locations across the UK on Saturday, but a YouGov poll for the Times found that the majority of voters (59%) back airstrikes in Syria.

Related: Britain carries out first Syria airstrikes after MPs approve action against Isis The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said the overnight strikes had hit the al-Omar oilfield, while activists in the province of Deir Ezzor reported other coalition strikes on the al-Jafra and al-Tanak oilfields, as well as the Conoco gas processing plant, in some of the most intense bombings of Isis facilities in the area over the past year.Isis seized the oil fields, Syria\u2019s largest, during its surge into Iraq last summer. It controls most of Deir Ezzor, and its south-eastern border has long been a crucial crossing point for militants entering Iraq, now and during the US occupation.\u201cWhether it [the bombing] has an effect or not will emerge in the next few days,\u201d said an activist with Deir Ezzor is Being Slaughtered Silently, a group documenting Isis crimes and life in the embattled province, operating clandestinely. \u201cBut yesterday was very violent as it targeted anything that has to do with Daesh [Isis] and oil.\u201d In targeting the oilfields, Britain appeared to have sidestepped questions about potential civilian casualties from its air campaign, while seeking to disrupt a crucial source of revenue for the group. Isis is believed to be profiting from the sale of black market oil to outside buyers as well as those in Iraq and Syria.The coalition has begun in recent months to intensify airstrikes against the Isis oil trade. Late last month the US said it had targeted 283 Isis vehicles and an oil facility. Related: Syria airstrikes: Britain launches 'offensive operation' after vote to bomb Isis targets \u2013 live updates The raids appear to have diminished the trading. Hisham al Hashimi, an expert on Isis who advises the Iraqi government on the group, estimated that Isis sold between 100,000 and 125,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq before April this year. That figure has declined to between 10,000 to 15,000 barrels from Iraq and 40,000 to 45,000 barrels from Syria after April 2015, at $10 to $15 a barrel.Reaction inside Syria to Britain joining the air campaign has been mixed. While some in areas controlled by Isis said they supported any military action against the group, others said it would do little to stem the power of the jihadis without a broader strategy to address the crisis in Syria, and in particular to end the violence perpetrated by the regime of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.\u201cIsis is our enemy just as the Syrian regime is our enemy,\u201d said Issam al-Reis, the spokesman for the Southern Front, a coalition of moderate opposition forces fighting the Assad regime in the country\u2019s south. \u201cBoth brutally repress and kill the Syrian people. While it is positive the UK is taking more measures to attack them what is important to understand is that a strategy to tackle Isis without tackling the causes of Isis will fail.\u201d\u201cThe Assad regime is the cancer that Isis grew out of,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no meaning for the operation if you treat the symptoms of the cancer while leaving the cancer in place.\u201dAl-Reis said the UK and its allies ought to stop the Assad regime\u2019s punishing aerial bombardment of areas held by the opposition, claiming the moderate rebels numbered even more than the widely derided 70,000 figure quoted by the British prime minister, David Cameron.\u201cWe are with anyone who kills someone from Daesh,\u201d said the Deir Ezzor activist. \u201cOthers are like us; the people are tired of indignity, poverty and starvation.\u201dIsis has imposed a food blockade on parts of Deir Ezzor that remain outside its control.However, an activist collective that operates secretly in Raqqa, the capital of Isis\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate, and which opposes both Isis and the Assad regime, condemned the airstrikes, saying Britain should accept more refugees if it wished to help Syrians.\u201cJust bombing Isis in Raqqa from the sky will not defeat Isis but it will make people suffer more,\u201d the group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently said in a series of tweets. \u201cIsis will use UK strikes to recruit new people in the west and new fighters.\u201d\u201cThe strange thing is all the world wants to fight Isis but not even one country dare to send one soldier to fight Isis on the ground,\u201d it added.", "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Military", "UK news", "Islamic State", "Counter-terrorism policy", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "Politics"], "title": "First British airstrikes: the view from Syria"},{"date": "2015-10-06T14:00:21Z", "content": "The conflict in Syria has created the biggest refugee crisis since the second world war, with over 11 million people forced from their homes and more than 200,000 killed.

If the shadow foreign secretary has serious designs on becoming the next great Labour leader, he could start by not taking questions quite so literally. Camelot was built on myth and legend, not breakfast menus.Then again, he could have been distracted by John McDonnell\u2019s appearance on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cI thought it was great oratory,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. \u201cIt reminded me of Tony Blair\u2019s speech when taking us to war in Iraq.\u201d As Nick Robinson pointed out this seemed to be more of a slap than a compliment, as McDonnell considers Blair a war criminal. \u201cThat\u2019s not the language I\u2019m using,\u201d McDonnell insisted. But it was. It was precisely the language he was using; McDonnell doesn\u2019t do unintentional.Maybe this early backlash failed to penetrate Benn\u2019s shield of moral certainty. The shield that turns whirlwinds into zephyrs and ploughshares into swords. Or maybe Benn just is nerdily literal. The Breezeblock Camelot. Normal, Jim, but not as we know it. Maybe Benn\u2019s compelling closing speech during Wednesday night\u2019s debate on launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, had just been a 15-minute aberration in an otherwise routinely dull 62 years.That\u2019s certainly the impression Normal Hilary was out to give as he took his seat on the government\u2019s front bench to listen to an urgent question about the overseas territory joint ministerial council. It was a parliamentary session that took place in a near empty chamber and was every bit as dull as the subject matter suggested. There was no need for Normal Hilary to be there as he was not required to speak. He could have been doing the round of all the media outlets clamouring to talk to him. He could even have allowed himself another croissant. Perhaps even, as a special treat, a pain au chocolat. But Normal Hilary was abnormally keen to be normal and that\u2019s why he was there. Another day, the same as any other dayNot even Abnormally Normal Hilary could pretend to be interested for a full hour, however, as two junior ministers went head to head on financial governance, climate change and sports participation in Britain\u2019s overseas territory. So, as his eyes closed in contemplation, perhaps he did allow himself a moment to consider where his oratory had taken him. How many civilian deaths could his conscience take? And what of Syria? What would Raqqa look like when and if the bombing campaign was over?Had he used the time to wander over to the HS2 committee \u2013 the Jarndyce v Jarndyce of committees \u2013 he would have realised that post-war reconstruction might be a lot trickier and a great deal more expensive than even the most pessimistic of forecasts would have it.Having spent more than a year considering the plight of badgers, cycle tracks, endangered newts and property prices along the planned HS2 rail route, the committee has now reached Camden in London. In particular, the house just off Regent\u2019s Park of the theatre impresario Cameron Mackintosh.\u201cSir Cameron is most unhappy,\u201d said Meyric Lewis, Mackintosh\u2019s lawyer. So unhappy that he was thinking of mounting a new production of Springtime for Camden and HS2, in London\u2019s West End. What was holding him back was the intense worry about noise levels and the possibility that the volume of lorry traffic would make him a virtual prisoner in his own home. As the committee stared intently at slide P11272(6) from the Standard Pack, Mackintosh could not contain himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to be forced to move if it becomes intolerable,\u201d he declared morosely.Eager to avert this humanitarian tragedy, Tim Smart, HS2\u2019s head of engineering, produced slide P11309 which showed that, even at its worst, only 200 lorries would trundle past Mackintosh\u2019s door each day. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot less than in the St Pancras redevelopment,\u201d he said soothingly. Mackintosh stared at Smart as if he was an idiot. Didn\u2019t he know there was a huge difference between Camden and King\u2019s Cross? Worried the proceedings might be drawing to a halt rather too quickly, Lewis asked for clarification that the pre-survey survey of any land settlement above 10mm that had been agreed the day before had actually been agreed. It had.Abnormally Normally Hilary sighed. If it took so many people and so much time to agree the noise levels near one house, just think how much time it would take to rebuild an entire city. Even if the war were over by Christmas, the reconstruction of Raqqa would not be complete until February 2307. Perhaps sooner if the Syrians weren\u2019t quite so fussy. After all, Raqqa had always been a bit of a dump.

Related: No 10 publishes Syria motion - Live The hour-long cabinet meeting, which was addressed by at least 20 ministers, also agreed to clear the entire business of the House of Commons on Wednesday to allow a 10-and-a-half-hour debate on Syria.

This means the Syria debate will start at 11.30am and will be wound up by the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, before a vote at 10.30pm.Cameron made an appeal to MPs across the House of Commons to support him in his attempt to defeat Isis as part of what he described as a \u201cbroader strategy\u201d to build a political settlement in Syria.Speaking after the cabinet meeting, the prime minister said: \u201cI will be making the arguments and I hope as many MPs across all parties will support me as possible. We had a meeting of the cabinet this morning and have agreed the motion that will be put in front of the House of Commons. \u201cThat motion talks about, yes, the necessity of taking military action agains Isil in Syria as well as Iraq, but it is part of a broader strategy. It\u2019s about politics and diplomacy and humanitarian aid, all of which we need to bring to bear to bring peace to Syria, but to make sure we protect our national interest of fighting against this appalling terrorist organisation.\u201dThe prime minister said he had led the process carefully in the run-up to the vote because the danger faced by Britain\u2019s armed forces preyed on his mind. \u201cThis has been a very deliberate and proper process \u2013 a cabinet meeting, legal advice, a proper motion in front of the House of Commons, 10-and-a-half-hours\u2019 debate tomorrow in the House of Commons and obviously we should think of our brave armed forces and their families for the risk that they take on our behalf. That obviously preys very heavily on my mind.\u201dCorbyn rejected the claim by Downing Street that the motion incorporated the Labour party conference motion on the grounds that the recent UN security council resolution had not been agreed under the chapter seven procedure.  Related: How will MPs vote on Syria airstrikes? The Labour leader highlighted the bitter divisions at the highest level of the party when he said that the shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, and other supporters of airstrikes would be guilty of approving the killing of civilians in Syria.Speaking on the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2, Corbyn said of Benn: \u201cHis belief is that we can get rid of Isil by bombing them. My reply to him and everybody else that supports bombing: when you bomb a town like Raqqa \u2013 where there are several hundred thousand people living there, who may or may not wish to be under Isil control, indeed many are trying to escape from there \u2013 we are going to kill people; we are going to kill people in their homes by our bombs. I think we should be very careful about that.\u201dCorbyn explained why he was allowing his MPs a free vote. \u201cI am saying to every MP: you make up your own mind, there is no hiding place behind a whipping arrangement or not: your decision, on behalf of your constituents, whether or not we should commit British troops into yet another war in the Middle East with no endgame in sight, no proper plan in sight, a mythical 75,000-strong apparently unknown Free Syrian Army operation which is also infiltrated by a lot of jihadist elements.

It recently pledged to double funding to the crisis to more than \u00a32.3bn by 2020 to fund education, jobs and humanitarian protection in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.But the report \u2013 which focuses on February 2012 to June 2014 \u2013 notes that the department, like the UK government, originally believed the fighting would tail off, paving the way for a more stable regime.\u201cFor a significant period \u2026 DfID\u2019s strategic position appeared to assume (and the UK appeared to desire) that the conflict would be limited, a new regime would be put in place and that displacement of refugees would be temporary,\u201d it says.\u201cAs a result, DfID did not want to commit long-term staff resources to the crisis.\u201dThe report suggests that while the department has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to work in fragile states, cope with disasters and engage in traditional development work, it had never been confronted with a complex emergency in a comparatively well developed region. \u201cDfID corporately does not yet have a clear idea how it should respond to a crisis like Syria,\u201d says the report, which was handed to DfID in January last year but only published by the department this week.\u201cDfID was not, and remains not, sufficiently ready to manage a blended crisis at scale \u2013 ie a regional conflict in middle-income countries that does not fit within in its standard delivery models.\u201dIt concedes that DfID had a difficult start as it, like many others, had no presence in the region.But it says the department would have done better to set up a dedicated unit of experienced staff led by a senior civil servant, rather than handing responsibility to its Middle East and North African department (Menad) \u2013 as it did initially. The decision to let Menad manage the response gave rise to \u201ctwo internal \u2018tribes\u2019\u201d: technical experts brought in on contracts, and London-based DfID staff, most of whom had little experience of managing rapidly changing emergencies. It adds: \u201cGiven the Syria crisis has been the largest humanitarian response that DfID has ever committed to, it is surprising that more experienced staff were not put in place.\u201dBy May 2013 \u2013 two years after the outbreak of civil war \u2013 DfID decided to set up a dedicated crisis unit (SCU). But once again, there were staffing problems. Difficulties in recruiting led to a dependence on temporary and contracted staff, including recent graduates. The report says their inexperience \u2013 combined with the \u201csclerotic\u201d effect of having to provide constant spending updates to senior management \u2013 led to \u201cpoor prioritisation, overwork and undue stress\u201d. The large number of SCU staff based in London conspired to make \u201cthe concerns of Whitehall and HQ \u2026 more immediate and dominant\u201d than those of people in the field.\u201cWe understand that there are resource constraints to placing more staff in the field, but this appears to be a false economy,\u201d says the report.The response was also hampered by a lack of foresight and planning. Although the SCU agreed to provide an NGO with \u00a35m to help it prepare winter resources in December 2013, the decision came too late to allow the NGO to deliver on time.The study does, however, acknowledge the enormous complexity of the crisis. \u201cAnticipation and early action were not possible in the early stages of the Syrian conflict,\u201d it says.\u201cThe international community failed to anticipate the extent to which the Arab spring \u2026 would reconfigure the region\u2019s political and social landscape.\u201dIt also recognises that DfID brought its Syria programme on to a \u201cmore stable footing\u201d during 2014, increasing its longer-term focus, resilience work and multi-year funding. But while the report is intended to help DfID learn lessons rather than hold it to account, it contains a blunt warning that the coming emergencies are likely to be Syria-shaped \u2013 and that far more needs to be done: \u201cWe note that, with increasing and persistent instability likely, DfID will almost certainly be called on to respond to similar crises in the future and suggest it develops a clearer view of how to rapidly put in place a fully capable resource.\u201dDfID said the Syria strategy was superseded in 2014 by \u201ccountry-specific operational plans\u201d that were underpinned by a \u201cseries of scenarios\u201d for the region. The department added: \u201cThe DfID Syria team is committed to sharing learning across DfID to help other teams better prepare for and manage future response to crises whilst recognising that each context is very different.\u201dSince fighting broke out in Syria in March 2011, 7.6 million people have been internally displaced and almost 4.7 million forced to flee as refugees.

David Cameron will almost certainly get enough votes as about 60 Labour MPs \u2013 in a free vote agreed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 are expected to vote with the government. The vote comes two years after parliament rejected a motion for the UK to take military action against Bashar al-Assad after a suspected chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. Here are where British papers stand on the eve of the vote.The Daily Telegraph favours military action but has many reservations.When the vote comes, a majority for action would be sensible and in line with public opinion, but Mr Cameron should take nothing for granted here. Many who will support him will do so with very reasonable concerns about what happens next. How will the ground forces needed to defeat Isil be constituted and directed? What will become of the Assad regime? What can be done to prevent the monstrous ideology that drives Isil erupting in some other place after Syria? Mr Cameron has been assiduous in trying to answer such questions, but he can still do more. He should also be realistic about what British military force can accomplish; despite plans for welcome increases in defence spending, RAF capability in the region is limited.The Financial Times is troubled by the lack of international unity and the absence of ground troops, but thinks Cameron\u2019s arguments are valid. (paywall)The UN security council has called on member states to take all necessary measures to \u201ceradicate the safe haven [Isis] have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria\u201d. This gives a strong legal grounding to what is primarily a political and moral case for action. After the Paris attacks, Britain has a duty to demonstrate that it is in lock step with its neighbour. As Mr Cameron has said, if the UK does not stand with France at this moment, its allies could be forgiven for asking: \u201cIf not now, when?\u201dFor all western governments, Syria presents an exceptionally difficult diplomatic and military problem. That should not stop the UK, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, from playing the fullest possible role in seeking to resolve it. This will not happen if Britain stays on the sidelines of the anti-Isis campaign in Syria.The Independent says British airstrikes are useful but only if accompanied by strong diplomacy.The case for Britain sending RAF fighters into the skies above Raqqa has merit \u2013 so long as the drawbacks are acknowledged, and the relative military insignificance of such a move is understood... But Isis will not be defeated by air strikes, and Britain should not fool itself that it is possible to do so. The deployment of the RAF is useful \u2013 but only in so far as it lays the ground for more muscular diplomacy.The Daily Express hammers Corbyn while coming out in favour of hitting Isis in Syria.We know that the terrorist tribe laying waste to Iraq and Syria, and whose tentacles have spread bloodshed around the world, are experts at the internet and social media. If they are following Calamity Corbyn\u2019s antics on the news websites they must be chuckling in their desert foxholes. It is high time to wipe the smiles off their faces - and for Labour\u2019s leader to grow up.The Sunday Times argues that it is absurd for British warplanes to target Isis in Iraq but not Syria. (paywall)The situation in Syria is complex but the case for airstrikes is straightforward. It is an absurdity that Britain is allowed to target Isis in Iraq, but not across the border in its Syrian heartlands. And it would be wrong not to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies \u2014 and against those who would still seek to kill us whether or not we remain on the sidelines. The Guardian does not think Cameron has come up with a convincing strategy for defeating Isis and urges MPs to vote no.The UK government does not have to pretend any of these questions are easy. They are not. But it needs to offer more than an RAF wing and a prayer. If Mr Cameron had come to parliament with a wide-ranging international strategy for defeating Isis on every front \u2013 cultural and financial, through both the intelligence agencies and the military \u2013 we would have been open to that. We could be open to it still. But so far he has failed that test. Admittedly, the bar is higher now, the public more sceptical after Iraq than before. But as things stand, we believe MPs should say no.The Daily Mail would have favoured a western army of occupation if it had been an option, but bemoans the lack of a coherent strategy and comes out against.We would urge Britain to join Barack Obama and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande if they were proposing a mass, UK-Franco-American army of occupation. This would include, imperatively, Arab states in the region and, more vitally, a ten-year plan for establishing a UN protectorate. But if these less-than-impressive leaders, or Mr Cameron himself, have any coherent strategy for what happens after the bombers go in, we have yet to hear it. So, yes, it sickens the Mail to find ourselves in the same camp as Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, who pose as peace-lovers while nursing a soft spot for terrorists. Even more, it distresses us to know that many of our readers, for whom we have enormous respect, may disagree with us. But on balance, and with many misgivings, this paper believes the case for bombing Syria has not yet been made.The Observer argues that the struggle against Isis is essentially one of ideas rather than bombs. If Isis is destroyed but not discredited, debunked and exposed for the evil sham it is, other, possibly ever more extreme Islamist groups will likely take its place. As we said Britain is already at war. It is already assisting its French and American allies militarily. But at bottom, it is a war of values and ideas, not of more and more bombs. This is the fight we must win, however long it takes. Mr Cameron has failed to make the case for expanded military action in Syria. His proposal should not be supported.The Daily Mirror criticises what it calls a rush to vote and is not convinced that Cameron has persuaded the majority of the British public. (In today\u2019s paper but not on its site)Mr Cameron is wrong to rush to a vote tomorrow after a single day\u2019s discussion instead of pausing for the detailed two-day debate demanded by labour leaser Jeremy Corbyn and backed by the SNP and anti-war Conservatives...

David Cameron set out the \u201cmoral\u201d and \u201csecurity\u201d case for bombing Isis in Syria in the Commons last week, saying it was morally unacceptable to leave the US, France and other allies to carry the burden. \u201cIf not now, when?\u201d he asked MPs. The issue has exposed deep divisions in the Labour party. In 2013 Labour\u2019s opposition helped inflict a surprise defeat against Cameron and his plans to launch airstrikes against the regime of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, over his use of chemical weapons. More than two years later many in the parliamentary Labour party, including half the shadow cabinet, are much more convinced by the case for airstrikes in Syria against Isis, which has seized and held territory amid the civil war. Corbyn, the party leader, is opposed.There have been almost 3,000 airstrikes against Isis targets in Syria since a US-led campaign began in September 2014. More than 95% of these have been conducted by the United States, according to the US monitoring group Airwars. From the start, America\u2019s Gulf allies \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar \u2013 have all taken part in some of the airstrikes. In September, France joined the campaign, and has since stepped up its airstrikes in Syria in the wake of the Paris attacks with a \u201cmassive\u201d attack on the Isis stronghold of Raqqa in the north-east of the country. In September, Russia also launched airstrikes \u201cagainst terrorist groups\u201d in Syria. Fewer than 10% of its initial strikes were against Isis targets, the majority have been against anti-Assad groups, some backed by the US and Turkey. Isis controls large swaths of north-east Syria including its stronghold of Raqqa and a number of lucrative gas and oil fields in the east. It controls most of the territory along the banks of the Euphrates including strategically important dams. It only controls one of Syria\u2019s top 10 cities by population \u2013 Deir Ezzor near the border with Iraq.The number of people fighting for Isis is more difficult to gauge. In 2014 the CIA estimated its strength at up to 31,500 fighters in both Iraq and Syria. Since airstrikes began the US says it has killed at least 10,000 militants in both countries, though the arrival of fresh fighters from outside the country may not have significantly hit its overall strength. Some have estimated there are up to 50,000 Isis fighters in the region. Citing British intelligence, Cameron said there were about 70,000 non-extremist Syrian opposition fighters who could help fight Isis. What he didn\u2019t emphasise is that these fighters are split into at least 100 to 120 different groups, with various aims, and differing in size from thousands to just 100 to 200 members. So far they have not shown much interest in focusing on Isis, being too preoccupied fighting Assad\u2019s Syrian army. Related: Who are these 70,000 Syrian fighters David Cameron is relying on? The most effective groups militarily in the opposition are among the most hardline. Two groups currently dominant are Jaish al-Islam and Ahrar al-Sham, which have a combined strength of 27,500 fighters, according to analyst Charles Lister from the Brookings Doha centre. \u201cBoth of these groups and perhaps a small number of others are definitely not natural western allies, no doubt about it. But they vehemently oppose [Isis] being in Syria and have fought it successfully in the past \u2013 with far better results than our currently favoured allies, the Kurds,\u201d he points out. One of the other most powerful forces is the al-Qaida linked group, Jabhat al-Nusra, which has also been banned by the US. Both Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham have been heavily involved in ousting Isis fighters from Syria\u2019s Idlib province and the Aleppo countryside in the north.The alliances of \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition fighters in Syria is constantly shifting, but many still fight under the broad banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). They control much of the territory in and around the western Syrian cities of Hama and Homs. They include groups such as Tajamu Ala\u2019Azza and Liwa Suqor al-Jebel which have received CIA training and weapons. Groups allied with the FSA also control areas around Syria\u2019s southern border with Jordan. But after years of disunity and faltering advances the influence of the FSA is on the wane, according to the Guardian\u2019s Syria specialist, Martin Chulov. There are a series of global, regional and religious conflicts being played out in Syria that make the conflict so potentially explosive and complicated. These are the main battles: Whether the UK should get involved in this conflict is the subject of a debate that has exposed serious divisions in the Labour party, but also unease among some government backbenchers. The government\u2019s case is built on the argument that such action would disrupt the ability of Isis to organise attacks in Europe, while containing the extremist group by denying it territory and access to finance, primarily through oil exports. The investigation into the Paris attacks showed that at least half the perpetrators had undergone some kind of centrally organised training with Isis.The experience of the fight against al-Qaida suggests that precise targeting of training camps and leaders reduced its capacity to strike western capitals. Documents recovered by US navy seals at Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound showed that drone strikes had made it near impossible for al-Qaida to host and train foreign fighters in the main area under its control, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) in western Pakistan.However, there are also signs that Isis has learned from al-Qaida\u2019s mistakes, and now avoids structured training camps, preferring to live and organise in residential buildings among civilians.\u201cIn Raqqa, Deir Ezzor and Mosul, Isis is living almost totally among civilians, so you can\u2019t hit them,\u201d said Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. He pointed out that thousands of foreign jihadi had managed to travel to and from Syria for the past few years through Turkey and questioned the wisdom of now trying to stop militants with bombs when they could have been stopped with tighter border controls.The Paris conspirators, including the presumed ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, were able to travel between Belgium, France and Syria while the US-led airstrikes targeting Isis command and control were in full swing.US-led airstrikes helped stop Isis capturing key strategic points such as Kobane on the Turkish border, and the Kurdish stronghold of Irbil. In neighbouring Iraq, they were instrumental in preventing the fall of Baghdad when Isis\u2019s power was at its zenith. UK air support also played a role in the liberation of the Iraqi town of Sinjar by Kurdish peshmerga forces.Counter-terrorism experts say that such defeats damage Isis\u2019s international appeal to foreign jihadis, which depends on the image of a constantly expanding \u201ccaliphate\u201d.However, further gains against Isis will require something that has so far eluded the western coalition, a working alliance with other Sunni rebel groups in Syria. Hassan Hassan, a Syria expert at the Chatham House thinktank and co-author of Isis: Inside the Army of Terror, said that persuading other Sunni armed groups to fight Isis as well as the Assad regime may ultimately be the key to success, but that requires a great deal of local knowledge and political commitment.\u201cThe answer is not dropping more bombs,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cThe answer is to find a way to support these groups on the ground. It\u2019s not about money or even weapons. It is about helping them with tactics and an overall strategy that has been missing.\u201dHe argued that the expensive US efforts to build an anti-Isis rebel movement failed because it worked with the wrong people and lacked long-term political commitment. The success of any British military contribution, Hassan added, will lie in the UK\u2019s ability to \u201cbreak out of the constraints\u201d of Washington\u2019s current strategy.The recent emphasis on striking tankers carrying Isis oil exports is likely to dent the group\u2019s vast financial resources but may not affect its immediate fighting capacity. Hassan said Isis scored its most significant victories before it captured the oil fields.Airstrikes on Raqqa last week are reported to have killed at least 12 people, including five children, when bombs fell near a school. It was not clear whether the bombs were dropped by Russian, American or French planes.\u201cThe number of civilian casualties from Russian bombardment is far higher than the number caused by American and French airstrikes,\u201d said Wael Aleji, spokesman for the Syrian Network for Human Rights. \u201cThis can be attributed to technology. The Russians use more \u2018dumb\u2019 bombs and have less advanced guidance systems.\u201dIn his memorandum to the Commons, Cameron pointed to the enhanced precision of the UK\u2019s Brimstone missile as one of the contributions Britain can make to the air campaign. But avoiding civilian casualties will also depend on good intelligence. One of the worst civilian tolls attributed by human rights activists to a US strike was on 1 May near Aleppo, where more than 60 civilians were said to have been killed, perhaps more than half of them children. Abdurrahman said: \u201cWe think they got the wrong information. They thought it was Isis, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201dAs it becomes harder to find genuine Isis targets, as the terrorist group gets better at melting in with the surrounding population, the civilian toll is likely to rise. And Syrians on the receiving end are unlikely to make the distinction between British warplanes and Russian bombers sent by Assad\u2019s chief ally.\u201cThis is likely to generate support for Isis, or at least create indifference among local people,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cThese are the risks of unintended consequences.\u201dAntiwar demonstrators gathered outside Downing Street and other locations across the UK on Saturday, but a YouGov poll for the Times found that the majority of voters (59%) back airstrikes in Syria. There was clear backing even among Labour voters with 52% saying they would approve of airstrikes compared with 26% against. But Labour members, especially those who voted for Corbyn in the leadership contest, were overwhelming opposed to the move. Meanwhile Labour said a random sample of full individual Labour party members showed 75% were against UK bombing in Syria, 13% were in favour and 11% were undecided.Diane Abbott keeps saying the public are opposed to air strikes on Syria.

Related: Britain carries out first Syria airstrikes after MPs approve action against Isis The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said the overnight strikes had hit the al-Omar oilfield, while activists in the province of Deir Ezzor reported other coalition strikes on the al-Jafra and al-Tanak oilfields, as well as the Conoco gas processing plant, in some of the most intense bombings of Isis facilities in the area over the past year.Isis seized the oil fields, Syria\u2019s largest, during its surge into Iraq last summer. It controls most of Deir Ezzor, and its south-eastern border has long been a crucial crossing point for militants entering Iraq, now and during the US occupation.\u201cWhether it [the bombing] has an effect or not will emerge in the next few days,\u201d said an activist with Deir Ezzor is Being Slaughtered Silently, a group documenting Isis crimes and life in the embattled province, operating clandestinely. \u201cBut yesterday was very violent as it targeted anything that has to do with Daesh [Isis] and oil.\u201d In targeting the oilfields, Britain appeared to have sidestepped questions about potential civilian casualties from its air campaign, while seeking to disrupt a crucial source of revenue for the group. Isis is believed to be profiting from the sale of black market oil to outside buyers as well as those in Iraq and Syria.The coalition has begun in recent months to intensify airstrikes against the Isis oil trade. Late last month the US said it had targeted 283 Isis vehicles and an oil facility. Related: Syria airstrikes: Britain launches 'offensive operation' after vote to bomb Isis targets \u2013 live updates The raids appear to have diminished the trading. Hisham al Hashimi, an expert on Isis who advises the Iraqi government on the group, estimated that Isis sold between 100,000 and 125,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq before April this year. That figure has declined to between 10,000 to 15,000 barrels from Iraq and 40,000 to 45,000 barrels from Syria after April 2015, at $10 to $15 a barrel.Reaction inside Syria to Britain joining the air campaign has been mixed. While some in areas controlled by Isis said they supported any military action against the group, others said it would do little to stem the power of the jihadis without a broader strategy to address the crisis in Syria, and in particular to end the violence perpetrated by the regime of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.\u201cIsis is our enemy just as the Syrian regime is our enemy,\u201d said Issam al-Reis, the spokesman for the Southern Front, a coalition of moderate opposition forces fighting the Assad regime in the country\u2019s south. \u201cBoth brutally repress and kill the Syrian people. While it is positive the UK is taking more measures to attack them what is important to understand is that a strategy to tackle Isis without tackling the causes of Isis will fail.\u201d\u201cThe Assad regime is the cancer that Isis grew out of,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is no meaning for the operation if you treat the symptoms of the cancer while leaving the cancer in place.\u201dAl-Reis said the UK and its allies ought to stop the Assad regime\u2019s punishing aerial bombardment of areas held by the opposition, claiming the moderate rebels numbered even more than the widely derided 70,000 figure quoted by the British prime minister, David Cameron.\u201cWe are with anyone who kills someone from Daesh,\u201d said the Deir Ezzor activist. \u201cOthers are like us; the people are tired of indignity, poverty and starvation.\u201dIsis has imposed a food blockade on parts of Deir Ezzor that remain outside its control.However, an activist collective that operates secretly in Raqqa, the capital of Isis\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate, and which opposes both Isis and the Assad regime, condemned the airstrikes, saying Britain should accept more refugees if it wished to help Syrians.\u201cJust bombing Isis in Raqqa from the sky will not defeat Isis but it will make people suffer more,\u201d the group Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently said in a series of tweets. \u201cIsis will use UK strikes to recruit new people in the west and new fighters.\u201d\u201cThe strange thing is all the world wants to fight Isis but not even one country dare to send one soldier to fight Isis on the ground,\u201d it added.", "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Military", "UK news", "Islamic State", "Counter-terrorism policy", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "Politics"], "title": "First British airstrikes: the view from Syria"},{"date": "2015-12-03T13:38:40Z", "content": "Britain\u2019s military action in Syria is complex and difficult and is going to take time, David Cameron has said.Four British Tornados hit seven targets in eastern Syrian oilfields within hours of the Commons decision to attempt to degrade and destroy Isis forces in the country.The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, disclosed that the aircraft were using Paveway bombs and had \u201cdealt a real blow\u201d to the Isis-controlled oilfields.

A total of 66 Labour MPs rejected the advice of their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and voted with the government. Seven Tories ignored the party\u2019s three-line whip and voted to oppose airstrikes.Cameron said there would be strong support from Britain\u2019s allies. \u201cI\u2019ve just been on the telephone to Chancellor Merkel of Germany, and the Germans are stepping up what they are doing in the region,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd there will be very strong support from Muslim countries, Gulf countries, that have asked us to take part in this action, as part of a process that will actually help to deliver the political and diplomatic change that we need in Syria as well.\u201dFallon said the air campaign, due to be supported by reconstituted Syrian troops, could last three years. \u201cThe American estimate of the campaign in Iraq, which began last year, was that it would last at least three years and we\u2019re not halfway through that yet. The operations there by the coalition have lasted just over a year and the prime minister has been pretty clear that this is going to be a long campaign to ensure that Daesh are thrown out of Iraq and that they are degraded and defeated in eastern Syria. This is not going to be quick.\u201dHe said most of the initial airstrikes would focus on Isis depots, supply routes, logistics, command and control and oil wells from which Isis derives revenues.  Related: The new politics and the enemy within | Letters He said the French, in joining the air campaign a month ago, had been surprised by the number of infrastructure targets. Fallon held out hope that a diplomatic and political path would open up this month with a planned agreement among the Syrian opposition groups in talks in Saudi Arabia. Opposition representatives in turn would attend UN-sponsored peace talks, probably in New York, involving all the key regional partners, including Iran. Fallon said: \u201cWe want a new Syrian state including some of those who are fighting it helping on the ground. Obviously we hope in Syria that we will be able to get the Free Syrian Army, who at the moment largely have been fighting [the forces of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad], involved.\u201cThe best news is the peace process is under way, [involving] all the key partners, like Russia and Turkey, that will lead to a transitional settlement in Syria that will lead to the departure of President Assad, and a new government that can lead to elections in Syria.\u201dHe said: \u201cThe Russians are starting to see a future for Syria that does not involve Assad.\u201d He added that some of the argument at the moment among the various partners was about the timetable.\u201cWhile that process is under way we have to deal with this terrorist threat to us in western Europe and we need to squeeze the terrorists, and that is what the RAF is now free to do.\u201d Britain is not coordinating its air campaign with Russia in terms of targets, but there is a formal agreement to prevent conflict between broadly western and Russian air campaigns. Fallon defended the joint intelligence committee estimate that about 70,000 non-extremist troops were available to fight Isis, a claim that proved to be one of the most contentious in the Commons debate. The reverberations from the vote inside the Labour party were only starting to be felt as the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, likened the much-praised speech by Benn \u2013 calling for a fight against modern fascism \u2013 to the oratory delivered by Tony Blair on the eve of the Iraq war in 2003.McDonnell said: \u201cI thought Jeremy [Corbyn] was very careful in the way he approached it. I thought Hilary, his oratory was great. It reminded me of Tony Blair\u2019s speech taking us into the Iraq war and I\u2019m always anxious about the greatest oratory is going to lead us to the greatest mistakes as well.\u201dIn a free vote, a total of 66 Labour MPs backed the war with 10 abstaining. Eleven shadow cabinet members backed the war.In the wake of the vote Corbyn called for an end to the threats and intimidation inside the party, but Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London, said there would be a few deselections, and some of Corbyn\u2019s closest allies described the 66 as rebels.Frank Field, the Labour MP for Birkenhead, called for a party leader in the country and another in parliament. The Stop the War Coalition, which staged a mass \u201cdie-in\u201d outside parliament as MPs voted, condemned \u201cthe whining complaints from those MPs who apparently do not like being lobbied\u201d.

But the Republican senator John McCain said the UK was offering only token aircraft, adding that they would make no significant difference. As the first British aircraft were sent within hours of MPs voting to back the strikes, Capt Richard Davies, of RAF Marham, told the BBC: \u201cIn over 400 airstrikes that the RAF has carried out in Iraq, we have had absolutely no civilian casualties reported. \u201cThe rules of engagement that our crews apply both in the air and by the commanders on the ground mean that I am absolutely confident that that will continue to be the case with operations in Syria.\u201d RAF Marham is preparing to send two jets to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. A further six are expected to arrive from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, doubling the strike force already at the base. Tornado fighter bombers have been attacking Isis targets in Iraq since September last year, when MPs gave the green light for airstrikes. The RAF insisted there had been no reports of civilian deaths, but Corbyn said innocents would be killed.

There\u2019s a taverna within walking distance: down the path to the beach, along the shore, up another path into the hills and down the road into the village \u2013 15 minutes, I\u2019m told. That\u2019s where we\u2019re having lunch today and, if I get my way, every day. In principle I\u2019ve got nothing against exploration, but I have difficulty savouring the unknown.The beach path is a little steeper than I\u2019d imagined when I elected to wear flip-flops. I\u2019m not good in flip-flops; I lack practice.The uphill path is where the main drawback of flip-flops becomes apparent: there\u2019s nothing to stop you sliding out of them backwards. I walk with deliberation, staring at my feet, until I am outside the taverna.After two large beers and many small fish, I begin to feel deeply relaxed.\u201cWhat are you going to write about this week?\u201d asks the child of a friend, seated across from me.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m starting to worry nothing bad will happen to me.\u201dThe children head back first, before coffee. Another contingent decides to wade round the rocks instead of climbing the hill. Soon it\u2019s just me and my friend Alex, and two bags full of stuff nobody wanted to get wet. We set off up the road at a stroll.Ten minutes later we\u2019re still strolling up the road.\u201cDo you remember where the turning for the path is?\u201d I say.\u201cIt must be just there,\u201d Alex says, pointing. We turn down a track that leads to an old car and then disappears.\u201cI don\u2019t recognise any of this,\u201d I say. It\u2019s a stupid comment: there is nothing to recognise.\u201cPerhaps we\u2019ve come too far,\u201d Alex says. We stomp back to the road and walk downhill a bit. We take another turning. It ends after 100 metres at a sheer precipice, dropping to the sea.\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, \u201cwe didn\u2019t go far enough.\u201d We return to the road and walk much farther uphill. The next obvious turning takes us past an abandoned farmhouse into an olive grove.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t look right,\u201d Alex says.\u201cDon\u2019t ask me,\u201d I say. \u201cI was looking at my feet the whole time.\u201dWe attempt to intercept the true path somewhere along its length, moving further into the trees. As we climb over a rusting bedstead, it becomes unclear who\u2019s leading the way. It\u2019s been an hour since we left the taverna. My veneer of calm is wearing thin.

Between them, the three countries have taken in about 90% of the asylum seekers over the past year, but are clamping down on their liberal admissions policies.Last week Vienna triggered a chain reaction of curbs on refugee movement by announcing plans to cap the numbers allowed in over the next four years.

Lagarde told Tsipras the IMF regarded reform of Greece\u2019s pension system, which accounts for 17.7% of GDP, as vital.The IMF said of the talks: \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic programme.\u201cSuch a programme would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d The Greek government said the talks had been sincere.Earlier in the day, Tsipras told Davos he was committed to reforming the Greek economy, which lost 25% of its GDP through austerity programmes which sent jobless rates to twice the eurozone average. But he criticised Europe\u2019s insistence on lowering budget deficits, saying: \u201cWe must all understand that, next to balanced budgets, we must also have growth \u2026 We need to be more realistic, and show more solidarity too.\u201dThe German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appeared unimpressed by Tsipras\u2019s call for greater solidarity, and suggested he needed to deliver on the promises made to creditors. \u201cMy advice is, if we want to make Europe stronger we should implement what we agreed to implement. We can simply say, \u2018implementation, stupid\u2019,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said, in a dig at the Greek leader echoing the catchphrase from Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 US election campaign.The scale of the challenge facing Tsipras was clear in Athens on Thursday. As he rubbed shoulders with fellow world leaders in the Swiss ski resort, thousands of protesters marched through the Greek capital to oppose pension reforms. Many were professionals, such as doctors and engineers, adding their voices to existing protests by farmers and fishermen.Lagarde had earlier called on China to take action to halt the turbulence in financial markets by providing clearer communication about its strategy of reform. Sidestepping questions about whether she wanted a second term at the IMF, she said: \u201cGiven the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue \u2013 this is something that markets do not like. \u201cUncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against \u2013 the dollar, or a basket of currencies.\u201d Related: Dutch PM says refugee crisis could shut down Europe's open borders for good Chinese delegates repeatedly insisted they were not losing control of the economy, growth of which has slowed to 6.8% in the last quarter, its slowest pace in 25 years.

He reiterated that there was no basis for China to devalue the yuan. But, Fang added: \u201cIn China, we cannot afford to let the growth rate drop too sharply, because that will ignite a lot of financial problems.\u201dLi Yuanchao, vice-president of China, told another session in Davos: \u201cDespite the volatility in the world economy, China still achieved a GDP increase of over $500bn (\u00a3352bn) [in 2015], which is estimated to be the largest in the world.\u201dChina\u2019s GDP grew only 6.9%, but Li said the \u201cmedium-high growth rate\u201d was to be expected given the country\u2019s drive to diversify its economic growth drivers.\u2022 This article was amended on 3 February 2016.

By contrast, the commission said this week that 60% of those entering the EU currently were \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d who were not fleeing war and not in need of protection and should be deported.A spokesman for the migration minister told the Guardian that despite the cold weather and choppy seas, about 3,000 refugees had managed to slip into Greece every day this month. \u201cIn that time Turkey has agreed to take back 123,\u201d said Kyriakos Mandouvalos, conceding that while local reaction on several islands had delayed construction of hot spots to process refugees they would be completed by the end of February. \u201cThere have been a lot of technical and political problems to get around but by the last 10 days of February five will open on Lesbos, Leros, Chios, Samos and Kos.\u201dThe warning from the commission came in the form of a draft report on Greece\u2019s performance, which still has to be endorsed by a qualified majority of EU governments. The commission would then give Athens three months to take \u201cremedial action\u201d to safeguard its place in the Schengen system.

Lagarde told Tsipras the IMF regarded reform of Greece\u2019s pension system, which accounts for 17.7% of GDP, as vital.The IMF said of the talks: \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic programme.\u201cSuch a programme would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d The Greek government said the talks had been sincere.Earlier in the day, Tsipras told Davos he was committed to reforming the Greek economy, which lost 25% of its GDP through austerity programmes which sent jobless rates to twice the eurozone average. But he criticised Europe\u2019s insistence on lowering budget deficits, saying: \u201cWe must all understand that, next to balanced budgets, we must also have growth \u2026 We need to be more realistic, and show more solidarity too.\u201dThe German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appeared unimpressed by Tsipras\u2019s call for greater solidarity, and suggested he needed to deliver on the promises made to creditors. \u201cMy advice is, if we want to make Europe stronger we should implement what we agreed to implement. We can simply say, \u2018implementation, stupid\u2019,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said, in a dig at the Greek leader echoing the catchphrase from Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 US election campaign.The scale of the challenge facing Tsipras was clear in Athens on Thursday. As he rubbed shoulders with fellow world leaders in the Swiss ski resort, thousands of protesters marched through the Greek capital to oppose pension reforms. Many were professionals, such as doctors and engineers, adding their voices to existing protests by farmers and fishermen.Lagarde had earlier called on China to take action to halt the turbulence in financial markets by providing clearer communication about its strategy of reform. Sidestepping questions about whether she wanted a second term at the IMF, she said: \u201cGiven the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue \u2013 this is something that markets do not like. \u201cUncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against \u2013 the dollar, or a basket of currencies.\u201d Related: Dutch PM says refugee crisis could shut down Europe's open borders for good Chinese delegates repeatedly insisted they were not losing control of the economy, growth of which has slowed to 6.8% in the last quarter, its slowest pace in 25 years.

He reiterated that there was no basis for China to devalue the yuan. But, Fang added: \u201cIn China, we cannot afford to let the growth rate drop too sharply, because that will ignite a lot of financial problems.\u201dLi Yuanchao, vice-president of China, told another session in Davos: \u201cDespite the volatility in the world economy, China still achieved a GDP increase of over $500bn (\u00a3352bn) [in 2015], which is estimated to be the largest in the world.\u201dChina\u2019s GDP grew only 6.9%, but Li said the \u201cmedium-high growth rate\u201d was to be expected given the country\u2019s drive to diversify its economic growth drivers.\u2022 This article was amended on 3 February 2016.

And sell the Acropolis too!\u201d was how the German tabloid Bild summed up their idea. While selling off ancient monuments was never a serious idea, the privatisation of state assets has always been an integral feature of Greece\u2019s international bailouts. Over the past five years, Greece has faltered on promises to sell vital parts of its infrastructure \u2013 ports, airports, marinas and waterworks \u2013 in exchange for billions of euros in loans. Related: Greek debt crisis talks stall over choice of hotel Privatisation remains a vital element of Greece\u2019s latest bailout deal. Under threat of being forced out of the eurozone, Athens agreed to transfer \u201cvaluable assets\u201d to an independent fund, with the aim of raising \u20ac50bn (\u00a335bn). Half the proceeds will be used to shore up capital reserves at Greek banks; a quarter will be used to repay Greece\u2019s creditors, and the remainder will be spent on unspecified investments.The privatisation fund was the issue that almost forced a Grexit at the marathon 17-hour, all-night summit of European leaders in Brussels earlier this month. \u201cIt was the only thing discussed at the summit,\u201d recalls one diplomat.At 6am, as Greece teetered on the brink of leaving the euro, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was still haggling over privatisation details with his counterparts, Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.The idea of the privatisation fund first emerged in a leaked German government paper which argued Greece should leave the eurozone if it did not agree to put \u20ac50bn in a Luxembourg fund as collateral for its debts. Although drafted in Berlin, the plan soon found support among Greece\u2019s hardline creditors in central Europe and the Baltics. Related: Greece bailout agreement: key points Tsipras wrung two concessions: the fund would be run from Athens, not Luxembourg, and a tranche of the cash would be earmarked for investments in Greece.The privatisation fund is likely to remain one of the most contentious issues as Greece and its creditors strive to conclude bailout talks by mid-August.From the creditors\u2019 perspective, Greek privatisation has been failure heaped upon failure. In 2011, international creditors decreed that Athens would raise \u20ac50bn by the end of 2015 from selling state assets. By early 2015, only \u20ac3.2bn had been raised; none of the most sensitive aspects \u2013 airports, ports, railways \u2013 had been sold. Neither officials at the European commission nor the International Monetary Fund are taking the \u20ac50bn target remotely seriously.In a devastating analysis of Greece\u2019s debt burden published in July, the IMF said it was realistic to assume asset sales would be worth no more than \u20ac500m a year \u2013 meaning it could take 100 years to raise \u20ac50bn.Gabriel Sterne at Oxford Economics argues that the IMF has failed to learn from its recent history that \u201cless is more\u201d when it comes to setting numerical targets. \u201cIt is economics versus faith \u2013 \u2018Somehow we will make this work even if it doesn\u2019t add up\u2019 \u2013 but the economics really doesn\u2019t add up.\u201dWhen Syriza swept to power in January, one of its first actions was to sack the people in charge of Greece\u2019s privatisation agency and cancel plans to sell Greece\u2019s electricity transmission operator (ADMIE). The sale of other assets \u2013 most notably regional airports and the port of Piraeus \u2013 had almost been completed, but was thrown into doubt. The government is expected to put up little resistance to the sales now being concluded. Venues purpose-built for the 2004 Athens Olympic games, which have sat derelict and rotting for the past decade, will also be among the assets moved to the fund, alongside state utilities, including the water board and ADMIE. Both Russia and China have expressed interest in snapping up the state-run railway network, one of the biggest encumbrances on public finances before the debt crisis erupted in late 2009. The Greek state is also rich in buildings bequeathed by individuals to municipalities and the Orthodox Church \u2013 properties that are also expected to be included in the fund. Contrary to popular perception, the public sector owns very few islands. The sale last week to Hollywood star Johnny Depp of the Aegean islet of Stroggilo, for a reputed \u20ac4.2m, was conducted privately.While Tsipras has been forced into a humiliating climbdown over the sale of state assets, he has repeatedly branded the entire bailout plan as a bad deal that he doesn\u2019t believe in.Unions with ties to the governing party have already vowed to \u201cwage war\u201d to stop the sale of docks in Piraeus, where the Chinese conglomerate, Cosco, currently manages three piers. With the debt-stricken country on its knees, officials have stressed that the prime minister will fight to ensure the denationalisations are not seen as a fire sale.However, independent observers fear just that. \u201cPrivatisation in Greece right now means a fire sale,\u201d political economist Jens Bastian said.Bastian was one of the officials responsible for privatisation under the European commission\u2019s Taskforce for Greece, a body of experts distinct from the troika. He thinks it was a \u201cpolitical mistake\u201d to set a target to raise \u20ac50bn from asset sales, in the absence of support from Greek politicians across the political spectrum, from the centre-right New Democracy party, to Pasok on the centre-left and Syriza on the left.\u201cWe have never had a political majority to embrace the idea of privatisation. How are you going to create the political momentum that has been absent in the past years under more difficult conditions today?\u201d he asks.Greece\u2019s creditors share such scepticism. Their answer is tighter controls. The privatisation fund will be managed by Greeks under the close watch of creditors. The privatisation fund has few precedents, although it has been compared to the Treuhandanstalt, the German agency created in the dying days of the GDR to privatise East German assets shortly before reunification. Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, was one of the first to draw the parallel, although others offer the comparison unprompted. Peter Doyle, a former IMF economist, says the Treuhand offers the closest parallels: the agency had full control over government ministries to sell assets quickly. \u201cThe principal task was to sell these things to somebody for cash.\u201d Greek government officials and opposition politicians said it was too early to know how the Greek fund would operate. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go before we have a clear picture of what this fund and the privatisation scheme will entail,\u201d Anna Asimakopoulou, shadow finance minister with the main opposition New Democracy party, told the Guardian. \u201cBut the entire privatisation process will feature large in negotiations because Tsipras is so opposed to them and creditors see them as a good way to raise revenues.\u201d Greece has an urgent need for cash: although the eurozone bailout is meant to be worth up to \u20ac86bn, only \u20ac50bn is on the table, via the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. Doyle thinks Greece\u2019s bailout is underfunded. \u201cThe Europeans just don\u2019t have enough cash ... and a major way to fill that gap is through privatisation.\u201d Officials at the Greek privatisation agency are \u201cgoing to find their arms very strongly twisted to provide needed cash\u201d, he says.\u201cThe privatisation agency is facing a trade off between doing something that is fair and open and following judicial procedures, or something that is going to deliver needed cash.\u201dHe fears Greece could be heading down the path taken by Russia in the 1990s, when valuable state assets were sold at knockdown prices to raise urgently-needed cash, creating a new oligarch class in the process.\u201cThe very thing we all think that Greece needs \u2013 to get rid of its oligarchy \u2013 will in fact be entrenched by privatisation done this way,\u201d argues Doyle, who worked on privatisations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland in the 1990s. The difference between those countries and Greece, he thinks, is that the population and political class in central Europe accepted the idea of privatisation, despite the short-term hardships.He is convinced the current privatisation plan for Greece is doomed to fail. \u201cThe programme was set up to encourage Greece to leave the euro and that plan didn\u2019t work, so now we are stuck with the privatisation arrangement that nobody, not even the original creditors, ever intended to happen.\u201dSource: Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Privatisation", "Greece", "Business", "Economics", "Euro", "Europe", "European Central Bank", "European Union", "European monetary union", "Financial crisis", "World news", "Financial sector", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)"], "title": "The great Greece fire sale"},{"date": "2016-01-27T18:49:05Z", "content": "Greece has hit back angrily after being given three months to avoid being suspended from Europe\u2019s free-travel Schengen area because of its alleged failures to get a grip on the continent\u2019s mass migration crisis.The European commission said on Wednesday that Athens was failing to observe its obligations under the rules governing Europe\u2019s 26-country passport-free travel area, known as Schengen.\u201cGreece is under pressure,\u201d said Valdis Dombrovskis, a commission vice-president. \u201cGreece seriously neglected its obligations \u2026 There are serious deficiencies in the carrying out of external border control that must be overcome.\u201d Related: Where there's a wall, there's no way: refugee crisis needs a better idea Greece has been the main gateway to Europe via Turkey for more than a million people over the past year, the majority of them from the Middle East.

Describing the threat to isolate Greece as unconstructive on Wednesday, it claimed the draft evaluation report had been conducted at a time when the situation on the ground was different to the one prevailing two and a half months later.\u201cGreece has surpassed itself in order to keep its obligations,\u201d said government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili, insisting that it was not Greece\u2019s fault that Turkey had failed to clamp down on smugglers\u2019 rings and stem the flow of refugees. \u201cWe expect everyone else to do the same.\u201dEU governments made clear on Monday that there would need to be unprecedented action against Greece if it failed to start playing by the Schengen rules. Wednesday\u2019s warning from the commission confirmed that. Dombrovskis said that a secret EU mission to Greece in November had concluded that Athens was avoiding the Schengen rules on several fronts.\u201cThere is no effective identification and registration of irregular migrants,\u201d said Dombrovskis. \u201cFingerprints are not being entered systematically into the system, travel documents are not being systematically checked for authenticity or against crucial security databases.\u201dThe unprecedented move to sanction Greece is being combined with national governments acting to extend and prolong national border controls for up to two years, dealing a potentially terminal blow to the Schengen regime which has been in effect for more than 20 years and is generally viewed as one of the EU\u2019s biggest and most popular achievements.

By contrast, the commission said this week that 60% of those entering the EU currently were \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d who were not fleeing war and not in need of protection and should be deported.A spokesman for the migration minister told the Guardian that despite the cold weather and choppy seas, about 3,000 refugees had managed to slip into Greece every day this month. \u201cIn that time Turkey has agreed to take back 123,\u201d said Kyriakos Mandouvalos, conceding that while local reaction on several islands had delayed construction of hot spots to process refugees they would be completed by the end of February. \u201cThere have been a lot of technical and political problems to get around but by the last 10 days of February five will open on Lesbos, Leros, Chios, Samos and Kos.\u201dThe warning from the commission came in the form of a draft report on Greece\u2019s performance, which still has to be endorsed by a qualified majority of EU governments. The commission would then give Athens three months to take \u201cremedial action\u201d to safeguard its place in the Schengen system.

Sweden has already imposed stringent national border controls and Germany is mulling whether to suspend Schengen for two years, a move that would bring copycat decisions elsewhere and deal a possibly terminal blow to the Schengen regime.Johana Mikl-Leitner, the Austrian interior minister, rejected Greek arguments about the difficulties of patrolling its maritime borders with Turkey and explicitly warned Athens about a Schengen expulsion. \u201cGreece has one of the biggest navies in Europe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a myth that the Greek-Turkish border cannot be protected.\u201dThe Swedish home affairs minister, Anders Ygeman, said that if Greece could not meet its Schengen obligations, \u201cits connections to the Schengen area have to be restricted\u201d.Thomas de Maiziere, the German interior minister, said: \u201cWe will put influence on Greece.\u201dA rising sense of panic has taken root in EU governments, who are desperate for the numbers of arrivals to slow down while all the evidence points in the opposite direction.About 35,000 have made the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece since the beginning of the year, a 20-fold increase on the same period last year.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any good options, only bad options on the table,\u201d said a senior diplomat in Brussels. \u201cThis simply can\u2019t continue.

The EU cannot agree on how on how to fund the \u20ac3bn promised to the Turks to halt or slow migrant flows to Europe. Germany wants to pay Turkey more, and a joint statement from the German and Turkish governments following Berlin negotiations last Friday referred to the \u20ac3bn bill as merely a \u201cfirst\u201d payment.The pressure on Greece also highlights further divisions in the EU..

Lagarde told Tsipras the IMF regarded reform of Greece\u2019s pension system, which accounts for 17.7% of GDP, as vital.The IMF said of the talks: \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic programme.\u201cSuch a programme would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d The Greek government said the talks had been sincere.Earlier in the day, Tsipras told Davos he was committed to reforming the Greek economy, which lost 25% of its GDP through austerity programmes which sent jobless rates to twice the eurozone average. But he criticised Europe\u2019s insistence on lowering budget deficits, saying: \u201cWe must all understand that, next to balanced budgets, we must also have growth \u2026 We need to be more realistic, and show more solidarity too.\u201dThe German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appeared unimpressed by Tsipras\u2019s call for greater solidarity, and suggested he needed to deliver on the promises made to creditors. \u201cMy advice is, if we want to make Europe stronger we should implement what we agreed to implement. We can simply say, \u2018implementation, stupid\u2019,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said, in a dig at the Greek leader echoing the catchphrase from Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 US election campaign.The scale of the challenge facing Tsipras was clear in Athens on Thursday. As he rubbed shoulders with fellow world leaders in the Swiss ski resort, thousands of protesters marched through the Greek capital to oppose pension reforms. Many were professionals, such as doctors and engineers, adding their voices to existing protests by farmers and fishermen.Lagarde had earlier called on China to take action to halt the turbulence in financial markets by providing clearer communication about its strategy of reform. Sidestepping questions about whether she wanted a second term at the IMF, she said: \u201cGiven the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue \u2013 this is something that markets do not like. \u201cUncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against \u2013 the dollar, or a basket of currencies.\u201d Related: Dutch PM says refugee crisis could shut down Europe's open borders for good Chinese delegates repeatedly insisted they were not losing control of the economy, growth of which has slowed to 6.8% in the last quarter, its slowest pace in 25 years.

He reiterated that there was no basis for China to devalue the yuan.

And sell the Acropolis too!\u201d was how the German tabloid Bild summed up their idea. While selling off ancient monuments was never a serious idea, the privatisation of state assets has always been an integral feature of Greece\u2019s international bailouts. Over the past five years, Greece has faltered on promises to sell vital parts of its infrastructure \u2013 ports, airports, marinas and waterworks \u2013 in exchange for billions of euros in loans. Related: Greek debt crisis talks stall over choice of hotel Privatisation remains a vital element of Greece\u2019s latest bailout deal. Under threat of being forced out of the eurozone, Athens agreed to transfer \u201cvaluable assets\u201d to an independent fund, with the aim of raising \u20ac50bn (\u00a335bn). Half the proceeds will be used to shore up capital reserves at Greek banks; a quarter will be used to repay Greece\u2019s creditors, and the remainder will be spent on unspecified investments.The privatisation fund was the issue that almost forced a Grexit at the marathon 17-hour, all-night summit of European leaders in Brussels earlier this month. \u201cIt was the only thing discussed at the summit,\u201d recalls one diplomat.At 6am, as Greece teetered on the brink of leaving the euro, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was still haggling over privatisation details with his counterparts, Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.The idea of the privatisation fund first emerged in a leaked German government paper which argued Greece should leave the eurozone if it did not agree to put \u20ac50bn in a Luxembourg fund as collateral for its debts. Although drafted in Berlin, the plan soon found support among Greece\u2019s hardline creditors in central Europe and the Baltics. Related: Greece bailout agreement: key points Tsipras wrung two concessions: the fund would be run from Athens, not Luxembourg, and a tranche of the cash would be earmarked for investments in Greece.The privatisation fund is likely to remain one of the most contentious issues as Greece and its creditors strive to conclude bailout talks by mid-August.From the creditors\u2019 perspective, Greek privatisation has been failure heaped upon failure. In 2011, international creditors decreed that Athens would raise \u20ac50bn by the end of 2015 from selling state assets. By early 2015, only \u20ac3.2bn had been raised; none of the most sensitive aspects \u2013 airports, ports, railways \u2013 had been sold. Neither officials at the European commission nor the International Monetary Fund are taking the \u20ac50bn target remotely seriously.In a devastating analysis of Greece\u2019s debt burden published in July, the IMF said it was realistic to assume asset sales would be worth no more than \u20ac500m a year \u2013 meaning it could take 100 years to raise \u20ac50bn.Gabriel Sterne at Oxford Economics argues that the IMF has failed to learn from its recent history that \u201cless is more\u201d when it comes to setting numerical targets. \u201cIt is economics versus faith \u2013 \u2018Somehow we will make this work even if it doesn\u2019t add up\u2019 \u2013 but the economics really doesn\u2019t add up.\u201dWhen Syriza swept to power in January, one of its first actions was to sack the people in charge of Greece\u2019s privatisation agency and cancel plans to sell Greece\u2019s electricity transmission operator (ADMIE). The sale of other assets \u2013 most notably regional airports and the port of Piraeus \u2013 had almost been completed, but was thrown into doubt. The government is expected to put up little resistance to the sales now being concluded. Venues purpose-built for the 2004 Athens Olympic games, which have sat derelict and rotting for the past decade, will also be among the assets moved to the fund, alongside state utilities, including the water board and ADMIE. Both Russia and China have expressed interest in snapping up the state-run railway network, one of the biggest encumbrances on public finances before the debt crisis erupted in late 2009. The Greek state is also rich in buildings bequeathed by individuals to municipalities and the Orthodox Church \u2013 properties that are also expected to be included in the fund. Contrary to popular perception, the public sector owns very few islands. The sale last week to Hollywood star Johnny Depp of the Aegean islet of Stroggilo, for a reputed \u20ac4.2m, was conducted privately.While Tsipras has been forced into a humiliating climbdown over the sale of state assets, he has repeatedly branded the entire bailout plan as a bad deal that he doesn\u2019t believe in.Unions with ties to the governing party have already vowed to \u201cwage war\u201d to stop the sale of docks in Piraeus, where the Chinese conglomerate, Cosco, currently manages three piers. With the debt-stricken country on its knees, officials have stressed that the prime minister will fight to ensure the denationalisations are not seen as a fire sale.However, independent observers fear just that. \u201cPrivatisation in Greece right now means a fire sale,\u201d political economist Jens Bastian said.Bastian was one of the officials responsible for privatisation under the European commission\u2019s Taskforce for Greece, a body of experts distinct from the troika. He thinks it was a \u201cpolitical mistake\u201d to set a target to raise \u20ac50bn from asset sales, in the absence of support from Greek politicians across the political spectrum, from the centre-right New Democracy party, to Pasok on the centre-left and Syriza on the left.\u201cWe have never had a political majority to embrace the idea of privatisation. How are you going to create the political momentum that has been absent in the past years under more difficult conditions today?\u201d he asks.Greece\u2019s creditors share such scepticism. Their answer is tighter controls. The privatisation fund will be managed by Greeks under the close watch of creditors. The privatisation fund has few precedents, although it has been compared to the Treuhandanstalt, the German agency created in the dying days of the GDR to privatise East German assets shortly before reunification. Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, was one of the first to draw the parallel, although others offer the comparison unprompted. Peter Doyle, a former IMF economist, says the Treuhand offers the closest parallels: the agency had full control over government ministries to sell assets quickly. \u201cThe principal task was to sell these things to somebody for cash.\u201d Greek government officials and opposition politicians said it was too early to know how the Greek fund would operate. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go before we have a clear picture of what this fund and the privatisation scheme will entail,\u201d Anna Asimakopoulou, shadow finance minister with the main opposition New Democracy party, told the Guardian. \u201cBut the entire privatisation process will feature large in negotiations because Tsipras is so opposed to them and creditors see them as a good way to raise revenues.\u201d Greece has an urgent need for cash: although the eurozone bailout is meant to be worth up to \u20ac86bn, only \u20ac50bn is on the table, via the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. Doyle thinks Greece\u2019s bailout is underfunded. \u201cThe Europeans just don\u2019t have enough cash ... and a major way to fill that gap is through privatisation.\u201d Officials at the Greek privatisation agency are \u201cgoing to find their arms very strongly twisted to provide needed cash\u201d, he says.\u201cThe privatisation agency is facing a trade off between doing something that is fair and open and following judicial procedures, or something that is going to deliver needed cash.\u201dHe fears Greece could be heading down the path taken by Russia in the 1990s, when valuable state assets were sold at knockdown prices to raise urgently-needed cash, creating a new oligarch class in the process.\u201cThe very thing we all think that Greece needs \u2013 to get rid of its oligarchy \u2013 will in fact be entrenched by privatisation done this way,\u201d argues Doyle, who worked on privatisations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland in the 1990s. The difference between those countries and Greece, he thinks, is that the population and political class in central Europe accepted the idea of privatisation, despite the short-term hardships.He is convinced the current privatisation plan for Greece is doomed to fail. \u201cThe programme was set up to encourage Greece to leave the euro and that plan didn\u2019t work, so now we are stuck with the privatisation arrangement that nobody, not even the original creditors, ever intended to happen.\u201dSource: Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Privatisation", "Greece", "Business", "Economics", "Euro", "Europe", "European Central Bank", "European Union", "European monetary union", "Financial crisis", "World news", "Financial sector", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)"], "title": "The great Greece fire sale"},{"date": "2015-07-13T16:20:58Z", "content": "After almost 17 hours of talks in Brussels, Europe\u2019s longest-ever summit, Greece and the rest of the eurozone have finally reached an agreement that could lead to a third bailout and keep the country in the single currency bloc.Alexis Tsipras, the Greek PM, conceded to a further swathe of austerity measures and economic reforms. Here is a summary of where he has had to compromise.Up to \u20ac50bn (\u00a335bn) worth of Greek assets will be transferred to a new fund, which will contribute to the recapitalisation of the country\u2019s banks. The fund will be based in Athens, not Luxembourg as Germany had originally demanded. Related: Greece and eurozone reach agreement in bailout talks The location of the fund was a key sticking point in the marathon overnight talks. Transferring the assets out of Greece would have meant \u201cliquidity asphyxiation\u201d, Tsipras said.As the statement puts it: \u201cValuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetise the assets through privatisations and other means.\u201d The \u201cvaluable assets\u201d are likely to include things such as planes, airports, infrastructure and banks, analysts say.Some of the fund will be used to recapitalise banks and decrease debt, but analysts are sceptical about how much money there will really be to work with.\u201cGiven the experience of the last few years\u2019 privatisation programme, these targets appear overtly optimistic, serving as a signalling mechanism of Greek government commitment to privatisation rather than a meaningful source of financing for bank recapitalisation, growth and debt reduction,\u201d said George Saravelos, a strategist at Deutsche Bank.Greece has been told that it needs to pass measures to \u201cimprove long-term sustainability of the pension system\u201d by 15 July.The country\u2019s pensions system, and its perceived generosity relative to other eurozone states, has been a key sticking point in the past five months of negotiations with creditors.The so-called troika of lenders believes that Athens can save 0.25% to 0.5% of GDP in 2015 and 1% of GDP in 2016 by reforming pensions.Greece had wanted to draw out reform of early retirement rules, starting in October and running until 2025, when everyone would retire at 67. The EU wants the process to start immediately, by imposing huge costs on those who want to retire early to discourage them from doing so. The lenders also say Athens must bring forward the reform programme so it completes in 2022.Another source of contention in the months of failed negotiations that preceded Monday\u2019s tentative deal, VAT is now also on the block for immediate reform.The latest agreement demands measures, again by 15 July, for \u201cthe streamlining of the VAT system and the broadening of the tax base to increase revenue\u201d.One of the key objections from Greece\u2019s creditors to its VAT system is a 30% discount for the Greek islands. Athens proposed a compromise on 10 July under which the exemptions for the big tourist islands \u2013 where the revenue opportunities are greatest \u2013 would end first, with the more remote islands following later.The onus on Greece to \u201cincrease revenue\u201d is likely to mean more items will be covered by the top VAT rate of 23%, including restaurant bills, something that had until recently been a red line for Tsipras.Another demand for legislation by 15 July is on \u201cthe safeguarduing of the full legal independence of ELSTAT\u201d, the Greek statistics office. Greece has been told it must legislate by 15 July to introduce \u201cquasi-automatic spending cuts\u201d if it deviates from primary surplus targets. In other words, if it cannot cut enough to balance the books, it should cut some more.In the past, the troika has demanded that Greece commit to a budget surplus of 1% in 2015, rising to 3.5% by 2018. Talks will begin immediately on bridging finance to avert the collapse of Greece\u2019s banking system and help cover its debt repayments this summer. Greece must repay more than \u20ac7bn to the European Central Bank (ECB) in July and August, before any bailout cash can be handed over.Greece has been promised discussions on restructuring its debts. A statement from Sunday night also ruled out any \u201chaircuts\u201d, leaving the \u20ac240bn Greece owes to Brussels, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the books. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the Eurogroup was ready to consider extending the maturity on Greek loans. She argues that a delay in loan repayments and a lower interest rate act in the same way as a write-off, which is why many analysts point out that the Greek debt mountain is worth the equivalent of 90% of GDP in real terms and not the 180% commonly quoted. Merkel said that for this reason there was no need for a Plan B.Tsipras pledged to implement radical reforms to ensure the Greek oligarchy finally makes a fair contribution. The agreement thrashed out overnight would allow Greece to stand on its feet again, he said. Implementation of the reforms would be tough, he said, but \u201cwe fought hard abroad, we must now fight at home against vested interests\u201d.He added: \u201cThe measures are recessionary, but we hope that putting Grexit to bed means inward investment can begin to flow, negating them.\u201dThe new deal also calls for \u201cmore ambitious product market reforms\u201d that will include liberalising the economy with measures ranging from bringing in Sunday trading hours to opening up closed professions.Greece\u2019s labour markets must also be liberalised, the other eurozone leaders say. Notably, they are demanding Athens \u201cundertake rigourous reviews and modernisation\u201d of collective bargaining and industrial action.Pharmacy ownership, the designation of bakeries and the marketing of milk are also up for reform, all as recommended in a \u201ctoolkit\u201d from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.The statement from the euro summit stipulates that Greece will request continued IMF support from March 2016. This is another loss for Tsipras, who had reportedly resisted further IMF involvement in Greece\u2019s rescue.Greece has been told to get on with privatising its energy transmission network operator (ADMIE).Greece has been told to strengthen its financial sector, including taking \u201cdecisive action on non-performing loans\u201d and eliminating political interference.

On the frontline of the migration flows \u2013 850,000 migrants traversed Greece last year \u2013 Athens is furious at being scapegoated by the rest of the EU and fears the impact of being quarantined.The Greek foreign ministry released statistics on Wednesday showing that 90% of the new arrivals last year were from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, most of whom would routinely qualify for refugee status. By contrast, the commission said this week that 60% of those entering the EU currently were \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d who were not fleeing war and not in need of protection and should be deported.A spokesman for the migration minister told the Guardian that despite the cold weather and choppy seas, about 3,000 refugees had managed to slip into Greece every day this month. \u201cIn that time Turkey has agreed to take back 123,\u201d said Kyriakos Mandouvalos, conceding that while local reaction on several islands had delayed construction of hot spots to process refugees they would be completed by the end of February. \u201cThere have been a lot of technical and political problems to get around but by the last 10 days of February five will open on Lesbos, Leros, Chios, Samos and Kos.\u201dThe warning from the commission came in the form of a draft report on Greece\u2019s performance, which still has to be endorsed by a qualified majority of EU governments.

Between them, the three countries have taken in about 90% of the asylum seekers over the past year, but are clamping down on their liberal admissions policies.Last week Vienna triggered a chain reaction of curbs on refugee movement by announcing plans to cap the numbers allowed in over the next four years. Sweden has already imposed stringent national border controls and Germany is mulling whether to suspend Schengen for two years, a move that would bring copycat decisions elsewhere and deal a possibly terminal blow to the Schengen regime.Johana Mikl-Leitner, the Austrian interior minister, rejected Greek arguments about the difficulties of patrolling its maritime borders with Turkey and explicitly warned Athens about a Schengen expulsion. \u201cGreece has one of the biggest navies in Europe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a myth that the Greek-Turkish border cannot be protected.\u201dThe Swedish home affairs minister, Anders Ygeman, said that if Greece could not meet its Schengen obligations, \u201cits connections to the Schengen area have to be restricted\u201d.Thomas de Maiziere, the German interior minister, said: \u201cWe will put influence on Greece.\u201dA rising sense of panic has taken root in EU governments, who are desperate for the numbers of arrivals to slow down while all the evidence points in the opposite direction.About 35,000 have made the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece since the beginning of the year, a 20-fold increase on the same period last year.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any good options, only bad options on the table,\u201d said a senior diplomat in Brussels. \u201cThis simply can\u2019t continue.

The EU cannot agree on how on how to fund the \u20ac3bn promised to the Turks to halt or slow migrant flows to Europe. Germany wants to pay Turkey more, and a joint statement from the German and Turkish governments following Berlin negotiations last Friday referred to the \u20ac3bn bill as merely a \u201cfirst\u201d payment.The pressure on Greece also highlights further divisions in the EU..

Lagarde told Tsipras the IMF regarded reform of Greece\u2019s pension system, which accounts for 17.7% of GDP, as vital.The IMF said of the talks: \u201cThe managing director reiterated that the IMF stands ready to continue to support Greece in achieving robust economic growth and sustainable public finances through a credible and comprehensive medium-term economic programme.\u201cSuch a programme would require strong economic policies, not least pension reforms as well as significant debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners to ensure that debt is on a sustainable downward trajectory.\u201d The Greek government said the talks had been sincere.Earlier in the day, Tsipras told Davos he was committed to reforming the Greek economy, which lost 25% of its GDP through austerity programmes which sent jobless rates to twice the eurozone average. But he criticised Europe\u2019s insistence on lowering budget deficits, saying: \u201cWe must all understand that, next to balanced budgets, we must also have growth \u2026 We need to be more realistic, and show more solidarity too.\u201dThe German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, appeared unimpressed by Tsipras\u2019s call for greater solidarity, and suggested he needed to deliver on the promises made to creditors. \u201cMy advice is, if we want to make Europe stronger we should implement what we agreed to implement. We can simply say, \u2018implementation, stupid\u2019,\u201d Sch\u00e4uble said, in a dig at the Greek leader echoing the catchphrase from Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 US election campaign.The scale of the challenge facing Tsipras was clear in Athens on Thursday. As he rubbed shoulders with fellow world leaders in the Swiss ski resort, thousands of protesters marched through the Greek capital to oppose pension reforms. Many were professionals, such as doctors and engineers, adding their voices to existing protests by farmers and fishermen.Lagarde had earlier called on China to take action to halt the turbulence in financial markets by providing clearer communication about its strategy of reform. Sidestepping questions about whether she wanted a second term at the IMF, she said: \u201cGiven the massive transitions in China, there is a communication issue \u2013 this is something that markets do not like. \u201cUncertainty, not knowing exactly what the policy is. Not knowing exactly what the renmimni is valued against \u2013 the dollar, or a basket of currencies.\u201d Related: Dutch PM says refugee crisis could shut down Europe's open borders for good Chinese delegates repeatedly insisted they were not losing control of the economy, growth of which has slowed to 6.8% in the last quarter, its slowest pace in 25 years.

He reiterated that there was no basis for China to devalue the yuan. But, Fang added: \u201cIn China, we cannot afford to let the growth rate drop too sharply, because that will ignite a lot of financial problems.\u201dLi Yuanchao, vice-president of China, told another session in Davos: \u201cDespite the volatility in the world economy, China still achieved a GDP increase of over $500bn (\u00a3352bn) [in 2015], which is estimated to be the largest in the world.\u201dChina\u2019s GDP grew only 6.9%, but Li said the \u201cmedium-high growth rate\u201d was to be expected given the country\u2019s drive to diversify its economic growth drivers.\u2022 This article was amended on 3 February 2016.

And sell the Acropolis too!\u201d was how the German tabloid Bild summed up their idea. While selling off ancient monuments was never a serious idea, the privatisation of state assets has always been an integral feature of Greece\u2019s international bailouts. Over the past five years, Greece has faltered on promises to sell vital parts of its infrastructure \u2013 ports, airports, marinas and waterworks \u2013 in exchange for billions of euros in loans. Related: Greek debt crisis talks stall over choice of hotel Privatisation remains a vital element of Greece\u2019s latest bailout deal. Under threat of being forced out of the eurozone, Athens agreed to transfer \u201cvaluable assets\u201d to an independent fund, with the aim of raising \u20ac50bn (\u00a335bn). Half the proceeds will be used to shore up capital reserves at Greek banks; a quarter will be used to repay Greece\u2019s creditors, and the remainder will be spent on unspecified investments.The privatisation fund was the issue that almost forced a Grexit at the marathon 17-hour, all-night summit of European leaders in Brussels earlier this month. \u201cIt was the only thing discussed at the summit,\u201d recalls one diplomat.At 6am, as Greece teetered on the brink of leaving the euro, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was still haggling over privatisation details with his counterparts, Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.The idea of the privatisation fund first emerged in a leaked German government paper which argued Greece should leave the eurozone if it did not agree to put \u20ac50bn in a Luxembourg fund as collateral for its debts. Although drafted in Berlin, the plan soon found support among Greece\u2019s hardline creditors in central Europe and the Baltics. Related: Greece bailout agreement: key points Tsipras wrung two concessions: the fund would be run from Athens, not Luxembourg, and a tranche of the cash would be earmarked for investments in Greece.The privatisation fund is likely to remain one of the most contentious issues as Greece and its creditors strive to conclude bailout talks by mid-August.From the creditors\u2019 perspective, Greek privatisation has been failure heaped upon failure. In 2011, international creditors decreed that Athens would raise \u20ac50bn by the end of 2015 from selling state assets. By early 2015, only \u20ac3.2bn had been raised; none of the most sensitive aspects \u2013 airports, ports, railways \u2013 had been sold. Neither officials at the European commission nor the International Monetary Fund are taking the \u20ac50bn target remotely seriously.In a devastating analysis of Greece\u2019s debt burden published in July, the IMF said it was realistic to assume asset sales would be worth no more than \u20ac500m a year \u2013 meaning it could take 100 years to raise \u20ac50bn.Gabriel Sterne at Oxford Economics argues that the IMF has failed to learn from its recent history that \u201cless is more\u201d when it comes to setting numerical targets. \u201cIt is economics versus faith \u2013 \u2018Somehow we will make this work even if it doesn\u2019t add up\u2019 \u2013 but the economics really doesn\u2019t add up.\u201dWhen Syriza swept to power in January, one of its first actions was to sack the people in charge of Greece\u2019s privatisation agency and cancel plans to sell Greece\u2019s electricity transmission operator (ADMIE). The sale of other assets \u2013 most notably regional airports and the port of Piraeus \u2013 had almost been completed, but was thrown into doubt. The government is expected to put up little resistance to the sales now being concluded. Venues purpose-built for the 2004 Athens Olympic games, which have sat derelict and rotting for the past decade, will also be among the assets moved to the fund, alongside state utilities, including the water board and ADMIE. Both Russia and China have expressed interest in snapping up the state-run railway network, one of the biggest encumbrances on public finances before the debt crisis erupted in late 2009. The Greek state is also rich in buildings bequeathed by individuals to municipalities and the Orthodox Church \u2013 properties that are also expected to be included in the fund. Contrary to popular perception, the public sector owns very few islands. The sale last week to Hollywood star Johnny Depp of the Aegean islet of Stroggilo, for a reputed \u20ac4.2m, was conducted privately.While Tsipras has been forced into a humiliating climbdown over the sale of state assets, he has repeatedly branded the entire bailout plan as a bad deal that he doesn\u2019t believe in.Unions with ties to the governing party have already vowed to \u201cwage war\u201d to stop the sale of docks in Piraeus, where the Chinese conglomerate, Cosco, currently manages three piers. With the debt-stricken country on its knees, officials have stressed that the prime minister will fight to ensure the denationalisations are not seen as a fire sale.However, independent observers fear just that. \u201cPrivatisation in Greece right now means a fire sale,\u201d political economist Jens Bastian said.Bastian was one of the officials responsible for privatisation under the European commission\u2019s Taskforce for Greece, a body of experts distinct from the troika. He thinks it was a \u201cpolitical mistake\u201d to set a target to raise \u20ac50bn from asset sales, in the absence of support from Greek politicians across the political spectrum, from the centre-right New Democracy party, to Pasok on the centre-left and Syriza on the left.\u201cWe have never had a political majority to embrace the idea of privatisation. How are you going to create the political momentum that has been absent in the past years under more difficult conditions today?\u201d he asks.Greece\u2019s creditors share such scepticism. Their answer is tighter controls. The privatisation fund will be managed by Greeks under the close watch of creditors. The privatisation fund has few precedents, although it has been compared to the Treuhandanstalt, the German agency created in the dying days of the GDR to privatise East German assets shortly before reunification. Greece\u2019s former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, was one of the first to draw the parallel, although others offer the comparison unprompted. Peter Doyle, a former IMF economist, says the Treuhand offers the closest parallels: the agency had full control over government ministries to sell assets quickly. \u201cThe principal task was to sell these things to somebody for cash.\u201d Greek government officials and opposition politicians said it was too early to know how the Greek fund would operate. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go before we have a clear picture of what this fund and the privatisation scheme will entail,\u201d Anna Asimakopoulou, shadow finance minister with the main opposition New Democracy party, told the Guardian. \u201cBut the entire privatisation process will feature large in negotiations because Tsipras is so opposed to them and creditors see them as a good way to raise revenues.\u201d Greece has an urgent need for cash: although the eurozone bailout is meant to be worth up to \u20ac86bn, only \u20ac50bn is on the table, via the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. Doyle thinks Greece\u2019s bailout is underfunded. \u201cThe Europeans just don\u2019t have enough cash ... and a major way to fill that gap is through privatisation.\u201d Officials at the Greek privatisation agency are \u201cgoing to find their arms very strongly twisted to provide needed cash\u201d, he says.\u201cThe privatisation agency is facing a trade off between doing something that is fair and open and following judicial procedures, or something that is going to deliver needed cash.\u201dHe fears Greece could be heading down the path taken by Russia in the 1990s, when valuable state assets were sold at knockdown prices to raise urgently-needed cash, creating a new oligarch class in the process.\u201cThe very thing we all think that Greece needs \u2013 to get rid of its oligarchy \u2013 will in fact be entrenched by privatisation done this way,\u201d argues Doyle, who worked on privatisations in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland in the 1990s. The difference between those countries and Greece, he thinks, is that the population and political class in central Europe accepted the idea of privatisation, despite the short-term hardships.He is convinced the current privatisation plan for Greece is doomed to fail. \u201cThe programme was set up to encourage Greece to leave the euro and that plan didn\u2019t work, so now we are stuck with the privatisation arrangement that nobody, not even the original creditors, ever intended to happen.\u201dSource: Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Privatisation", "Greece", "Business", "Economics", "Euro", "Europe", "European Central Bank", "European Union", "European monetary union", "Financial crisis", "World news", "Financial sector", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)"], "title": "The great Greece fire sale"},{"date": "2015-07-13T16:20:58Z", "content": "After almost 17 hours of talks in Brussels, Europe\u2019s longest-ever summit, Greece and the rest of the eurozone have finally reached an agreement that could lead to a third bailout and keep the country in the single currency bloc.Alexis Tsipras, the Greek PM, conceded to a further swathe of austerity measures and economic reforms. Here is a summary of where he has had to compromise.Up to \u20ac50bn (\u00a335bn) worth of Greek assets will be transferred to a new fund, which will contribute to the recapitalisation of the country\u2019s banks. The fund will be based in Athens, not Luxembourg as Germany had originally demanded. Related: Greece and eurozone reach agreement in bailout talks The location of the fund was a key sticking point in the marathon overnight talks. Transferring the assets out of Greece would have meant \u201cliquidity asphyxiation\u201d, Tsipras said.As the statement puts it: \u201cValuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetise the assets through privatisations and other means.\u201d The \u201cvaluable assets\u201d are likely to include things such as planes, airports, infrastructure and banks, analysts say.Some of the fund will be used to recapitalise banks and decrease debt, but analysts are sceptical about how much money there will really be to work with.\u201cGiven the experience of the last few years\u2019 privatisation programme, these targets appear overtly optimistic, serving as a signalling mechanism of Greek government commitment to privatisation rather than a meaningful source of financing for bank recapitalisation, growth and debt reduction,\u201d said George Saravelos, a strategist at Deutsche Bank.Greece has been told that it needs to pass measures to \u201cimprove long-term sustainability of the pension system\u201d by 15 July.The country\u2019s pensions system, and its perceived generosity relative to other eurozone states, has been a key sticking point in the past five months of negotiations with creditors.The so-called troika of lenders believes that Athens can save 0.25% to 0.5% of GDP in 2015 and 1% of GDP in 2016 by reforming pensions.Greece had wanted to draw out reform of early retirement rules, starting in October and running until 2025, when everyone would retire at 67. The EU wants the process to start immediately, by imposing huge costs on those who want to retire early to discourage them from doing so. The lenders also say Athens must bring forward the reform programme so it completes in 2022.Another source of contention in the months of failed negotiations that preceded Monday\u2019s tentative deal, VAT is now also on the block for immediate reform.The latest agreement demands measures, again by 15 July, for \u201cthe streamlining of the VAT system and the broadening of the tax base to increase revenue\u201d.One of the key objections from Greece\u2019s creditors to its VAT system is a 30% discount for the Greek islands. Athens proposed a compromise on 10 July under which the exemptions for the big tourist islands \u2013 where the revenue opportunities are greatest \u2013 would end first, with the more remote islands following later.The onus on Greece to \u201cincrease revenue\u201d is likely to mean more items will be covered by the top VAT rate of 23%, including restaurant bills, something that had until recently been a red line for Tsipras.Another demand for legislation by 15 July is on \u201cthe safeguarduing of the full legal independence of ELSTAT\u201d, the Greek statistics office. Greece has been told it must legislate by 15 July to introduce \u201cquasi-automatic spending cuts\u201d if it deviates from primary surplus targets. In other words, if it cannot cut enough to balance the books, it should cut some more.In the past, the troika has demanded that Greece commit to a budget surplus of 1% in 2015, rising to 3.5% by 2018. Talks will begin immediately on bridging finance to avert the collapse of Greece\u2019s banking system and help cover its debt repayments this summer. Greece must repay more than \u20ac7bn to the European Central Bank (ECB) in July and August, before any bailout cash can be handed over.Greece has been promised discussions on restructuring its debts. A statement from Sunday night also ruled out any \u201chaircuts\u201d, leaving the \u20ac240bn Greece owes to Brussels, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the books. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the Eurogroup was ready to consider extending the maturity on Greek loans. She argues that a delay in loan repayments and a lower interest rate act in the same way as a write-off, which is why many analysts point out that the Greek debt mountain is worth the equivalent of 90% of GDP in real terms and not the 180% commonly quoted. Merkel said that for this reason there was no need for a Plan B.Tsipras pledged to implement radical reforms to ensure the Greek oligarchy finally makes a fair contribution. The agreement thrashed out overnight would allow Greece to stand on its feet again, he said. Implementation of the reforms would be tough, he said, but \u201cwe fought hard abroad, we must now fight at home against vested interests\u201d.He added: \u201cThe measures are recessionary, but we hope that putting Grexit to bed means inward investment can begin to flow, negating them.\u201dThe new deal also calls for \u201cmore ambitious product market reforms\u201d that will include liberalising the economy with measures ranging from bringing in Sunday trading hours to opening up closed professions.Greece\u2019s labour markets must also be liberalised, the other eurozone leaders say. Notably, they are demanding Athens \u201cundertake rigourous reviews and modernisation\u201d of collective bargaining and industrial action.Pharmacy ownership, the designation of bakeries and the marketing of milk are also up for reform, all as recommended in a \u201ctoolkit\u201d from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.The statement from the euro summit stipulates that Greece will request continued IMF support from March 2016. This is another loss for Tsipras, who had reportedly resisted further IMF involvement in Greece\u2019s rescue.Greece has been told to get on with privatising its energy transmission network operator (ADMIE).Greece has been told to strengthen its financial sector, including taking \u201cdecisive action on non-performing loans\u201d and eliminating political interference. Athens has been told to depoliticise the Greek administration and to continue cutting the costs of public administration.", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Germany", "Angela Merkel", "Alexis Tsipras", "World news", "Financial sector", "Financial crisis", "European monetary union", "European banks", "European Union", "Europe", "Euro", "Currencies", "Business", "Banking", "European Central Bank", "Economics"], "title": "Greece bailout agreement: key points"},{"date": "2015-09-20T21:05:01Z", "content": "The second Greek general election of 2015 has resulted in a triumph for Alexis Tsipras.

Or, as her owner Angel Arredondo explained: \u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a diva.\u201dNo wonder: she\u2019s got people taking her picture where ever she goes, asking for selfies, even stopping cars and motorcycles abruptly to gawk at her magnificence. Miss Piggy would be justifiably jealous.Arredondo has had her a year and a half, ever since his girlfriend brought her home as a birthday gift. He thought it was a crazy idea but, within a few days, he was in love ... and so were all his neighbours.Walks are some of La Chata\u2019s favourite things, both because of the attention of strangers and to greet her friends, from the guys at the taco shop to the newsstand lady who sneaks her chips.She even has her own official artist, Ruben Ochoa, best known for (appropriately enough) Bestiary, a take on the seven deadly sins. Ochoa risks life and limb for that perfect photograph of La Chata crossing the road, getting a bath or scaring the neighborhood dogs, who aren\u2019t quite sure what those squeals and grunts mean.To follow La Chata\u2019s urban adventures (and you should), check her out on Instagram or Twitter: @LaChataPigMCUpdated\nat 12.46am GMT\n\n\n11.57pm GMT\n23:57\n\nMartin\u2019s incredible expedition around Mexico City\u2019s markets concludes in Tepito, at the Altar de Santa Muerte.Altar de Santa Muerte, Tipito. \"There's no good or bad, just faith\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/XM2PJsDwGoWe\u2019ve just been talking to the indomitable Do\u00f1a Queta, who set up the DF\u2019s biggest shrine to Santa Muerte in 2001.

Dog walker in La Condesa #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/JnVSC6oHlUMexico City\u2019s inhabitants love their dogs: the rise in income and education, along with people\u2019s choices to put off parenthood and have fewer children, have led to a boom in pet ownership. The city is home to as many as 3 million pet dogs; New York City, by comparison, has around 600,000.But all hasn\u2019t been well of late: a serial dog-killer was stalking the bushes of Parque M\u00e9xico in October, and poisoned 19 dogs in just four days. Police eventually arrested a 75-year-old resident, reportedly angry about off-leash dogs and unscooped poop, who was said to have spread tainted food in the underbrush.

Here are three key points from their \u201cmanifesto for the city\u201d:(1) Insecurity and violence against women continues to be the number one priority for women living in the city. This panel seeks urgent action to tackle society\u2019s tolerance of the harassment of women \u2013 in public and private spaces, including among those working within an official capacity \u2013 and to challenge women\u2019s representation as lesser, sexual objects in the mainstream media. (2) The absence of gender equality within the school curriculum is a huge concern. There is an urgent need for programmes (within both public and private schools) that teach all children about equality, rights, sexual choice, sexual health, diversity and respect. It must be a priority that women defending the rights of other women can carry out their work safely and securely. Any threats or violence against female human rights defenders \u2013 for example, the massacre in Navarte \u2013 must be a priority for the city\u2019s authorities. It must be dealt with transparently within the criminal justice system and not be played out in the media.(3) The vast majority of women in the city rely on public transport, where many feel vulnerable and unsafe. Women-only carriages will only be effective if they are properly controlled \u2013 and even then, they are only part of a solution. There must be long-term, effective public campaigns to eradicate sexual harassment, which must include messages about equality and respect from school-age onwards. A more detailed report on the discussion, and a full set of the recommendations arrived at, will be published later this week. MH\n\n9.52pm GMT\n21:52\n\nIt\u2019s a heady time for Mexican film-makers abroad. The country has bred the past two Academy Award winners for best director: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Gravity and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). And Emmanuel \u201cChivo\u201d Lubezki rode both those films to two consecutive Oscars for best cinematographer.Cuar\u00f3n and Lubezki have another thing in common: they both went to the prestigious CUEC film school of Mexico City.So we knew that challenging CUEC\u2019s first-year class to make a series of three-minute films about Mexico City would generate something interesting.On Friday, they screened the results for us. Here\u2019s one.I say again: first-year students. It\u2019s enough to make you hopeful that the days of judging Mexican directors by their Oscar haul are numbered. Though the students also had an axe to grind about how difficult it is to distribute independent Mexican films, even in Mexico. \u201cSo far from God, so close to the United States.\u201dMore to come.CMUpdated\nat 10.13pm GMT\n\n\n9.22pm GMT\n21:22\n\nMartin has spent some time with the migrants at La Merced market.Mexico City\u2019s been a magnet for migrants since the Revolution, and people are still coming from the countryside, to flee violence or find work.For no particular reason, these butchers at La Merced market broke into a chorus of \"\u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/fQLy24m7Z3...which quickly became a chant of \"\u00a1 Que viva Oaxaca!\" in honour of their home town #GuardianMexico\u201cIn the countryside there are no jobs, so we had to move,\u201d said Ricardo, who was selling calla lillies. \u201cI don\u2019t like Mexico City, but I had no choice.\u201dValeria selling jelly in La Merced market: \"Mexico City is pretty but I worry about insecurity here\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Gjc5a04e4JAnother woman, Elena, said she and her family had moved to the DF from Guerrero when their father was killed 40 years ago.Lu\u00eds + tripe: \"The best thing about Mexico City?

Marcelina herself moved here aged 14 to work as a live-in housekeeper, and worked as a domestic for 22 years \u2013 often in very difficult circumstances.Then in 2000, she set up the Centre for Support and Training of Domestic Workers (Caceh) \u2013 an employment rights association which recently converted into a fully-fledged union, becoming the first national union in Mexico to be run by domestic workers themselves.

It also turns the capital\u2019s 16 boroughs into entities similar to municipalities, with their own mayors and councils.The reform moves Mexico City \u2013 the area of nearly nine million people surrounded on three sides by the grungy suburbs of Mexico State \u2013 closer towards becoming a state in its own right.But analysts say the devil remains in the details, which will be enshrined in a new constitution.\u201cThis is an administrative reform more than anything,\u201d said Adri\u00e1n Rueda, local politics columnist in the Exc\u00e9lsior newspaper.Rueda expects the new constitution to keep the city\u2019s liberal provisions for same-sex marriages and decriminalized abortions (a procedure outlawed in more than half of Mexico\u2019s 31 states).Campaigners \u2013 mostly on the left \u2013 started pushing for an end to the Federal District after the devastating 1985 earthquake, after an inept federal response left millions to fend for themselves. Leftwing movements rose from the wreckage, achieved political reforms and won the first mayoral and assembly elections in 1997. They subsequently went about rebranding the capital, \u201cMexico City\u201d \u2013 at least informally \u2013 in an attempt at showing autonomy, says Il\u00e1n Semo, political historian at the Iberoamerican University.The name \u201cMexico City\u201d predates the country. And people in the provinces \u2013 often resentful of the capital in Mexico\u2019s heavily centralised system \u2013 refer to it simply as \u201cMexico\u201d.Some analysts warned of potential confusion caused by adding a capital called \u201cMexico City,\u201d to a country already named Mexico, whose biggest state is the \u201cState of Mexico\u201d.\u201cIt reflects our lack of imagination,\u201d said sociologist Rodolfo Soriano N\u00fa\u00f1ez, adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t build identity by decree.\u201dMexico City residents commonly call themselves, \u201cDefe\u00f1os\u201d, \u201cCapitalinos\u201d, and, \u201cChilangos\u201d, though memes appeared with new names such as, \u201cTraficalinos\u201d, a nod to the city\u2019s crushing traffic.Some say giving up the \u201cDF\u201d moniker will take time.\u201cIt will never stop being \u2018DF\u2019 in our daily language,\u201d said Juancho Nu\u00f1ez, a DJ and lifelong Mexico City resident.\u201cChilangos will always be \u2018Defectuoso\u2019,\u201d he added, referring to a word play combining \u201cdefective\u201d and \u201cDF\u201d.", "tags": ["Mexico", "World news", "Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Cities"], "title": "Mexico City officially changes its name to \u2013 Mexico City"},{"date": "2015-11-10T00:46:24Z", "content": "\n\n12.15am GMT\n00:15\n\nWe\u2019ve covered many a mile, set a new record for markets visited in one day, flown in a hot air balloon, located a large, tame pig, and had a fascinating and fruitful discussion about the future of the city for women.

Or, as her owner Angel Arredondo explained: \u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a diva.\u201dNo wonder: she\u2019s got people taking her picture where ever she goes, asking for selfies, even stopping cars and motorcycles abruptly to gawk at her magnificence. Miss Piggy would be justifiably jealous.Arredondo has had her a year and a half, ever since his girlfriend brought her home as a birthday gift. He thought it was a crazy idea but, within a few days, he was in love ... and so were all his neighbours.Walks are some of La Chata\u2019s favourite things, both because of the attention of strangers and to greet her friends, from the guys at the taco shop to the newsstand lady who sneaks her chips.She even has her own official artist, Ruben Ochoa, best known for (appropriately enough) Bestiary, a take on the seven deadly sins. Ochoa risks life and limb for that perfect photograph of La Chata crossing the road, getting a bath or scaring the neighborhood dogs, who aren\u2019t quite sure what those squeals and grunts mean.To follow La Chata\u2019s urban adventures (and you should), check her out on Instagram or Twitter: @LaChataPigMCUpdated\nat 12.46am GMT\n\n\n11.57pm GMT\n23:57\n\nMartin\u2019s incredible expedition around Mexico City\u2019s markets concludes in Tepito, at the Altar de Santa Muerte.Altar de Santa Muerte, Tipito. \"There's no good or bad, just faith\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/XM2PJsDwGoWe\u2019ve just been talking to the indomitable Do\u00f1a Queta, who set up the DF\u2019s biggest shrine to Santa Muerte in 2001.

The city is home to as many as 3 million pet dogs; New York City, by comparison, has around 600,000.But all hasn\u2019t been well of late: a serial dog-killer was stalking the bushes of Parque M\u00e9xico in October, and poisoned 19 dogs in just four days. Police eventually arrested a 75-year-old resident, reportedly angry about off-leash dogs and unscooped poop, who was said to have spread tainted food in the underbrush.

Here are three key points from their \u201cmanifesto for the city\u201d:(1) Insecurity and violence against women continues to be the number one priority for women living in the city. This panel seeks urgent action to tackle society\u2019s tolerance of the harassment of women \u2013 in public and private spaces, including among those working within an official capacity \u2013 and to challenge women\u2019s representation as lesser, sexual objects in the mainstream media. (2) The absence of gender equality within the school curriculum is a huge concern. There is an urgent need for programmes (within both public and private schools) that teach all children about equality, rights, sexual choice, sexual health, diversity and respect. It must be a priority that women defending the rights of other women can carry out their work safely and securely. Any threats or violence against female human rights defenders \u2013 for example, the massacre in Navarte \u2013 must be a priority for the city\u2019s authorities. It must be dealt with transparently within the criminal justice system and not be played out in the media.(3) The vast majority of women in the city rely on public transport, where many feel vulnerable and unsafe. Women-only carriages will only be effective if they are properly controlled \u2013 and even then, they are only part of a solution. There must be long-term, effective public campaigns to eradicate sexual harassment, which must include messages about equality and respect from school-age onwards. A more detailed report on the discussion, and a full set of the recommendations arrived at, will be published later this week. MH\n\n9.52pm GMT\n21:52\n\nIt\u2019s a heady time for Mexican film-makers abroad. The country has bred the past two Academy Award winners for best director: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Gravity and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). And Emmanuel \u201cChivo\u201d Lubezki rode both those films to two consecutive Oscars for best cinematographer.Cuar\u00f3n and Lubezki have another thing in common: they both went to the prestigious CUEC film school of Mexico City.So we knew that challenging CUEC\u2019s first-year class to make a series of three-minute films about Mexico City would generate something interesting.On Friday, they screened the results for us. Here\u2019s one.I say again: first-year students. It\u2019s enough to make you hopeful that the days of judging Mexican directors by their Oscar haul are numbered. Though the students also had an axe to grind about how difficult it is to distribute independent Mexican films, even in Mexico. \u201cSo far from God, so close to the United States.\u201dMore to come.CMUpdated\nat 10.13pm GMT\n\n\n9.22pm GMT\n21:22\n\nMartin has spent some time with the migrants at La Merced market.Mexico City\u2019s been a magnet for migrants since the Revolution, and people are still coming from the countryside, to flee violence or find work.For no particular reason, these butchers at La Merced market broke into a chorus of \"\u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/fQLy24m7Z3...which quickly became a chant of \"\u00a1 Que viva Oaxaca!\" in honour of their home town #GuardianMexico\u201cIn the countryside there are no jobs, so we had to move,\u201d said Ricardo, who was selling calla lillies. \u201cI don\u2019t like Mexico City, but I had no choice.\u201dValeria selling jelly in La Merced market: \"Mexico City is pretty but I worry about insecurity here\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Gjc5a04e4JAnother woman, Elena, said she and her family had moved to the DF from Guerrero when their father was killed 40 years ago.Lu\u00eds + tripe: \"The best thing about Mexico City?

Too many people\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/YZ6TwjIMcBBut what\u2019s striking is how migrants hold on to their identity: even though Elena has never been back to her home state, she still called herself a Guerrerense.Rosa, who was selling potatoes and tomatoes in a corner of the Merced market, is a member of the Mazahua indigenous group. She moved to the city from Michoac\u00e1n when she was five years old; she\u2019s 55 now, but doesn\u2019t consider herself a chilango and still speaks Mazahua at home. \u201cYou don\u2019t give up who you are just because you move.\u201dGabby and Anna-Maria selling nopal cactus in La Merced market. #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Yi5jCtr1htGabby (above) and Alejandro moved from Oaxaca six years ago in search of work, but now that their daughter, Anna Maria (pictured) is starting to grow, they\u2019re thinking of heading back. \u201cWhen we were younger there was no work in Oaxaca, but things are starting to change now, so we\u2019d like to go back home.

Here are some photos to make your collective mouths water ...This indescribably delicious dish is a persimmon salad, mixed with reques\u00f3n cheese (a type of ricotta), all manner of herbs (sorrel, shiso, mint, tarragon), plus pistachios for added crunch. Personally, I don\u2019t ever remember trying a persimmon before, and now I have, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to look at a tomato the same way again.And this is an octopus rushed here fresh from Campeche, a state on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, then accompanied by chickpeas, coriander and purslane.There is desert too, but I honestly think it would be cruel to show you a photo of it \u2013 so I\u2019ll just tell you the ingredients and let you imagine for yourself:Red mole sauce with chocolate in a peanut ice cream, dressed with caramelised peanuts with salt, toasted corn and \u2013 who\u2019d have thought it? \u2013 lemon thyme.

Marcelina herself moved here aged 14 to work as a live-in housekeeper, and worked as a domestic for 22 years \u2013 often in very difficult circumstances.Then in 2000, she set up the Centre for Support and Training of Domestic Workers (Caceh) \u2013 an employment rights association which recently converted into a fully-fledged union, becoming the first national union in Mexico to be run by domestic workers themselves.

By far the best place to swim in town, La Punta is centred on a street of cafes, surf shops, hostels and restaurants. Caba\u00f1as Buena Onda (bed in dorms from about \u00a34) is a simple hostel on the beach offering individual huts, dormitories and tents. The palm trees provide much-needed shade, a place to sling a hammock, and give the place an authentic, jungle feel.

The sand is soft, the palm trees sway, the waves are huge and endless. Sunset sees serious surfers share the evening with traditional dancers and music. Hemmed in by cliffs, it has resisted major development and yet found space for cosmopolitan restaurants and luxury and budget accommodation by the beach and on a hillside - at the budget end Posada Paloma (doubles from \u00a317) and El Recinto del Viento (doubles from \u00a312) are superb.

It also turns the capital\u2019s 16 boroughs into entities similar to municipalities, with their own mayors and councils.The reform moves Mexico City \u2013 the area of nearly nine million people surrounded on three sides by the grungy suburbs of Mexico State \u2013 closer towards becoming a state in its own right.But analysts say the devil remains in the details, which will be enshrined in a new constitution.\u201cThis is an administrative reform more than anything,\u201d said Adri\u00e1n Rueda, local politics columnist in the Exc\u00e9lsior newspaper.Rueda expects the new constitution to keep the city\u2019s liberal provisions for same-sex marriages and decriminalized abortions (a procedure outlawed in more than half of Mexico\u2019s 31 states).Campaigners \u2013 mostly on the left \u2013 started pushing for an end to the Federal District after the devastating 1985 earthquake, after an inept federal response left millions to fend for themselves.

Or, as her owner Angel Arredondo explained: \u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a diva.\u201dNo wonder: she\u2019s got people taking her picture where ever she goes, asking for selfies, even stopping cars and motorcycles abruptly to gawk at her magnificence. Miss Piggy would be justifiably jealous.Arredondo has had her a year and a half, ever since his girlfriend brought her home as a birthday gift. He thought it was a crazy idea but, within a few days, he was in love ... and so were all his neighbours.Walks are some of La Chata\u2019s favourite things, both because of the attention of strangers and to greet her friends, from the guys at the taco shop to the newsstand lady who sneaks her chips.She even has her own official artist, Ruben Ochoa, best known for (appropriately enough) Bestiary, a take on the seven deadly sins. Ochoa risks life and limb for that perfect photograph of La Chata crossing the road, getting a bath or scaring the neighborhood dogs, who aren\u2019t quite sure what those squeals and grunts mean.To follow La Chata\u2019s urban adventures (and you should), check her out on Instagram or Twitter: @LaChataPigMCUpdated\nat 12.46am GMT\n\n\n11.57pm GMT\n23:57\n\nMartin\u2019s incredible expedition around Mexico City\u2019s markets concludes in Tepito, at the Altar de Santa Muerte.Altar de Santa Muerte, Tipito. \"There's no good or bad, just faith\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/XM2PJsDwGoWe\u2019ve just been talking to the indomitable Do\u00f1a Queta, who set up the DF\u2019s biggest shrine to Santa Muerte in 2001.

Here are three key points from their \u201cmanifesto for the city\u201d:(1) Insecurity and violence against women continues to be the number one priority for women living in the city. This panel seeks urgent action to tackle society\u2019s tolerance of the harassment of women \u2013 in public and private spaces, including among those working within an official capacity \u2013 and to challenge women\u2019s representation as lesser, sexual objects in the mainstream media. (2) The absence of gender equality within the school curriculum is a huge concern. There is an urgent need for programmes (within both public and private schools) that teach all children about equality, rights, sexual choice, sexual health, diversity and respect. It must be a priority that women defending the rights of other women can carry out their work safely and securely. Any threats or violence against female human rights defenders \u2013 for example, the massacre in Navarte \u2013 must be a priority for the city\u2019s authorities. It must be dealt with transparently within the criminal justice system and not be played out in the media.(3) The vast majority of women in the city rely on public transport, where many feel vulnerable and unsafe. Women-only carriages will only be effective if they are properly controlled \u2013 and even then, they are only part of a solution. There must be long-term, effective public campaigns to eradicate sexual harassment, which must include messages about equality and respect from school-age onwards. A more detailed report on the discussion, and a full set of the recommendations arrived at, will be published later this week. MH\n\n9.52pm GMT\n21:52\n\nIt\u2019s a heady time for Mexican film-makers abroad. The country has bred the past two Academy Award winners for best director: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Gravity and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). And Emmanuel \u201cChivo\u201d Lubezki rode both those films to two consecutive Oscars for best cinematographer.Cuar\u00f3n and Lubezki have another thing in common: they both went to the prestigious CUEC film school of Mexico City.So we knew that challenging CUEC\u2019s first-year class to make a series of three-minute films about Mexico City would generate something interesting.On Friday, they screened the results for us. Here\u2019s one.I say again: first-year students. It\u2019s enough to make you hopeful that the days of judging Mexican directors by their Oscar haul are numbered. Though the students also had an axe to grind about how difficult it is to distribute independent Mexican films, even in Mexico. \u201cSo far from God, so close to the United States.\u201dMore to come.CMUpdated\nat 10.13pm GMT\n\n\n9.22pm GMT\n21:22\n\nMartin has spent some time with the migrants at La Merced market.Mexico City\u2019s been a magnet for migrants since the Revolution, and people are still coming from the countryside, to flee violence or find work.For no particular reason, these butchers at La Merced market broke into a chorus of \"\u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/fQLy24m7Z3...which quickly became a chant of \"\u00a1 Que viva Oaxaca!\" in honour of their home town #GuardianMexico\u201cIn the countryside there are no jobs, so we had to move,\u201d said Ricardo, who was selling calla lillies. \u201cI don\u2019t like Mexico City, but I had no choice.\u201dValeria selling jelly in La Merced market: \"Mexico City is pretty but I worry about insecurity here\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Gjc5a04e4JAnother woman, Elena, said she and her family had moved to the DF from Guerrero when their father was killed 40 years ago.Lu\u00eds + tripe: \"The best thing about Mexico City?

Marcelina herself moved here aged 14 to work as a live-in housekeeper, and worked as a domestic for 22 years \u2013 often in very difficult circumstances.Then in 2000, she set up the Centre for Support and Training of Domestic Workers (Caceh) \u2013 an employment rights association which recently converted into a fully-fledged union, becoming the first national union in Mexico to be run by domestic workers themselves.

It also turns the capital\u2019s 16 boroughs into entities similar to municipalities, with their own mayors and councils.The reform moves Mexico City \u2013 the area of nearly nine million people surrounded on three sides by the grungy suburbs of Mexico State \u2013 closer towards becoming a state in its own right.But analysts say the devil remains in the details, which will be enshrined in a new constitution.\u201cThis is an administrative reform more than anything,\u201d said Adri\u00e1n Rueda, local politics columnist in the Exc\u00e9lsior newspaper.Rueda expects the new constitution to keep the city\u2019s liberal provisions for same-sex marriages and decriminalized abortions (a procedure outlawed in more than half of Mexico\u2019s 31 states).Campaigners \u2013 mostly on the left \u2013 started pushing for an end to the Federal District after the devastating 1985 earthquake, after an inept federal response left millions to fend for themselves. Leftwing movements rose from the wreckage, achieved political reforms and won the first mayoral and assembly elections in 1997. They subsequently went about rebranding the capital, \u201cMexico City\u201d \u2013 at least informally \u2013 in an attempt at showing autonomy, says Il\u00e1n Semo, political historian at the Iberoamerican University.The name \u201cMexico City\u201d predates the country. And people in the provinces \u2013 often resentful of the capital in Mexico\u2019s heavily centralised system \u2013 refer to it simply as \u201cMexico\u201d.Some analysts warned of potential confusion caused by adding a capital called \u201cMexico City,\u201d to a country already named Mexico, whose biggest state is the \u201cState of Mexico\u201d.\u201cIt reflects our lack of imagination,\u201d said sociologist Rodolfo Soriano N\u00fa\u00f1ez, adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t build identity by decree.\u201dMexico City residents commonly call themselves, \u201cDefe\u00f1os\u201d, \u201cCapitalinos\u201d, and, \u201cChilangos\u201d, though memes appeared with new names such as, \u201cTraficalinos\u201d, a nod to the city\u2019s crushing traffic.Some say giving up the \u201cDF\u201d moniker will take time.\u201cIt will never stop being \u2018DF\u2019 in our daily language,\u201d said Juancho Nu\u00f1ez, a DJ and lifelong Mexico City resident.\u201cChilangos will always be \u2018Defectuoso\u2019,\u201d he added, referring to a word play combining \u201cdefective\u201d and \u201cDF\u201d.", "tags": ["Mexico", "World news", "Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Cities"], "title": "Mexico City officially changes its name to \u2013 Mexico City"},{"date": "2015-11-10T00:46:24Z", "content": "\n\n12.15am GMT\n00:15\n\nWe\u2019ve covered many a mile, set a new record for markets visited in one day, flown in a hot air balloon, located a large, tame pig, and had a fascinating and fruitful discussion about the future of the city for women.

Or, as her owner Angel Arredondo explained: \u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a diva.\u201dNo wonder: she\u2019s got people taking her picture where ever she goes, asking for selfies, even stopping cars and motorcycles abruptly to gawk at her magnificence. Miss Piggy would be justifiably jealous.Arredondo has had her a year and a half, ever since his girlfriend brought her home as a birthday gift. He thought it was a crazy idea but, within a few days, he was in love ... and so were all his neighbours.Walks are some of La Chata\u2019s favourite things, both because of the attention of strangers and to greet her friends, from the guys at the taco shop to the newsstand lady who sneaks her chips.She even has her own official artist, Ruben Ochoa, best known for (appropriately enough) Bestiary, a take on the seven deadly sins. Ochoa risks life and limb for that perfect photograph of La Chata crossing the road, getting a bath or scaring the neighborhood dogs, who aren\u2019t quite sure what those squeals and grunts mean.To follow La Chata\u2019s urban adventures (and you should), check her out on Instagram or Twitter: @LaChataPigMCUpdated\nat 12.46am GMT\n\n\n11.57pm GMT\n23:57\n\nMartin\u2019s incredible expedition around Mexico City\u2019s markets concludes in Tepito, at the Altar de Santa Muerte.Altar de Santa Muerte, Tipito. \"There's no good or bad, just faith\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/XM2PJsDwGoWe\u2019ve just been talking to the indomitable Do\u00f1a Queta, who set up the DF\u2019s biggest shrine to Santa Muerte in 2001. It\u2019s in Tepito, a neighbourhood best known as Mexico City\u2019s most dangerous.The shrine itself is pretty modest : behind polished glass stands a skeleton dressed in white satin \u2013 La Flaca (the skinny lady). Every first of the month, thousands crowd into the street outside Do\u00f1a Queta\u2019s house to pay their respects.\u201cThe church doesn\u2019t like us, but we live in a free country and we can do whatever we like,\u201d she said. \u201cDios es el mas chignon.\u201d Loosely translated: God is the baddest motherfucker.\"A civilization which denies death ends up denying life\" - Octavio Paz, the Labyrinth of Solitude #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/7dosb7J8zdUpdated\nat 4.00pm GMT\n\n\n11.24pm GMT\n23:24\n\nOn the border between La Condesa and Roma lies Parque M\u00e9xico.

Dog walker in La Condesa #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/JnVSC6oHlUMexico City\u2019s inhabitants love their dogs: the rise in income and education, along with people\u2019s choices to put off parenthood and have fewer children, have led to a boom in pet ownership. The city is home to as many as 3 million pet dogs; New York City, by comparison, has around 600,000.But all hasn\u2019t been well of late: a serial dog-killer was stalking the bushes of Parque M\u00e9xico in October, and poisoned 19 dogs in just four days. Police eventually arrested a 75-year-old resident, reportedly angry about off-leash dogs and unscooped poop, who was said to have spread tainted food in the underbrush. (The suspect has reportedly since been released.)

It\u2019s the worst barbarity. But most people are indifferent because they\u2019re too focused on their daily lives,\u201d said one protester, Victor.Twenty-eight thousand people have officially disappeared since 2006, but the real figure is thought to be much higher: mass graves are discovered with depressing regularity. Activists in Mexico City calculate that around 1,000 women disappear in the capital every year.Updated\nat 11.17pm GMT\n\n\n10.25pm GMT\n22:25\n\nToday\u2019s discussion at the Frida Kahlo Museum culminated in our all-female panel (of all ages and backgrounds) drawing up a set of recommendations for the city\u2019s authorities. Here are three key points from their \u201cmanifesto for the city\u201d:(1) Insecurity and violence against women continues to be the number one priority for women living in the city. This panel seeks urgent action to tackle society\u2019s tolerance of the harassment of women \u2013 in public and private spaces, including among those working within an official capacity \u2013 and to challenge women\u2019s representation as lesser, sexual objects in the mainstream media. (2) The absence of gender equality within the school curriculum is a huge concern. There is an urgent need for programmes (within both public and private schools) that teach all children about equality, rights, sexual choice, sexual health, diversity and respect. It must be a priority that women defending the rights of other women can carry out their work safely and securely. Any threats or violence against female human rights defenders \u2013 for example, the massacre in Navarte \u2013 must be a priority for the city\u2019s authorities. It must be dealt with transparently within the criminal justice system and not be played out in the media.(3) The vast majority of women in the city rely on public transport, where many feel vulnerable and unsafe. Women-only carriages will only be effective if they are properly controlled \u2013 and even then, they are only part of a solution. There must be long-term, effective public campaigns to eradicate sexual harassment, which must include messages about equality and respect from school-age onwards. A more detailed report on the discussion, and a full set of the recommendations arrived at, will be published later this week. MH\n\n9.52pm GMT\n21:52\n\nIt\u2019s a heady time for Mexican film-makers abroad. The country has bred the past two Academy Award winners for best director: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Gravity and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). And Emmanuel \u201cChivo\u201d Lubezki rode both those films to two consecutive Oscars for best cinematographer.Cuar\u00f3n and Lubezki have another thing in common: they both went to the prestigious CUEC film school of Mexico City.So we knew that challenging CUEC\u2019s first-year class to make a series of three-minute films about Mexico City would generate something interesting.On Friday, they screened the results for us. Here\u2019s one.I say again: first-year students. It\u2019s enough to make you hopeful that the days of judging Mexican directors by their Oscar haul are numbered. Though the students also had an axe to grind about how difficult it is to distribute independent Mexican films, even in Mexico. \u201cSo far from God, so close to the United States.\u201dMore to come.CMUpdated\nat 10.13pm GMT\n\n\n9.22pm GMT\n21:22\n\nMartin has spent some time with the migrants at La Merced market.Mexico City\u2019s been a magnet for migrants since the Revolution, and people are still coming from the countryside, to flee violence or find work.For no particular reason, these butchers at La Merced market broke into a chorus of \"\u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/fQLy24m7Z3...which quickly became a chant of \"\u00a1 Que viva Oaxaca!\" in honour of their home town #GuardianMexico\u201cIn the countryside there are no jobs, so we had to move,\u201d said Ricardo, who was selling calla lillies. \u201cI don\u2019t like Mexico City, but I had no choice.\u201dValeria selling jelly in La Merced market: \"Mexico City is pretty but I worry about insecurity here\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Gjc5a04e4JAnother woman, Elena, said she and her family had moved to the DF from Guerrero when their father was killed 40 years ago.Lu\u00eds + tripe: \"The best thing about Mexico City?

Too many people\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/YZ6TwjIMcBBut what\u2019s striking is how migrants hold on to their identity: even though Elena has never been back to her home state, she still called herself a Guerrerense.Rosa, who was selling potatoes and tomatoes in a corner of the Merced market, is a member of the Mazahua indigenous group. She moved to the city from Michoac\u00e1n when she was five years old; she\u2019s 55 now, but doesn\u2019t consider herself a chilango and still speaks Mazahua at home. \u201cYou don\u2019t give up who you are just because you move.\u201dGabby and Anna-Maria selling nopal cactus in La Merced market. #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Yi5jCtr1htGabby (above) and Alejandro moved from Oaxaca six years ago in search of work, but now that their daughter, Anna Maria (pictured) is starting to grow, they\u2019re thinking of heading back. \u201cWhen we were younger there was no work in Oaxaca, but things are starting to change now, so we\u2019d like to go back home.

Here are some photos to make your collective mouths water ...This indescribably delicious dish is a persimmon salad, mixed with reques\u00f3n cheese (a type of ricotta), all manner of herbs (sorrel, shiso, mint, tarragon), plus pistachios for added crunch. Personally, I don\u2019t ever remember trying a persimmon before, and now I have, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to look at a tomato the same way again.And this is an octopus rushed here fresh from Campeche, a state on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, then accompanied by chickpeas, coriander and purslane.There is desert too, but I honestly think it would be cruel to show you a photo of it \u2013 so I\u2019ll just tell you the ingredients and let you imagine for yourself:Red mole sauce with chocolate in a peanut ice cream, dressed with caramelised peanuts with salt, toasted corn and \u2013 who\u2019d have thought it? \u2013 lemon thyme. Heaven. MH\n\n8.24pm GMT\n20:24\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy switching between different locations and subjects across Mexico City today. We want to capture all the excitement of being in the city, but we\u2019re also feeling pretty serious about some of the tough conversations that have been had by our guests at the Frida Kahlo Museum today.Some of Mexico City's most influential women @museofridakahlo discussing challenges for women in DF #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/xWZNJXLqMTWe will certainly follow up on some of the important points that have been made \u2013 for example, we\u2019ll talk at length to Marcelina Bautista and other (anonymous) domestic workers this week about their often gruelling experiences of life in Mexico City. Marcelina herself moved here aged 14 to work as a live-in housekeeper, and worked as a domestic for 22 years \u2013 often in very difficult circumstances.Then in 2000, she set up the Centre for Support and Training of Domestic Workers (Caceh) \u2013 an employment rights association which recently converted into a fully-fledged union, becoming the first national union in Mexico to be run by domestic workers themselves. It\u2019s been an honour to have her and the rest of this eminent group of Mexico City women sharing their experiences with us today.

By far the best place to swim in town, La Punta is centred on a street of cafes, surf shops, hostels and restaurants. Caba\u00f1as Buena Onda (bed in dorms from about \u00a34) is a simple hostel on the beach offering individual huts, dormitories and tents. The palm trees provide much-needed shade, a place to sling a hammock, and give the place an authentic, jungle feel.

Hemmed in by cliffs, it has resisted major development and yet found space for cosmopolitan restaurants and luxury and budget accommodation by the beach and on a hillside - at the budget end Posada Paloma (doubles from \u00a317) and El Recinto del Viento (doubles from \u00a312) are superb.

We stayed at the Secret Garden Tulum Hotel (doubles from \u00a363) which offers a green oasis at reasonable prices. For a dip there are natural limestone pools nearby \u2013 and the warm Caribbean sea of course.Keen123Playa Las Gatas, three miles south of the Zihuatanejo on the Pacific coast, is accessible only by boat or a treacherous pathway, so getting there always seems like an adventure.

It also turns the capital\u2019s 16 boroughs into entities similar to municipalities, with their own mayors and councils.The reform moves Mexico City \u2013 the area of nearly nine million people surrounded on three sides by the grungy suburbs of Mexico State \u2013 closer towards becoming a state in its own right.But analysts say the devil remains in the details, which will be enshrined in a new constitution.\u201cThis is an administrative reform more than anything,\u201d said Adri\u00e1n Rueda, local politics columnist in the Exc\u00e9lsior newspaper.Rueda expects the new constitution to keep the city\u2019s liberal provisions for same-sex marriages and decriminalized abortions (a procedure outlawed in more than half of Mexico\u2019s 31 states).Campaigners \u2013 mostly on the left \u2013 started pushing for an end to the Federal District after the devastating 1985 earthquake, after an inept federal response left millions to fend for themselves.

Or, as her owner Angel Arredondo explained: \u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a diva.\u201dNo wonder: she\u2019s got people taking her picture where ever she goes, asking for selfies, even stopping cars and motorcycles abruptly to gawk at her magnificence. Miss Piggy would be justifiably jealous.Arredondo has had her a year and a half, ever since his girlfriend brought her home as a birthday gift. He thought it was a crazy idea but, within a few days, he was in love ... and so were all his neighbours.Walks are some of La Chata\u2019s favourite things, both because of the attention of strangers and to greet her friends, from the guys at the taco shop to the newsstand lady who sneaks her chips.She even has her own official artist, Ruben Ochoa, best known for (appropriately enough) Bestiary, a take on the seven deadly sins. Ochoa risks life and limb for that perfect photograph of La Chata crossing the road, getting a bath or scaring the neighborhood dogs, who aren\u2019t quite sure what those squeals and grunts mean.To follow La Chata\u2019s urban adventures (and you should), check her out on Instagram or Twitter: @LaChataPigMCUpdated\nat 12.46am GMT\n\n\n11.57pm GMT\n23:57\n\nMartin\u2019s incredible expedition around Mexico City\u2019s markets concludes in Tepito, at the Altar de Santa Muerte.Altar de Santa Muerte, Tipito. \"There's no good or bad, just faith\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/XM2PJsDwGoWe\u2019ve just been talking to the indomitable Do\u00f1a Queta, who set up the DF\u2019s biggest shrine to Santa Muerte in 2001.

The city is home to as many as 3 million pet dogs; New York City, by comparison, has around 600,000.But all hasn\u2019t been well of late: a serial dog-killer was stalking the bushes of Parque M\u00e9xico in October, and poisoned 19 dogs in just four days.

Here are three key points from their \u201cmanifesto for the city\u201d:(1) Insecurity and violence against women continues to be the number one priority for women living in the city. This panel seeks urgent action to tackle society\u2019s tolerance of the harassment of women \u2013 in public and private spaces, including among those working within an official capacity \u2013 and to challenge women\u2019s representation as lesser, sexual objects in the mainstream media. (2) The absence of gender equality within the school curriculum is a huge concern. There is an urgent need for programmes (within both public and private schools) that teach all children about equality, rights, sexual choice, sexual health, diversity and respect. It must be a priority that women defending the rights of other women can carry out their work safely and securely. Any threats or violence against female human rights defenders \u2013 for example, the massacre in Navarte \u2013 must be a priority for the city\u2019s authorities. It must be dealt with transparently within the criminal justice system and not be played out in the media.(3) The vast majority of women in the city rely on public transport, where many feel vulnerable and unsafe. Women-only carriages will only be effective if they are properly controlled \u2013 and even then, they are only part of a solution. There must be long-term, effective public campaigns to eradicate sexual harassment, which must include messages about equality and respect from school-age onwards. A more detailed report on the discussion, and a full set of the recommendations arrived at, will be published later this week. MH\n\n9.52pm GMT\n21:52\n\nIt\u2019s a heady time for Mexican film-makers abroad. The country has bred the past two Academy Award winners for best director: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Gravity and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). And Emmanuel \u201cChivo\u201d Lubezki rode both those films to two consecutive Oscars for best cinematographer.Cuar\u00f3n and Lubezki have another thing in common: they both went to the prestigious CUEC film school of Mexico City.So we knew that challenging CUEC\u2019s first-year class to make a series of three-minute films about Mexico City would generate something interesting.On Friday, they screened the results for us. Here\u2019s one.I say again: first-year students. It\u2019s enough to make you hopeful that the days of judging Mexican directors by their Oscar haul are numbered. Though the students also had an axe to grind about how difficult it is to distribute independent Mexican films, even in Mexico. \u201cSo far from God, so close to the United States.\u201dMore to come.CMUpdated\nat 10.13pm GMT\n\n\n9.22pm GMT\n21:22\n\nMartin has spent some time with the migrants at La Merced market.Mexico City\u2019s been a magnet for migrants since the Revolution, and people are still coming from the countryside, to flee violence or find work.For no particular reason, these butchers at La Merced market broke into a chorus of \"\u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/fQLy24m7Z3...which quickly became a chant of \"\u00a1 Que viva Oaxaca!\" in honour of their home town #GuardianMexico\u201cIn the countryside there are no jobs, so we had to move,\u201d said Ricardo, who was selling calla lillies. \u201cI don\u2019t like Mexico City, but I had no choice.\u201dValeria selling jelly in La Merced market: \"Mexico City is pretty but I worry about insecurity here\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Gjc5a04e4JAnother woman, Elena, said she and her family had moved to the DF from Guerrero when their father was killed 40 years ago.Lu\u00eds + tripe: \"The best thing about Mexico City?

She moved to the city from Michoac\u00e1n when she was five years old; she\u2019s 55 now, but doesn\u2019t consider herself a chilango and still speaks Mazahua at home. \u201cYou don\u2019t give up who you are just because you move.\u201dGabby and Anna-Maria selling nopal cactus in La Merced market. #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Yi5jCtr1htGabby (above) and Alejandro moved from Oaxaca six years ago in search of work, but now that their daughter, Anna Maria (pictured) is starting to grow, they\u2019re thinking of heading back. \u201cWhen we were younger there was no work in Oaxaca, but things are starting to change now, so we\u2019d like to go back home.

Marcelina herself moved here aged 14 to work as a live-in housekeeper, and worked as a domestic for 22 years \u2013 often in very difficult circumstances.Then in 2000, she set up the Centre for Support and Training of Domestic Workers (Caceh) \u2013 an employment rights association which recently converted into a fully-fledged union, becoming the first national union in Mexico to be run by domestic workers themselves.

It also turns the capital\u2019s 16 boroughs into entities similar to municipalities, with their own mayors and councils.The reform moves Mexico City \u2013 the area of nearly nine million people surrounded on three sides by the grungy suburbs of Mexico State \u2013 closer towards becoming a state in its own right.But analysts say the devil remains in the details, which will be enshrined in a new constitution.\u201cThis is an administrative reform more than anything,\u201d said Adri\u00e1n Rueda, local politics columnist in the Exc\u00e9lsior newspaper.Rueda expects the new constitution to keep the city\u2019s liberal provisions for same-sex marriages and decriminalized abortions (a procedure outlawed in more than half of Mexico\u2019s 31 states).Campaigners \u2013 mostly on the left \u2013 started pushing for an end to the Federal District after the devastating 1985 earthquake, after an inept federal response left millions to fend for themselves.

They subsequently went about rebranding the capital, \u201cMexico City\u201d \u2013 at least informally \u2013 in an attempt at showing autonomy, says Il\u00e1n Semo, political historian at the Iberoamerican University.The name \u201cMexico City\u201d predates the country.

Or, as her owner Angel Arredondo explained: \u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a diva.\u201dNo wonder: she\u2019s got people taking her picture where ever she goes, asking for selfies, even stopping cars and motorcycles abruptly to gawk at her magnificence. Miss Piggy would be justifiably jealous.Arredondo has had her a year and a half, ever since his girlfriend brought her home as a birthday gift. He thought it was a crazy idea but, within a few days, he was in love ... and so were all his neighbours.Walks are some of La Chata\u2019s favourite things, both because of the attention of strangers and to greet her friends, from the guys at the taco shop to the newsstand lady who sneaks her chips.She even has her own official artist, Ruben Ochoa, best known for (appropriately enough) Bestiary, a take on the seven deadly sins. Ochoa risks life and limb for that perfect photograph of La Chata crossing the road, getting a bath or scaring the neighborhood dogs, who aren\u2019t quite sure what those squeals and grunts mean.To follow La Chata\u2019s urban adventures (and you should), check her out on Instagram or Twitter: @LaChataPigMCUpdated\nat 12.46am GMT\n\n\n11.57pm GMT\n23:57\n\nMartin\u2019s incredible expedition around Mexico City\u2019s markets concludes in Tepito, at the Altar de Santa Muerte.Altar de Santa Muerte, Tipito. \"There's no good or bad, just faith\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/XM2PJsDwGoWe\u2019ve just been talking to the indomitable Do\u00f1a Queta, who set up the DF\u2019s biggest shrine to Santa Muerte in 2001.

The city is home to as many as 3 million pet dogs; New York City, by comparison, has around 600,000.But all hasn\u2019t been well of late: a serial dog-killer was stalking the bushes of Parque M\u00e9xico in October, and poisoned 19 dogs in just four days.

Here are three key points from their \u201cmanifesto for the city\u201d:(1) Insecurity and violence against women continues to be the number one priority for women living in the city. This panel seeks urgent action to tackle society\u2019s tolerance of the harassment of women \u2013 in public and private spaces, including among those working within an official capacity \u2013 and to challenge women\u2019s representation as lesser, sexual objects in the mainstream media. (2) The absence of gender equality within the school curriculum is a huge concern. There is an urgent need for programmes (within both public and private schools) that teach all children about equality, rights, sexual choice, sexual health, diversity and respect. It must be a priority that women defending the rights of other women can carry out their work safely and securely. Any threats or violence against female human rights defenders \u2013 for example, the massacre in Navarte \u2013 must be a priority for the city\u2019s authorities. It must be dealt with transparently within the criminal justice system and not be played out in the media.(3) The vast majority of women in the city rely on public transport, where many feel vulnerable and unsafe. Women-only carriages will only be effective if they are properly controlled \u2013 and even then, they are only part of a solution. There must be long-term, effective public campaigns to eradicate sexual harassment, which must include messages about equality and respect from school-age onwards. A more detailed report on the discussion, and a full set of the recommendations arrived at, will be published later this week. MH\n\n9.52pm GMT\n21:52\n\nIt\u2019s a heady time for Mexican film-makers abroad. The country has bred the past two Academy Award winners for best director: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Gravity and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). And Emmanuel \u201cChivo\u201d Lubezki rode both those films to two consecutive Oscars for best cinematographer.Cuar\u00f3n and Lubezki have another thing in common: they both went to the prestigious CUEC film school of Mexico City.So we knew that challenging CUEC\u2019s first-year class to make a series of three-minute films about Mexico City would generate something interesting.On Friday, they screened the results for us. Here\u2019s one.I say again: first-year students. It\u2019s enough to make you hopeful that the days of judging Mexican directors by their Oscar haul are numbered. Though the students also had an axe to grind about how difficult it is to distribute independent Mexican films, even in Mexico. \u201cSo far from God, so close to the United States.\u201dMore to come.CMUpdated\nat 10.13pm GMT\n\n\n9.22pm GMT\n21:22\n\nMartin has spent some time with the migrants at La Merced market.Mexico City\u2019s been a magnet for migrants since the Revolution, and people are still coming from the countryside, to flee violence or find work.For no particular reason, these butchers at La Merced market broke into a chorus of \"\u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/fQLy24m7Z3...which quickly became a chant of \"\u00a1 Que viva Oaxaca!\" in honour of their home town #GuardianMexico\u201cIn the countryside there are no jobs, so we had to move,\u201d said Ricardo, who was selling calla lillies. \u201cI don\u2019t like Mexico City, but I had no choice.\u201dValeria selling jelly in La Merced market: \"Mexico City is pretty but I worry about insecurity here\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Gjc5a04e4JAnother woman, Elena, said she and her family had moved to the DF from Guerrero when their father was killed 40 years ago.Lu\u00eds + tripe: \"The best thing about Mexico City?

She moved to the city from Michoac\u00e1n when she was five years old; she\u2019s 55 now, but doesn\u2019t consider herself a chilango and still speaks Mazahua at home. \u201cYou don\u2019t give up who you are just because you move.\u201dGabby and Anna-Maria selling nopal cactus in La Merced market. #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Yi5jCtr1htGabby (above) and Alejandro moved from Oaxaca six years ago in search of work, but now that their daughter, Anna Maria (pictured) is starting to grow, they\u2019re thinking of heading back. \u201cWhen we were younger there was no work in Oaxaca, but things are starting to change now, so we\u2019d like to go back home.

Personally, I don\u2019t ever remember trying a persimmon before, and now I have, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to look at a tomato the same way again.And this is an octopus rushed here fresh from Campeche, a state on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, then accompanied by chickpeas, coriander and purslane.There is desert too, but I honestly think it would be cruel to show you a photo of it \u2013 so I\u2019ll just tell you the ingredients and let you imagine for yourself:Red mole sauce with chocolate in a peanut ice cream, dressed with caramelised peanuts with salt, toasted corn and \u2013 who\u2019d have thought it? \u2013 lemon thyme.

Marcelina herself moved here aged 14 to work as a live-in housekeeper, and worked as a domestic for 22 years \u2013 often in very difficult circumstances.Then in 2000, she set up the Centre for Support and Training of Domestic Workers (Caceh) \u2013 an employment rights association which recently converted into a fully-fledged union, becoming the first national union in Mexico to be run by domestic workers themselves.

By far the best place to swim in town, La Punta is centred on a street of cafes, surf shops, hostels and restaurants. Caba\u00f1as Buena Onda (bed in dorms from about \u00a34) is a simple hostel on the beach offering individual huts, dormitories and tents.

Mexican authorities detained 190,366 people in 2015 \u2013 120% more than in 2013, according to official figures. It deported 155,418 people last year, compared to 80,902 in 2013.  Related: Mexico's migration crackdown escalates dangers for Central Americans Almost 98% of those deported in 2015 were from the violent northern triangle of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala where people are fleeing a lethal mix of gang warfare, corruption and extreme poverty.Detentions have surged since Mexico launched the Southern Front Plan in July 2014 just days after Barack Obama declared the surge in unaccompanied Central American child migrants seeking refuge on the us child migrants a humanitarian crisis.Since then, at least 5,000 Mexican federal police, army and navy officers have been deployed across the country to work alongside immigration officers to help stem the flow of northward-bound migrants.Public documents show that the US State Department initially provided $86m to train the security forces and modernise inspection and communication equipment. But it is unclear how much from the $2.5bn Merida Initiative and other aid programmes have been redirected towards tightening Mexico\u2019s southern border and stopping the flow of migrants. The five human rights groups, along with an Episcopal bishop in Los Angeles, are seeking audits and other financial documents which demonstrate how the Mexican government uses US aid for this program. They also want information on how migrants are treated in detention centres, and whether those fleeing violence are being allowed to seek asylum as dictated by international and Mexican human rights law. There is ample anecdotal evidence that people are being denied the opportunity to seek asylum under an undeclared deportation quota system operated by INM which breaches international law. A Guardian investigation last year found that the US was deporting undocumented migrants to face the threat of imminent violence, and identified several deportees who were murdered within days or weeks of their return. Related: Gang violence in El Salvador fuelling country\u2019s child migration crisis Alex Mart\u00ednez, a former head of the INM, told the Guardian that although a 2007 law had decriminalised irregular migration through Mexico, the government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto had reverted to treating undocumented migrants as criminals.\u201cMexico is hunting down migrants like criminals, abusing their human rights than in the US. Most people are not permitted to go through the asylum process, they are quickly deported.\u201d\u201cThe Americans started paying Mexico in the past three years, this didn\u2019t happen before,\u201d he added. The legal challenge was launched this week after the state department failed to provide the information. The claim states that the state department\u2019s refusal to process his request or release the records is \u201cshrouding US support for Mexico\u2019s unlawful interdiction program in secrecy\u201d.\u201cMexico\u2019s really playing hardball, and detains and then returns the vast majority of these people with no fair assessment about the type of danger they face if they are returned,\u201d Peter Schey, director of the Center for Human Rights, told Courthouse News.The organisations bringing the case are Human Rights Watch, Movimiento Migrante Mesoamericano, Red Mexicana De L\u00edderes Y Organizations Migrantes, Red De Pastores y Lideres Latinos Del Sur De California and Right Reverend Jon Bruno.", "tags": ["US immigration", "Mexico", "Obama administration", "US news", "Americas", "World news"], "title": "Human rights groups sue US over immigration payments to Mexico"},{"date": "2016-01-29T21:34:24Z", "content": "Mexico has rechristened its capital city, embracing the name by which it is known worldwide, but causing a conundrum for residents who for decades have referred to the sprawling megalopolis as the Federal District \u2013 or \u201cDF\u201dPresident Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto officially changed the capital\u2019s name to \u201cMexico City\u201d on Friday as part of a reform to devolve power from the federal government, allowing the city\u2019s mayor to name senior officials including the police chief.

Or, as her owner Angel Arredondo explained: \u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a diva.\u201dNo wonder: she\u2019s got people taking her picture where ever she goes, asking for selfies, even stopping cars and motorcycles abruptly to gawk at her magnificence. Miss Piggy would be justifiably jealous.Arredondo has had her a year and a half, ever since his girlfriend brought her home as a birthday gift. He thought it was a crazy idea but, within a few days, he was in love ... and so were all his neighbours.Walks are some of La Chata\u2019s favourite things, both because of the attention of strangers and to greet her friends, from the guys at the taco shop to the newsstand lady who sneaks her chips.She even has her own official artist, Ruben Ochoa, best known for (appropriately enough) Bestiary, a take on the seven deadly sins. Ochoa risks life and limb for that perfect photograph of La Chata crossing the road, getting a bath or scaring the neighborhood dogs, who aren\u2019t quite sure what those squeals and grunts mean.To follow La Chata\u2019s urban adventures (and you should), check her out on Instagram or Twitter: @LaChataPigMCUpdated\nat 12.46am GMT\n\n\n11.57pm GMT\n23:57\n\nMartin\u2019s incredible expedition around Mexico City\u2019s markets concludes in Tepito, at the Altar de Santa Muerte.Altar de Santa Muerte, Tipito. \"There's no good or bad, just faith\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/XM2PJsDwGoWe\u2019ve just been talking to the indomitable Do\u00f1a Queta, who set up the DF\u2019s biggest shrine to Santa Muerte in 2001.

The city is home to as many as 3 million pet dogs; New York City, by comparison, has around 600,000.But all hasn\u2019t been well of late: a serial dog-killer was stalking the bushes of Parque M\u00e9xico in October, and poisoned 19 dogs in just four days.

Here are three key points from their \u201cmanifesto for the city\u201d:(1) Insecurity and violence against women continues to be the number one priority for women living in the city. This panel seeks urgent action to tackle society\u2019s tolerance of the harassment of women \u2013 in public and private spaces, including among those working within an official capacity \u2013 and to challenge women\u2019s representation as lesser, sexual objects in the mainstream media. (2) The absence of gender equality within the school curriculum is a huge concern. There is an urgent need for programmes (within both public and private schools) that teach all children about equality, rights, sexual choice, sexual health, diversity and respect. It must be a priority that women defending the rights of other women can carry out their work safely and securely. Any threats or violence against female human rights defenders \u2013 for example, the massacre in Navarte \u2013 must be a priority for the city\u2019s authorities. It must be dealt with transparently within the criminal justice system and not be played out in the media.(3) The vast majority of women in the city rely on public transport, where many feel vulnerable and unsafe. Women-only carriages will only be effective if they are properly controlled \u2013 and even then, they are only part of a solution. There must be long-term, effective public campaigns to eradicate sexual harassment, which must include messages about equality and respect from school-age onwards. A more detailed report on the discussion, and a full set of the recommendations arrived at, will be published later this week. MH\n\n9.52pm GMT\n21:52\n\nIt\u2019s a heady time for Mexican film-makers abroad. The country has bred the past two Academy Award winners for best director: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Gravity and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). And Emmanuel \u201cChivo\u201d Lubezki rode both those films to two consecutive Oscars for best cinematographer.Cuar\u00f3n and Lubezki have another thing in common: they both went to the prestigious CUEC film school of Mexico City.So we knew that challenging CUEC\u2019s first-year class to make a series of three-minute films about Mexico City would generate something interesting.On Friday, they screened the results for us. Here\u2019s one.I say again: first-year students. It\u2019s enough to make you hopeful that the days of judging Mexican directors by their Oscar haul are numbered. Though the students also had an axe to grind about how difficult it is to distribute independent Mexican films, even in Mexico. \u201cSo far from God, so close to the United States.\u201dMore to come.CMUpdated\nat 10.13pm GMT\n\n\n9.22pm GMT\n21:22\n\nMartin has spent some time with the migrants at La Merced market.Mexico City\u2019s been a magnet for migrants since the Revolution, and people are still coming from the countryside, to flee violence or find work.For no particular reason, these butchers at La Merced market broke into a chorus of \"\u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/fQLy24m7Z3...which quickly became a chant of \"\u00a1 Que viva Oaxaca!\" in honour of their home town #GuardianMexico\u201cIn the countryside there are no jobs, so we had to move,\u201d said Ricardo, who was selling calla lillies. \u201cI don\u2019t like Mexico City, but I had no choice.\u201dValeria selling jelly in La Merced market: \"Mexico City is pretty but I worry about insecurity here\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Gjc5a04e4JAnother woman, Elena, said she and her family had moved to the DF from Guerrero when their father was killed 40 years ago.Lu\u00eds + tripe: \"The best thing about Mexico City?

By far the best place to swim in town, La Punta is centred on a street of cafes, surf shops, hostels and restaurants. Caba\u00f1as Buena Onda (bed in dorms from about \u00a34) is a simple hostel on the beach offering individual huts, dormitories and tents.

The sand is soft, the palm trees sway, the waves are huge and endless. Sunset sees serious surfers share the evening with traditional dancers and music. Hemmed in by cliffs, it has resisted major development and yet found space for cosmopolitan restaurants and luxury and budget accommodation by the beach and on a hillside - at the budget end Posada Paloma (doubles from \u00a317) and El Recinto del Viento (doubles from \u00a312) are superb.

Mexican authorities detained 190,366 people in 2015 \u2013 120% more than in 2013, according to official figures. It deported 155,418 people last year, compared to 80,902 in 2013.  Related: Mexico's migration crackdown escalates dangers for Central Americans Almost 98% of those deported in 2015 were from the violent northern triangle of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala where people are fleeing a lethal mix of gang warfare, corruption and extreme poverty.Detentions have surged since Mexico launched the Southern Front Plan in July 2014 just days after Barack Obama declared the surge in unaccompanied Central American child migrants seeking refuge on the us child migrants a humanitarian crisis.Since then, at least 5,000 Mexican federal police, army and navy officers have been deployed across the country to work alongside immigration officers to help stem the flow of northward-bound migrants.Public documents show that the US State Department initially provided $86m to train the security forces and modernise inspection and communication equipment. But it is unclear how much from the $2.5bn Merida Initiative and other aid programmes have been redirected towards tightening Mexico\u2019s southern border and stopping the flow of migrants. The five human rights groups, along with an Episcopal bishop in Los Angeles, are seeking audits and other financial documents which demonstrate how the Mexican government uses US aid for this program. They also want information on how migrants are treated in detention centres, and whether those fleeing violence are being allowed to seek asylum as dictated by international and Mexican human rights law. There is ample anecdotal evidence that people are being denied the opportunity to seek asylum under an undeclared deportation quota system operated by INM which breaches international law. A Guardian investigation last year found that the US was deporting undocumented migrants to face the threat of imminent violence, and identified several deportees who were murdered within days or weeks of their return. Related: Gang violence in El Salvador fuelling country\u2019s child migration crisis Alex Mart\u00ednez, a former head of the INM, told the Guardian that although a 2007 law had decriminalised irregular migration through Mexico, the government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto had reverted to treating undocumented migrants as criminals.\u201cMexico is hunting down migrants like criminals, abusing their human rights than in the US. Most people are not permitted to go through the asylum process, they are quickly deported.\u201d\u201cThe Americans started paying Mexico in the past three years, this didn\u2019t happen before,\u201d he added. The legal challenge was launched this week after the state department failed to provide the information.

Related: Indigenous struggle in Chiapas will come 'out in the open' for Pope Francis's visit The claims of ecclesiastical irregularities come days before Pope Francis makes a six-day trip to Mexico, in which he is expected to address touchy topics such as corruption, inequality and insecurity \u2013 matters on which the Mexican government has mostly stayed silent under Pe\u00f1a Nieto.Reporters with the news weekly Proceso and online news organization Aristegui Noticias obtained the documents, which were shared with the Guardian.Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s first wife, M\u00f3nica Pretelini, died in January 2007 after suffering an epileptic seizure. His subsequent romance with Rivera, who had been hired as the public face of Mexico state, where Pe\u00f1a Nieto was governor, produced a steady stream of puff pieces and cover stories in the country\u2019s gossip magazines.Rivera, a popular soap opera star, was married to TV producer Jos\u00e9 Alberto Castro from 2004 to 2008. They have three daughters together, including two who were born out of wedlock. The archdiocese of Mexico City annulled their marriage in May 2009, noting that the ceremony had taken place on a beach in Acapulco and exhibited \u201cdefects of canonical form\u201d.But the newly revealed church documents cast doubt on the archdiocese\u2019s story that an improper wedding ceremony was sufficient grounds to annul the marriage.A copy of Castro and Rivera\u2019s Catholic marriage certificate appears to show a proper church ceremony took place in a Mexico City parish on 2 December 2004 \u2013 before the Acapulco beach service and in contradiction of archdiocesan claims that it did not take place in an authorized house of worship.Annulments are available to all Catholics, though the process is cumbersome and can take years to complete, according to a priest consulted by the Guardian. That is especially true for those lacking the cash or connections to people in prominent positions. Pope Francis has only recently attempted to make annulments more accessible. Related: Mexico plans to deploy 10,000 police officers for Pope Francis's visit \u201cWorking class Mexicans would almost never be able to get an annulment,\u201d said Father Robert Coogan, an American priest in the city of Saltillo.\u201cIt could take four or five years,\u201d Coogan said, adding that most people do not have their documents in the proper order, cannot navigate the paperwork and are unable to afford the fees.Documents show the archdiocese of Mexico City vigorously pursued a priest popular with telenovela actors, Father Jos\u00e9 Luis Salinas Aranda, who presided at the Acapulco ceremony \u2013 which he described as a repetition of vows.One archdiocesan document proposes punishing Salinas for \u201cirregularities\u201d in the Castro-Rivera marriage. It cited Rivera and three witnesses \u2013 all her sisters \u2013 who claimed they did not \u201cunderstand\u201d they were signing a church marriage certificate at the ceremony in Mexico City.A spokesman for the archdiocese of Mexico City, Father Hugo Valdemar, denied there had been any irregularities and told the Guardian the annulment \u201cfollowed the proper process\u201d. He added that the original marriage in the Mexico City parish was celebrated with the intention that it would be repeated in Acapulco by a priest lacking the proper permission to perform it.Valdemar also denied any political motives for granting the annulment.Salinas died of cancer in October 2015. In 2012, a Vatican tribunal known as the Roman Rota absolved him of any ecclesiastical wrongdoing in Rivera\u2019s marriage. A letter to the Vatican in 2009 by Father Enrique Gonz\u00e1lez Torres, the prominent former rector of the Jesuit-run Universidad Iberoamericana, condemned the archdiocesan actions against Salinas as \u201cfull of irregularities\u201d.\u201cIt is very sad that to indulge a lady, who wishes to marry the governor of Mexico state, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in a church wedding, a travesty of justice is committed,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez Torres wrote in a 18 December 2009 letter defending Salinas.The letter was sent two days after Pe\u00f1a Nieto went to the Vatican with bishops from his home state. In an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, he introduced the pope to Rivera and made their marriage plans public for the first time.\u201cEven more worrying to me is that the president of the Mexican bishops\u2019 conference accompanied these people,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez Torres wrote, \u201cvouching for their upcoming church wedding, when the annulment of Ang\u00e9lica Rivera\u2019s first marriage was done fast-track, hastily and was full of irregularities.\u201d", "tags": ["Mexico", "Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Catholicism", "Americas", "Religion", "World news", "Christianity"], "title": "Mexico Catholic church accused of bending marriage rules for president"},{"date": "2016-01-29T21:34:24Z", "content": "Mexico has rechristened its capital city, embracing the name by which it is known worldwide, but causing a conundrum for residents who for decades have referred to the sprawling megalopolis as the Federal District \u2013 or \u201cDF\u201dPresident Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto officially changed the capital\u2019s name to \u201cMexico City\u201d on Friday as part of a reform to devolve power from the federal government, allowing the city\u2019s mayor to name senior officials including the police chief.

Or, as her owner Angel Arredondo explained: \u201cShe\u2019s a bit of a diva.\u201dNo wonder: she\u2019s got people taking her picture where ever she goes, asking for selfies, even stopping cars and motorcycles abruptly to gawk at her magnificence. Miss Piggy would be justifiably jealous.Arredondo has had her a year and a half, ever since his girlfriend brought her home as a birthday gift. He thought it was a crazy idea but, within a few days, he was in love ... and so were all his neighbours.Walks are some of La Chata\u2019s favourite things, both because of the attention of strangers and to greet her friends, from the guys at the taco shop to the newsstand lady who sneaks her chips.She even has her own official artist, Ruben Ochoa, best known for (appropriately enough) Bestiary, a take on the seven deadly sins. Ochoa risks life and limb for that perfect photograph of La Chata crossing the road, getting a bath or scaring the neighborhood dogs, who aren\u2019t quite sure what those squeals and grunts mean.To follow La Chata\u2019s urban adventures (and you should), check her out on Instagram or Twitter: @LaChataPigMCUpdated\nat 12.46am GMT\n\n\n11.57pm GMT\n23:57\n\nMartin\u2019s incredible expedition around Mexico City\u2019s markets concludes in Tepito, at the Altar de Santa Muerte.Altar de Santa Muerte, Tipito. \"There's no good or bad, just faith\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/XM2PJsDwGoWe\u2019ve just been talking to the indomitable Do\u00f1a Queta, who set up the DF\u2019s biggest shrine to Santa Muerte in 2001.

Here are three key points from their \u201cmanifesto for the city\u201d:(1) Insecurity and violence against women continues to be the number one priority for women living in the city. This panel seeks urgent action to tackle society\u2019s tolerance of the harassment of women \u2013 in public and private spaces, including among those working within an official capacity \u2013 and to challenge women\u2019s representation as lesser, sexual objects in the mainstream media. (2) The absence of gender equality within the school curriculum is a huge concern. There is an urgent need for programmes (within both public and private schools) that teach all children about equality, rights, sexual choice, sexual health, diversity and respect. It must be a priority that women defending the rights of other women can carry out their work safely and securely. Any threats or violence against female human rights defenders \u2013 for example, the massacre in Navarte \u2013 must be a priority for the city\u2019s authorities. It must be dealt with transparently within the criminal justice system and not be played out in the media.(3) The vast majority of women in the city rely on public transport, where many feel vulnerable and unsafe. Women-only carriages will only be effective if they are properly controlled \u2013 and even then, they are only part of a solution. There must be long-term, effective public campaigns to eradicate sexual harassment, which must include messages about equality and respect from school-age onwards.

The country has bred the past two Academy Award winners for best director: Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Gravity and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu for Birdman (Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). And Emmanuel \u201cChivo\u201d Lubezki rode both those films to two consecutive Oscars for best cinematographer.Cuar\u00f3n and Lubezki have another thing in common: they both went to the prestigious CUEC film school of Mexico City.So we knew that challenging CUEC\u2019s first-year class to make a series of three-minute films about Mexico City would generate something interesting.On Friday, they screened the results for us. Here\u2019s one.I say again: first-year students. It\u2019s enough to make you hopeful that the days of judging Mexican directors by their Oscar haul are numbered. Though the students also had an axe to grind about how difficult it is to distribute independent Mexican films, even in Mexico. \u201cSo far from God, so close to the United States.\u201dMore to come.CMUpdated\nat 10.13pm GMT\n\n\n9.22pm GMT\n21:22\n\nMartin has spent some time with the migrants at La Merced market.Mexico City\u2019s been a magnet for migrants since the Revolution, and people are still coming from the countryside, to flee violence or find work.For no particular reason, these butchers at La Merced market broke into a chorus of \"\u00a1Viva M\u00e9xico!\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/fQLy24m7Z3...which quickly became a chant of \"\u00a1 Que viva Oaxaca!\" in honour of their home town #GuardianMexico\u201cIn the countryside there are no jobs, so we had to move,\u201d said Ricardo, who was selling calla lillies. \u201cI don\u2019t like Mexico City, but I had no choice.\u201dValeria selling jelly in La Merced market: \"Mexico City is pretty but I worry about insecurity here\" #GuardianMexico pic.twitter.com/Gjc5a04e4JAnother woman, Elena, said she and her family had moved to the DF from Guerrero when their father was killed 40 years ago.Lu\u00eds + tripe: \"The best thing about Mexico City?

Mexican authorities detained 190,366 people in 2015 \u2013 120% more than in 2013, according to official figures. It deported 155,418 people last year, compared to 80,902 in 2013.  Related: Mexico's migration crackdown escalates dangers for Central Americans Almost 98% of those deported in 2015 were from the violent northern triangle of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala where people are fleeing a lethal mix of gang warfare, corruption and extreme poverty.Detentions have surged since Mexico launched the Southern Front Plan in July 2014 just days after Barack Obama declared the surge in unaccompanied Central American child migrants seeking refuge on the us child migrants a humanitarian crisis.Since then, at least 5,000 Mexican federal police, army and navy officers have been deployed across the country to work alongside immigration officers to help stem the flow of northward-bound migrants.Public documents show that the US State Department initially provided $86m to train the security forces and modernise inspection and communication equipment. But it is unclear how much from the $2.5bn Merida Initiative and other aid programmes have been redirected towards tightening Mexico\u2019s southern border and stopping the flow of migrants. The five human rights groups, along with an Episcopal bishop in Los Angeles, are seeking audits and other financial documents which demonstrate how the Mexican government uses US aid for this program. They also want information on how migrants are treated in detention centres, and whether those fleeing violence are being allowed to seek asylum as dictated by international and Mexican human rights law. There is ample anecdotal evidence that people are being denied the opportunity to seek asylum under an undeclared deportation quota system operated by INM which breaches international law. A Guardian investigation last year found that the US was deporting undocumented migrants to face the threat of imminent violence, and identified several deportees who were murdered within days or weeks of their return. Related: Gang violence in El Salvador fuelling country\u2019s child migration crisis Alex Mart\u00ednez, a former head of the INM, told the Guardian that although a 2007 law had decriminalised irregular migration through Mexico, the government of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto had reverted to treating undocumented migrants as criminals.\u201cMexico is hunting down migrants like criminals, abusing their human rights than in the US.

Related: Indigenous struggle in Chiapas will come 'out in the open' for Pope Francis's visit The claims of ecclesiastical irregularities come days before Pope Francis makes a six-day trip to Mexico, in which he is expected to address touchy topics such as corruption, inequality and insecurity \u2013 matters on which the Mexican government has mostly stayed silent under Pe\u00f1a Nieto.Reporters with the news weekly Proceso and online news organization Aristegui Noticias obtained the documents, which were shared with the Guardian.Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s first wife, M\u00f3nica Pretelini, died in January 2007 after suffering an epileptic seizure. His subsequent romance with Rivera, who had been hired as the public face of Mexico state, where Pe\u00f1a Nieto was governor, produced a steady stream of puff pieces and cover stories in the country\u2019s gossip magazines.Rivera, a popular soap opera star, was married to TV producer Jos\u00e9 Alberto Castro from 2004 to 2008. They have three daughters together, including two who were born out of wedlock. The archdiocese of Mexico City annulled their marriage in May 2009, noting that the ceremony had taken place on a beach in Acapulco and exhibited \u201cdefects of canonical form\u201d.But the newly revealed church documents cast doubt on the archdiocese\u2019s story that an improper wedding ceremony was sufficient grounds to annul the marriage.A copy of Castro and Rivera\u2019s Catholic marriage certificate appears to show a proper church ceremony took place in a Mexico City parish on 2 December 2004 \u2013 before the Acapulco beach service and in contradiction of archdiocesan claims that it did not take place in an authorized house of worship.Annulments are available to all Catholics, though the process is cumbersome and can take years to complete, according to a priest consulted by the Guardian. That is especially true for those lacking the cash or connections to people in prominent positions. Pope Francis has only recently attempted to make annulments more accessible. Related: Mexico plans to deploy 10,000 police officers for Pope Francis's visit \u201cWorking class Mexicans would almost never be able to get an annulment,\u201d said Father Robert Coogan, an American priest in the city of Saltillo.\u201cIt could take four or five years,\u201d Coogan said, adding that most people do not have their documents in the proper order, cannot navigate the paperwork and are unable to afford the fees.Documents show the archdiocese of Mexico City vigorously pursued a priest popular with telenovela actors, Father Jos\u00e9 Luis Salinas Aranda, who presided at the Acapulco ceremony \u2013 which he described as a repetition of vows.One archdiocesan document proposes punishing Salinas for \u201cirregularities\u201d in the Castro-Rivera marriage. It cited Rivera and three witnesses \u2013 all her sisters \u2013 who claimed they did not \u201cunderstand\u201d they were signing a church marriage certificate at the ceremony in Mexico City.A spokesman for the archdiocese of Mexico City, Father Hugo Valdemar, denied there had been any irregularities and told the Guardian the annulment \u201cfollowed the proper process\u201d. He added that the original marriage in the Mexico City parish was celebrated with the intention that it would be repeated in Acapulco by a priest lacking the proper permission to perform it.Valdemar also denied any political motives for granting the annulment.Salinas died of cancer in October 2015. In 2012, a Vatican tribunal known as the Roman Rota absolved him of any ecclesiastical wrongdoing in Rivera\u2019s marriage. A letter to the Vatican in 2009 by Father Enrique Gonz\u00e1lez Torres, the prominent former rector of the Jesuit-run Universidad Iberoamericana, condemned the archdiocesan actions against Salinas as \u201cfull of irregularities\u201d.\u201cIt is very sad that to indulge a lady, who wishes to marry the governor of Mexico state, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in a church wedding, a travesty of justice is committed,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez Torres wrote in a 18 December 2009 letter defending Salinas.The letter was sent two days after Pe\u00f1a Nieto went to the Vatican with bishops from his home state. In an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, he introduced the pope to Rivera and made their marriage plans public for the first time.\u201cEven more worrying to me is that the president of the Mexican bishops\u2019 conference accompanied these people,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez Torres wrote, \u201cvouching for their upcoming church wedding, when the annulment of Ang\u00e9lica Rivera\u2019s first marriage was done fast-track, hastily and was full of irregularities.\u201d", "tags": ["Mexico", "Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Catholicism", "Americas", "Religion", "World news", "Christianity"], "title": "Mexico Catholic church accused of bending marriage rules for president"},{"date": "2016-01-11T16:51:21Z", "content": "Behind the drama of the manhunt and the surreal involvement of Sean Penn, the rearrest of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n constitutes a fascinating and important moment for Mexico and the world of narco-traffic.

Just because Wachovia and HSBC got caught \u2013 and admitted to \u2013 facilitating Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s cartel business (and may have stopped) means merely that now some other bank is doing so. The whole show goes on and on \u2013 and in this regard, Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s comment to Penn that drug use will continue after his demise is spot-on.But in what way might the plates have shifted in what narco-traffic calls la plaza \u2013 the turf \u2013 to bring about this rearrest? And how will the business, and the violence, be affected?The first possibility is that it has been staged in some way, and that Guzm\u00e1n will do what he has always done (and as his predecessor Pablo Escobar did in Colombia): run the business from jail. And even if Guzm\u00e1n is neutralised in prison, an heir could take over the cartel and run it on his principles.Both of these scenarios presume that the Sinaloa cartel, the world\u2019s biggest and richest criminal syndicate, remains so and enjoys a relationship with the Mexican state \u2013 or sufficient elements within it - which involves conviviality at best, complicity at worst.The alliance, such as it has existed for decades between the state and Guzm\u00e1n (and his ancestry in the old Guadalajara cartel), is logical: the old-fashioned corporate \u201cpyramid\u201d cartel is best equipped to keep order, the \u201cpax mafiosa\u201d. Contrary to popular belief, the mafia prefers peace to war, and things get violent \u2013 and did so in Mexico in 2006 - when the plaza becomes unquiet, not when power is exercised effectively.But there comes a point when the state\u2019s ally in the criminal world becomes so powerful that it constitutes a state-within-a-state, and too great of a threat. This is what happened to Escobar\u2019s Medellin cartel in Colombia, and the time came to take him out.It could be that diaster-prone Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto (or, at least, the oligarchy that represents \u201cpermanent Mexico\u201d) judges that moment to have arrived, and that this arrest is for real; many expert commentators have posited that it seemed so, that Guzm\u00e1n does not appear cock-of-the-walk this time around. Related: If drug cartel kingpin El Chapo stays in Mexico, 'absolutely nothing' will change It may well be that Pe\u00f1a Nieto cannot risk a further tragicomic embarrassment in the appalling farce of his presidency to date, and a further outcome of the arrest is that Guzm\u00e1n is extradited to the US. That the US will claim its quarry and try Guzm\u00e1n themselves, with no chance of any miraculous \u201cescapes\u201d.This would create a compelling situation: Guzm\u00e1n has very good friends in very high places north of the border as well as on the Mexican side, not least in financial and arms-dealing circles. If he were to play his cards intelligently in court, he could bring a lot of high-level people down. For this reason, the trial of the century to date would be probably be held in secret \u2013 and there is a precedent template for this: the conviction in Houston of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s principal rival, Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n, founder and then leader of Los Zetas, which we in the press tried desperately but in vain to witness.Which brings us to a last, intriguing \u2013 and potentially terrifying - possibility. The Sinaloa cartel is the last of the old patrician, corporate cartels \u2013 akin, on more familiar terrain, to the Sicilian Cosa Nostra. Guzm\u00e1n is the last old-school \u201cdon\u201d, the last Robin Hood narco.In Sinaloa, he is praised and admired more than he is feared or hated. He distributes alms of sorts; his serfs will tell you how he flew their sick child to hospital in his plane, gave flowers to the church on Mother\u2019s Day, provided electricity to a school. Contrast this to the situation in places controlled by C\u00e1rdenas\u2019 Zetas: you would be ill advised to even mention their name. Their rule is a vice grip based on sheer terror, not baronial patronage.Just as Cosa Nostra was overtaken first by the Neapolitan Camorra and Calabrian \u2019Ndrangheta, so there is the chance that the Sinaloa cartel is damaged, buckling under the intensity of the assaults on its hegemony by the ferocious Zetas and their allies (among them the Beltran Leyva cartel, which was once part of El Chapo\u2019s federation).Narco-cartels are not adversaries of global capitalism, nor even pastiches of it: they are its role models. Free trade across the Americas was invented not by Bill Clinton and the presidents of Mexico and Canada, but Escobar.But that was another generation, that which raised Guzm\u00e1n. In the world of narco-genealogy, which is no different from the generational evolution of any corporation, new cartels like the Zetas set the scene for our world of pure, unfettered capitalism in the wake of the now outdated patrician corporate model. They are leaner and meaner, with a more appositely brutal understanding of the vicissitudes of the cocaine market, and the many others in which they operate on cocaine\u2019s slipstream.It is possible that the advance of the Zetas and their allies forms part of the backstage behind Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s arrest, that Guzm\u00e1n can no longer be relied upon to deliver the pax mafiosa, that elements of the state controlled by or loyal to Guzm\u00e1n now find that this is no protection. The deep trouble exploded in 2006 when the plaza was contested (by the Gulf cartel and Zetas in the north-east, and La Familia in Michoacan) and the state decided to become a player in the game; and the more the sands shift, the more the violence intensifies.If the advance of these new, Zeta-led cartels in the narco-nightmare is part of the story behind the arrest, then it can only get worse before it gets better \u2013 if it ever does.Ed Vulliamy is author of Amexica: War Along the Borderline, published by Picador USA and Vintage UK", "tags": ["Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n", "Drugs trade", "Mexico", "World news", "Americas"], "title": "How will El Chapo's recapture affect Mexico and narco-trafficking?"},{"date": "2015-11-21T14:52:12Z", "content": "A drone has crashed in south-west Iran, the regional governor has told the Fars news agency.It was not clear if the drone, which crashed near Shush city, in Khuzestan province on Friday, had been shot down by Iran or failed due to technical problems.Fars news agency quoted the governor of Shush county as saying a foreign surveillance drone had come down.

The Iranian authorities had confiscated his travel documents, and Hakimzadeh took the risk of being shot by border guards to avoid yet another stint in prison.Still, the ordeal he faced over five years ago pales in comparison to what currently awaits activists and journalists who fall into the clutches of Iran\u2019s justice system, he says.

This allows Iranian officials to adjust the meaning of moharebeh to apply to anything from an angry post on Facebook or Twitter to participating in a spontaneous protest rally. Hakimzadeh believes there are steps activists in Iran can take to better protect themselves, both inside and outside prison walls. He belongs to a group of over a dozen activists who used their hard-earned personal experiences to create a 19-chapter booklet in Farsi and English titled Safe Activism: Reducing the Risks and Impact of Arrest.Designed to teach activists and journalists how to avoid careless behaviors that could endanger them and those around them, the booklet, now online, also offers guidelines on what to do in case of arrest and how to mitigate the consequences of incarceration.Mahdieh Javid, who left Iran in her early teens, played a crucial role in writing the booklet. Through her work with activists who left Iran between 2009 and 2010, Mahdieh came into contact with activists based in Iran and made an alarming discovery. \u201cWe realized that many instances of arrest could have been avoided by taking a few simple measures,\u201d she says of her motivation for spearheading the project. \u201cThese issues are not talked about or sufficiently discussed. Many of the mistakes are repeated.\u201dThese basic safety measures are highlighted in the first chapters of the \u2018Safe Activism\u2019 booklet. Readers are reminded to take precautions before meeting with other activists and not communicate important information over the phone. They are advised to keep sensitive documents as well as identification papers and travel documents at a safe place outside their residence, and to clear their homes of illegal items like drugs, alcohol and banned media.Mehdi Aminizadeh, another activist who contributed to the project, says his family sent him books from his home library during one of his four stints in prison, without realizing one of them was contraband. Possession of that banned book was later added to his charges. The guide also devotes a section to digital security. Readers are advised to memorize phone numbers, addresses and other sensitive information instead of recording them. The booklet recommends using a different email address for activism-related exchanges, and preventing the recovery of deleted files by using software like File Shredder. Looking back, Hakimzadeh says one of his biggest mistakes was writing an email to his girlfriend with instructions on what to do if he was detained. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I had kept the file on my computer or deleted it and they managed to recover it, but my interrogators knew about it and used it against me.\u201dKeeping insanity at bayActivists have no real way of telling when and if they will be arrested or how serious their punishment will be.

Readers are also advised to not incriminate others when \u2018confessing\u2019. In written confessions, the authors recommend giving vague answers and including the interrogator\u2019s questions in their statements. They advise detainees to write what is in their best interest as opposed to what they told the interrogator. To prevent prosecutors from using the confession as evidence against them in a later case, the detainees should number and date all pages. They should also prevent additions by crossing out all blank spaces. Detainees may also write illegibly and scratch out words to make their confessions inadmissible in court.Preparing activists for solitary confinement, a common method used to break detainees, is perhaps one of the most significant undertakings of the guide. Hakimzadeh, who spent a total of 190 days in solitary, describes it as a vacuum that felt like death. \u201cI haven\u2019t experienced death but I think this is how it must feel. It is very sudden and unexpected. In an instant, you are cut off from everyone and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do trivial things that were once normal and you took for granted like opening a door, looking at yourself in the mirror, or checking the time on your cellphone.\u201dAs time went by, exercise, meditation, positive thoughts and cleaning his cell, among other things, helped Hakimzadeh keep insanity at bay. \u201cI had a Quran and a prayer book in my cell and I would study them and take notes with the pen and paper I had found and managed to hide,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving writing material was illegal there. I would think about my notes and have discussions about them with myself. I would talk to myself. I would walk in my cell for hours.\u201dThe Safe Activism booklet is not the first of its kind, but its writers believe that it is more current on the methods used by Iranian authorities. Compiled by a large group of activists whose ordeals of persecution and incarceration are recent, the booklet incorporates the voices of student activists, women\u2019s rights activists and the Green Movement as well as other groups. \u201cSome of the items were new even to me, for instance I knew what happens to political and student activists in section 209 [of Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison], but I didn\u2019t know about what happens to prisoners in other cities like Sanandaj or Ahvaz or to religious minorities. This booklet includes their experiences too,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. While the intended audience of the booklet are activists in Iran, its online nature also gives Islamic republic authorities access to its volume of information. However, the writers of Safe Activism are not concerned that revealing the methods used to persecute activists will result in a change of tactics.Reading the booklet could lead Iranian officials to take a \u201csmarter approach\u201d, but Hakimzadeh says it will not change the fact that once a \u201cperson knows the basics of what will happen there, it will help them adapt.\u201d\u201cAt the very least,\u201d adds one of the contributors who asked to remain unnamed, \u201cit lets them know they are not alone.

Many are already being circulated on social media by Iranians. There\u2019s the one where foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in his shirtsleeves, is waving a draft of the agreement that he needed to get back to, or the one where he is holding both ears to hear the shouts of the reporters below. Whatever the moment, there is a constant: the ornamental cast iron grill of the 19th century balcony of the Hotel Palais Coburg frames each shot. This balcony has now entered the annals of international conflict resolution and Iranian political history.Watching these images, other moments from Iran\u2019s past come to mind that are framed by distinct architecture. The year is 1943. The world is at war. Britain, the US and the USSR must develop a coordinated strategy to defeat Hitler. The British in the south of the country and the Soviets in the north have occupied Iran from the start of the conflict. Stalin will only meet Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, as he ostensibly wants to be near Moscow. The official photographs of the three statesmen after they conclude the Tehran conference are taken on the veranda of the Soviet Union embassy in downtown Tehran, a stones throw away from the British embassy compound. They sit between hulking white columns with large arched windows behind them.Iran is at this time an underdeveloped country and in the grip of severe food shortages. Reza Shah has been forced to abdicate his throne and leave the country. His young son, Mohammad Reza, is put on the throne by the British.The Tehran Conference will lead to a new strategy that will help the allies win the war against fascism. Iran will provide the oil for the war effort, and the corridor for supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union. It will be known as the \u201cBridge To Victory\u201d by the Allies.Iranians themselves will neither be informed of this vital meeting on their soil nor invited to it. Churchill will summon the young Shah to the embassy for a brief meeting. Stalin is the only leader who will visit him in his palace as a monarch. And even then he will have his arm twisted. The oil that will help win the war against fascism does not belong to Iranians - yet. It will be another decade before Mohammad Mossadeq nationalises the Iranian oil industry, and in the process engineer his own demise.On another veranda less than a mile north of the embassies, we can see tracks of a tank in a private garden. The house is a large house by Iranian standards with plaster colonnades characteristic of Qajar architecture. There is no one on the porch that is daubed in slogans declaring Death to Mossadeq. It is 19 of August 1953. The Anglo American coup conceived by the British and conducted by the CIA has been successful. Mobs and a tank have overrun the premier\u2019s house. There are papers strewn all across the garden. Mossadeq has been arrested. He will die in exile in his garden outside the boundaries of Tehran under house arrest. He will be buried in the front room of his rural home. Even in death, he will not find reprieve from his exile. He must be forgotten even as the country enjoys the riches of the oil that he freed for them. On a shelf in the room next to this makeshift mausoleum is a picture of the premier smartly dressed in a sharp suit standing atop a platform, smiling next to the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. It is 1951 and he has just delivered an emotive speech drawing parallels between the American emancipation from the British in 1776 and Iran\u2019s attempts to nationalize its oil industry. Back then many Iranians believed that the United States with its constitutional affirmations of freedom, was Iran\u2019s best ally against the old meddling imperial forces of Britain and Russia.A raised small platform in the seminarian city of Qom, 1964. A middle-aged cleric sits slightly elevated on a traditional pulpit above a sea of white turbans. He is preaching to his juniors, deploring a recently passed law that exempts American military personnel from being tried by Iranian courts if they commit a crime in the country. He declares that the Shah\u2019s capitulation law is humiliating. For this he will be slapped by the Shah\u2019s prime minister and eventually exiled, first to Iraq and then to France, only to return 15 years later to become the supreme spiritual leader of Iran after the revolution. On his return he will greet his loyal followers through a raised window at the Refah School for girls. History is framed in the humble wooden struts of the window. There are no balconies here. On the rooftop though, summary executions of those close to the ousted Shah will take place during the night. During the day, the school yard heaves with the mass of people who have come to hear Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini speak of his vision for a new Iran. It\u2019s Februaury 1979.A little further north on a boulevard named after the legendary throne of a Persian king, the American eagle is about to come under assault. It\u2019s mid autumn and it\u2019s payback time. Men are climbing over the wrought iron gates of the United States embassy in Tehran. There is a short flight of steps to the solid entrance of the two story red brick building with an austere 1930s utilitarian design. The Americans staff call the building \u201cHenderson High\u201d because it looks like the high schools built back in the United States. Soon there will be men blindfolded and marched down those concrete steps for the world to see. There is no turning back now. We will shock the world. We will break the rules and step on the soil of a sovereign nation uninvited and treat its citizens with contempt.We will behave in a belligerent way because we are tired of being pushed around. The hostages will be released after 444 days. But during that time we will become increasingly alone in the world. We will feel this in the soon-to-come eight year war with our neighbour. We will feel isolated and we will wear this isolation with an angry pride. Our young will perish in a seemingly endless war; the world will watch as they are gassed by Saddam. But we will resist.

He survived physical and psychological abuse, enduring torture for up to 15 hours a day.Suspecting a fourth arrest was imminent, in 2010 Hakimzadeh fled across the border to Turkey. The Iranian authorities had confiscated his travel documents, and Hakimzadeh took the risk of being shot by border guards to avoid yet another stint in prison.Still, the ordeal he faced over five years ago pales in comparison to what currently awaits activists and journalists who fall into the clutches of Iran\u2019s justice system, he says. Since the unrests of 2009, the Islamic republic expanded its use of legal tools, including capital punishment, to silence dissidents. \u201cThe stakes are much higher now,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. \u201cIn my time, the price you paid for activism was prison. But since the Green Movement, this price has gone up.\u201d Related: Iran's Jila Baniyaghoob on journalism, prison and Rouhani One example is the charge of moharebeh, or \u2018waging war against God\u2019, which carries the death penalty. Iranian authorities have expanded the scope of its definition from \u2018armed war against the state\u2019 and \u2018heresy\u2019 to include \u2018working to undermine the Islamic establishment\u2019 and \u2018cooperating with foreign agents or entities\u2019. This allows Iranian officials to adjust the meaning of moharebeh to apply to anything from an angry post on Facebook or Twitter to participating in a spontaneous protest rally. Hakimzadeh believes there are steps activists in Iran can take to better protect themselves, both inside and outside prison walls. He belongs to a group of over a dozen activists who used their hard-earned personal experiences to create a 19-chapter booklet in Farsi and English titled Safe Activism: Reducing the Risks and Impact of Arrest.Designed to teach activists and journalists how to avoid careless behaviors that could endanger them and those around them, the booklet, now online, also offers guidelines on what to do in case of arrest and how to mitigate the consequences of incarceration.Mahdieh Javid, who left Iran in her early teens, played a crucial role in writing the booklet. Through her work with activists who left Iran between 2009 and 2010, Mahdieh came into contact with activists based in Iran and made an alarming discovery. \u201cWe realized that many instances of arrest could have been avoided by taking a few simple measures,\u201d she says of her motivation for spearheading the project. \u201cThese issues are not talked about or sufficiently discussed. Many of the mistakes are repeated.\u201dThese basic safety measures are highlighted in the first chapters of the \u2018Safe Activism\u2019 booklet. Readers are reminded to take precautions before meeting with other activists and not communicate important information over the phone. They are advised to keep sensitive documents as well as identification papers and travel documents at a safe place outside their residence, and to clear their homes of illegal items like drugs, alcohol and banned media.Mehdi Aminizadeh, another activist who contributed to the project, says his family sent him books from his home library during one of his four stints in prison, without realizing one of them was contraband. Possession of that banned book was later added to his charges. The guide also devotes a section to digital security. Readers are advised to memorize phone numbers, addresses and other sensitive information instead of recording them. The booklet recommends using a different email address for activism-related exchanges, and preventing the recovery of deleted files by using software like File Shredder. Looking back, Hakimzadeh says one of his biggest mistakes was writing an email to his girlfriend with instructions on what to do if he was detained. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I had kept the file on my computer or deleted it and they managed to recover it, but my interrogators knew about it and used it against me.\u201dKeeping insanity at bayActivists have no real way of telling when and if they will be arrested or how serious their punishment will be. The arrest strategies employed by Iranian officials also differ. Some arrests are quick and predictable while others come as a surprise as authorities take time to \u2018gather information and get to know the person better.\u2019\u201cFor others, they prepare a scenario and wait for certain things to transpire before playing out that scenario...They let the fruit ripen first and then pluck it,\u201d says Hakimzadeh.The booklet gives readers insight into what to expect during arrest and prison admission, as well as tactics commonly used by interrogators: threatening physical harm and arresting the subject\u2019s family members, employing physical and psychological torture, sexual assault, as well as performing random acts of kindness. Readers are also advised to not incriminate others when \u2018confessing\u2019. In written confessions, the authors recommend giving vague answers and including the interrogator\u2019s questions in their statements. They advise detainees to write what is in their best interest as opposed to what they told the interrogator. To prevent prosecutors from using the confession as evidence against them in a later case, the detainees should number and date all pages. They should also prevent additions by crossing out all blank spaces. Detainees may also write illegibly and scratch out words to make their confessions inadmissible in court.Preparing activists for solitary confinement, a common method used to break detainees, is perhaps one of the most significant undertakings of the guide. Hakimzadeh, who spent a total of 190 days in solitary, describes it as a vacuum that felt like death. \u201cI haven\u2019t experienced death but I think this is how it must feel. It is very sudden and unexpected. In an instant, you are cut off from everyone and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do trivial things that were once normal and you took for granted like opening a door, looking at yourself in the mirror, or checking the time on your cellphone.\u201dAs time went by, exercise, meditation, positive thoughts and cleaning his cell, among other things, helped Hakimzadeh keep insanity at bay. \u201cI had a Quran and a prayer book in my cell and I would study them and take notes with the pen and paper I had found and managed to hide,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving writing material was illegal there. I would think about my notes and have discussions about them with myself. I would talk to myself. I would walk in my cell for hours.\u201dThe Safe Activism booklet is not the first of its kind, but its writers believe that it is more current on the methods used by Iranian authorities. Compiled by a large group of activists whose ordeals of persecution and incarceration are recent, the booklet incorporates the voices of student activists, women\u2019s rights activists and the Green Movement as well as other groups. \u201cSome of the items were new even to me, for instance I knew what happens to political and student activists in section 209 [of Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison], but I didn\u2019t know about what happens to prisoners in other cities like Sanandaj or Ahvaz or to religious minorities. This booklet includes their experiences too,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. While the intended audience of the booklet are activists in Iran, its online nature also gives Islamic republic authorities access to its volume of information. However, the writers of Safe Activism are not concerned that revealing the methods used to persecute activists will result in a change of tactics.Reading the booklet could lead Iranian officials to take a \u201csmarter approach\u201d, but Hakimzadeh says it will not change the fact that once a \u201cperson knows the basics of what will happen there, it will help them adapt.\u201d\u201cAt the very least,\u201d adds one of the contributors who asked to remain unnamed, \u201cit lets them know they are not alone. Others have gone through this ordeal in the past, and some of those people are safe now.\u201d The Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

Many are already being circulated on social media by Iranians. There\u2019s the one where foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in his shirtsleeves, is waving a draft of the agreement that he needed to get back to, or the one where he is holding both ears to hear the shouts of the reporters below. Whatever the moment, there is a constant: the ornamental cast iron grill of the 19th century balcony of the Hotel Palais Coburg frames each shot. This balcony has now entered the annals of international conflict resolution and Iranian political history.Watching these images, other moments from Iran\u2019s past come to mind that are framed by distinct architecture. The year is 1943. The world is at war. Britain, the US and the USSR must develop a coordinated strategy to defeat Hitler. The British in the south of the country and the Soviets in the north have occupied Iran from the start of the conflict. Stalin will only meet Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, as he ostensibly wants to be near Moscow. The official photographs of the three statesmen after they conclude the Tehran conference are taken on the veranda of the Soviet Union embassy in downtown Tehran, a stones throw away from the British embassy compound. They sit between hulking white columns with large arched windows behind them.Iran is at this time an underdeveloped country and in the grip of severe food shortages. Reza Shah has been forced to abdicate his throne and leave the country. His young son, Mohammad Reza, is put on the throne by the British.The Tehran Conference will lead to a new strategy that will help the allies win the war against fascism. Iran will provide the oil for the war effort, and the corridor for supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union. It will be known as the \u201cBridge To Victory\u201d by the Allies.Iranians themselves will neither be informed of this vital meeting on their soil nor invited to it. Churchill will summon the young Shah to the embassy for a brief meeting. Stalin is the only leader who will visit him in his palace as a monarch. And even then he will have his arm twisted. The oil that will help win the war against fascism does not belong to Iranians - yet. It will be another decade before Mohammad Mossadeq nationalises the Iranian oil industry, and in the process engineer his own demise.On another veranda less than a mile north of the embassies, we can see tracks of a tank in a private garden. The house is a large house by Iranian standards with plaster colonnades characteristic of Qajar architecture. There is no one on the porch that is daubed in slogans declaring Death to Mossadeq. It is 19 of August 1953. The Anglo American coup conceived by the British and conducted by the CIA has been successful. Mobs and a tank have overrun the premier\u2019s house. There are papers strewn all across the garden. Mossadeq has been arrested. He will die in exile in his garden outside the boundaries of Tehran under house arrest. He will be buried in the front room of his rural home. Even in death, he will not find reprieve from his exile. He must be forgotten even as the country enjoys the riches of the oil that he freed for them. On a shelf in the room next to this makeshift mausoleum is a picture of the premier smartly dressed in a sharp suit standing atop a platform, smiling next to the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. It is 1951 and he has just delivered an emotive speech drawing parallels between the American emancipation from the British in 1776 and Iran\u2019s attempts to nationalize its oil industry. Back then many Iranians believed that the United States with its constitutional affirmations of freedom, was Iran\u2019s best ally against the old meddling imperial forces of Britain and Russia.A raised small platform in the seminarian city of Qom, 1964. A middle-aged cleric sits slightly elevated on a traditional pulpit above a sea of white turbans. He is preaching to his juniors, deploring a recently passed law that exempts American military personnel from being tried by Iranian courts if they commit a crime in the country. He declares that the Shah\u2019s capitulation law is humiliating. For this he will be slapped by the Shah\u2019s prime minister and eventually exiled, first to Iraq and then to France, only to return 15 years later to become the supreme spiritual leader of Iran after the revolution. On his return he will greet his loyal followers through a raised window at the Refah School for girls. History is framed in the humble wooden struts of the window. There are no balconies here. On the rooftop though, summary executions of those close to the ousted Shah will take place during the night. During the day, the school yard heaves with the mass of people who have come to hear Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini speak of his vision for a new Iran. It\u2019s Februaury 1979.A little further north on a boulevard named after the legendary throne of a Persian king, the American eagle is about to come under assault. It\u2019s mid autumn and it\u2019s payback time. Men are climbing over the wrought iron gates of the United States embassy in Tehran. There is a short flight of steps to the solid entrance of the two story red brick building with an austere 1930s utilitarian design. The Americans staff call the building \u201cHenderson High\u201d because it looks like the high schools built back in the United States. Soon there will be men blindfolded and marched down those concrete steps for the world to see. There is no turning back now. We will shock the world. We will break the rules and step on the soil of a sovereign nation uninvited and treat its citizens with contempt.We will behave in a belligerent way because we are tired of being pushed around. The hostages will be released after 444 days. But during that time we will become increasingly alone in the world. We will feel this in the soon-to-come eight year war with our neighbour. We will feel isolated and we will wear this isolation with an angry pride. Our young will perish in a seemingly endless war; the world will watch as they are gassed by Saddam. But we will resist. Every year we will burn the American flag, chanting Death to America in front of what we now call the nest of spies. This will become the favourite spectacle of the world press.And the world press will stand under the balcony of the Cobourg Palais hotel for 17 days and watch us end our standoff with the world.

He claims Natanz was only intended to produce low-enriched uranium fuel for nuclear power plants. Iran agrees to a request from UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to visit the Natanz site. IAEA visits in late February and Iran promises to submit to inspections.May 2003 Iran allows IAEA to visit the Kalaye Electric Company but refuses to allow IAEA inspectors to take samples.June 2003 IAEA report concludes that Iran has failed to meet its obligations under the safeguards agreement. June 2003 Following the IAEA report, the UK, Germany and France (the EU-3) launch a joint diplomatic effort to address Iran\u2019s nuclear policy. The US refused to be involved in the talks. October 2003 Under threat of referral to the UN security council, Iran reaches an agreement with the EU-3, known as the Tehran Declaration. Iran agrees to cooperate fully with the IAEA and suspend all uranium enrichment. August 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is elected president of Iran. He is seen as supportive of the country\u2019s nuclear programme. August-September 2005 EU-3 deal begins to fall apart as Iran resumes the conversion of uranium at the Isfahan facility. Ahmadinejad gives a speech at the United Nations stating that Iran has the right to develop a nuclear power programme. February 2006 The IAEA votes to report Iran to the UN security council. After the vote, Iran announces it will resume enrichment of uranium. April 2006 Ahmadinejad announces Iran has joined the group of countries that have nuclear technology, but adds that this is purely for providing power, not producing weapons. June 2006: China, the US and Russia join the UK, Germany and France to form the P5+1. The term refers to the five permanent member states of the UN security council, plus Germany, which is one of Iran\u2019s key trading partners. Related: Iranians: how do you feel about the 'landmark' nuclear deal? July 2006 The UN security council passes its first resolution demanding Iran stop its uranium enrichment and processing activities. 2006-2010 The security council adopts a total of six resolutions and imposes gradual sanctions on Iran, including freezing assets of individuals and companies related to the enrichment programme and banning the supply of nuclear-related technology to the country. September 2009 The US president, Barack Obama, reveals the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near the Iranian city of Qom. The US begins talking seriously about air strikes against Iran, and Israel threatens to take nuclear action. March 2013 The US begins a series of secret talks with Iranian officials, which are kept from its partners in the P5+1. June 2013 Hassan Rouhani is elected president of Iran. He is considered more moderate, pragmatic and willing to negotiate than Ahmadinejad. September 2013 Obama telephones Rouhani, the first contact between leaders of the US and Iran since 1979. The phone call, as well as a meeting between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, a day earlier, is seen as the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the countries. November 2013 Iran and the P5+1 reach an interim agreement, known as the joint plan of action. The agreement limits Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Production at the Arak heavy-water reactor ceases and Iran depletes much of its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium. Sanctions against Iran are partially lifted and assets are unfrozen.

Diplomats suggest that the real deadline is 9 July, the latest the deal can go to US Congress if sanctions are to be lifted as quickly as Iran would hope. Obama warns that he will walk away from a deal if Tehran does not stick to the outline agreed in April.6 July 2015 Kerry says negotiations \u201ccould go either way\u201d, 48 hours before the deadline for an agreement, as foreign ministers from the P5+1 meet again in Vienna.8 July 2015 Talks are extended by three days amid disagreements over the lifting of an arms embargo, but western diplomats say they remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached by the end of the week.10 July 2015 A senior member of the Iranian delegation criticises the P5+1, accusing them of putting forward multiple agreements and dragging their feet on a deal, after Kerry says there is \u201cno rush\u201d to conclude negotiations.11 July 2015 The deadline to reach agreement is pushed back to Monday 13 July, the third extension in two weeks.12 July 2015 President Rouhani says Iran has \u201cmanaged to amaze the world\u201d in the talks.13 July 2015 The Iranian president\u2019s office is forced to delete a premature tweet in his name that appears to welcome a nuclear agreement which has yet to materialise.

While the intended audience of the booklet are activists in Iran, its online nature also gives Islamic republic authorities access to its volume of information. However, the writers of Safe Activism are not concerned that revealing the methods used to persecute activists will result in a change of tactics.Reading the booklet could lead Iranian officials to take a \u201csmarter approach\u201d, but Hakimzadeh says it will not change the fact that once a \u201cperson knows the basics of what will happen there, it will help them adapt.\u201d\u201cAt the very least,\u201d adds one of the contributors who asked to remain unnamed, \u201cit lets them know they are not alone.

Many are already being circulated on social media by Iranians. There\u2019s the one where foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in his shirtsleeves, is waving a draft of the agreement that he needed to get back to, or the one where he is holding both ears to hear the shouts of the reporters below. Whatever the moment, there is a constant: the ornamental cast iron grill of the 19th century balcony of the Hotel Palais Coburg frames each shot. This balcony has now entered the annals of international conflict resolution and Iranian political history.Watching these images, other moments from Iran\u2019s past come to mind that are framed by distinct architecture. The year is 1943. The world is at war. Britain, the US and the USSR must develop a coordinated strategy to defeat Hitler. The British in the south of the country and the Soviets in the north have occupied Iran from the start of the conflict. Stalin will only meet Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, as he ostensibly wants to be near Moscow. The official photographs of the three statesmen after they conclude the Tehran conference are taken on the veranda of the Soviet Union embassy in downtown Tehran, a stones throw away from the British embassy compound. They sit between hulking white columns with large arched windows behind them.Iran is at this time an underdeveloped country and in the grip of severe food shortages. Reza Shah has been forced to abdicate his throne and leave the country. His young son, Mohammad Reza, is put on the throne by the British.The Tehran Conference will lead to a new strategy that will help the allies win the war against fascism. Iran will provide the oil for the war effort, and the corridor for supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union. It will be known as the \u201cBridge To Victory\u201d by the Allies.Iranians themselves will neither be informed of this vital meeting on their soil nor invited to it. Churchill will summon the young Shah to the embassy for a brief meeting. Stalin is the only leader who will visit him in his palace as a monarch. And even then he will have his arm twisted. The oil that will help win the war against fascism does not belong to Iranians - yet. It will be another decade before Mohammad Mossadeq nationalises the Iranian oil industry, and in the process engineer his own demise.On another veranda less than a mile north of the embassies, we can see tracks of a tank in a private garden. The house is a large house by Iranian standards with plaster colonnades characteristic of Qajar architecture. There is no one on the porch that is daubed in slogans declaring Death to Mossadeq. It is 19 of August 1953. The Anglo American coup conceived by the British and conducted by the CIA has been successful. Mobs and a tank have overrun the premier\u2019s house. There are papers strewn all across the garden. Mossadeq has been arrested. He will die in exile in his garden outside the boundaries of Tehran under house arrest. He will be buried in the front room of his rural home. Even in death, he will not find reprieve from his exile. He must be forgotten even as the country enjoys the riches of the oil that he freed for them. On a shelf in the room next to this makeshift mausoleum is a picture of the premier smartly dressed in a sharp suit standing atop a platform, smiling next to the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. It is 1951 and he has just delivered an emotive speech drawing parallels between the American emancipation from the British in 1776 and Iran\u2019s attempts to nationalize its oil industry. Back then many Iranians believed that the United States with its constitutional affirmations of freedom, was Iran\u2019s best ally against the old meddling imperial forces of Britain and Russia.A raised small platform in the seminarian city of Qom, 1964. A middle-aged cleric sits slightly elevated on a traditional pulpit above a sea of white turbans. He is preaching to his juniors, deploring a recently passed law that exempts American military personnel from being tried by Iranian courts if they commit a crime in the country. He declares that the Shah\u2019s capitulation law is humiliating. For this he will be slapped by the Shah\u2019s prime minister and eventually exiled, first to Iraq and then to France, only to return 15 years later to become the supreme spiritual leader of Iran after the revolution. On his return he will greet his loyal followers through a raised window at the Refah School for girls. History is framed in the humble wooden struts of the window. There are no balconies here. On the rooftop though, summary executions of those close to the ousted Shah will take place during the night. During the day, the school yard heaves with the mass of people who have come to hear Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini speak of his vision for a new Iran. It\u2019s Februaury 1979.A little further north on a boulevard named after the legendary throne of a Persian king, the American eagle is about to come under assault. It\u2019s mid autumn and it\u2019s payback time. Men are climbing over the wrought iron gates of the United States embassy in Tehran. There is a short flight of steps to the solid entrance of the two story red brick building with an austere 1930s utilitarian design. The Americans staff call the building \u201cHenderson High\u201d because it looks like the high schools built back in the United States. Soon there will be men blindfolded and marched down those concrete steps for the world to see. There is no turning back now. We will shock the world. We will break the rules and step on the soil of a sovereign nation uninvited and treat its citizens with contempt.We will behave in a belligerent way because we are tired of being pushed around. The hostages will be released after 444 days. But during that time we will become increasingly alone in the world. We will feel this in the soon-to-come eight year war with our neighbour. We will feel isolated and we will wear this isolation with an angry pride. Our young will perish in a seemingly endless war; the world will watch as they are gassed by Saddam. But we will resist. Every year we will burn the American flag, chanting Death to America in front of what we now call the nest of spies. This will become the favourite spectacle of the world press.And the world press will stand under the balcony of the Cobourg Palais hotel for 17 days and watch us end our standoff with the world. More reporters will hover on the hot pavements of our capital waiting for what is now another Iranian spectacle, the street celebrations. We will come and they will see us dance and they will ask us about the sanctions and the centrifuges, the economy and the future, they will take pictures of how our women dress.On the many balconies of the city, we will watch the celebrations and share a multitude of images on our smartphones from the day history became brighter from a balcony in Vienna. We will discuss the implications endlessly. Will the end of sanctions make life easier? Were we right to give up our centrifuges? Will this new deal make us acceptable in polite international company? What will the future hold? How soon and how meaningful will the changes be?We will share hopes and doubts knowing the answer to these questions will take a while to manifest, but one thing is certain, even as we feel that we have lost time and life to our revolution, we are also aware that we have come a long way from that balcony in the Soviet embassy.

He claims Natanz was only intended to produce low-enriched uranium fuel for nuclear power plants. Iran agrees to a request from UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to visit the Natanz site. IAEA visits in late February and Iran promises to submit to inspections.May 2003 Iran allows IAEA to visit the Kalaye Electric Company but refuses to allow IAEA inspectors to take samples.June 2003 IAEA report concludes that Iran has failed to meet its obligations under the safeguards agreement. June 2003 Following the IAEA report, the UK, Germany and France (the EU-3) launch a joint diplomatic effort to address Iran\u2019s nuclear policy. The US refused to be involved in the talks. October 2003 Under threat of referral to the UN security council, Iran reaches an agreement with the EU-3, known as the Tehran Declaration. Iran agrees to cooperate fully with the IAEA and suspend all uranium enrichment. August 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is elected president of Iran. He is seen as supportive of the country\u2019s nuclear programme. August-September 2005 EU-3 deal begins to fall apart as Iran resumes the conversion of uranium at the Isfahan facility. Ahmadinejad gives a speech at the United Nations stating that Iran has the right to develop a nuclear power programme. February 2006 The IAEA votes to report Iran to the UN security council. After the vote, Iran announces it will resume enrichment of uranium. April 2006 Ahmadinejad announces Iran has joined the group of countries that have nuclear technology, but adds that this is purely for providing power, not producing weapons. June 2006: China, the US and Russia join the UK, Germany and France to form the P5+1. The term refers to the five permanent member states of the UN security council, plus Germany, which is one of Iran\u2019s key trading partners. Related: Iranians: how do you feel about the 'landmark' nuclear deal? July 2006 The UN security council passes its first resolution demanding Iran stop its uranium enrichment and processing activities. 2006-2010 The security council adopts a total of six resolutions and imposes gradual sanctions on Iran, including freezing assets of individuals and companies related to the enrichment programme and banning the supply of nuclear-related technology to the country. September 2009 The US president, Barack Obama, reveals the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near the Iranian city of Qom. The US begins talking seriously about air strikes against Iran, and Israel threatens to take nuclear action. March 2013 The US begins a series of secret talks with Iranian officials, which are kept from its partners in the P5+1. June 2013 Hassan Rouhani is elected president of Iran. He is considered more moderate, pragmatic and willing to negotiate than Ahmadinejad. September 2013 Obama telephones Rouhani, the first contact between leaders of the US and Iran since 1979. The phone call, as well as a meeting between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, a day earlier, is seen as the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the countries. November 2013 Iran and the P5+1 reach an interim agreement, known as the joint plan of action. The agreement limits Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Production at the Arak heavy-water reactor ceases and Iran depletes much of its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium. Sanctions against Iran are partially lifted and assets are unfrozen.

Diplomats suggest that the real deadline is 9 July, the latest the deal can go to US Congress if sanctions are to be lifted as quickly as Iran would hope. Obama warns that he will walk away from a deal if Tehran does not stick to the outline agreed in April.6 July 2015 Kerry says negotiations \u201ccould go either way\u201d, 48 hours before the deadline for an agreement, as foreign ministers from the P5+1 meet again in Vienna.8 July 2015 Talks are extended by three days amid disagreements over the lifting of an arms embargo, but western diplomats say they remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached by the end of the week.10 July 2015 A senior member of the Iranian delegation criticises the P5+1, accusing them of putting forward multiple agreements and dragging their feet on a deal, after Kerry says there is \u201cno rush\u201d to conclude negotiations.11 July 2015 The deadline to reach agreement is pushed back to Monday 13 July, the third extension in two weeks.12 July 2015 President Rouhani says Iran has \u201cmanaged to amaze the world\u201d in the talks.13 July 2015 The Iranian president\u2019s office is forced to delete a premature tweet in his name that appears to welcome a nuclear agreement which has yet to materialise.

In the capital Tehran, over 1000 candidates are competing for just 30 seats.Earlier this week Iran\u2019s interior ministry finalised the full list of approved candidates for the parliamentary election, due on 26 February, after the Guardian Council blocked a significant number of reformist contenders during the vetting process. On the same day, Iran will also hold the election for the next Assembly of Experts, an influential clerical body in charge of appointing the supreme leader. Both elections are a battleground between hardliners already in power and moderate and pro-reform figures seeking a comeback. The outcome will have significant consequences for the president, Hassan Rouhani, in the remaining two years of his term and will affect his chances of seeking re-election next year. Despite widespread disqualifications, reformists are pulling out all the stops to make sure fewer hardliners will enter the next parliament, or Majlis, according to Mohammadreza Jalaeipour, an Iranian reformist political activist now at Harvard University. \u201cReformists from all different parties have put aside their differences after many years to agree on a joint list of candidates in an unprecedented form of coalition aimed at blocking hardliners from entering the parliament,\u201d he told the Guardian. The reformists\u2019 patron is former president Mohammad Khatami, who faces restrictions on his movement and activities but is leading from behind the scenes. The reformists\u2019 joint list of 30 candidates who they want to enter the Majlis from the capital is led by Mohammad Reza Aref, an influential figure whose decision to stand down in the 2013 presidential election in favour of Rouhani was crucial to the latter\u2019s victory. Also on the list is Ali Motahari, the parliament\u2019s sole current outspoken MP \u2013 a rare conservative figure who is also critical of the ruling establishment.  Related: Iran vice-president hails new era after removal of sanctions Jalaeipour said the big challenge facing the reformers is persuading people to turn out and vote. \u201cThere have been a lot of disqualifications but they haven\u2019t purged all the reformists. The ultimate aim for moderates is to have fewer hardliners in the next parliament.\u201d Although initial reports suggest that as few as 100 reformist candidates are among the 6,000 approved for the parliamentary elections by the Guardian Council, it is believed that some pro-reform figures may have been spared from disqualification because their allegiance has been unclear. More than 51% of those who registered for the parliamentary elections have been disqualified. Currently only nine of the Majlis\u2019s 290 members are female. This is unlikely to increase beyond 5%, according to Majlis Monitor, a parliamentary monitoring initiative supported by ASL19 and the University of Toronto.The Assembly of Experts is equally important. \u201cThis is the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that the Assembly of Experts election, usually a lacklustre event, is attracting huge attention internally,\u201d said Majlis Monitor\u2019s Farhad Souzanchi. \u201cBecause of the age of the supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei] \u2013 he is 76 \u2013 and because the assembly lasts for eight years, it is very likely that the people who get into the assembly in this election will choose the next supreme leader, or the new leader himself may well be among those elected.\u201d According to Souzanchi, there is little or no sign of an organised boycott of elections in Iran, in spite of the disqualifications. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like people think a boycott is a viable solution at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a lot of people boycotted under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, hardliners easily dominated the Majlis, which affected everyone. \u201cNow, although there are not many reformist candidates, people are trying to at least block extremists from entering both bodies.\u201dThe Guardian Council\u2019s filtering of the candidates has not stopped polls being competitive. In 2013 Rouhani, an approved candidate, created an extraordinary momentum for change and was elected on a mandate considered at home and abroad to be legitimate. From more than 800 Islamic theologians who registered for the Assembly of Experts, only 161 were approved for the 88-member body. This initially meant that in six provinces, one candidate was standing unopposed, but an election official has since indicated that candidates have been moved to rectify the issue. No women have been allowed to stand. Rouhani is himself a candidate for the assembly and his name is on a list of moderates along with a former reformist president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. According to Hossein Bastani of BBC Persian, if fewer than half of those who voted for Rouhani in 2013 vote for a list of 16 moderate-leaning candidates in Tehran, the three main ultra-conservative leaders \u2013 Ahmad Jannati, Mohammad Yazdi and Mohammad Taghi Mesbah-Yazdi \u2013 will automatically be blocked.

He survived physical and psychological abuse, enduring torture for up to 15 hours a day.Suspecting a fourth arrest was imminent, in 2010 Hakimzadeh fled across the border to Turkey. The Iranian authorities had confiscated his travel documents, and Hakimzadeh took the risk of being shot by border guards to avoid yet another stint in prison.Still, the ordeal he faced over five years ago pales in comparison to what currently awaits activists and journalists who fall into the clutches of Iran\u2019s justice system, he says. Since the unrests of 2009, the Islamic republic expanded its use of legal tools, including capital punishment, to silence dissidents. \u201cThe stakes are much higher now,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. \u201cIn my time, the price you paid for activism was prison. But since the Green Movement, this price has gone up.\u201d Related: Iran's Jila Baniyaghoob on journalism, prison and Rouhani One example is the charge of moharebeh, or \u2018waging war against God\u2019, which carries the death penalty. Iranian authorities have expanded the scope of its definition from \u2018armed war against the state\u2019 and \u2018heresy\u2019 to include \u2018working to undermine the Islamic establishment\u2019 and \u2018cooperating with foreign agents or entities\u2019. This allows Iranian officials to adjust the meaning of moharebeh to apply to anything from an angry post on Facebook or Twitter to participating in a spontaneous protest rally. Hakimzadeh believes there are steps activists in Iran can take to better protect themselves, both inside and outside prison walls. He belongs to a group of over a dozen activists who used their hard-earned personal experiences to create a 19-chapter booklet in Farsi and English titled Safe Activism: Reducing the Risks and Impact of Arrest.Designed to teach activists and journalists how to avoid careless behaviors that could endanger them and those around them, the booklet, now online, also offers guidelines on what to do in case of arrest and how to mitigate the consequences of incarceration.Mahdieh Javid, who left Iran in her early teens, played a crucial role in writing the booklet. Through her work with activists who left Iran between 2009 and 2010, Mahdieh came into contact with activists based in Iran and made an alarming discovery. \u201cWe realized that many instances of arrest could have been avoided by taking a few simple measures,\u201d she says of her motivation for spearheading the project. \u201cThese issues are not talked about or sufficiently discussed. Many of the mistakes are repeated.\u201dThese basic safety measures are highlighted in the first chapters of the \u2018Safe Activism\u2019 booklet. Readers are reminded to take precautions before meeting with other activists and not communicate important information over the phone. They are advised to keep sensitive documents as well as identification papers and travel documents at a safe place outside their residence, and to clear their homes of illegal items like drugs, alcohol and banned media.Mehdi Aminizadeh, another activist who contributed to the project, says his family sent him books from his home library during one of his four stints in prison, without realizing one of them was contraband. Possession of that banned book was later added to his charges. The guide also devotes a section to digital security. Readers are advised to memorize phone numbers, addresses and other sensitive information instead of recording them. The booklet recommends using a different email address for activism-related exchanges, and preventing the recovery of deleted files by using software like File Shredder. Looking back, Hakimzadeh says one of his biggest mistakes was writing an email to his girlfriend with instructions on what to do if he was detained. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I had kept the file on my computer or deleted it and they managed to recover it, but my interrogators knew about it and used it against me.\u201dKeeping insanity at bayActivists have no real way of telling when and if they will be arrested or how serious their punishment will be. The arrest strategies employed by Iranian officials also differ. Some arrests are quick and predictable while others come as a surprise as authorities take time to \u2018gather information and get to know the person better.\u2019\u201cFor others, they prepare a scenario and wait for certain things to transpire before playing out that scenario...They let the fruit ripen first and then pluck it,\u201d says Hakimzadeh.The booklet gives readers insight into what to expect during arrest and prison admission, as well as tactics commonly used by interrogators: threatening physical harm and arresting the subject\u2019s family members, employing physical and psychological torture, sexual assault, as well as performing random acts of kindness. Readers are also advised to not incriminate others when \u2018confessing\u2019. In written confessions, the authors recommend giving vague answers and including the interrogator\u2019s questions in their statements. They advise detainees to write what is in their best interest as opposed to what they told the interrogator. To prevent prosecutors from using the confession as evidence against them in a later case, the detainees should number and date all pages. They should also prevent additions by crossing out all blank spaces. Detainees may also write illegibly and scratch out words to make their confessions inadmissible in court.Preparing activists for solitary confinement, a common method used to break detainees, is perhaps one of the most significant undertakings of the guide. Hakimzadeh, who spent a total of 190 days in solitary, describes it as a vacuum that felt like death. \u201cI haven\u2019t experienced death but I think this is how it must feel. It is very sudden and unexpected. In an instant, you are cut off from everyone and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do trivial things that were once normal and you took for granted like opening a door, looking at yourself in the mirror, or checking the time on your cellphone.\u201dAs time went by, exercise, meditation, positive thoughts and cleaning his cell, among other things, helped Hakimzadeh keep insanity at bay. \u201cI had a Quran and a prayer book in my cell and I would study them and take notes with the pen and paper I had found and managed to hide,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving writing material was illegal there. I would think about my notes and have discussions about them with myself. I would talk to myself. I would walk in my cell for hours.\u201dThe Safe Activism booklet is not the first of its kind, but its writers believe that it is more current on the methods used by Iranian authorities. Compiled by a large group of activists whose ordeals of persecution and incarceration are recent, the booklet incorporates the voices of student activists, women\u2019s rights activists and the Green Movement as well as other groups. \u201cSome of the items were new even to me, for instance I knew what happens to political and student activists in section 209 [of Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison], but I didn\u2019t know about what happens to prisoners in other cities like Sanandaj or Ahvaz or to religious minorities. This booklet includes their experiences too,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. While the intended audience of the booklet are activists in Iran, its online nature also gives Islamic republic authorities access to its volume of information. However, the writers of Safe Activism are not concerned that revealing the methods used to persecute activists will result in a change of tactics.Reading the booklet could lead Iranian officials to take a \u201csmarter approach\u201d, but Hakimzadeh says it will not change the fact that once a \u201cperson knows the basics of what will happen there, it will help them adapt.\u201d\u201cAt the very least,\u201d adds one of the contributors who asked to remain unnamed, \u201cit lets them know they are not alone.

The oil that will help win the war against fascism does not belong to Iranians - yet. It will be another decade before Mohammad Mossadeq nationalises the Iranian oil industry, and in the process engineer his own demise.On another veranda less than a mile north of the embassies, we can see tracks of a tank in a private garden. The house is a large house by Iranian standards with plaster colonnades characteristic of Qajar architecture. There is no one on the porch that is daubed in slogans declaring Death to Mossadeq. It is 19 of August 1953. The Anglo American coup conceived by the British and conducted by the CIA has been successful. Mobs and a tank have overrun the premier\u2019s house. There are papers strewn all across the garden. Mossadeq has been arrested. He will die in exile in his garden outside the boundaries of Tehran under house arrest. He will be buried in the front room of his rural home. Even in death, he will not find reprieve from his exile. He must be forgotten even as the country enjoys the riches of the oil that he freed for them. On a shelf in the room next to this makeshift mausoleum is a picture of the premier smartly dressed in a sharp suit standing atop a platform, smiling next to the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. It is 1951 and he has just delivered an emotive speech drawing parallels between the American emancipation from the British in 1776 and Iran\u2019s attempts to nationalize its oil industry. Back then many Iranians believed that the United States with its constitutional affirmations of freedom, was Iran\u2019s best ally against the old meddling imperial forces of Britain and Russia.A raised small platform in the seminarian city of Qom, 1964. A middle-aged cleric sits slightly elevated on a traditional pulpit above a sea of white turbans. He is preaching to his juniors, deploring a recently passed law that exempts American military personnel from being tried by Iranian courts if they commit a crime in the country. He declares that the Shah\u2019s capitulation law is humiliating. For this he will be slapped by the Shah\u2019s prime minister and eventually exiled, first to Iraq and then to France, only to return 15 years later to become the supreme spiritual leader of Iran after the revolution. On his return he will greet his loyal followers through a raised window at the Refah School for girls. History is framed in the humble wooden struts of the window. There are no balconies here. On the rooftop though, summary executions of those close to the ousted Shah will take place during the night. During the day, the school yard heaves with the mass of people who have come to hear Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini speak of his vision for a new Iran. It\u2019s Februaury 1979.A little further north on a boulevard named after the legendary throne of a Persian king, the American eagle is about to come under assault. It\u2019s mid autumn and it\u2019s payback time. Men are climbing over the wrought iron gates of the United States embassy in Tehran. There is a short flight of steps to the solid entrance of the two story red brick building with an austere 1930s utilitarian design. The Americans staff call the building \u201cHenderson High\u201d because it looks like the high schools built back in the United States. Soon there will be men blindfolded and marched down those concrete steps for the world to see. There is no turning back now. We will shock the world. We will break the rules and step on the soil of a sovereign nation uninvited and treat its citizens with contempt.We will behave in a belligerent way because we are tired of being pushed around. The hostages will be released after 444 days. But during that time we will become increasingly alone in the world. We will feel this in the soon-to-come eight year war with our neighbour. We will feel isolated and we will wear this isolation with an angry pride. Our young will perish in a seemingly endless war; the world will watch as they are gassed by Saddam. But we will resist. Every year we will burn the American flag, chanting Death to America in front of what we now call the nest of spies. This will become the favourite spectacle of the world press.And the world press will stand under the balcony of the Cobourg Palais hotel for 17 days and watch us end our standoff with the world. More reporters will hover on the hot pavements of our capital waiting for what is now another Iranian spectacle, the street celebrations. We will come and they will see us dance and they will ask us about the sanctions and the centrifuges, the economy and the future, they will take pictures of how our women dress.On the many balconies of the city, we will watch the celebrations and share a multitude of images on our smartphones from the day history became brighter from a balcony in Vienna. We will discuss the implications endlessly. Will the end of sanctions make life easier? Were we right to give up our centrifuges? Will this new deal make us acceptable in polite international company? What will the future hold? How soon and how meaningful will the changes be?We will share hopes and doubts knowing the answer to these questions will take a while to manifest, but one thing is certain, even as we feel that we have lost time and life to our revolution, we are also aware that we have come a long way from that balcony in the Soviet embassy.

June 2003 Following the IAEA report, the UK, Germany and France (the EU-3) launch a joint diplomatic effort to address Iran\u2019s nuclear policy. The US refused to be involved in the talks. October 2003 Under threat of referral to the UN security council, Iran reaches an agreement with the EU-3, known as the Tehran Declaration. Iran agrees to cooperate fully with the IAEA and suspend all uranium enrichment. August 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is elected president of Iran. He is seen as supportive of the country\u2019s nuclear programme. August-September 2005 EU-3 deal begins to fall apart as Iran resumes the conversion of uranium at the Isfahan facility. Ahmadinejad gives a speech at the United Nations stating that Iran has the right to develop a nuclear power programme. February 2006 The IAEA votes to report Iran to the UN security council. After the vote, Iran announces it will resume enrichment of uranium. April 2006 Ahmadinejad announces Iran has joined the group of countries that have nuclear technology, but adds that this is purely for providing power, not producing weapons.

July 2006 The UN security council passes its first resolution demanding Iran stop its uranium enrichment and processing activities. 2006-2010 The security council adopts a total of six resolutions and imposes gradual sanctions on Iran, including freezing assets of individuals and companies related to the enrichment programme and banning the supply of nuclear-related technology to the country. September 2009 The US president, Barack Obama, reveals the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near the Iranian city of Qom. The US begins talking seriously about air strikes against Iran, and Israel threatens to take nuclear action. March 2013 The US begins a series of secret talks with Iranian officials, which are kept from its partners in the P5+1. June 2013 Hassan Rouhani is elected president of Iran. He is considered more moderate, pragmatic and willing to negotiate than Ahmadinejad. September 2013 Obama telephones Rouhani, the first contact between leaders of the US and Iran since 1979. The phone call, as well as a meeting between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, a day earlier, is seen as the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the countries. November 2013 Iran and the P5+1 reach an interim agreement, known as the joint plan of action. The agreement limits Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Production at the Arak heavy-water reactor ceases and Iran depletes much of its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium. Sanctions against Iran are partially lifted and assets are unfrozen.

In the capital Tehran, over 1000 candidates are competing for just 30 seats.Earlier this week Iran\u2019s interior ministry finalised the full list of approved candidates for the parliamentary election, due on 26 February, after the Guardian Council blocked a significant number of reformist contenders during the vetting process. On the same day, Iran will also hold the election for the next Assembly of Experts, an influential clerical body in charge of appointing the supreme leader. Both elections are a battleground between hardliners already in power and moderate and pro-reform figures seeking a comeback. The outcome will have significant consequences for the president, Hassan Rouhani, in the remaining two years of his term and will affect his chances of seeking re-election next year. Despite widespread disqualifications, reformists are pulling out all the stops to make sure fewer hardliners will enter the next parliament, or Majlis, according to Mohammadreza Jalaeipour, an Iranian reformist political activist now at Harvard University. \u201cReformists from all different parties have put aside their differences after many years to agree on a joint list of candidates in an unprecedented form of coalition aimed at blocking hardliners from entering the parliament,\u201d he told the Guardian. The reformists\u2019 patron is former president Mohammad Khatami, who faces restrictions on his movement and activities but is leading from behind the scenes. The reformists\u2019 joint list of 30 candidates who they want to enter the Majlis from the capital is led by Mohammad Reza Aref, an influential figure whose decision to stand down in the 2013 presidential election in favour of Rouhani was crucial to the latter\u2019s victory. Also on the list is Ali Motahari, the parliament\u2019s sole current outspoken MP \u2013 a rare conservative figure who is also critical of the ruling establishment.  Related: Iran vice-president hails new era after removal of sanctions Jalaeipour said the big challenge facing the reformers is persuading people to turn out and vote. \u201cThere have been a lot of disqualifications but they haven\u2019t purged all the reformists. The ultimate aim for moderates is to have fewer hardliners in the next parliament.\u201d Although initial reports suggest that as few as 100 reformist candidates are among the 6,000 approved for the parliamentary elections by the Guardian Council, it is believed that some pro-reform figures may have been spared from disqualification because their allegiance has been unclear. More than 51% of those who registered for the parliamentary elections have been disqualified. Currently only nine of the Majlis\u2019s 290 members are female. This is unlikely to increase beyond 5%, according to Majlis Monitor, a parliamentary monitoring initiative supported by ASL19 and the University of Toronto.The Assembly of Experts is equally important. \u201cThis is the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that the Assembly of Experts election, usually a lacklustre event, is attracting huge attention internally,\u201d said Majlis Monitor\u2019s Farhad Souzanchi. \u201cBecause of the age of the supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei] \u2013 he is 76 \u2013 and because the assembly lasts for eight years, it is very likely that the people who get into the assembly in this election will choose the next supreme leader, or the new leader himself may well be among those elected.\u201d According to Souzanchi, there is little or no sign of an organised boycott of elections in Iran, in spite of the disqualifications. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like people think a boycott is a viable solution at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a lot of people boycotted under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, hardliners easily dominated the Majlis, which affected everyone. \u201cNow, although there are not many reformist candidates, people are trying to at least block extremists from entering both bodies.\u201dThe Guardian Council\u2019s filtering of the candidates has not stopped polls being competitive. In 2013 Rouhani, an approved candidate, created an extraordinary momentum for change and was elected on a mandate considered at home and abroad to be legitimate. From more than 800 Islamic theologians who registered for the Assembly of Experts, only 161 were approved for the 88-member body. This initially meant that in six provinces, one candidate was standing unopposed, but an election official has since indicated that candidates have been moved to rectify the issue. No women have been allowed to stand. Rouhani is himself a candidate for the assembly and his name is on a list of moderates along with a former reformist president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. According to Hossein Bastani of BBC Persian, if fewer than half of those who voted for Rouhani in 2013 vote for a list of 16 moderate-leaning candidates in Tehran, the three main ultra-conservative leaders \u2013 Ahmad Jannati, Mohammad Yazdi and Mohammad Taghi Mesbah-Yazdi \u2013 will automatically be blocked.

Saffron, king of all spices, is Iran\u2019s red gold, and an ounce of it is even more expensive in some western supermarkets than the precious metal. The lifting of sanctions against the country in mid-January is triggering a fresh demand worldwide as the spice is exported to the US for the first time in 15 years.Saffron is a distinctive flavour in much Persian cuisine and has featured widely in recipes by some of the world\u2019s most famous chefs, but its exports sank under a decade of sanctions as the west severed economic ties with Tehran. Between 80% and 90% of the world\u2019s saffron comes from Iran, but banking and trade restrictions meant Iranian companies faced huge challenges in exporting it abroad, particularly to the US and Europe. Instead, sanctions created a large market for counterfeit, artificially coloured products, and other countries acted as intermediaries by importing the genuine spice from Iran and rebranding and exporting it to the wider world in their own name and at higher prices. Mohammad Javad Rezaie, the head of Iran\u2019s saffron exports development fund, has said that the first shipment will reach the US next week and predicted that the removal of sanctions and direct trade with Europe will boost its exports by 40% in the near future. \u201cAfter the implementation of the nuclear deal between Iran and [the west], a number of countries such as Spain want to directly buy saffron from Iran,\u201d Rezaie told the semi-official Isna news agency.\u201cUnder sanctions, saffron exports fell down significantly \u2026 which made it very difficult to send or receive foreign currency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a request from the US and the first shipment of saffron, weighed at 20kg, will be sent to the US for the first time in 15 years.\u201dIranians believe saffron serves as a natural antidepressant and helps fight Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. It is usually ground and mixed with hot water before being added to rice used alongside a bowl of Persian stew, such as ghormeh sabzi, which is a mixture of sauteed herbs, kidney beans and lamb or beef. It is also generously used in sholeh zard, a rice pudding which people cook and hand out to neighbours and the poor on religious occasions. Saffron\u2019s high price is due to the fact it takes more than 150,000 purple crocus flowers to make one kilogram suitable for sale. Saffron flowers, which have three tiny red stigmas, blossom only a few weeks every autumn and the best time to harvest them is early in the morning. According to a CNN report last year, one gram of good quality saffron can cost $65 (\u00a345). Gholamreza Miri, the vice-president of Iran\u2019s national saffron council, said on Tuesday that Iran has exported $110m worth of saffron in the past 10 months in spite of sanctions, which is 35% less than the same period last year, but he predicted the US sale and lifting of sanctions will spark a boost. \u201cBecause of sanctions, we weren\u2019t able to export saffron to the US but now we can,\u201d he said. According to Iranian officials, Iran has produced a record 310 metric tonnes of saffron this year so far, and a kilo has reached 72m rials (\u00a31,300). In 2014, Iran exported about 170 tonnes of saffron, worth $244m, to a total of 53 countries. Much of it was produced in the northern Khorasan province. In recent years, fluctuation in the local price of saffron has become a huge obstacle to its export. \u201cTraditional cultivation and harvest methods, as well as bulk sales, stand out as the drawbacks of the sector but officials say middlemen and speculators are an additional burden,\u201d according to Iran Daily. Under sanctions, importing saffron to the US was banned and Reuters has reported that American officials have inspected Spanish farms in the past to make sure they were not using Iranian variations in their own exports to the US. Other Iranian products are also allowed for US sale in the post-sanctions era, including caviar, pistachios and carpets. Iran exported more than $600m worth of carpets in 2011 before sanctions were tightened. Last year, Iran was also the world\u2019s top producer of pistachios, ahead of the US.

He survived physical and psychological abuse, enduring torture for up to 15 hours a day.Suspecting a fourth arrest was imminent, in 2010 Hakimzadeh fled across the border to Turkey. The Iranian authorities had confiscated his travel documents, and Hakimzadeh took the risk of being shot by border guards to avoid yet another stint in prison.Still, the ordeal he faced over five years ago pales in comparison to what currently awaits activists and journalists who fall into the clutches of Iran\u2019s justice system, he says. Since the unrests of 2009, the Islamic republic expanded its use of legal tools, including capital punishment, to silence dissidents. \u201cThe stakes are much higher now,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. \u201cIn my time, the price you paid for activism was prison. But since the Green Movement, this price has gone up.\u201d Related: Iran's Jila Baniyaghoob on journalism, prison and Rouhani One example is the charge of moharebeh, or \u2018waging war against God\u2019, which carries the death penalty. Iranian authorities have expanded the scope of its definition from \u2018armed war against the state\u2019 and \u2018heresy\u2019 to include \u2018working to undermine the Islamic establishment\u2019 and \u2018cooperating with foreign agents or entities\u2019. This allows Iranian officials to adjust the meaning of moharebeh to apply to anything from an angry post on Facebook or Twitter to participating in a spontaneous protest rally. Hakimzadeh believes there are steps activists in Iran can take to better protect themselves, both inside and outside prison walls. He belongs to a group of over a dozen activists who used their hard-earned personal experiences to create a 19-chapter booklet in Farsi and English titled Safe Activism: Reducing the Risks and Impact of Arrest.Designed to teach activists and journalists how to avoid careless behaviors that could endanger them and those around them, the booklet, now online, also offers guidelines on what to do in case of arrest and how to mitigate the consequences of incarceration.Mahdieh Javid, who left Iran in her early teens, played a crucial role in writing the booklet. Through her work with activists who left Iran between 2009 and 2010, Mahdieh came into contact with activists based in Iran and made an alarming discovery. \u201cWe realized that many instances of arrest could have been avoided by taking a few simple measures,\u201d she says of her motivation for spearheading the project. \u201cThese issues are not talked about or sufficiently discussed. Many of the mistakes are repeated.\u201dThese basic safety measures are highlighted in the first chapters of the \u2018Safe Activism\u2019 booklet. Readers are reminded to take precautions before meeting with other activists and not communicate important information over the phone. They are advised to keep sensitive documents as well as identification papers and travel documents at a safe place outside their residence, and to clear their homes of illegal items like drugs, alcohol and banned media.Mehdi Aminizadeh, another activist who contributed to the project, says his family sent him books from his home library during one of his four stints in prison, without realizing one of them was contraband. Possession of that banned book was later added to his charges. The guide also devotes a section to digital security. Readers are advised to memorize phone numbers, addresses and other sensitive information instead of recording them. The booklet recommends using a different email address for activism-related exchanges, and preventing the recovery of deleted files by using software like File Shredder. Looking back, Hakimzadeh says one of his biggest mistakes was writing an email to his girlfriend with instructions on what to do if he was detained. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I had kept the file on my computer or deleted it and they managed to recover it, but my interrogators knew about it and used it against me.\u201dKeeping insanity at bayActivists have no real way of telling when and if they will be arrested or how serious their punishment will be. The arrest strategies employed by Iranian officials also differ. Some arrests are quick and predictable while others come as a surprise as authorities take time to \u2018gather information and get to know the person better.\u2019\u201cFor others, they prepare a scenario and wait for certain things to transpire before playing out that scenario...They let the fruit ripen first and then pluck it,\u201d says Hakimzadeh.The booklet gives readers insight into what to expect during arrest and prison admission, as well as tactics commonly used by interrogators: threatening physical harm and arresting the subject\u2019s family members, employing physical and psychological torture, sexual assault, as well as performing random acts of kindness. Readers are also advised to not incriminate others when \u2018confessing\u2019. In written confessions, the authors recommend giving vague answers and including the interrogator\u2019s questions in their statements. They advise detainees to write what is in their best interest as opposed to what they told the interrogator. To prevent prosecutors from using the confession as evidence against them in a later case, the detainees should number and date all pages. They should also prevent additions by crossing out all blank spaces. Detainees may also write illegibly and scratch out words to make their confessions inadmissible in court.Preparing activists for solitary confinement, a common method used to break detainees, is perhaps one of the most significant undertakings of the guide. Hakimzadeh, who spent a total of 190 days in solitary, describes it as a vacuum that felt like death. \u201cI haven\u2019t experienced death but I think this is how it must feel. It is very sudden and unexpected. In an instant, you are cut off from everyone and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do trivial things that were once normal and you took for granted like opening a door, looking at yourself in the mirror, or checking the time on your cellphone.\u201dAs time went by, exercise, meditation, positive thoughts and cleaning his cell, among other things, helped Hakimzadeh keep insanity at bay. \u201cI had a Quran and a prayer book in my cell and I would study them and take notes with the pen and paper I had found and managed to hide,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving writing material was illegal there. I would think about my notes and have discussions about them with myself. I would talk to myself. I would walk in my cell for hours.\u201dThe Safe Activism booklet is not the first of its kind, but its writers believe that it is more current on the methods used by Iranian authorities. Compiled by a large group of activists whose ordeals of persecution and incarceration are recent, the booklet incorporates the voices of student activists, women\u2019s rights activists and the Green Movement as well as other groups. \u201cSome of the items were new even to me, for instance I knew what happens to political and student activists in section 209 [of Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison], but I didn\u2019t know about what happens to prisoners in other cities like Sanandaj or Ahvaz or to religious minorities. This booklet includes their experiences too,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. While the intended audience of the booklet are activists in Iran, its online nature also gives Islamic republic authorities access to its volume of information. However, the writers of Safe Activism are not concerned that revealing the methods used to persecute activists will result in a change of tactics.Reading the booklet could lead Iranian officials to take a \u201csmarter approach\u201d, but Hakimzadeh says it will not change the fact that once a \u201cperson knows the basics of what will happen there, it will help them adapt.\u201d\u201cAt the very least,\u201d adds one of the contributors who asked to remain unnamed, \u201cit lets them know they are not alone. Others have gone through this ordeal in the past, and some of those people are safe now.\u201d The Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

Many are already being circulated on social media by Iranians. There\u2019s the one where foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in his shirtsleeves, is waving a draft of the agreement that he needed to get back to, or the one where he is holding both ears to hear the shouts of the reporters below. Whatever the moment, there is a constant: the ornamental cast iron grill of the 19th century balcony of the Hotel Palais Coburg frames each shot. This balcony has now entered the annals of international conflict resolution and Iranian political history.Watching these images, other moments from Iran\u2019s past come to mind that are framed by distinct architecture. The year is 1943. The world is at war. Britain, the US and the USSR must develop a coordinated strategy to defeat Hitler. The British in the south of the country and the Soviets in the north have occupied Iran from the start of the conflict. Stalin will only meet Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, as he ostensibly wants to be near Moscow. The official photographs of the three statesmen after they conclude the Tehran conference are taken on the veranda of the Soviet Union embassy in downtown Tehran, a stones throw away from the British embassy compound. They sit between hulking white columns with large arched windows behind them.Iran is at this time an underdeveloped country and in the grip of severe food shortages. Reza Shah has been forced to abdicate his throne and leave the country. His young son, Mohammad Reza, is put on the throne by the British.The Tehran Conference will lead to a new strategy that will help the allies win the war against fascism. Iran will provide the oil for the war effort, and the corridor for supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union. It will be known as the \u201cBridge To Victory\u201d by the Allies.Iranians themselves will neither be informed of this vital meeting on their soil nor invited to it. Churchill will summon the young Shah to the embassy for a brief meeting. Stalin is the only leader who will visit him in his palace as a monarch. And even then he will have his arm twisted. The oil that will help win the war against fascism does not belong to Iranians - yet. It will be another decade before Mohammad Mossadeq nationalises the Iranian oil industry, and in the process engineer his own demise.On another veranda less than a mile north of the embassies, we can see tracks of a tank in a private garden. The house is a large house by Iranian standards with plaster colonnades characteristic of Qajar architecture. There is no one on the porch that is daubed in slogans declaring Death to Mossadeq. It is 19 of August 1953. The Anglo American coup conceived by the British and conducted by the CIA has been successful. Mobs and a tank have overrun the premier\u2019s house. There are papers strewn all across the garden. Mossadeq has been arrested. He will die in exile in his garden outside the boundaries of Tehran under house arrest. He will be buried in the front room of his rural home. Even in death, he will not find reprieve from his exile. He must be forgotten even as the country enjoys the riches of the oil that he freed for them. On a shelf in the room next to this makeshift mausoleum is a picture of the premier smartly dressed in a sharp suit standing atop a platform, smiling next to the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. It is 1951 and he has just delivered an emotive speech drawing parallels between the American emancipation from the British in 1776 and Iran\u2019s attempts to nationalize its oil industry. Back then many Iranians believed that the United States with its constitutional affirmations of freedom, was Iran\u2019s best ally against the old meddling imperial forces of Britain and Russia.A raised small platform in the seminarian city of Qom, 1964. A middle-aged cleric sits slightly elevated on a traditional pulpit above a sea of white turbans. He is preaching to his juniors, deploring a recently passed law that exempts American military personnel from being tried by Iranian courts if they commit a crime in the country. He declares that the Shah\u2019s capitulation law is humiliating. For this he will be slapped by the Shah\u2019s prime minister and eventually exiled, first to Iraq and then to France, only to return 15 years later to become the supreme spiritual leader of Iran after the revolution. On his return he will greet his loyal followers through a raised window at the Refah School for girls. History is framed in the humble wooden struts of the window. There are no balconies here. On the rooftop though, summary executions of those close to the ousted Shah will take place during the night. During the day, the school yard heaves with the mass of people who have come to hear Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini speak of his vision for a new Iran. It\u2019s Februaury 1979.A little further north on a boulevard named after the legendary throne of a Persian king, the American eagle is about to come under assault. It\u2019s mid autumn and it\u2019s payback time. Men are climbing over the wrought iron gates of the United States embassy in Tehran. There is a short flight of steps to the solid entrance of the two story red brick building with an austere 1930s utilitarian design. The Americans staff call the building \u201cHenderson High\u201d because it looks like the high schools built back in the United States. Soon there will be men blindfolded and marched down those concrete steps for the world to see. There is no turning back now. We will shock the world. We will break the rules and step on the soil of a sovereign nation uninvited and treat its citizens with contempt.We will behave in a belligerent way because we are tired of being pushed around. The hostages will be released after 444 days. But during that time we will become increasingly alone in the world. We will feel this in the soon-to-come eight year war with our neighbour. We will feel isolated and we will wear this isolation with an angry pride. Our young will perish in a seemingly endless war; the world will watch as they are gassed by Saddam. But we will resist. Every year we will burn the American flag, chanting Death to America in front of what we now call the nest of spies. This will become the favourite spectacle of the world press.And the world press will stand under the balcony of the Cobourg Palais hotel for 17 days and watch us end our standoff with the world. More reporters will hover on the hot pavements of our capital waiting for what is now another Iranian spectacle, the street celebrations. We will come and they will see us dance and they will ask us about the sanctions and the centrifuges, the economy and the future, they will take pictures of how our women dress.On the many balconies of the city, we will watch the celebrations and share a multitude of images on our smartphones from the day history became brighter from a balcony in Vienna. We will discuss the implications endlessly. Will the end of sanctions make life easier? Were we right to give up our centrifuges? Will this new deal make us acceptable in polite international company? What will the future hold? How soon and how meaningful will the changes be?We will share hopes and doubts knowing the answer to these questions will take a while to manifest, but one thing is certain, even as we feel that we have lost time and life to our revolution, we are also aware that we have come a long way from that balcony in the Soviet embassy.

September 2009 The US president, Barack Obama, reveals the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near the Iranian city of Qom.

In the capital Tehran, over 1000 candidates are competing for just 30 seats.Earlier this week Iran\u2019s interior ministry finalised the full list of approved candidates for the parliamentary election, due on 26 February, after the Guardian Council blocked a significant number of reformist contenders during the vetting process. On the same day, Iran will also hold the election for the next Assembly of Experts, an influential clerical body in charge of appointing the supreme leader. Both elections are a battleground between hardliners already in power and moderate and pro-reform figures seeking a comeback. The outcome will have significant consequences for the president, Hassan Rouhani, in the remaining two years of his term and will affect his chances of seeking re-election next year. Despite widespread disqualifications, reformists are pulling out all the stops to make sure fewer hardliners will enter the next parliament, or Majlis, according to Mohammadreza Jalaeipour, an Iranian reformist political activist now at Harvard University. \u201cReformists from all different parties have put aside their differences after many years to agree on a joint list of candidates in an unprecedented form of coalition aimed at blocking hardliners from entering the parliament,\u201d he told the Guardian. The reformists\u2019 patron is former president Mohammad Khatami, who faces restrictions on his movement and activities but is leading from behind the scenes. The reformists\u2019 joint list of 30 candidates who they want to enter the Majlis from the capital is led by Mohammad Reza Aref, an influential figure whose decision to stand down in the 2013 presidential election in favour of Rouhani was crucial to the latter\u2019s victory. Also on the list is Ali Motahari, the parliament\u2019s sole current outspoken MP \u2013 a rare conservative figure who is also critical of the ruling establishment.  Related: Iran vice-president hails new era after removal of sanctions Jalaeipour said the big challenge facing the reformers is persuading people to turn out and vote. \u201cThere have been a lot of disqualifications but they haven\u2019t purged all the reformists. The ultimate aim for moderates is to have fewer hardliners in the next parliament.\u201d Although initial reports suggest that as few as 100 reformist candidates are among the 6,000 approved for the parliamentary elections by the Guardian Council, it is believed that some pro-reform figures may have been spared from disqualification because their allegiance has been unclear. More than 51% of those who registered for the parliamentary elections have been disqualified. Currently only nine of the Majlis\u2019s 290 members are female. This is unlikely to increase beyond 5%, according to Majlis Monitor, a parliamentary monitoring initiative supported by ASL19 and the University of Toronto.The Assembly of Experts is equally important. \u201cThis is the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that the Assembly of Experts election, usually a lacklustre event, is attracting huge attention internally,\u201d said Majlis Monitor\u2019s Farhad Souzanchi. \u201cBecause of the age of the supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei] \u2013 he is 76 \u2013 and because the assembly lasts for eight years, it is very likely that the people who get into the assembly in this election will choose the next supreme leader, or the new leader himself may well be among those elected.\u201d According to Souzanchi, there is little or no sign of an organised boycott of elections in Iran, in spite of the disqualifications. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like people think a boycott is a viable solution at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a lot of people boycotted under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, hardliners easily dominated the Majlis, which affected everyone. \u201cNow, although there are not many reformist candidates, people are trying to at least block extremists from entering both bodies.\u201dThe Guardian Council\u2019s filtering of the candidates has not stopped polls being competitive. In 2013 Rouhani, an approved candidate, created an extraordinary momentum for change and was elected on a mandate considered at home and abroad to be legitimate. From more than 800 Islamic theologians who registered for the Assembly of Experts, only 161 were approved for the 88-member body. This initially meant that in six provinces, one candidate was standing unopposed, but an election official has since indicated that candidates have been moved to rectify the issue. No women have been allowed to stand. Rouhani is himself a candidate for the assembly and his name is on a list of moderates along with a former reformist president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. According to Hossein Bastani of BBC Persian, if fewer than half of those who voted for Rouhani in 2013 vote for a list of 16 moderate-leaning candidates in Tehran, the three main ultra-conservative leaders \u2013 Ahmad Jannati, Mohammad Yazdi and Mohammad Taghi Mesbah-Yazdi \u2013 will automatically be blocked.

Saffron, king of all spices, is Iran\u2019s red gold, and an ounce of it is even more expensive in some western supermarkets than the precious metal. The lifting of sanctions against the country in mid-January is triggering a fresh demand worldwide as the spice is exported to the US for the first time in 15 years.Saffron is a distinctive flavour in much Persian cuisine and has featured widely in recipes by some of the world\u2019s most famous chefs, but its exports sank under a decade of sanctions as the west severed economic ties with Tehran. Between 80% and 90% of the world\u2019s saffron comes from Iran, but banking and trade restrictions meant Iranian companies faced huge challenges in exporting it abroad, particularly to the US and Europe. Instead, sanctions created a large market for counterfeit, artificially coloured products, and other countries acted as intermediaries by importing the genuine spice from Iran and rebranding and exporting it to the wider world in their own name and at higher prices. Mohammad Javad Rezaie, the head of Iran\u2019s saffron exports development fund, has said that the first shipment will reach the US next week and predicted that the removal of sanctions and direct trade with Europe will boost its exports by 40% in the near future. \u201cAfter the implementation of the nuclear deal between Iran and [the west], a number of countries such as Spain want to directly buy saffron from Iran,\u201d Rezaie told the semi-official Isna news agency.\u201cUnder sanctions, saffron exports fell down significantly \u2026 which made it very difficult to send or receive foreign currency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a request from the US and the first shipment of saffron, weighed at 20kg, will be sent to the US for the first time in 15 years.\u201dIranians believe saffron serves as a natural antidepressant and helps fight Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. It is usually ground and mixed with hot water before being added to rice used alongside a bowl of Persian stew, such as ghormeh sabzi, which is a mixture of sauteed herbs, kidney beans and lamb or beef. It is also generously used in sholeh zard, a rice pudding which people cook and hand out to neighbours and the poor on religious occasions. Saffron\u2019s high price is due to the fact it takes more than 150,000 purple crocus flowers to make one kilogram suitable for sale. Saffron flowers, which have three tiny red stigmas, blossom only a few weeks every autumn and the best time to harvest them is early in the morning. According to a CNN report last year, one gram of good quality saffron can cost $65 (\u00a345). Gholamreza Miri, the vice-president of Iran\u2019s national saffron council, said on Tuesday that Iran has exported $110m worth of saffron in the past 10 months in spite of sanctions, which is 35% less than the same period last year, but he predicted the US sale and lifting of sanctions will spark a boost. \u201cBecause of sanctions, we weren\u2019t able to export saffron to the US but now we can,\u201d he said. According to Iranian officials, Iran has produced a record 310 metric tonnes of saffron this year so far, and a kilo has reached 72m rials (\u00a31,300). In 2014, Iran exported about 170 tonnes of saffron, worth $244m, to a total of 53 countries. Much of it was produced in the northern Khorasan province. In recent years, fluctuation in the local price of saffron has become a huge obstacle to its export. \u201cTraditional cultivation and harvest methods, as well as bulk sales, stand out as the drawbacks of the sector but officials say middlemen and speculators are an additional burden,\u201d according to Iran Daily. Under sanctions, importing saffron to the US was banned and Reuters has reported that American officials have inspected Spanish farms in the past to make sure they were not using Iranian variations in their own exports to the US. Other Iranian products are also allowed for US sale in the post-sanctions era, including caviar, pistachios and carpets. Iran exported more than $600m worth of carpets in 2011 before sanctions were tightened. Last year, Iran was also the world\u2019s top producer of pistachios, ahead of the US.

Iran\u2019s former president, whose political presence faded during the presidencies of Mohammad Khatami and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is once again on the rise. At 81, Rafsanjani is embroiled again in a new political battle. Over the past few years he has gained popularity among \u2018moderates\u2019, a term that has become popular since Hassan Rouhani was elected president in 2013 and which includes some figures previously seen as reformists and others as \u2018principle-ists\u2019. He is already one of the Assembly\u2019s 78 members. This week he was cleared to run again.  Related: Reformer Hassan Khomeini barred from Iran clerical body ballot Saeed Abutaleb, a former principle-ist parliamentary deputy, predicts Rafsanjani is going to have a big win in the Assembly of Experts. \u201cI think not only that Rafsanjani and his allies will be successful in the election, but it\u2019s even possible that Rafsanjani becomes the chairman of the assembly,\u201d he told Tehran Bureau.The next chairman will have a \u201cvery significant\u201d role, said Abutaleb, given the assembly may in its next eight-year term choose a successor to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, who is 76 and in 2014 underwent prostate surgery.And things do not end there for Rafsanjani. His supporters have also geared up for the parliamentary elections, for which significant numbers of moderates leaning toward Rafsanjani have stepped forward.The Guardian Council, which vets candidates for elections, has failed to qualify most of these candidates. But despite all the hurdles, the new \u2018moderate\u2019 faction still has the upper hand in the parliamentary elections, said Sadegh Zibakalam, professor of political science at Tehran University, given they have enough candidates qualified to win more seats than the nearly 30 they hold out of 288, which is about 10%.The Guardian Council is reviewing the mass disqualifications and may reverse itself in some cases. \u201cRafsanjani and the moderates benefitted a lot from all the developments since the establishment of the new government [in 2013], especially the nuclear deal and consequently the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\u201d he told Tehran Bureau. \u201cSo their chances are quite high for the election.\u201dAny successes would leave them well short of a majority, said Abutaleb: \u201cThe next parliament is not going to be dominated by moderates and Rafsanjani\u2019s allies, but I believe their presence would be more significant than the current parliament.\u201dThese days Rafsanjani is far more popular with the public than during the presidencies of Khatami and Ahmadinejad, when he was under constant attack by the government. The roots of this unpopularity lay in his time as president from 1989 to 1997.Prior to becoming president, Rafsanjani also played a key role in Khamenei\u2019s ascent to supreme leader. In 1989 when Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic and its leader, died without designating a replacement, Rafsanjani, then a powerful parliamentary speaker, argued that Khomeini had been in favor of Khamenei\u2019s candidacy. Khamenei was elected as the new supreme leader by the Assembly of Experts in June 1989 and two months later, Rafsanjani took over as the next president.Rafsanjani\u2019s focus was on reviving the country\u2019s war-torn economy through economic liberalisation. Arguably, he was successful as average annual GDP growth was 5.3% during his presidency, far higher than the 1.6% average growth under his predecessor Ali Khamenei (1981-1989).But the Rafsanjani era brought little in the way of political reform or openness. His presidency was a time when dissidents were assassinated in the so-called \u201cchain murders\u201d and when the universities were subjected to tight control.As Rafsanjani\u2019s first term ended in 1993, discontent with his performance, as well as a challenge from three other candidates, saw the 94% of votes he gained in the 1989 election against just one challenger drop to 63%. During the mid-90s, as talk of reform and change emerged and gained momentum, Rafsanjani appeared cautious. When Khatami swept to office in 1997, the Rafsanjani presidency was seen by reformists as \u201cpatriarchal\u201d and financially corrupt. The exposure of the state\u2019s role in the \u201cchain murders\u201d by journalist Akbar Ganji further tainted Rafsanjani among reformists.When he stood in Tehran in the 2000 parliamentary election, Rafsanjani barely made it and later resigned. The reformists held a majority in the parliament, while Rafsanjani\u2019s party, Kargozaran, formed in 1996 largely on a platform of economic development, won around 40 seats. When Rafsanjani ran in the 2005 presidential election, he lost a run-off ballot to the then mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who attacked him, if not by name, as corrupt. Charges of corruption against him and his family ranged from bribery to accumulating illicit wealth through the oil trade, and these continued when Ahmadinejad was president. A leading figure since the 1979 Revolution, Rafsanjani went into political isolation.But 2009 marked a turning point in Rafsanjani\u2019s long career. As protests over the presidential election results erupted, Rafsanjani earned the protesters\u2019 attention by criticising Ahmadinejad\u2019s government. On 17 July, 2009, during his Friday sermon in Tehran, Rafsanjani attacked the authorities for mishandling the protests and called for the release of jailed protesters. That marked his last appearance as Friday prayer speaker, and attacks intensified against Rafsanjani and his family, including daughter Faezeh and son Mohsen. Another son, Mehdi, was briefly detained in 2012 accused of financial crimes and inciting the 2009 post-election unrest, and is now serving ten years in prison.Over the years following the 2009 unrest, Rafsanjani\u2019s political presence was less visible. In March 2011 he stepped down as the chair of the Assembly of Experts. In 2013, he was disqualified from running in the presidential election ostensibly on grounds of age.But since Rouhani took office in August 2013, Rafsanjani has once again publicly engaged in politics while making clear he has revised many of his views. \u201cLooking at Rafsanjani\u2019s political stands and comments over the past few years, we see that his opinions have changed and become more moderate,\u201d said Abutaleb. \u201cNow he is supported not only by reformist intellectuals, but also some of the moderate principle-ists.\u201d Where Rafsanjani once wanted dissident students expelled  from universities, he now calls for more openness in academia. While he once rejected talk of \u201creconciliation with the USA\u201d, by 2012 he expressed support for negotiations with Washington over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and he now insists Iran cannot remain isolated from the US and the rest of the world.And while the morality police was widely set up during Rafsanjani\u2019s presidency, when he supported  enforcing Islamic dress codes and dealing with what he called \u201cmoral corruption\u201d, if needs be by using \u201csome violence\u201d, by 2000 Rafsanjani said the authorities should not interfere unduly in the way people dressed. But Rafsanjani is not the only politician who has changed. The reformists have too, said Zibakalam. \u201cMany of his radical opponents among the reformists and traditional leftists have realised that their strategy of destroying Rafsanjani\u2019s reputation was a big mistake,\u201d he explained.\u201cSo since the Ahmadinejad era, the reformists have got closer to him. Now an unwritten coalition has formed between the reformists and Rafsanjani. And even a wide range of moderate reformists have accepted his leadership.\u201dThe Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

He survived physical and psychological abuse, enduring torture for up to 15 hours a day.Suspecting a fourth arrest was imminent, in 2010 Hakimzadeh fled across the border to Turkey. The Iranian authorities had confiscated his travel documents, and Hakimzadeh took the risk of being shot by border guards to avoid yet another stint in prison.Still, the ordeal he faced over five years ago pales in comparison to what currently awaits activists and journalists who fall into the clutches of Iran\u2019s justice system, he says. Since the unrests of 2009, the Islamic republic expanded its use of legal tools, including capital punishment, to silence dissidents. \u201cThe stakes are much higher now,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. \u201cIn my time, the price you paid for activism was prison. But since the Green Movement, this price has gone up.\u201d Related: Iran's Jila Baniyaghoob on journalism, prison and Rouhani One example is the charge of moharebeh, or \u2018waging war against God\u2019, which carries the death penalty. Iranian authorities have expanded the scope of its definition from \u2018armed war against the state\u2019 and \u2018heresy\u2019 to include \u2018working to undermine the Islamic establishment\u2019 and \u2018cooperating with foreign agents or entities\u2019. This allows Iranian officials to adjust the meaning of moharebeh to apply to anything from an angry post on Facebook or Twitter to participating in a spontaneous protest rally. Hakimzadeh believes there are steps activists in Iran can take to better protect themselves, both inside and outside prison walls. He belongs to a group of over a dozen activists who used their hard-earned personal experiences to create a 19-chapter booklet in Farsi and English titled Safe Activism: Reducing the Risks and Impact of Arrest.Designed to teach activists and journalists how to avoid careless behaviors that could endanger them and those around them, the booklet, now online, also offers guidelines on what to do in case of arrest and how to mitigate the consequences of incarceration.Mahdieh Javid, who left Iran in her early teens, played a crucial role in writing the booklet. Through her work with activists who left Iran between 2009 and 2010, Mahdieh came into contact with activists based in Iran and made an alarming discovery. \u201cWe realized that many instances of arrest could have been avoided by taking a few simple measures,\u201d she says of her motivation for spearheading the project. \u201cThese issues are not talked about or sufficiently discussed. Many of the mistakes are repeated.\u201dThese basic safety measures are highlighted in the first chapters of the \u2018Safe Activism\u2019 booklet. Readers are reminded to take precautions before meeting with other activists and not communicate important information over the phone. They are advised to keep sensitive documents as well as identification papers and travel documents at a safe place outside their residence, and to clear their homes of illegal items like drugs, alcohol and banned media.Mehdi Aminizadeh, another activist who contributed to the project, says his family sent him books from his home library during one of his four stints in prison, without realizing one of them was contraband. Possession of that banned book was later added to his charges. The guide also devotes a section to digital security. Readers are advised to memorize phone numbers, addresses and other sensitive information instead of recording them. The booklet recommends using a different email address for activism-related exchanges, and preventing the recovery of deleted files by using software like File Shredder. Looking back, Hakimzadeh says one of his biggest mistakes was writing an email to his girlfriend with instructions on what to do if he was detained. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I had kept the file on my computer or deleted it and they managed to recover it, but my interrogators knew about it and used it against me.\u201dKeeping insanity at bayActivists have no real way of telling when and if they will be arrested or how serious their punishment will be. The arrest strategies employed by Iranian officials also differ. Some arrests are quick and predictable while others come as a surprise as authorities take time to \u2018gather information and get to know the person better.\u2019\u201cFor others, they prepare a scenario and wait for certain things to transpire before playing out that scenario...They let the fruit ripen first and then pluck it,\u201d says Hakimzadeh.The booklet gives readers insight into what to expect during arrest and prison admission, as well as tactics commonly used by interrogators: threatening physical harm and arresting the subject\u2019s family members, employing physical and psychological torture, sexual assault, as well as performing random acts of kindness. Readers are also advised to not incriminate others when \u2018confessing\u2019. In written confessions, the authors recommend giving vague answers and including the interrogator\u2019s questions in their statements. They advise detainees to write what is in their best interest as opposed to what they told the interrogator. To prevent prosecutors from using the confession as evidence against them in a later case, the detainees should number and date all pages. They should also prevent additions by crossing out all blank spaces. Detainees may also write illegibly and scratch out words to make their confessions inadmissible in court.Preparing activists for solitary confinement, a common method used to break detainees, is perhaps one of the most significant undertakings of the guide. Hakimzadeh, who spent a total of 190 days in solitary, describes it as a vacuum that felt like death. \u201cI haven\u2019t experienced death but I think this is how it must feel. It is very sudden and unexpected. In an instant, you are cut off from everyone and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do trivial things that were once normal and you took for granted like opening a door, looking at yourself in the mirror, or checking the time on your cellphone.\u201dAs time went by, exercise, meditation, positive thoughts and cleaning his cell, among other things, helped Hakimzadeh keep insanity at bay. \u201cI had a Quran and a prayer book in my cell and I would study them and take notes with the pen and paper I had found and managed to hide,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving writing material was illegal there. I would think about my notes and have discussions about them with myself. I would talk to myself. I would walk in my cell for hours.\u201dThe Safe Activism booklet is not the first of its kind, but its writers believe that it is more current on the methods used by Iranian authorities. Compiled by a large group of activists whose ordeals of persecution and incarceration are recent, the booklet incorporates the voices of student activists, women\u2019s rights activists and the Green Movement as well as other groups. \u201cSome of the items were new even to me, for instance I knew what happens to political and student activists in section 209 [of Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison], but I didn\u2019t know about what happens to prisoners in other cities like Sanandaj or Ahvaz or to religious minorities. This booklet includes their experiences too,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. While the intended audience of the booklet are activists in Iran, its online nature also gives Islamic republic authorities access to its volume of information. However, the writers of Safe Activism are not concerned that revealing the methods used to persecute activists will result in a change of tactics.Reading the booklet could lead Iranian officials to take a \u201csmarter approach\u201d, but Hakimzadeh says it will not change the fact that once a \u201cperson knows the basics of what will happen there, it will help them adapt.\u201d\u201cAt the very least,\u201d adds one of the contributors who asked to remain unnamed, \u201cit lets them know they are not alone. Others have gone through this ordeal in the past, and some of those people are safe now.\u201d The Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

Many are already being circulated on social media by Iranians. There\u2019s the one where foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in his shirtsleeves, is waving a draft of the agreement that he needed to get back to, or the one where he is holding both ears to hear the shouts of the reporters below. Whatever the moment, there is a constant: the ornamental cast iron grill of the 19th century balcony of the Hotel Palais Coburg frames each shot. This balcony has now entered the annals of international conflict resolution and Iranian political history.Watching these images, other moments from Iran\u2019s past come to mind that are framed by distinct architecture. The year is 1943. The world is at war. Britain, the US and the USSR must develop a coordinated strategy to defeat Hitler. The British in the south of the country and the Soviets in the north have occupied Iran from the start of the conflict. Stalin will only meet Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, as he ostensibly wants to be near Moscow. The official photographs of the three statesmen after they conclude the Tehran conference are taken on the veranda of the Soviet Union embassy in downtown Tehran, a stones throw away from the British embassy compound. They sit between hulking white columns with large arched windows behind them.Iran is at this time an underdeveloped country and in the grip of severe food shortages. Reza Shah has been forced to abdicate his throne and leave the country. His young son, Mohammad Reza, is put on the throne by the British.The Tehran Conference will lead to a new strategy that will help the allies win the war against fascism. Iran will provide the oil for the war effort, and the corridor for supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union. It will be known as the \u201cBridge To Victory\u201d by the Allies.Iranians themselves will neither be informed of this vital meeting on their soil nor invited to it. Churchill will summon the young Shah to the embassy for a brief meeting. Stalin is the only leader who will visit him in his palace as a monarch. And even then he will have his arm twisted. The oil that will help win the war against fascism does not belong to Iranians - yet. It will be another decade before Mohammad Mossadeq nationalises the Iranian oil industry, and in the process engineer his own demise.On another veranda less than a mile north of the embassies, we can see tracks of a tank in a private garden. The house is a large house by Iranian standards with plaster colonnades characteristic of Qajar architecture. There is no one on the porch that is daubed in slogans declaring Death to Mossadeq. It is 19 of August 1953. The Anglo American coup conceived by the British and conducted by the CIA has been successful. Mobs and a tank have overrun the premier\u2019s house. There are papers strewn all across the garden. Mossadeq has been arrested. He will die in exile in his garden outside the boundaries of Tehran under house arrest. He will be buried in the front room of his rural home. Even in death, he will not find reprieve from his exile. He must be forgotten even as the country enjoys the riches of the oil that he freed for them. On a shelf in the room next to this makeshift mausoleum is a picture of the premier smartly dressed in a sharp suit standing atop a platform, smiling next to the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. It is 1951 and he has just delivered an emotive speech drawing parallels between the American emancipation from the British in 1776 and Iran\u2019s attempts to nationalize its oil industry. Back then many Iranians believed that the United States with its constitutional affirmations of freedom, was Iran\u2019s best ally against the old meddling imperial forces of Britain and Russia.A raised small platform in the seminarian city of Qom, 1964. A middle-aged cleric sits slightly elevated on a traditional pulpit above a sea of white turbans. He is preaching to his juniors, deploring a recently passed law that exempts American military personnel from being tried by Iranian courts if they commit a crime in the country. He declares that the Shah\u2019s capitulation law is humiliating. For this he will be slapped by the Shah\u2019s prime minister and eventually exiled, first to Iraq and then to France, only to return 15 years later to become the supreme spiritual leader of Iran after the revolution. On his return he will greet his loyal followers through a raised window at the Refah School for girls. History is framed in the humble wooden struts of the window. There are no balconies here. On the rooftop though, summary executions of those close to the ousted Shah will take place during the night. During the day, the school yard heaves with the mass of people who have come to hear Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini speak of his vision for a new Iran. It\u2019s Februaury 1979.A little further north on a boulevard named after the legendary throne of a Persian king, the American eagle is about to come under assault. It\u2019s mid autumn and it\u2019s payback time. Men are climbing over the wrought iron gates of the United States embassy in Tehran. There is a short flight of steps to the solid entrance of the two story red brick building with an austere 1930s utilitarian design. The Americans staff call the building \u201cHenderson High\u201d because it looks like the high schools built back in the United States. Soon there will be men blindfolded and marched down those concrete steps for the world to see. There is no turning back now. We will shock the world. We will break the rules and step on the soil of a sovereign nation uninvited and treat its citizens with contempt.We will behave in a belligerent way because we are tired of being pushed around. The hostages will be released after 444 days. But during that time we will become increasingly alone in the world. We will feel this in the soon-to-come eight year war with our neighbour. We will feel isolated and we will wear this isolation with an angry pride. Our young will perish in a seemingly endless war; the world will watch as they are gassed by Saddam. But we will resist. Every year we will burn the American flag, chanting Death to America in front of what we now call the nest of spies. This will become the favourite spectacle of the world press.And the world press will stand under the balcony of the Cobourg Palais hotel for 17 days and watch us end our standoff with the world. More reporters will hover on the hot pavements of our capital waiting for what is now another Iranian spectacle, the street celebrations. We will come and they will see us dance and they will ask us about the sanctions and the centrifuges, the economy and the future, they will take pictures of how our women dress.On the many balconies of the city, we will watch the celebrations and share a multitude of images on our smartphones from the day history became brighter from a balcony in Vienna. We will discuss the implications endlessly. Will the end of sanctions make life easier? Were we right to give up our centrifuges? Will this new deal make us acceptable in polite international company? What will the future hold? How soon and how meaningful will the changes be?We will share hopes and doubts knowing the answer to these questions will take a while to manifest, but one thing is certain, even as we feel that we have lost time and life to our revolution, we are also aware that we have come a long way from that balcony in the Soviet embassy.

October 2003 Under threat of referral to the UN security council, Iran reaches an agreement with the EU-3, known as the Tehran Declaration. Iran agrees to cooperate fully with the IAEA and suspend all uranium enrichment. August 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is elected president of Iran.

September 2009 The US president, Barack Obama, reveals the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near the Iranian city of Qom.

The phone call, as well as a meeting between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, a day earlier, is seen as the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the countries.

In the capital Tehran, over 1000 candidates are competing for just 30 seats.Earlier this week Iran\u2019s interior ministry finalised the full list of approved candidates for the parliamentary election, due on 26 February, after the Guardian Council blocked a significant number of reformist contenders during the vetting process. On the same day, Iran will also hold the election for the next Assembly of Experts, an influential clerical body in charge of appointing the supreme leader. Both elections are a battleground between hardliners already in power and moderate and pro-reform figures seeking a comeback. The outcome will have significant consequences for the president, Hassan Rouhani, in the remaining two years of his term and will affect his chances of seeking re-election next year. Despite widespread disqualifications, reformists are pulling out all the stops to make sure fewer hardliners will enter the next parliament, or Majlis, according to Mohammadreza Jalaeipour, an Iranian reformist political activist now at Harvard University. \u201cReformists from all different parties have put aside their differences after many years to agree on a joint list of candidates in an unprecedented form of coalition aimed at blocking hardliners from entering the parliament,\u201d he told the Guardian. The reformists\u2019 patron is former president Mohammad Khatami, who faces restrictions on his movement and activities but is leading from behind the scenes. The reformists\u2019 joint list of 30 candidates who they want to enter the Majlis from the capital is led by Mohammad Reza Aref, an influential figure whose decision to stand down in the 2013 presidential election in favour of Rouhani was crucial to the latter\u2019s victory. Also on the list is Ali Motahari, the parliament\u2019s sole current outspoken MP \u2013 a rare conservative figure who is also critical of the ruling establishment.  Related: Iran vice-president hails new era after removal of sanctions Jalaeipour said the big challenge facing the reformers is persuading people to turn out and vote. \u201cThere have been a lot of disqualifications but they haven\u2019t purged all the reformists. The ultimate aim for moderates is to have fewer hardliners in the next parliament.\u201d Although initial reports suggest that as few as 100 reformist candidates are among the 6,000 approved for the parliamentary elections by the Guardian Council, it is believed that some pro-reform figures may have been spared from disqualification because their allegiance has been unclear. More than 51% of those who registered for the parliamentary elections have been disqualified. Currently only nine of the Majlis\u2019s 290 members are female. This is unlikely to increase beyond 5%, according to Majlis Monitor, a parliamentary monitoring initiative supported by ASL19 and the University of Toronto.The Assembly of Experts is equally important. \u201cThis is the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that the Assembly of Experts election, usually a lacklustre event, is attracting huge attention internally,\u201d said Majlis Monitor\u2019s Farhad Souzanchi. \u201cBecause of the age of the supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei] \u2013 he is 76 \u2013 and because the assembly lasts for eight years, it is very likely that the people who get into the assembly in this election will choose the next supreme leader, or the new leader himself may well be among those elected.\u201d According to Souzanchi, there is little or no sign of an organised boycott of elections in Iran, in spite of the disqualifications. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like people think a boycott is a viable solution at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a lot of people boycotted under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, hardliners easily dominated the Majlis, which affected everyone. \u201cNow, although there are not many reformist candidates, people are trying to at least block extremists from entering both bodies.\u201dThe Guardian Council\u2019s filtering of the candidates has not stopped polls being competitive. In 2013 Rouhani, an approved candidate, created an extraordinary momentum for change and was elected on a mandate considered at home and abroad to be legitimate. From more than 800 Islamic theologians who registered for the Assembly of Experts, only 161 were approved for the 88-member body. This initially meant that in six provinces, one candidate was standing unopposed, but an election official has since indicated that candidates have been moved to rectify the issue. No women have been allowed to stand. Rouhani is himself a candidate for the assembly and his name is on a list of moderates along with a former reformist president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. According to Hossein Bastani of BBC Persian, if fewer than half of those who voted for Rouhani in 2013 vote for a list of 16 moderate-leaning candidates in Tehran, the three main ultra-conservative leaders \u2013 Ahmad Jannati, Mohammad Yazdi and Mohammad Taghi Mesbah-Yazdi \u2013 will automatically be blocked.

Saffron, king of all spices, is Iran\u2019s red gold, and an ounce of it is even more expensive in some western supermarkets than the precious metal. The lifting of sanctions against the country in mid-January is triggering a fresh demand worldwide as the spice is exported to the US for the first time in 15 years.Saffron is a distinctive flavour in much Persian cuisine and has featured widely in recipes by some of the world\u2019s most famous chefs, but its exports sank under a decade of sanctions as the west severed economic ties with Tehran. Between 80% and 90% of the world\u2019s saffron comes from Iran, but banking and trade restrictions meant Iranian companies faced huge challenges in exporting it abroad, particularly to the US and Europe. Instead, sanctions created a large market for counterfeit, artificially coloured products, and other countries acted as intermediaries by importing the genuine spice from Iran and rebranding and exporting it to the wider world in their own name and at higher prices. Mohammad Javad Rezaie, the head of Iran\u2019s saffron exports development fund, has said that the first shipment will reach the US next week and predicted that the removal of sanctions and direct trade with Europe will boost its exports by 40% in the near future. \u201cAfter the implementation of the nuclear deal between Iran and [the west], a number of countries such as Spain want to directly buy saffron from Iran,\u201d Rezaie told the semi-official Isna news agency.\u201cUnder sanctions, saffron exports fell down significantly \u2026 which made it very difficult to send or receive foreign currency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a request from the US and the first shipment of saffron, weighed at 20kg, will be sent to the US for the first time in 15 years.\u201dIranians believe saffron serves as a natural antidepressant and helps fight Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. It is usually ground and mixed with hot water before being added to rice used alongside a bowl of Persian stew, such as ghormeh sabzi, which is a mixture of sauteed herbs, kidney beans and lamb or beef. It is also generously used in sholeh zard, a rice pudding which people cook and hand out to neighbours and the poor on religious occasions. Saffron\u2019s high price is due to the fact it takes more than 150,000 purple crocus flowers to make one kilogram suitable for sale. Saffron flowers, which have three tiny red stigmas, blossom only a few weeks every autumn and the best time to harvest them is early in the morning. According to a CNN report last year, one gram of good quality saffron can cost $65 (\u00a345). Gholamreza Miri, the vice-president of Iran\u2019s national saffron council, said on Tuesday that Iran has exported $110m worth of saffron in the past 10 months in spite of sanctions, which is 35% less than the same period last year, but he predicted the US sale and lifting of sanctions will spark a boost. \u201cBecause of sanctions, we weren\u2019t able to export saffron to the US but now we can,\u201d he said. According to Iranian officials, Iran has produced a record 310 metric tonnes of saffron this year so far, and a kilo has reached 72m rials (\u00a31,300). In 2014, Iran exported about 170 tonnes of saffron, worth $244m, to a total of 53 countries. Much of it was produced in the northern Khorasan province. In recent years, fluctuation in the local price of saffron has become a huge obstacle to its export. \u201cTraditional cultivation and harvest methods, as well as bulk sales, stand out as the drawbacks of the sector but officials say middlemen and speculators are an additional burden,\u201d according to Iran Daily. Under sanctions, importing saffron to the US was banned and Reuters has reported that American officials have inspected Spanish farms in the past to make sure they were not using Iranian variations in their own exports to the US. Other Iranian products are also allowed for US sale in the post-sanctions era, including caviar, pistachios and carpets. Iran exported more than $600m worth of carpets in 2011 before sanctions were tightened. Last year, Iran was also the world\u2019s top producer of pistachios, ahead of the US.

Iran\u2019s former president, whose political presence faded during the presidencies of Mohammad Khatami and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is once again on the rise. At 81, Rafsanjani is embroiled again in a new political battle. Over the past few years he has gained popularity among \u2018moderates\u2019, a term that has become popular since Hassan Rouhani was elected president in 2013 and which includes some figures previously seen as reformists and others as \u2018principle-ists\u2019. He is already one of the Assembly\u2019s 78 members. This week he was cleared to run again.  Related: Reformer Hassan Khomeini barred from Iran clerical body ballot Saeed Abutaleb, a former principle-ist parliamentary deputy, predicts Rafsanjani is going to have a big win in the Assembly of Experts. \u201cI think not only that Rafsanjani and his allies will be successful in the election, but it\u2019s even possible that Rafsanjani becomes the chairman of the assembly,\u201d he told Tehran Bureau.The next chairman will have a \u201cvery significant\u201d role, said Abutaleb, given the assembly may in its next eight-year term choose a successor to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, who is 76 and in 2014 underwent prostate surgery.And things do not end there for Rafsanjani. His supporters have also geared up for the parliamentary elections, for which significant numbers of moderates leaning toward Rafsanjani have stepped forward.The Guardian Council, which vets candidates for elections, has failed to qualify most of these candidates. But despite all the hurdles, the new \u2018moderate\u2019 faction still has the upper hand in the parliamentary elections, said Sadegh Zibakalam, professor of political science at Tehran University, given they have enough candidates qualified to win more seats than the nearly 30 they hold out of 288, which is about 10%.The Guardian Council is reviewing the mass disqualifications and may reverse itself in some cases. \u201cRafsanjani and the moderates benefitted a lot from all the developments since the establishment of the new government [in 2013], especially the nuclear deal and consequently the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\u201d he told Tehran Bureau. \u201cSo their chances are quite high for the election.\u201dAny successes would leave them well short of a majority, said Abutaleb: \u201cThe next parliament is not going to be dominated by moderates and Rafsanjani\u2019s allies, but I believe their presence would be more significant than the current parliament.\u201dThese days Rafsanjani is far more popular with the public than during the presidencies of Khatami and Ahmadinejad, when he was under constant attack by the government. The roots of this unpopularity lay in his time as president from 1989 to 1997.Prior to becoming president, Rafsanjani also played a key role in Khamenei\u2019s ascent to supreme leader. In 1989 when Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic and its leader, died without designating a replacement, Rafsanjani, then a powerful parliamentary speaker, argued that Khomeini had been in favor of Khamenei\u2019s candidacy. Khamenei was elected as the new supreme leader by the Assembly of Experts in June 1989 and two months later, Rafsanjani took over as the next president.Rafsanjani\u2019s focus was on reviving the country\u2019s war-torn economy through economic liberalisation. Arguably, he was successful as average annual GDP growth was 5.3% during his presidency, far higher than the 1.6% average growth under his predecessor Ali Khamenei (1981-1989).But the Rafsanjani era brought little in the way of political reform or openness. His presidency was a time when dissidents were assassinated in the so-called \u201cchain murders\u201d and when the universities were subjected to tight control.As Rafsanjani\u2019s first term ended in 1993, discontent with his performance, as well as a challenge from three other candidates, saw the 94% of votes he gained in the 1989 election against just one challenger drop to 63%. During the mid-90s, as talk of reform and change emerged and gained momentum, Rafsanjani appeared cautious. When Khatami swept to office in 1997, the Rafsanjani presidency was seen by reformists as \u201cpatriarchal\u201d and financially corrupt. The exposure of the state\u2019s role in the \u201cchain murders\u201d by journalist Akbar Ganji further tainted Rafsanjani among reformists.When he stood in Tehran in the 2000 parliamentary election, Rafsanjani barely made it and later resigned. The reformists held a majority in the parliament, while Rafsanjani\u2019s party, Kargozaran, formed in 1996 largely on a platform of economic development, won around 40 seats. When Rafsanjani ran in the 2005 presidential election, he lost a run-off ballot to the then mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who attacked him, if not by name, as corrupt. Charges of corruption against him and his family ranged from bribery to accumulating illicit wealth through the oil trade, and these continued when Ahmadinejad was president. A leading figure since the 1979 Revolution, Rafsanjani went into political isolation.But 2009 marked a turning point in Rafsanjani\u2019s long career. As protests over the presidential election results erupted, Rafsanjani earned the protesters\u2019 attention by criticising Ahmadinejad\u2019s government. On 17 July, 2009, during his Friday sermon in Tehran, Rafsanjani attacked the authorities for mishandling the protests and called for the release of jailed protesters. That marked his last appearance as Friday prayer speaker, and attacks intensified against Rafsanjani and his family, including daughter Faezeh and son Mohsen. Another son, Mehdi, was briefly detained in 2012 accused of financial crimes and inciting the 2009 post-election unrest, and is now serving ten years in prison.Over the years following the 2009 unrest, Rafsanjani\u2019s political presence was less visible. In March 2011 he stepped down as the chair of the Assembly of Experts. In 2013, he was disqualified from running in the presidential election ostensibly on grounds of age.But since Rouhani took office in August 2013, Rafsanjani has once again publicly engaged in politics while making clear he has revised many of his views. \u201cLooking at Rafsanjani\u2019s political stands and comments over the past few years, we see that his opinions have changed and become more moderate,\u201d said Abutaleb. \u201cNow he is supported not only by reformist intellectuals, but also some of the moderate principle-ists.\u201d Where Rafsanjani once wanted dissident students expelled  from universities, he now calls for more openness in academia. While he once rejected talk of \u201creconciliation with the USA\u201d, by 2012 he expressed support for negotiations with Washington over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and he now insists Iran cannot remain isolated from the US and the rest of the world.And while the morality police was widely set up during Rafsanjani\u2019s presidency, when he supported  enforcing Islamic dress codes and dealing with what he called \u201cmoral corruption\u201d, if needs be by using \u201csome violence\u201d, by 2000 Rafsanjani said the authorities should not interfere unduly in the way people dressed. But Rafsanjani is not the only politician who has changed. The reformists have too, said Zibakalam. \u201cMany of his radical opponents among the reformists and traditional leftists have realised that their strategy of destroying Rafsanjani\u2019s reputation was a big mistake,\u201d he explained.\u201cSo since the Ahmadinejad era, the reformists have got closer to him. Now an unwritten coalition has formed between the reformists and Rafsanjani. And even a wide range of moderate reformists have accepted his leadership.\u201dThe Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

The majority were unwilling to disclose whether they had plans to deal with Iran, a few said there was no change in their existing policy, and the London-based Standard Chartered, which was fined \u00a3400m by the US authorities in 2012, issued a statement to make clear it was not dealing with anyone or any entity that had anything to do with Iran.This contrasts with the desire of European companies and European governments to increase trade with Iran from the current \u20ac7.6bn (\u00a35.8bn) to the pre-sanctions figure of almost \u20ac28bn. An unprecedented number of EU business delegations have already visited Tehran and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, is expected in Rome on Monday and then Paris on Wednesday to revamp Iran\u2019s relations with Europe. Related: Rouhani hails 'turning point' as Iran embraces post-sanctions era \u201cI am yet to find one tier-one European investment bank that wants to go back into Iran,\u201d said a senior European banker who did not want to be named. Sanctions compliance departments in big banks are busy digesting a 50-page guidance provided by the US treasury\u2019s office of foreign assets control (OFAC) \u2013 some say the text is so complicated it may deter businesses from returning to Iran, while others fear it may be open to interpretation.The Guardian visited an HSBC branch in London last week to see if it was possible for an Iranian resident in the UK to open a personal bank account. It was not still possible but that was likely to change in two weeks\u2019 time, a branch officer said. HSBC later issued a statement, saying: \u201cThere are a number of factors we take into consideration when opening a new account and we judge each application on an individual basis.\u201dBarclays, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, RBS, Citi, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank declined to say if an Iranian national unrelated to the Iran government, such as a student, was able to open a personal account with their banks. \u201cDeutsche Bank will, for the time being, stick to its decision of withholding from doing business connected to Iran,\u201d said a spokesperson.The general mood is to wait and let the others risk first. Smaller European banks or those in China and Russia that are not concerned about the US market, however, are more likely to lead the way.Banks are particularly worried about US primary sanctions related to terrorism and human rights violations that remain in place. \u201cWe know the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are sanctioned as a terrorist entity. They own a vast amount of economy through bonyads [trusts], ownership schemes which we can\u2019t fathom, so it\u2019s very difficult to operate in Iran without hitting the Revolutionary Guards or somebody else who is sanctioned by the Americans, and you are extra-territorially sanctioned by the Americans if you do deals with IRGC-linked elements,\u201d the senior banker said.\u201cMoreover, the FATF [an inter-governmental body combating money laundering and terrorist financing] stills views Iran as a non-compliant jurisdiction of money laundering, as we all know corruption is rampant, so it\u2019s not just worth the candle at the moment.\u201dCiting the case of BNP Paribas, which was heavily fined last year over sanctions violations involving Iran, the senior banker said European banks were worried that the US could ban them from dollars in the US capital market.\u201cSanctions are still in place in the US really. It\u2019s only nuclear-related sanctions that have been relaxed, even if you even open an office in Tehran and you\u2019re using Microsoft operating system, you can still be in trouble,\u201d said the banker.\u201cIt\u2019s not just OFAC, you\u2019ve got other regulatory authorities in the US, which are not as transparent about their guidelines, particularly New York department of financial services, which doesn\u2019t offer FAQs and won\u2019t meet non-American entities to discuss issues about sanctions. You\u2019ve got the Federal Reserve, you\u2019ve got a lot of agencies out there which can punish you for the same offence, so it\u2019s not just OFAC. Whoever goes in first they're going to be watched like a hawk by those who oppose the deal\u201cThere\u2019s also a reputational risk, whoever goes in first they\u2019re going to be watched like a hawk by those who oppose the deal, the Israelis, Saudi Arabians, Republican American entities,\u201d the banker said, saying that his bank was particularly under pressure from the US pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC. \u201cI can\u2019t see any movement for at least six to 12 months.\u201dThe banker added: \u201cMost banks in Europe and UK have been sanctioned for transgression on Iran, and some of them have entered agreement with OFAC, what\u2019s called the deferred prosecution agreement, where they\u2019ve said they won\u2019t do any deals with Iran, so do they break that agreement, has that agreement changed?\u201dIran\u2019s Middle East Bank said this week it has requested to be linked up with 40 international banks through the Swift global transaction network. \u201cMy feeling is it is going to take a couple of weeks or so before we start to see proper re-engagement. It will be slowly, slowly,\u201d the bank\u2019s head, Parviz Aghili, told Reuters.Many services are denied to Iranians not because providers are legally bound to refuse them but because they err on the side of safety for fear of running foul of the policy. At least one Iranian said his account was closed down recently after 10 years. \u201cI know six other ordinary Iranians in the UK who\u2019ve had their bank accounts closed abruptly,\u201d he told the Guardian.A businessman from Switzerland who visited two major Swiss banks this week said he was told they were waiting for other banks to try first and see the reaction of the Americans. \u201cBanks are worried about interpretations of these guidances, so they\u2019re still waiting for others to test the water.\u201d Related: The era of sanctions is over in Iran. So why no celebrations? | Azadeh Moaveni Emil Dall, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute who has read the guidance, said European companies still fear being caught up in what remains a complex US sanctions web. He said while the US treasury has offered substantial clarifications, they reveal a number of possible practical complications for EU companies.\u201cOne complication is the matter of the definition of \u2018US control\u2019 or \u2018US ownership\u2019. US-owned or controlled entities will still be bound by the US trade embargo on Iran if a US person holds a 50% or greater stake or \u2018otherwise controls the actions, policies or personnel decisions\u2019 of the entity,\u201d he said. \u201cExactly where the lines of control will be drawn and how the definition will be enforced remains to be seen, but EU companies with a US parent will need to ensure that their business is conducted without US involvement \u2013 whether that be in terms of decisions, materials or support.\u201dHowever, Dall said EU banks can rest assured that they will not be subject to US penalties for their relations with Iranian banks, even if those Iranian banks conduct business with still-sanctioned clients. \u201cThis clarification is highly noteworthy. It was feared that the financial sector would be one of the slowest moving in terms of re-engagement with Iran. This clarification may now alter the calculations of banks, in the process increasing the likelihood that other sectors are less inhibited by their inability to find methods of financing for Iranian trade.\u201d\u201cAll of the clarifications provided by the US and EU authorities make one thing clear: companies looking to re-engage with Iran face a monumental due diligence task in ensuring that their Iranian business does not have a sanctioned beneficiary.\u201d", "tags": ["Iran", "Banking", "Business", "International trade", "Middle East and North Africa", "HSBC", "Deutsche Bank", "Economics", "Global economy", "World news", "European banks", "Financial sector", "Europe"], "title": "Europe's big banks remain wary of doing business with Iran"},{"date": "2015-11-21T14:52:12Z", "content": "A drone has crashed in south-west Iran, the regional governor has told the Fars news agency.It was not clear if the drone, which crashed near Shush city, in Khuzestan province on Friday, had been shot down by Iran or failed due to technical problems.Fars news agency quoted the governor of Shush county as saying a foreign surveillance drone had come down.

He survived physical and psychological abuse, enduring torture for up to 15 hours a day.Suspecting a fourth arrest was imminent, in 2010 Hakimzadeh fled across the border to Turkey. The Iranian authorities had confiscated his travel documents, and Hakimzadeh took the risk of being shot by border guards to avoid yet another stint in prison.Still, the ordeal he faced over five years ago pales in comparison to what currently awaits activists and journalists who fall into the clutches of Iran\u2019s justice system, he says. Since the unrests of 2009, the Islamic republic expanded its use of legal tools, including capital punishment, to silence dissidents. \u201cThe stakes are much higher now,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. \u201cIn my time, the price you paid for activism was prison. But since the Green Movement, this price has gone up.\u201d Related: Iran's Jila Baniyaghoob on journalism, prison and Rouhani One example is the charge of moharebeh, or \u2018waging war against God\u2019, which carries the death penalty. Iranian authorities have expanded the scope of its definition from \u2018armed war against the state\u2019 and \u2018heresy\u2019 to include \u2018working to undermine the Islamic establishment\u2019 and \u2018cooperating with foreign agents or entities\u2019. This allows Iranian officials to adjust the meaning of moharebeh to apply to anything from an angry post on Facebook or Twitter to participating in a spontaneous protest rally. Hakimzadeh believes there are steps activists in Iran can take to better protect themselves, both inside and outside prison walls. He belongs to a group of over a dozen activists who used their hard-earned personal experiences to create a 19-chapter booklet in Farsi and English titled Safe Activism: Reducing the Risks and Impact of Arrest.Designed to teach activists and journalists how to avoid careless behaviors that could endanger them and those around them, the booklet, now online, also offers guidelines on what to do in case of arrest and how to mitigate the consequences of incarceration.Mahdieh Javid, who left Iran in her early teens, played a crucial role in writing the booklet. Through her work with activists who left Iran between 2009 and 2010, Mahdieh came into contact with activists based in Iran and made an alarming discovery. \u201cWe realized that many instances of arrest could have been avoided by taking a few simple measures,\u201d she says of her motivation for spearheading the project. \u201cThese issues are not talked about or sufficiently discussed. Many of the mistakes are repeated.\u201dThese basic safety measures are highlighted in the first chapters of the \u2018Safe Activism\u2019 booklet. Readers are reminded to take precautions before meeting with other activists and not communicate important information over the phone. They are advised to keep sensitive documents as well as identification papers and travel documents at a safe place outside their residence, and to clear their homes of illegal items like drugs, alcohol and banned media.Mehdi Aminizadeh, another activist who contributed to the project, says his family sent him books from his home library during one of his four stints in prison, without realizing one of them was contraband. Possession of that banned book was later added to his charges. The guide also devotes a section to digital security. Readers are advised to memorize phone numbers, addresses and other sensitive information instead of recording them. The booklet recommends using a different email address for activism-related exchanges, and preventing the recovery of deleted files by using software like File Shredder. Looking back, Hakimzadeh says one of his biggest mistakes was writing an email to his girlfriend with instructions on what to do if he was detained. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I had kept the file on my computer or deleted it and they managed to recover it, but my interrogators knew about it and used it against me.\u201dKeeping insanity at bayActivists have no real way of telling when and if they will be arrested or how serious their punishment will be. The arrest strategies employed by Iranian officials also differ. Some arrests are quick and predictable while others come as a surprise as authorities take time to \u2018gather information and get to know the person better.\u2019\u201cFor others, they prepare a scenario and wait for certain things to transpire before playing out that scenario...They let the fruit ripen first and then pluck it,\u201d says Hakimzadeh.The booklet gives readers insight into what to expect during arrest and prison admission, as well as tactics commonly used by interrogators: threatening physical harm and arresting the subject\u2019s family members, employing physical and psychological torture, sexual assault, as well as performing random acts of kindness. Readers are also advised to not incriminate others when \u2018confessing\u2019. In written confessions, the authors recommend giving vague answers and including the interrogator\u2019s questions in their statements. They advise detainees to write what is in their best interest as opposed to what they told the interrogator. To prevent prosecutors from using the confession as evidence against them in a later case, the detainees should number and date all pages. They should also prevent additions by crossing out all blank spaces. Detainees may also write illegibly and scratch out words to make their confessions inadmissible in court.Preparing activists for solitary confinement, a common method used to break detainees, is perhaps one of the most significant undertakings of the guide. Hakimzadeh, who spent a total of 190 days in solitary, describes it as a vacuum that felt like death. \u201cI haven\u2019t experienced death but I think this is how it must feel. It is very sudden and unexpected. In an instant, you are cut off from everyone and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do trivial things that were once normal and you took for granted like opening a door, looking at yourself in the mirror, or checking the time on your cellphone.\u201dAs time went by, exercise, meditation, positive thoughts and cleaning his cell, among other things, helped Hakimzadeh keep insanity at bay. \u201cI had a Quran and a prayer book in my cell and I would study them and take notes with the pen and paper I had found and managed to hide,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving writing material was illegal there. I would think about my notes and have discussions about them with myself. I would talk to myself. I would walk in my cell for hours.\u201dThe Safe Activism booklet is not the first of its kind, but its writers believe that it is more current on the methods used by Iranian authorities. Compiled by a large group of activists whose ordeals of persecution and incarceration are recent, the booklet incorporates the voices of student activists, women\u2019s rights activists and the Green Movement as well as other groups. \u201cSome of the items were new even to me, for instance I knew what happens to political and student activists in section 209 [of Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison], but I didn\u2019t know about what happens to prisoners in other cities like Sanandaj or Ahvaz or to religious minorities. This booklet includes their experiences too,\u201d says Hakimzadeh. While the intended audience of the booklet are activists in Iran, its online nature also gives Islamic republic authorities access to its volume of information. However, the writers of Safe Activism are not concerned that revealing the methods used to persecute activists will result in a change of tactics.Reading the booklet could lead Iranian officials to take a \u201csmarter approach\u201d, but Hakimzadeh says it will not change the fact that once a \u201cperson knows the basics of what will happen there, it will help them adapt.\u201d\u201cAt the very least,\u201d adds one of the contributors who asked to remain unnamed, \u201cit lets them know they are not alone. Others have gone through this ordeal in the past, and some of those people are safe now.\u201d The Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

Many are already being circulated on social media by Iranians. There\u2019s the one where foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in his shirtsleeves, is waving a draft of the agreement that he needed to get back to, or the one where he is holding both ears to hear the shouts of the reporters below. Whatever the moment, there is a constant: the ornamental cast iron grill of the 19th century balcony of the Hotel Palais Coburg frames each shot. This balcony has now entered the annals of international conflict resolution and Iranian political history.Watching these images, other moments from Iran\u2019s past come to mind that are framed by distinct architecture. The year is 1943. The world is at war. Britain, the US and the USSR must develop a coordinated strategy to defeat Hitler. The British in the south of the country and the Soviets in the north have occupied Iran from the start of the conflict. Stalin will only meet Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran, as he ostensibly wants to be near Moscow. The official photographs of the three statesmen after they conclude the Tehran conference are taken on the veranda of the Soviet Union embassy in downtown Tehran, a stones throw away from the British embassy compound. They sit between hulking white columns with large arched windows behind them.Iran is at this time an underdeveloped country and in the grip of severe food shortages. Reza Shah has been forced to abdicate his throne and leave the country. His young son, Mohammad Reza, is put on the throne by the British.The Tehran Conference will lead to a new strategy that will help the allies win the war against fascism. Iran will provide the oil for the war effort, and the corridor for supplies from the Persian Gulf to the Soviet Union. It will be known as the \u201cBridge To Victory\u201d by the Allies.Iranians themselves will neither be informed of this vital meeting on their soil nor invited to it. Churchill will summon the young Shah to the embassy for a brief meeting. Stalin is the only leader who will visit him in his palace as a monarch. And even then he will have his arm twisted. The oil that will help win the war against fascism does not belong to Iranians - yet. It will be another decade before Mohammad Mossadeq nationalises the Iranian oil industry, and in the process engineer his own demise.On another veranda less than a mile north of the embassies, we can see tracks of a tank in a private garden. The house is a large house by Iranian standards with plaster colonnades characteristic of Qajar architecture. There is no one on the porch that is daubed in slogans declaring Death to Mossadeq. It is 19 of August 1953. The Anglo American coup conceived by the British and conducted by the CIA has been successful. Mobs and a tank have overrun the premier\u2019s house. There are papers strewn all across the garden. Mossadeq has been arrested. He will die in exile in his garden outside the boundaries of Tehran under house arrest. He will be buried in the front room of his rural home. Even in death, he will not find reprieve from his exile. He must be forgotten even as the country enjoys the riches of the oil that he freed for them. On a shelf in the room next to this makeshift mausoleum is a picture of the premier smartly dressed in a sharp suit standing atop a platform, smiling next to the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. It is 1951 and he has just delivered an emotive speech drawing parallels between the American emancipation from the British in 1776 and Iran\u2019s attempts to nationalize its oil industry. Back then many Iranians believed that the United States with its constitutional affirmations of freedom, was Iran\u2019s best ally against the old meddling imperial forces of Britain and Russia.A raised small platform in the seminarian city of Qom, 1964. A middle-aged cleric sits slightly elevated on a traditional pulpit above a sea of white turbans. He is preaching to his juniors, deploring a recently passed law that exempts American military personnel from being tried by Iranian courts if they commit a crime in the country. He declares that the Shah\u2019s capitulation law is humiliating. For this he will be slapped by the Shah\u2019s prime minister and eventually exiled, first to Iraq and then to France, only to return 15 years later to become the supreme spiritual leader of Iran after the revolution. On his return he will greet his loyal followers through a raised window at the Refah School for girls. History is framed in the humble wooden struts of the window. There are no balconies here. On the rooftop though, summary executions of those close to the ousted Shah will take place during the night. During the day, the school yard heaves with the mass of people who have come to hear Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini speak of his vision for a new Iran.

It\u2019s mid autumn and it\u2019s payback time. Men are climbing over the wrought iron gates of the United States embassy in Tehran. There is a short flight of steps to the solid entrance of the two story red brick building with an austere 1930s utilitarian design. The Americans staff call the building \u201cHenderson High\u201d because it looks like the high schools built back in the United States. Soon there will be men blindfolded and marched down those concrete steps for the world to see. There is no turning back now. We will shock the world. We will break the rules and step on the soil of a sovereign nation uninvited and treat its citizens with contempt.We will behave in a belligerent way because we are tired of being pushed around. The hostages will be released after 444 days. But during that time we will become increasingly alone in the world. We will feel this in the soon-to-come eight year war with our neighbour. We will feel isolated and we will wear this isolation with an angry pride. Our young will perish in a seemingly endless war; the world will watch as they are gassed by Saddam. But we will resist. Every year we will burn the American flag, chanting Death to America in front of what we now call the nest of spies. This will become the favourite spectacle of the world press.And the world press will stand under the balcony of the Cobourg Palais hotel for 17 days and watch us end our standoff with the world. More reporters will hover on the hot pavements of our capital waiting for what is now another Iranian spectacle, the street celebrations. We will come and they will see us dance and they will ask us about the sanctions and the centrifuges, the economy and the future, they will take pictures of how our women dress.On the many balconies of the city, we will watch the celebrations and share a multitude of images on our smartphones from the day history became brighter from a balcony in Vienna. We will discuss the implications endlessly. Will the end of sanctions make life easier? Were we right to give up our centrifuges? Will this new deal make us acceptable in polite international company? What will the future hold? How soon and how meaningful will the changes be?We will share hopes and doubts knowing the answer to these questions will take a while to manifest, but one thing is certain, even as we feel that we have lost time and life to our revolution, we are also aware that we have come a long way from that balcony in the Soviet embassy.

October 2003 Under threat of referral to the UN security council, Iran reaches an agreement with the EU-3, known as the Tehran Declaration. Iran agrees to cooperate fully with the IAEA and suspend all uranium enrichment. August 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is elected president of Iran. He is seen as supportive of the country\u2019s nuclear programme. August-September 2005 EU-3 deal begins to fall apart as Iran resumes the conversion of uranium at the Isfahan facility. Ahmadinejad gives a speech at the United Nations stating that Iran has the right to develop a nuclear power programme. February 2006 The IAEA votes to report Iran to the UN security council. After the vote, Iran announces it will resume enrichment of uranium. April 2006 Ahmadinejad announces Iran has joined the group of countries that have nuclear technology, but adds that this is purely for providing power, not producing weapons.

September 2009 The US president, Barack Obama, reveals the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near the Iranian city of Qom. The US begins talking seriously about air strikes against Iran, and Israel threatens to take nuclear action. March 2013 The US begins a series of secret talks with Iranian officials, which are kept from its partners in the P5+1. June 2013 Hassan Rouhani is elected president of Iran. He is considered more moderate, pragmatic and willing to negotiate than Ahmadinejad. September 2013 Obama telephones Rouhani, the first contact between leaders of the US and Iran since 1979. The phone call, as well as a meeting between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, a day earlier, is seen as the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the countries. November 2013 Iran and the P5+1 reach an interim agreement, known as the joint plan of action. The agreement limits Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.

In the capital Tehran, over 1000 candidates are competing for just 30 seats.Earlier this week Iran\u2019s interior ministry finalised the full list of approved candidates for the parliamentary election, due on 26 February, after the Guardian Council blocked a significant number of reformist contenders during the vetting process. On the same day, Iran will also hold the election for the next Assembly of Experts, an influential clerical body in charge of appointing the supreme leader. Both elections are a battleground between hardliners already in power and moderate and pro-reform figures seeking a comeback. The outcome will have significant consequences for the president, Hassan Rouhani, in the remaining two years of his term and will affect his chances of seeking re-election next year. Despite widespread disqualifications, reformists are pulling out all the stops to make sure fewer hardliners will enter the next parliament, or Majlis, according to Mohammadreza Jalaeipour, an Iranian reformist political activist now at Harvard University. \u201cReformists from all different parties have put aside their differences after many years to agree on a joint list of candidates in an unprecedented form of coalition aimed at blocking hardliners from entering the parliament,\u201d he told the Guardian. The reformists\u2019 patron is former president Mohammad Khatami, who faces restrictions on his movement and activities but is leading from behind the scenes. The reformists\u2019 joint list of 30 candidates who they want to enter the Majlis from the capital is led by Mohammad Reza Aref, an influential figure whose decision to stand down in the 2013 presidential election in favour of Rouhani was crucial to the latter\u2019s victory. Also on the list is Ali Motahari, the parliament\u2019s sole current outspoken MP \u2013 a rare conservative figure who is also critical of the ruling establishment.  Related: Iran vice-president hails new era after removal of sanctions Jalaeipour said the big challenge facing the reformers is persuading people to turn out and vote. \u201cThere have been a lot of disqualifications but they haven\u2019t purged all the reformists. The ultimate aim for moderates is to have fewer hardliners in the next parliament.\u201d Although initial reports suggest that as few as 100 reformist candidates are among the 6,000 approved for the parliamentary elections by the Guardian Council, it is believed that some pro-reform figures may have been spared from disqualification because their allegiance has been unclear. More than 51% of those who registered for the parliamentary elections have been disqualified. Currently only nine of the Majlis\u2019s 290 members are female. This is unlikely to increase beyond 5%, according to Majlis Monitor, a parliamentary monitoring initiative supported by ASL19 and the University of Toronto.The Assembly of Experts is equally important. \u201cThis is the first time since the 1979 Islamic revolution that the Assembly of Experts election, usually a lacklustre event, is attracting huge attention internally,\u201d said Majlis Monitor\u2019s Farhad Souzanchi. \u201cBecause of the age of the supreme leader [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei] \u2013 he is 76 \u2013 and because the assembly lasts for eight years, it is very likely that the people who get into the assembly in this election will choose the next supreme leader, or the new leader himself may well be among those elected.\u201d According to Souzanchi, there is little or no sign of an organised boycott of elections in Iran, in spite of the disqualifications. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like people think a boycott is a viable solution at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a lot of people boycotted under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, hardliners easily dominated the Majlis, which affected everyone. \u201cNow, although there are not many reformist candidates, people are trying to at least block extremists from entering both bodies.\u201dThe Guardian Council\u2019s filtering of the candidates has not stopped polls being competitive. In 2013 Rouhani, an approved candidate, created an extraordinary momentum for change and was elected on a mandate considered at home and abroad to be legitimate. From more than 800 Islamic theologians who registered for the Assembly of Experts, only 161 were approved for the 88-member body. This initially meant that in six provinces, one candidate was standing unopposed, but an election official has since indicated that candidates have been moved to rectify the issue. No women have been allowed to stand. Rouhani is himself a candidate for the assembly and his name is on a list of moderates along with a former reformist president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. According to Hossein Bastani of BBC Persian, if fewer than half of those who voted for Rouhani in 2013 vote for a list of 16 moderate-leaning candidates in Tehran, the three main ultra-conservative leaders \u2013 Ahmad Jannati, Mohammad Yazdi and Mohammad Taghi Mesbah-Yazdi \u2013 will automatically be blocked.

Saffron, king of all spices, is Iran\u2019s red gold, and an ounce of it is even more expensive in some western supermarkets than the precious metal. The lifting of sanctions against the country in mid-January is triggering a fresh demand worldwide as the spice is exported to the US for the first time in 15 years.Saffron is a distinctive flavour in much Persian cuisine and has featured widely in recipes by some of the world\u2019s most famous chefs, but its exports sank under a decade of sanctions as the west severed economic ties with Tehran. Between 80% and 90% of the world\u2019s saffron comes from Iran, but banking and trade restrictions meant Iranian companies faced huge challenges in exporting it abroad, particularly to the US and Europe. Instead, sanctions created a large market for counterfeit, artificially coloured products, and other countries acted as intermediaries by importing the genuine spice from Iran and rebranding and exporting it to the wider world in their own name and at higher prices. Mohammad Javad Rezaie, the head of Iran\u2019s saffron exports development fund, has said that the first shipment will reach the US next week and predicted that the removal of sanctions and direct trade with Europe will boost its exports by 40% in the near future. \u201cAfter the implementation of the nuclear deal between Iran and [the west], a number of countries such as Spain want to directly buy saffron from Iran,\u201d Rezaie told the semi-official Isna news agency.\u201cUnder sanctions, saffron exports fell down significantly \u2026 which made it very difficult to send or receive foreign currency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a request from the US and the first shipment of saffron, weighed at 20kg, will be sent to the US for the first time in 15 years.\u201dIranians believe saffron serves as a natural antidepressant and helps fight Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. It is usually ground and mixed with hot water before being added to rice used alongside a bowl of Persian stew, such as ghormeh sabzi, which is a mixture of sauteed herbs, kidney beans and lamb or beef. It is also generously used in sholeh zard, a rice pudding which people cook and hand out to neighbours and the poor on religious occasions. Saffron\u2019s high price is due to the fact it takes more than 150,000 purple crocus flowers to make one kilogram suitable for sale. Saffron flowers, which have three tiny red stigmas, blossom only a few weeks every autumn and the best time to harvest them is early in the morning. According to a CNN report last year, one gram of good quality saffron can cost $65 (\u00a345). Gholamreza Miri, the vice-president of Iran\u2019s national saffron council, said on Tuesday that Iran has exported $110m worth of saffron in the past 10 months in spite of sanctions, which is 35% less than the same period last year, but he predicted the US sale and lifting of sanctions will spark a boost. \u201cBecause of sanctions, we weren\u2019t able to export saffron to the US but now we can,\u201d he said. According to Iranian officials, Iran has produced a record 310 metric tonnes of saffron this year so far, and a kilo has reached 72m rials (\u00a31,300). In 2014, Iran exported about 170 tonnes of saffron, worth $244m, to a total of 53 countries. Much of it was produced in the northern Khorasan province. In recent years, fluctuation in the local price of saffron has become a huge obstacle to its export. \u201cTraditional cultivation and harvest methods, as well as bulk sales, stand out as the drawbacks of the sector but officials say middlemen and speculators are an additional burden,\u201d according to Iran Daily. Under sanctions, importing saffron to the US was banned and Reuters has reported that American officials have inspected Spanish farms in the past to make sure they were not using Iranian variations in their own exports to the US. Other Iranian products are also allowed for US sale in the post-sanctions era, including caviar, pistachios and carpets. Iran exported more than $600m worth of carpets in 2011 before sanctions were tightened. Last year, Iran was also the world\u2019s top producer of pistachios, ahead of the US.

Iran\u2019s former president, whose political presence faded during the presidencies of Mohammad Khatami and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is once again on the rise. At 81, Rafsanjani is embroiled again in a new political battle. Over the past few years he has gained popularity among \u2018moderates\u2019, a term that has become popular since Hassan Rouhani was elected president in 2013 and which includes some figures previously seen as reformists and others as \u2018principle-ists\u2019. He is already one of the Assembly\u2019s 78 members. This week he was cleared to run again.  Related: Reformer Hassan Khomeini barred from Iran clerical body ballot Saeed Abutaleb, a former principle-ist parliamentary deputy, predicts Rafsanjani is going to have a big win in the Assembly of Experts. \u201cI think not only that Rafsanjani and his allies will be successful in the election, but it\u2019s even possible that Rafsanjani becomes the chairman of the assembly,\u201d he told Tehran Bureau.The next chairman will have a \u201cvery significant\u201d role, said Abutaleb, given the assembly may in its next eight-year term choose a successor to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, who is 76 and in 2014 underwent prostate surgery.And things do not end there for Rafsanjani. His supporters have also geared up for the parliamentary elections, for which significant numbers of moderates leaning toward Rafsanjani have stepped forward.The Guardian Council, which vets candidates for elections, has failed to qualify most of these candidates. But despite all the hurdles, the new \u2018moderate\u2019 faction still has the upper hand in the parliamentary elections, said Sadegh Zibakalam, professor of political science at Tehran University, given they have enough candidates qualified to win more seats than the nearly 30 they hold out of 288, which is about 10%.The Guardian Council is reviewing the mass disqualifications and may reverse itself in some cases. \u201cRafsanjani and the moderates benefitted a lot from all the developments since the establishment of the new government [in 2013], especially the nuclear deal and consequently the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\u201d he told Tehran Bureau. \u201cSo their chances are quite high for the election.\u201dAny successes would leave them well short of a majority, said Abutaleb: \u201cThe next parliament is not going to be dominated by moderates and Rafsanjani\u2019s allies, but I believe their presence would be more significant than the current parliament.\u201dThese days Rafsanjani is far more popular with the public than during the presidencies of Khatami and Ahmadinejad, when he was under constant attack by the government. The roots of this unpopularity lay in his time as president from 1989 to 1997.Prior to becoming president, Rafsanjani also played a key role in Khamenei\u2019s ascent to supreme leader. In 1989 when Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic and its leader, died without designating a replacement, Rafsanjani, then a powerful parliamentary speaker, argued that Khomeini had been in favor of Khamenei\u2019s candidacy. Khamenei was elected as the new supreme leader by the Assembly of Experts in June 1989 and two months later, Rafsanjani took over as the next president.Rafsanjani\u2019s focus was on reviving the country\u2019s war-torn economy through economic liberalisation. Arguably, he was successful as average annual GDP growth was 5.3% during his presidency, far higher than the 1.6% average growth under his predecessor Ali Khamenei (1981-1989).But the Rafsanjani era brought little in the way of political reform or openness. His presidency was a time when dissidents were assassinated in the so-called \u201cchain murders\u201d and when the universities were subjected to tight control.As Rafsanjani\u2019s first term ended in 1993, discontent with his performance, as well as a challenge from three other candidates, saw the 94% of votes he gained in the 1989 election against just one challenger drop to 63%. During the mid-90s, as talk of reform and change emerged and gained momentum, Rafsanjani appeared cautious. When Khatami swept to office in 1997, the Rafsanjani presidency was seen by reformists as \u201cpatriarchal\u201d and financially corrupt. The exposure of the state\u2019s role in the \u201cchain murders\u201d by journalist Akbar Ganji further tainted Rafsanjani among reformists.When he stood in Tehran in the 2000 parliamentary election, Rafsanjani barely made it and later resigned. The reformists held a majority in the parliament, while Rafsanjani\u2019s party, Kargozaran, formed in 1996 largely on a platform of economic development, won around 40 seats. When Rafsanjani ran in the 2005 presidential election, he lost a run-off ballot to the then mayor of Tehran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who attacked him, if not by name, as corrupt. Charges of corruption against him and his family ranged from bribery to accumulating illicit wealth through the oil trade, and these continued when Ahmadinejad was president. A leading figure since the 1979 Revolution, Rafsanjani went into political isolation.But 2009 marked a turning point in Rafsanjani\u2019s long career. As protests over the presidential election results erupted, Rafsanjani earned the protesters\u2019 attention by criticising Ahmadinejad\u2019s government. On 17 July, 2009, during his Friday sermon in Tehran, Rafsanjani attacked the authorities for mishandling the protests and called for the release of jailed protesters. That marked his last appearance as Friday prayer speaker, and attacks intensified against Rafsanjani and his family, including daughter Faezeh and son Mohsen. Another son, Mehdi, was briefly detained in 2012 accused of financial crimes and inciting the 2009 post-election unrest, and is now serving ten years in prison.Over the years following the 2009 unrest, Rafsanjani\u2019s political presence was less visible. In March 2011 he stepped down as the chair of the Assembly of Experts. In 2013, he was disqualified from running in the presidential election ostensibly on grounds of age.But since Rouhani took office in August 2013, Rafsanjani has once again publicly engaged in politics while making clear he has revised many of his views. \u201cLooking at Rafsanjani\u2019s political stands and comments over the past few years, we see that his opinions have changed and become more moderate,\u201d said Abutaleb. \u201cNow he is supported not only by reformist intellectuals, but also some of the moderate principle-ists.\u201d Where Rafsanjani once wanted dissident students expelled  from universities, he now calls for more openness in academia. While he once rejected talk of \u201creconciliation with the USA\u201d, by 2012 he expressed support for negotiations with Washington over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and he now insists Iran cannot remain isolated from the US and the rest of the world.And while the morality police was widely set up during Rafsanjani\u2019s presidency, when he supported  enforcing Islamic dress codes and dealing with what he called \u201cmoral corruption\u201d, if needs be by using \u201csome violence\u201d, by 2000 Rafsanjani said the authorities should not interfere unduly in the way people dressed. But Rafsanjani is not the only politician who has changed. The reformists have too, said Zibakalam. \u201cMany of his radical opponents among the reformists and traditional leftists have realised that their strategy of destroying Rafsanjani\u2019s reputation was a big mistake,\u201d he explained.\u201cSo since the Ahmadinejad era, the reformists have got closer to him. Now an unwritten coalition has formed between the reformists and Rafsanjani. And even a wide range of moderate reformists have accepted his leadership.\u201dThe Tehran Bureau is an independent media organisation, hosted by the Guardian.

The majority were unwilling to disclose whether they had plans to deal with Iran, a few said there was no change in their existing policy, and the London-based Standard Chartered, which was fined \u00a3400m by the US authorities in 2012, issued a statement to make clear it was not dealing with anyone or any entity that had anything to do with Iran.This contrasts with the desire of European companies and European governments to increase trade with Iran from the current \u20ac7.6bn (\u00a35.8bn) to the pre-sanctions figure of almost \u20ac28bn. An unprecedented number of EU business delegations have already visited Tehran and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, is expected in Rome on Monday and then Paris on Wednesday to revamp Iran\u2019s relations with Europe. Related: Rouhani hails 'turning point' as Iran embraces post-sanctions era \u201cI am yet to find one tier-one European investment bank that wants to go back into Iran,\u201d said a senior European banker who did not want to be named. Sanctions compliance departments in big banks are busy digesting a 50-page guidance provided by the US treasury\u2019s office of foreign assets control (OFAC) \u2013 some say the text is so complicated it may deter businesses from returning to Iran, while others fear it may be open to interpretation.The Guardian visited an HSBC branch in London last week to see if it was possible for an Iranian resident in the UK to open a personal bank account. It was not still possible but that was likely to change in two weeks\u2019 time, a branch officer said. HSBC later issued a statement, saying: \u201cThere are a number of factors we take into consideration when opening a new account and we judge each application on an individual basis.\u201dBarclays, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, RBS, Citi, Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank declined to say if an Iranian national unrelated to the Iran government, such as a student, was able to open a personal account with their banks. \u201cDeutsche Bank will, for the time being, stick to its decision of withholding from doing business connected to Iran,\u201d said a spokesperson.The general mood is to wait and let the others risk first. Smaller European banks or those in China and Russia that are not concerned about the US market, however, are more likely to lead the way.Banks are particularly worried about US primary sanctions related to terrorism and human rights violations that remain in place. \u201cWe know the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are sanctioned as a terrorist entity. They own a vast amount of economy through bonyads [trusts], ownership schemes which we can\u2019t fathom, so it\u2019s very difficult to operate in Iran without hitting the Revolutionary Guards or somebody else who is sanctioned by the Americans, and you are extra-territorially sanctioned by the Americans if you do deals with IRGC-linked elements,\u201d the senior banker said.\u201cMoreover, the FATF [an inter-governmental body combating money laundering and terrorist financing] stills views Iran as a non-compliant jurisdiction of money laundering, as we all know corruption is rampant, so it\u2019s not just worth the candle at the moment.\u201dCiting the case of BNP Paribas, which was heavily fined last year over sanctions violations involving Iran, the senior banker said European banks were worried that the US could ban them from dollars in the US capital market.\u201cSanctions are still in place in the US really. It\u2019s only nuclear-related sanctions that have been relaxed, even if you even open an office in Tehran and you\u2019re using Microsoft operating system, you can still be in trouble,\u201d said the banker.\u201cIt\u2019s not just OFAC, you\u2019ve got other regulatory authorities in the US, which are not as transparent about their guidelines, particularly New York department of financial services, which doesn\u2019t offer FAQs and won\u2019t meet non-American entities to discuss issues about sanctions. You\u2019ve got the Federal Reserve, you\u2019ve got a lot of agencies out there which can punish you for the same offence, so it\u2019s not just OFAC. Whoever goes in first they're going to be watched like a hawk by those who oppose the deal\u201cThere\u2019s also a reputational risk, whoever goes in first they\u2019re going to be watched like a hawk by those who oppose the deal, the Israelis, Saudi Arabians, Republican American entities,\u201d the banker said, saying that his bank was particularly under pressure from the US pro-Israel lobby, AIPAC. \u201cI can\u2019t see any movement for at least six to 12 months.\u201dThe banker added: \u201cMost banks in Europe and UK have been sanctioned for transgression on Iran, and some of them have entered agreement with OFAC, what\u2019s called the deferred prosecution agreement, where they\u2019ve said they won\u2019t do any deals with Iran, so do they break that agreement, has that agreement changed?\u201dIran\u2019s Middle East Bank said this week it has requested to be linked up with 40 international banks through the Swift global transaction network. \u201cMy feeling is it is going to take a couple of weeks or so before we start to see proper re-engagement. It will be slowly, slowly,\u201d the bank\u2019s head, Parviz Aghili, told Reuters.Many services are denied to Iranians not because providers are legally bound to refuse them but because they err on the side of safety for fear of running foul of the policy. At least one Iranian said his account was closed down recently after 10 years. \u201cI know six other ordinary Iranians in the UK who\u2019ve had their bank accounts closed abruptly,\u201d he told the Guardian.A businessman from Switzerland who visited two major Swiss banks this week said he was told they were waiting for other banks to try first and see the reaction of the Americans. \u201cBanks are worried about interpretations of these guidances, so they\u2019re still waiting for others to test the water.\u201d Related: The era of sanctions is over in Iran. So why no celebrations? | Azadeh Moaveni Emil Dall, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute who has read the guidance, said European companies still fear being caught up in what remains a complex US sanctions web. He said while the US treasury has offered substantial clarifications, they reveal a number of possible practical complications for EU companies.\u201cOne complication is the matter of the definition of \u2018US control\u2019 or \u2018US ownership\u2019. US-owned or controlled entities will still be bound by the US trade embargo on Iran if a US person holds a 50% or greater stake or \u2018otherwise controls the actions, policies or personnel decisions\u2019 of the entity,\u201d he said. \u201cExactly where the lines of control will be drawn and how the definition will be enforced remains to be seen, but EU companies with a US parent will need to ensure that their business is conducted without US involvement \u2013 whether that be in terms of decisions, materials or support.\u201dHowever, Dall said EU banks can rest assured that they will not be subject to US penalties for their relations with Iranian banks, even if those Iranian banks conduct business with still-sanctioned clients. \u201cThis clarification is highly noteworthy. It was feared that the financial sector would be one of the slowest moving in terms of re-engagement with Iran. This clarification may now alter the calculations of banks, in the process increasing the likelihood that other sectors are less inhibited by their inability to find methods of financing for Iranian trade.\u201d\u201cAll of the clarifications provided by the US and EU authorities make one thing clear: companies looking to re-engage with Iran face a monumental due diligence task in ensuring that their Iranian business does not have a sanctioned beneficiary.\u201d", "tags": ["Iran", "Banking", "Business", "International trade", "Middle East and North Africa", "HSBC", "Deutsche Bank", "Economics", "Global economy", "World news", "European banks", "Financial sector", "Europe"], "title": "Europe's big banks remain wary of doing business with Iran"},{"date": "2016-01-23T07:00:06Z", "content": "After years out in the diplomatic cold, Iran has officially entered the post-sanctions era.

I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201dAsked by CNN moderator Anderson Cooper about the statement, the Republican frontrunner simply responded: \u201cI could have said that.\u201dTrump then insisted that his past support for the war did not matter because \u201cby the time the war started I was against it\u201d. His comments came during the second of a two-part town hall in Columbia featuring the remaining candidates in the Republican field. Ohio governor John Kasich and former Florida governor Jeb Bush preceded Trump in Thursday night\u2019s instalment, whereas Ben Carson and senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz participated the prior evening.Trump stumbled when asked if he thought George W Bush had deliberately lied about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. Both a voter and Cooper repeatedly asked him if he stood by his comments in the last Republican presidential debate when he insisted that was the case.\u201cThey said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none,\u201d Trump said in the debate, held in Charleston on Saturday.During Thursday\u2019s town hall, just five days later, he backtracked, saying: \u201cThere are a lot of people that think that. Bottom line is there were no weapons of mass destruction.\u201dPressed further, Trump said of George W Bush, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he did.\u201d Trump added that he would have to \u201clook at some documents\u201d.The forum took place as another news cycle was dominated by Trump, who earlier in the day drew a rebuke from Pope Francis, who was returning from a trip to Mexico, over the candidate\u2019s stance on immigration. When asked about the Republican frontrunner, the pontiff objected to some of Trump\u2019s controversial statements about immigrants.\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\u201d the Pope said, while adding he did not wish to wade into the US presidential election.Trump reacted sharply to the reports at first, saying it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d for a religious leader to question an individual\u2019s faith and suggested the Pope had been misled by the Mexican government during his trip.Addressing the drama in the town hall that same evening, Trump softened his tone toward the pope.\u201cI have a lot of respect for the pope. I think he was very much misinterpreted \u2026 and given false information,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media.\u201dTrump went on to praise the pope as having \u201ca lot of energy\u201d and being effective in his role, adding that he agreed with many of the pontiff\u2019s positions.Before Trump took the stage, two of his rivals in the Republican race who are struggling to gain traction in South Carolina sought to persuade the undecided into their fold two days ahead of the state\u2019s primary. John Kasich and Jeb Bush both revealed their personal side and grasp of policy in a format that played to their strengths.While Kasich and Bush have grown more confident in recent debates, they have often struggled to stand out on a crowded stage and looked uncomfortable in increasingly testy exchanges. Thursday\u2019s town hall offered a stark contrast, as the two governors breezed through questions ranging from the healthcare law to US foreign policy against the Islamic State.There were also more humanizing moments, such as when Kasich recounted the tragedy of losing his parents in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. The Ohio governor became emotional, saying his mother and father had been at Burger King because they were offered a second cup of coffee for free.\u201cThat\u2019s the way the mailman and Mrs Kasich lived,\u201d he said of his parents, adding that their death sent him \u201cinto a black hole with just a little pin prick of light\u201d.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with me or like it or whatever, but it\u2019s really where I found the Lord,\u201d he added. \u201cI have found that even though the pain still comes, there\u2019s where I have to go.\u201dKasich has largely glossed over the South Carolina primary, choosing instead to focus on states where he would have more widespread appeal. He is nonetheless hoping that primary voters, even if in the south, might give him another look after he secured a surprise second-place finish in New Hampshire last week.Bush, who like Kasich is seeking to emerge as the establishment favorite, also opened up about his personal life in poignant terms. The son and brother of former US presidents lavished praise on his father, George HW Bush, calling him \u201cthe greatest man alive\u201d.\u201cI realized pretty quickly in my life if I could be half the man my dad was that that would be a pretty good goal,\u201d Bush said.The former Florida governor has faced a series of challenges in gaining the traction he needs to remain competitive, and this week called upon his brother George W Bush for an assist on the campaign trail. The elder Bush brother remains a popular figure in South Carolina, despite having been considered a liability when Jeb Bush first launched his campaign.\u201cIt\u2019s a blast being with George, because I love him dearly,\u201d Jeb Bush said.Other Republican candidates spent the evening at an event held by Conservative Review, an online right wing publication, in Greenville.Ben Carson and Ted Cruz, appearing along with prominent conservative figures like Mark Levin, Sean Hannity and Michelle Malkin, emphasized their hard-right bona fides. Cruz spent much of his speech warning of the peril that the country faced in the aftermath of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. \u201cOur very Bill of Rights hangs in balance, one justice away from a five justice radical left wing majority the likes of which our county has never seen,\u201d said the senator from Texas.Cruz warned of the consequences not just of electing a Democrat, whom he claimed \u201cevery one of their nominees is consistent left-wing knee jerk vote\u201d but of other Republicans as well. \u201cWe bat less than .500,\u201d Cruz said, arguing that Republican presidents nominated \u201cmany of the worst judicial activists\u201d.Carson, who is lagging in the polls, hit his normal talking points berating \u201csecular progressives\u201d and political correctness while opining \u201cin the future, he who controls space will control the earth\u201d.Marco Rubio was scheduled to attend but canceled because of scheduling issues, his campaign said.Rubio\u2019s absence sparked criticism from Cruz, with whom he is locked in a bitter feud. A spokesman for Cruz charged that Rubio was too afraid to appear at the gathering, issuing a statement declaring that Rubio \u201cis not a conservative\u201d.Rubio instead appeared in an interview with Fox News alongside South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, whose endorsement he earned on Thursday. Earlier in the day, Rubio\u2019s campaign accused Cruz staffers of resorting to dishonest tactics to impugn Rubio \u2013 such as photoshopping a picture of the senator shaking hands with Barack Obama to draw a link between their records.Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to go after the senator over his absence, much less to infer that he was not a true conservative.The attack, Conant said, was \u201cjust the latest example of Ted Cruz\u2019s willingness to do or say anything in this campaign\u201d.", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "US elections 2016", "Republicans", "US politics", "US news", "World news", "Jeb Bush", "John Kasich", "South Carolina"], "title": "Donald Trump confronted with past support for Iraq war"},{"date": "2015-12-08T15:33:19Z", "content": "Isis fighters are using arms, mainly looted from Iraqi military stocks, which were manufactured, designed, and supplied, by more than two dozen countries, including the UK, Russia, China, the USA, Germany, and France, a report published on Tuesday by Amnesty International reveals.The weapons range from man-portable air defence surface-to air missile systems, guided anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicles, and modern assault rifles to Soviet Union-era Kalashnikovs.Decades of arms flows, largely unregulated and uncontrolled, into Iraq have provided Isis with a huge arsenal it uses to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria, Amnesty points out.

It\u2019s 44-page report, Taking Stock: The arming of Islamic State, is based on an analysis of thousands of videos and images.Oliver Sprague, Amnesty UK\u2019s arms programme director, said:\u201cDecades of free-flowing arms into Iraq meant that when [Isis] took control of these areas, they were like children in a sweetshop\u201dHe added: \u201cThe fact that countries including the UK have ended up inadvertently arming [Isis] , should give us pause over current weapons deals\u201d. The extent of the armoury available to Isis reflects decades of irresponsible arms transfers to Iraq, a danger compounded by lax controls over military stockpiles and endemic corruption by successive Iraqi governments, says Amnesty.It says that between 2011 and 2013, the US signed billions of dollars\u2019 worth of contracts for 140 M1A1 Abrams tanks, F16 fighter aircraft, 681 Stinger shoulder held units, Hawk anti-aircraft batteries, and other equipment.By 2014, the US had delivered more than US$500m worth of small arms and ammunition to the Iraqi government.It has been reported that Iraqi security forces lost 2,300 Humvee armoured vehicles when Isis overran the northern city of Mosul. Arms supplied by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey to rebel groups in Syria also end up in the hands of extremist Islamist elements.Research by anti arms trade campaigners shows that Britain over the last five years has approved sales of \u00a35bn to a Middle East already awash with arms. Birtish weapos sales were sold to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Iraq, Egypt, Kuwait, and Lebanon.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: \u201cFor years now the UK government has been happy to flood the Middle East with arms. There is so such thing as arms control in a war zone and very little oversight. The lifespan of weapons is often longer than those of governments, so there is no way of knowing where they will end up or what they will be used for.\u201dThe Guardian on Tuesday reported from Isis documents how the violent extremist group funds its operations and has set up training camps to instruct fighters in the \u201clatest arts of using wepons, military planning and military technologies\u201d.Other recent reports describe how Isis runs a complex arms procurement system, benefitting from a black market with the enemies of Isis its best sources of ammunition.", "tags": ["Islamic State", "Arms trade", "Oxfam", "UK news", "World news"], "title": "Isis benefits from Iraq awash with weapons"},{"date": "2016-02-19T06:36:01Z", "content": "Donald Trump, who has made his opposition to the Iraq invasion one of the bedrocks of his campaign, was left scrambling during a CNN town hall when confronted with a newly uncovered interview in which he supported the conflict.The interview, reported by BuzzFeed, was from 2002 when Trump sat down with radio shock jock Howard Stern and was asked directly whether he advocated invading Saddam Hussein\u2019s country.Trump replied: \u201cYeah I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201dAsked by CNN moderator Anderson Cooper about the statement, the Republican frontrunner simply responded: \u201cI could have said that.\u201dTrump then insisted that his past support for the war did not matter because \u201cby the time the war started I was against it\u201d. His comments came during the second of a two-part town hall in Columbia featuring the remaining candidates in the Republican field. Ohio governor John Kasich and former Florida governor Jeb Bush preceded Trump in Thursday night\u2019s instalment, whereas Ben Carson and senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz participated the prior evening.Trump stumbled when asked if he thought George W Bush had deliberately lied about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. Both a voter and Cooper repeatedly asked him if he stood by his comments in the last Republican presidential debate when he insisted that was the case.\u201cThey said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none,\u201d Trump said in the debate, held in Charleston on Saturday.During Thursday\u2019s town hall, just five days later, he backtracked, saying: \u201cThere are a lot of people that think that. Bottom line is there were no weapons of mass destruction.\u201dPressed further, Trump said of George W Bush, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he did.\u201d Trump added that he would have to \u201clook at some documents\u201d.The forum took place as another news cycle was dominated by Trump, who earlier in the day drew a rebuke from Pope Francis, who was returning from a trip to Mexico, over the candidate\u2019s stance on immigration. When asked about the Republican frontrunner, the pontiff objected to some of Trump\u2019s controversial statements about immigrants.\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\u201d the Pope said, while adding he did not wish to wade into the US presidential election.Trump reacted sharply to the reports at first, saying it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d for a religious leader to question an individual\u2019s faith and suggested the Pope had been misled by the Mexican government during his trip.Addressing the drama in the town hall that same evening, Trump softened his tone toward the pope.\u201cI have a lot of respect for the pope. I think he was very much misinterpreted \u2026 and given false information,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media.\u201dTrump went on to praise the pope as having \u201ca lot of energy\u201d and being effective in his role, adding that he agreed with many of the pontiff\u2019s positions.Before Trump took the stage, two of his rivals in the Republican race who are struggling to gain traction in South Carolina sought to persuade the undecided into their fold two days ahead of the state\u2019s primary. John Kasich and Jeb Bush both revealed their personal side and grasp of policy in a format that played to their strengths.While Kasich and Bush have grown more confident in recent debates, they have often struggled to stand out on a crowded stage and looked uncomfortable in increasingly testy exchanges. Thursday\u2019s town hall offered a stark contrast, as the two governors breezed through questions ranging from the healthcare law to US foreign policy against the Islamic State.There were also more humanizing moments, such as when Kasich recounted the tragedy of losing his parents in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. The Ohio governor became emotional, saying his mother and father had been at Burger King because they were offered a second cup of coffee for free.\u201cThat\u2019s the way the mailman and Mrs Kasich lived,\u201d he said of his parents, adding that their death sent him \u201cinto a black hole with just a little pin prick of light\u201d.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with me or like it or whatever, but it\u2019s really where I found the Lord,\u201d he added. \u201cI have found that even though the pain still comes, there\u2019s where I have to go.\u201dKasich has largely glossed over the South Carolina primary, choosing instead to focus on states where he would have more widespread appeal. He is nonetheless hoping that primary voters, even if in the south, might give him another look after he secured a surprise second-place finish in New Hampshire last week.Bush, who like Kasich is seeking to emerge as the establishment favorite, also opened up about his personal life in poignant terms. The son and brother of former US presidents lavished praise on his father, George HW Bush, calling him \u201cthe greatest man alive\u201d.\u201cI realized pretty quickly in my life if I could be half the man my dad was that that would be a pretty good goal,\u201d Bush said.The former Florida governor has faced a series of challenges in gaining the traction he needs to remain competitive, and this week called upon his brother George W Bush for an assist on the campaign trail. The elder Bush brother remains a popular figure in South Carolina, despite having been considered a liability when Jeb Bush first launched his campaign.\u201cIt\u2019s a blast being with George, because I love him dearly,\u201d Jeb Bush said.Other Republican candidates spent the evening at an event held by Conservative Review, an online right wing publication, in Greenville.Ben Carson and Ted Cruz, appearing along with prominent conservative figures like Mark Levin, Sean Hannity and Michelle Malkin, emphasized their hard-right bona fides. Cruz spent much of his speech warning of the peril that the country faced in the aftermath of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. \u201cOur very Bill of Rights hangs in balance, one justice away from a five justice radical left wing majority the likes of which our county has never seen,\u201d said the senator from Texas.Cruz warned of the consequences not just of electing a Democrat, whom he claimed \u201cevery one of their nominees is consistent left-wing knee jerk vote\u201d but of other Republicans as well. \u201cWe bat less than .500,\u201d Cruz said, arguing that Republican presidents nominated \u201cmany of the worst judicial activists\u201d.Carson, who is lagging in the polls, hit his normal talking points berating \u201csecular progressives\u201d and political correctness while opining \u201cin the future, he who controls space will control the earth\u201d.Marco Rubio was scheduled to attend but canceled because of scheduling issues, his campaign said.Rubio\u2019s absence sparked criticism from Cruz, with whom he is locked in a bitter feud.

The removal of\u00a0a\u00a0dictator, before a stable\u00a0replacement\u00a0is available, simply creates a vacuum which destructive elements quickly exploit.Assad kept the lid on Syria, until overflow from the disintegration of Iraq fractured his regime. The influx of refugees into Europe, from both Syria and Libya, is the continuing consequence of democratic politicians failing to appreciate the inappropriateness of introducing democracy into states with no established record of the peaceful transfer of political authority.Martin LondonHenllan, Denbighshire\u2022 Tony Blair apologises, among other things, for the inaccuracy of the intelligence information about Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction. But the fact is that by the time the war started, the highly regarded UN weapons inspector Hans Blix hadn\u2019t found any such weapons and didn\u2019t believe he was going to.Twelve and a half years on from the march via which over a million of us tried to give Blair a get-out-of-jail card, it still troubles me that a prime minister who until that point had been among the most sure-footed this country had elected in generations either could not or would not see that it was entirely in Saddam\u2019s interests both to have destroyed his weapons of mass destruction and to be maintaining some uncertainty as to whether he had done so.Jeremy WaxmanSaltaire, West Yorkshire\u2022 Sadly, the rise of Isis was a relatively milder consequence of the Iraq war. The wider consequence was the creation of a religious war across the whole of the Middle East. Before Iraq, al-Qaida was not attacking Shia or Kurd. Its targets were the west. Sunni and Shia have always been on opposing sides but there were no conflicts in the Middle East based on this religious division.As Martin Chulov (The crucial point: a partial acknowledgment that without the war there would have been no Isis, 26 October) quite rightly states, the Iraq war stoked these divisions, destroying the country, favouring Shia, oppressing Sunni and generating the chaos of a civil religious war. This division has now broadened into Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Lebanon, and the Middle East is on fire as Sunni and Shia fight a religious war that is every day becoming a single international conflict with the US on one\u00a0side and Russia on the other.Chris OwenHolywood, County Down\u2022 Martin Chulov\u2019s reference to Abu Ghraib resonates in Syria. I was in Damascus when events at Abu Ghraib surfaced and while meeting with Bouthaina Shaaban, media adviser to president Bashar al-Assad, I voiced my concern about the many young Syrian men who seemed keen to go to Iraq to fight. More young lives lost, I felt. \u201cThey have seen what happened in Abu Ghraib,\u201d she said, \u201cand they have to go.\u201dMary RussellOxford\u2022 The main outstanding issue about the Iraq war is how and why it came to be that when British forces landed in Iraq their stated purpose was to find and destroy weapons of mass destruction, but when they departed their stated achievement had been the overthrow of the Iraqi regime which, incidentally, posed no threat to the security of Britain or its military allies. That goes well beyond mere apologetics. When the Chilcot inquiry has shed some forensic light on this issue it should be easier to make a final judgment on the war and Britain\u2019s role in it.Robin WendtChester\u2022 Tony Blair\u2019s pre-emptive strike against Chilcot and the publication of the Chilcot report, still, I believe, leave one key aspect of the affair unanswered. Let me recount an incident that took place in Italy in May 2003.While eating out one evening, I was able to prevail on other diners to make space for an American family. Once all were seated I engaged in the sort of conversation one has in these situations; talk touched on the invasion of Iraq. The father, a notable US academic, stated quite firmly that it was Blair who persuaded the American intellectual elite that it was right to launch the war on Saddam Hussein.Ever since that moment I have watched for anything that focuses on this aspect of the affair, and I believe that Chilcot did not consider Blair\u2019s role in influencing US public opinion; why should he, when accountability is restricted to the \u201cline management\u201d within a nation state? The publication of the dialogue between Blair and Bush may go some way towards addressing this, but is unlikely to reveal the ultimate spin.It seems that it is this triangulation for which Bush was grateful, and for which the US right continues to show gratitude to Blair through channelling generous lecture fees to him. Blair will continue to prevaricate with qualified apologies and regret for things that are peripheral to the main point. Only an international inquiry, dare I say an international court, is able to properly consider Blair\u2019s role in propping up the intellectually weak US argument for war.Will MessengerMoreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire\u2022 There is one problem with Tony Blair\u2019s qualified mea culpa: Britain did not overthrow Saddam. Neither did it to any significant degree slaughter the civilian population, bomb cities, destroy infrastructure or desecrate holy places. In fact the UK did virtually nothing in the Iraq war after the initial seizure of Basra except hand it over to pro-Iranian militias and retreat to the safety of its barracks at Basra airport, there to await relief from US forces. Blair\u2019s comments are an arrogant repetition of the lie that the UK made any difference at all to either going to war or in determining the outcome. From the outset of hostilities Blair\u2019s war aim was the avoidance of casualties. The best (or worst) that can be laid at Blair\u2019s feet is that he gave moral cover to the US, which made it contemptuously clear that it would proceed with the war no matter what the UK did or didn\u2019t do in support. Blair should admit it: the UK\u2019s participation in the Iraq war was an irrelevance. He should then sleep sound in the knowledge that the only war crimes he was guilty of are hubris and cowardice.Chris ForseSnitterfield, Warwickshire\u2022 It seems Tony Blair is still at it \u2013 twisting and turning as usual. He says he apologises for \u201cthe intelligence being wrong\u201d but what he really should say is: \u201cI apologise for the intelligence being correct but we ignored that and told the general public and parliament a totally different story to suit our intentions.\u201d Why is there still a need to listen to him?Henk SlagterHazlemere, Buckinghamshire\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Iraq war inquiry", "Tony Blair", "Iraq", "Politics", "UK news", "Saddam Hussein", "World news", "Islamic State", "Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Bashar al-Assad", "Military", "Foreign policy"], "title": "Tony Blair\u2019s partial apology for Iraq isn\u2019t enough | Letters"},{"date": "2015-12-08T15:33:19Z", "content": "Isis fighters are using arms, mainly looted from Iraqi military stocks, which were manufactured, designed, and supplied, by more than two dozen countries, including the UK, Russia, China, the USA, Germany, and France, a report published on Tuesday by Amnesty International reveals.The weapons range from man-portable air defence surface-to air missile systems, guided anti-tank missiles, armoured vehicles, and modern assault rifles to Soviet Union-era Kalashnikovs.Decades of arms flows, largely unregulated and uncontrolled, into Iraq have provided Isis with a huge arsenal it uses to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity on a massive scale in Iraq and Syria, Amnesty points out. It\u2019s 44-page report, Taking Stock: The arming of Islamic State, is based on an analysis of thousands of videos and images.Oliver Sprague, Amnesty UK\u2019s arms programme director, said:\u201cDecades of free-flowing arms into Iraq meant that when [Isis] took control of these areas, they were like children in a sweetshop\u201dHe added: \u201cThe fact that countries including the UK have ended up inadvertently arming [Isis] , should give us pause over current weapons deals\u201d. The extent of the armoury available to Isis reflects decades of irresponsible arms transfers to Iraq, a danger compounded by lax controls over military stockpiles and endemic corruption by successive Iraqi governments, says Amnesty.It says that between 2011 and 2013, the US signed billions of dollars\u2019 worth of contracts for 140 M1A1 Abrams tanks, F16 fighter aircraft, 681 Stinger shoulder held units, Hawk anti-aircraft batteries, and other equipment.By 2014, the US had delivered more than US$500m worth of small arms and ammunition to the Iraqi government.It has been reported that Iraqi security forces lost 2,300 Humvee armoured vehicles when Isis overran the northern city of Mosul. Arms supplied by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey to rebel groups in Syria also end up in the hands of extremist Islamist elements.Research by anti arms trade campaigners shows that Britain over the last five years has approved sales of \u00a35bn to a Middle East already awash with arms. Birtish weapos sales were sold to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Iraq, Egypt, Kuwait, and Lebanon.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: \u201cFor years now the UK government has been happy to flood the Middle East with arms. There is so such thing as arms control in a war zone and very little oversight. The lifespan of weapons is often longer than those of governments, so there is no way of knowing where they will end up or what they will be used for.\u201dThe Guardian on Tuesday reported from Isis documents how the violent extremist group funds its operations and has set up training camps to instruct fighters in the \u201clatest arts of using wepons, military planning and military technologies\u201d.Other recent reports describe how Isis runs a complex arms procurement system, benefitting from a black market with the enemies of Isis its best sources of ammunition.", "tags": ["Islamic State", "Arms trade", "Oxfam", "UK news", "World news"], "title": "Isis benefits from Iraq awash with weapons"},{"date": "2016-02-19T06:36:01Z", "content": "Donald Trump, who has made his opposition to the Iraq invasion one of the bedrocks of his campaign, was left scrambling during a CNN town hall when confronted with a newly uncovered interview in which he supported the conflict.The interview, reported by BuzzFeed, was from 2002 when Trump sat down with radio shock jock Howard Stern and was asked directly whether he advocated invading Saddam Hussein\u2019s country.Trump replied: \u201cYeah I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201dAsked by CNN moderator Anderson Cooper about the statement, the Republican frontrunner simply responded: \u201cI could have said that.\u201dTrump then insisted that his past support for the war did not matter because \u201cby the time the war started I was against it\u201d. His comments came during the second of a two-part town hall in Columbia featuring the remaining candidates in the Republican field. Ohio governor John Kasich and former Florida governor Jeb Bush preceded Trump in Thursday night\u2019s instalment, whereas Ben Carson and senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz participated the prior evening.Trump stumbled when asked if he thought George W Bush had deliberately lied about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. Both a voter and Cooper repeatedly asked him if he stood by his comments in the last Republican presidential debate when he insisted that was the case.\u201cThey said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none,\u201d Trump said in the debate, held in Charleston on Saturday.During Thursday\u2019s town hall, just five days later, he backtracked, saying: \u201cThere are a lot of people that think that. Bottom line is there were no weapons of mass destruction.\u201dPressed further, Trump said of George W Bush, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he did.\u201d Trump added that he would have to \u201clook at some documents\u201d.The forum took place as another news cycle was dominated by Trump, who earlier in the day drew a rebuke from Pope Francis, who was returning from a trip to Mexico, over the candidate\u2019s stance on immigration. When asked about the Republican frontrunner, the pontiff objected to some of Trump\u2019s controversial statements about immigrants.\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\u201d the Pope said, while adding he did not wish to wade into the US presidential election.Trump reacted sharply to the reports at first, saying it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d for a religious leader to question an individual\u2019s faith and suggested the Pope had been misled by the Mexican government during his trip.Addressing the drama in the town hall that same evening, Trump softened his tone toward the pope.\u201cI have a lot of respect for the pope. I think he was very much misinterpreted \u2026 and given false information,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media.\u201dTrump went on to praise the pope as having \u201ca lot of energy\u201d and being effective in his role, adding that he agreed with many of the pontiff\u2019s positions.Before Trump took the stage, two of his rivals in the Republican race who are struggling to gain traction in South Carolina sought to persuade the undecided into their fold two days ahead of the state\u2019s primary. John Kasich and Jeb Bush both revealed their personal side and grasp of policy in a format that played to their strengths.While Kasich and Bush have grown more confident in recent debates, they have often struggled to stand out on a crowded stage and looked uncomfortable in increasingly testy exchanges. Thursday\u2019s town hall offered a stark contrast, as the two governors breezed through questions ranging from the healthcare law to US foreign policy against the Islamic State.There were also more humanizing moments, such as when Kasich recounted the tragedy of losing his parents in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. The Ohio governor became emotional, saying his mother and father had been at Burger King because they were offered a second cup of coffee for free.\u201cThat\u2019s the way the mailman and Mrs Kasich lived,\u201d he said of his parents, adding that their death sent him \u201cinto a black hole with just a little pin prick of light\u201d.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with me or like it or whatever, but it\u2019s really where I found the Lord,\u201d he added. \u201cI have found that even though the pain still comes, there\u2019s where I have to go.\u201dKasich has largely glossed over the South Carolina primary, choosing instead to focus on states where he would have more widespread appeal. He is nonetheless hoping that primary voters, even if in the south, might give him another look after he secured a surprise second-place finish in New Hampshire last week.Bush, who like Kasich is seeking to emerge as the establishment favorite, also opened up about his personal life in poignant terms. The son and brother of former US presidents lavished praise on his father, George HW Bush, calling him \u201cthe greatest man alive\u201d.\u201cI realized pretty quickly in my life if I could be half the man my dad was that that would be a pretty good goal,\u201d Bush said.The former Florida governor has faced a series of challenges in gaining the traction he needs to remain competitive, and this week called upon his brother George W Bush for an assist on the campaign trail. The elder Bush brother remains a popular figure in South Carolina, despite having been considered a liability when Jeb Bush first launched his campaign.\u201cIt\u2019s a blast being with George, because I love him dearly,\u201d Jeb Bush said.Other Republican candidates spent the evening at an event held by Conservative Review, an online right wing publication, in Greenville.Ben Carson and Ted Cruz, appearing along with prominent conservative figures like Mark Levin, Sean Hannity and Michelle Malkin, emphasized their hard-right bona fides. Cruz spent much of his speech warning of the peril that the country faced in the aftermath of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. \u201cOur very Bill of Rights hangs in balance, one justice away from a five justice radical left wing majority the likes of which our county has never seen,\u201d said the senator from Texas.Cruz warned of the consequences not just of electing a Democrat, whom he claimed \u201cevery one of their nominees is consistent left-wing knee jerk vote\u201d but of other Republicans as well. \u201cWe bat less than .500,\u201d Cruz said, arguing that Republican presidents nominated \u201cmany of the worst judicial activists\u201d.Carson, who is lagging in the polls, hit his normal talking points berating \u201csecular progressives\u201d and political correctness while opining \u201cin the future, he who controls space will control the earth\u201d.Marco Rubio was scheduled to attend but canceled because of scheduling issues, his campaign said.Rubio\u2019s absence sparked criticism from Cruz, with whom he is locked in a bitter feud. A spokesman for Cruz charged that Rubio was too afraid to appear at the gathering, issuing a statement declaring that Rubio \u201cis not a conservative\u201d.Rubio instead appeared in an interview with Fox News alongside South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, whose endorsement he earned on Thursday. Earlier in the day, Rubio\u2019s campaign accused Cruz staffers of resorting to dishonest tactics to impugn Rubio \u2013 such as photoshopping a picture of the senator shaking hands with Barack Obama to draw a link between their records.Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to go after the senator over his absence, much less to infer that he was not a true conservative.The attack, Conant said, was \u201cjust the latest example of Ted Cruz\u2019s willingness to do or say anything in this campaign\u201d.", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "US elections 2016", "Republicans", "US politics", "US news", "World news", "Jeb Bush", "John Kasich", "South Carolina"], "title": "Donald Trump confronted with past support for Iraq war"},{"date": "2015-12-01T08:36:28Z", "content": "Tony Blair was guilty of \u201ccriminal irresponsibility\u201d for launching the Iraq war in 2003 based on the testimony of one discredited local politician who said that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, Ken Livingstone has said.The former London mayor spoke out as he defended his claim last week that Blair was to blame for the 52 deaths in the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005 after ignoring warnings that the invasion of Iraq would provoke terrorists.His claims prompted calls at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday night for Livingstone to be sacked from his role as co-convenor of Labour\u2019s defence role.But Livingstone strongly defended his remarks on Question Time on BBC1 last week in which he said that Blair\u2019s failure to heed warnings from the security services about the impact of the invasion of Iraq on terrorism had \u201ckilled 52 Londoners\u201d.He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: \u201cI simply told the truth.

The publication of the dialogue between Blair and Bush may go some way towards addressing this, but is unlikely to reveal the ultimate spin.It seems that it is this triangulation for which Bush was grateful, and for which the US right continues to show gratitude to Blair through channelling generous lecture fees to him. Blair will continue to prevaricate with qualified apologies and regret for things that are peripheral to the main point. Only an international inquiry, dare I say an international court, is able to properly consider Blair\u2019s role in propping up the intellectually weak US argument for war.Will MessengerMoreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire\u2022 There is one problem with Tony Blair\u2019s qualified mea culpa: Britain did not overthrow Saddam. Neither did it to any significant degree slaughter the civilian population, bomb cities, destroy infrastructure or desecrate holy places. In fact the UK did virtually nothing in the Iraq war after the initial seizure of Basra except hand it over to pro-Iranian militias and retreat to the safety of its barracks at Basra airport, there to await relief from US forces. Blair\u2019s comments are an arrogant repetition of the lie that the UK made any difference at all to either going to war or in determining the outcome. From the outset of hostilities Blair\u2019s war aim was the avoidance of casualties. The best (or worst) that can be laid at Blair\u2019s feet is that he gave moral cover to the US, which made it contemptuously clear that it would proceed with the war no matter what the UK did or didn\u2019t do in support. Blair should admit it: the UK\u2019s participation in the Iraq war was an irrelevance. He should then sleep sound in the knowledge that the only war crimes he was guilty of are hubris and cowardice.Chris ForseSnitterfield, Warwickshire\u2022 It seems Tony Blair is still at it \u2013 twisting and turning as usual. He says he apologises for \u201cthe intelligence being wrong\u201d but what he really should say is: \u201cI apologise for the intelligence being correct but we ignored that and told the general public and parliament a totally different story to suit our intentions.\u201d Why is there still a need to listen to him?Henk SlagterHazlemere, Buckinghamshire\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Iraq war inquiry", "Tony Blair", "Iraq", "Politics", "UK news", "Saddam Hussein", "World news", "Islamic State", "Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Bashar al-Assad", "Military", "Foreign policy"], "title": "Tony Blair\u2019s partial apology for Iraq isn\u2019t enough | Letters"},{"date": "2015-10-26T09:11:17Z", "content": "Did Tony Blair\u2019s statements about taking Britain to war in Iraq constitute an apology? As far as Britain\u2019s national newspapers were concerned, they certainly did not.Most of the editorials and commentaries view his CNN interview as a spin operation ahead of the publication of the Chilcot report, which is expected, wrote the Guardian\u2019s Richard Norton-Taylor, to be \u201cdamning.\u201dThe Daily Mail accused the former prime minister of weasel words in \u201can apology of sorts.\u201d The Daily Mirror thought he had delivered a \u201chalf-hearted apology\u201d that \u201cwill bring no comfort to families whose loved ones never came home.\u201d The Daily Telegraph, rejecting any sense that it amounted to an apology, said Blair was \u201cmaking sure the political ground has been prepared for the fight to defend his reputation.\u201dAs for the Times, its opinionated news page headline reflected its scepticism, \u201cBlair gets his Iraq defence out early.\u201d The Independent argued that Blair\u2019s \u201cadmission... represents progress in coming to some sort of understanding about that ill-starred adventure and its longer-term consequences.\u201dAnd the Morning Star saw Blair\u2019s argument that \u201c\u2018the intelligence we received was wrong\u2019... is not an apology \u2014 it is blaming British and other intelligence agencies for making mistakes.\u201dSo left, right and centre appeared to agree that Blair\u2019s pre-Chilcot interview raised more questions than it answered.For the Indy, \u201capologies and semi-apologies... are no substitute for a thorough investigation into the decision to go to a war that had such grievous consequences.\u201dSeeing the rise of Isis and the conflicts across the Middle East as the result of the 2003 invasion, the paper stated: \u201cThat we can trace the plight of Syrian and Iraqi refugees back to those conversations between Mr Blair and President George Bush at Camp David is now acknowledged by at least one of those men...Whatever Mr Blair says now will not, in the short run, save a single refugee child from drowning in the Mediterranean or freezing in a mountain camp in Lebanon or the Balkans. It will not prevent a single woman being raped by militants from Isis, al-Shabaab or Boko Haram, nor the attempted genocide of minorities and destruction of human rights and cultural heritage. We shouldn\u2019t let the events of 2003 distract us from action now.\u201dIn the Sun, Trevor Kavanagh said Blair - the \u201cGreat Spinner\u201d - had \u201crejected any blame for the greatest geopolitical catastrophe this century.\u201d In so doing, he confirmed that he \u201ctook this country to war on a false prospectus, certain of victory and determined at all costs to support President George W Bush.\u201dAfter referring to Blair\u2019s interview answers as \u201cweasel words\u201d, Kavanagh continued:\u201cBlair suggests he did not foresee the inevitable chaos in Iraq once Saddam was toppled. But the consequences were widely discussed at the time.In the run-up to the invasion, we saw detailed blueprints for post-war reconstruction, with multi-billion dollar plans for a stable peacetime Iraq.There would be new roads, water supplies, hospitals and schools. Industrial generators would be flown in to keep lights burning while new power stations were constructed. Instead, power was cut off and people were left to drink from puddles.\u201dCon Couglin, in the Telegraph, pointed out that before Blair commited British forces to join the US-led coalition to overthrow Saddam Hussein, \u201cradical Islamist groups such as Isis and al-Qaida barely featured on the political terrain of either country.\u201dBut it would be unfair, he contended, to blame Blair and Bush \u201centirely\u201d for the rise of Islamist-linked militants because it was a coincidence of events. He concluded: \u201cThe real blame lies with a more recent generation of politicians who failed to grasp the importance of maintaining stability in both Iraq and Syria.\u201dMichael Burleigh, in the Mail, noted a crucial omission from Blair\u2019s not-apology:\u201cThere was no reference in his CNN interview about the recent revelation that he had committed Britain to war in Iraq at least a month before he met Bush at his ranch in Texas in April 2002...Only last week, we learnt from a newly unearthed memo from the then US secretary of state, Colin Powell, written a month earlier to Bush, that \u2018on Iraq, Blair will be with us should military operations be necessary\u0085.\u2019 This means that Blair was privately committed to war, which belied his public position that he was going down the diplomatic route to try to avoid it.\u201dBut the editorial in the Mirror will probably have a greater resonance because of the paper\u2019s Labour party loyalties. Acknowledging that Blair has already been able to read large parts of the Chilcot report, it described his \u201csquirming\u201d statement as a \u201cpreemptive strike\u201d and \u201ca semi-apology.\u201d It believed Blair \u201cwill never face up to the enormity of his actions. He will never say sorry for all he has done\u201d, adding:\u201cThe central charge against him remains woefully unaddressed \u2013 that he took this country to war upon a lie. And as a result of his actions 179 brave British soldiers lie dead, alongside thousands of US allies and untold numbers of Iraqi citizens.\u201dWe should remind ourselves that the Mirror (then edited by Piers Morgan) opposed the Iraq invasion. Some papers, notably the Sun, were gung-ho for war in 2003. However, the post-war realisation that Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction and that Britain\u2019s intelligence was flawed (and/or non-existent) changed the minds of most of the warmongers. Some still plug away, of course, viewing regime change in Iraq as justification enough.

It\u2019s 44-page report, Taking Stock: The arming of Islamic State, is based on an analysis of thousands of videos and images.Oliver Sprague, Amnesty UK\u2019s arms programme director, said:\u201cDecades of free-flowing arms into Iraq meant that when [Isis] took control of these areas, they were like children in a sweetshop\u201dHe added: \u201cThe fact that countries including the UK have ended up inadvertently arming [Isis] , should give us pause over current weapons deals\u201d. The extent of the armoury available to Isis reflects decades of irresponsible arms transfers to Iraq, a danger compounded by lax controls over military stockpiles and endemic corruption by successive Iraqi governments, says Amnesty.It says that between 2011 and 2013, the US signed billions of dollars\u2019 worth of contracts for 140 M1A1 Abrams tanks, F16 fighter aircraft, 681 Stinger shoulder held units, Hawk anti-aircraft batteries, and other equipment.By 2014, the US had delivered more than US$500m worth of small arms and ammunition to the Iraqi government.It has been reported that Iraqi security forces lost 2,300 Humvee armoured vehicles when Isis overran the northern city of Mosul. Arms supplied by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey to rebel groups in Syria also end up in the hands of extremist Islamist elements.Research by anti arms trade campaigners shows that Britain over the last five years has approved sales of \u00a35bn to a Middle East already awash with arms. Birtish weapos sales were sold to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Iraq, Egypt, Kuwait, and Lebanon.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: \u201cFor years now the UK government has been happy to flood the Middle East with arms.

The lifespan of weapons is often longer than those of governments, so there is no way of knowing where they will end up or what they will be used for.\u201dThe Guardian on Tuesday reported from Isis documents how the violent extremist group funds its operations and has set up training camps to instruct fighters in the \u201clatest arts of using wepons, military planning and military technologies\u201d.Other recent reports describe how Isis runs a complex arms procurement system, benefitting from a black market with the enemies of Isis its best sources of ammunition.", "tags": ["Islamic State", "Arms trade", "Oxfam", "UK news", "World news"], "title": "Isis benefits from Iraq awash with weapons"},{"date": "2016-02-19T06:36:01Z", "content": "Donald Trump, who has made his opposition to the Iraq invasion one of the bedrocks of his campaign, was left scrambling during a CNN town hall when confronted with a newly uncovered interview in which he supported the conflict.The interview, reported by BuzzFeed, was from 2002 when Trump sat down with radio shock jock Howard Stern and was asked directly whether he advocated invading Saddam Hussein\u2019s country.Trump replied: \u201cYeah I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201dAsked by CNN moderator Anderson Cooper about the statement, the Republican frontrunner simply responded: \u201cI could have said that.\u201dTrump then insisted that his past support for the war did not matter because \u201cby the time the war started I was against it\u201d. His comments came during the second of a two-part town hall in Columbia featuring the remaining candidates in the Republican field. Ohio governor John Kasich and former Florida governor Jeb Bush preceded Trump in Thursday night\u2019s instalment, whereas Ben Carson and senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz participated the prior evening.Trump stumbled when asked if he thought George W Bush had deliberately lied about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction. Both a voter and Cooper repeatedly asked him if he stood by his comments in the last Republican presidential debate when he insisted that was the case.\u201cThey said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none,\u201d Trump said in the debate, held in Charleston on Saturday.During Thursday\u2019s town hall, just five days later, he backtracked, saying: \u201cThere are a lot of people that think that. Bottom line is there were no weapons of mass destruction.\u201dPressed further, Trump said of George W Bush, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he did.\u201d Trump added that he would have to \u201clook at some documents\u201d.The forum took place as another news cycle was dominated by Trump, who earlier in the day drew a rebuke from Pope Francis, who was returning from a trip to Mexico, over the candidate\u2019s stance on immigration. When asked about the Republican frontrunner, the pontiff objected to some of Trump\u2019s controversial statements about immigrants.\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\u201d the Pope said, while adding he did not wish to wade into the US presidential election.Trump reacted sharply to the reports at first, saying it was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d for a religious leader to question an individual\u2019s faith and suggested the Pope had been misled by the Mexican government during his trip.Addressing the drama in the town hall that same evening, Trump softened his tone toward the pope.\u201cI have a lot of respect for the pope. I think he was very much misinterpreted \u2026 and given false information,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media.\u201dTrump went on to praise the pope as having \u201ca lot of energy\u201d and being effective in his role, adding that he agreed with many of the pontiff\u2019s positions.Before Trump took the stage, two of his rivals in the Republican race who are struggling to gain traction in South Carolina sought to persuade the undecided into their fold two days ahead of the state\u2019s primary. John Kasich and Jeb Bush both revealed their personal side and grasp of policy in a format that played to their strengths.While Kasich and Bush have grown more confident in recent debates, they have often struggled to stand out on a crowded stage and looked uncomfortable in increasingly testy exchanges. Thursday\u2019s town hall offered a stark contrast, as the two governors breezed through questions ranging from the healthcare law to US foreign policy against the Islamic State.There were also more humanizing moments, such as when Kasich recounted the tragedy of losing his parents in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. The Ohio governor became emotional, saying his mother and father had been at Burger King because they were offered a second cup of coffee for free.\u201cThat\u2019s the way the mailman and Mrs Kasich lived,\u201d he said of his parents, adding that their death sent him \u201cinto a black hole with just a little pin prick of light\u201d.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with me or like it or whatever, but it\u2019s really where I found the Lord,\u201d he added. \u201cI have found that even though the pain still comes, there\u2019s where I have to go.\u201dKasich has largely glossed over the South Carolina primary, choosing instead to focus on states where he would have more widespread appeal. He is nonetheless hoping that primary voters, even if in the south, might give him another look after he secured a surprise second-place finish in New Hampshire last week.Bush, who like Kasich is seeking to emerge as the establishment favorite, also opened up about his personal life in poignant terms. The son and brother of former US presidents lavished praise on his father, George HW Bush, calling him \u201cthe greatest man alive\u201d.\u201cI realized pretty quickly in my life if I could be half the man my dad was that that would be a pretty good goal,\u201d Bush said.The former Florida governor has faced a series of challenges in gaining the traction he needs to remain competitive, and this week called upon his brother George W Bush for an assist on the campaign trail. The elder Bush brother remains a popular figure in South Carolina, despite having been considered a liability when Jeb Bush first launched his campaign.\u201cIt\u2019s a blast being with George, because I love him dearly,\u201d Jeb Bush said.Other Republican candidates spent the evening at an event held by Conservative Review, an online right wing publication, in Greenville.Ben Carson and Ted Cruz, appearing along with prominent conservative figures like Mark Levin, Sean Hannity and Michelle Malkin, emphasized their hard-right bona fides. Cruz spent much of his speech warning of the peril that the country faced in the aftermath of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. \u201cOur very Bill of Rights hangs in balance, one justice away from a five justice radical left wing majority the likes of which our county has never seen,\u201d said the senator from Texas.Cruz warned of the consequences not just of electing a Democrat, whom he claimed \u201cevery one of their nominees is consistent left-wing knee jerk vote\u201d but of other Republicans as well. \u201cWe bat less than .500,\u201d Cruz said, arguing that Republican presidents nominated \u201cmany of the worst judicial activists\u201d.Carson, who is lagging in the polls, hit his normal talking points berating \u201csecular progressives\u201d and political correctness while opining \u201cin the future, he who controls space will control the earth\u201d.Marco Rubio was scheduled to attend but canceled because of scheduling issues, his campaign said.Rubio\u2019s absence sparked criticism from Cruz, with whom he is locked in a bitter feud. A spokesman for Cruz charged that Rubio was too afraid to appear at the gathering, issuing a statement declaring that Rubio \u201cis not a conservative\u201d.Rubio instead appeared in an interview with Fox News alongside South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, whose endorsement he earned on Thursday. Earlier in the day, Rubio\u2019s campaign accused Cruz staffers of resorting to dishonest tactics to impugn Rubio \u2013 such as photoshopping a picture of the senator shaking hands with Barack Obama to draw a link between their records.Alex Conant, a spokesman for Rubio, said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d to go after the senator over his absence, much less to infer that he was not a true conservative.The attack, Conant said, was \u201cjust the latest example of Ted Cruz\u2019s willingness to do or say anything in this campaign\u201d.", "tags": ["Donald Trump", "US elections 2016", "Republicans", "US politics", "US news", "World news", "Jeb Bush", "John Kasich", "South Carolina"], "title": "Donald Trump confronted with past support for Iraq war"},{"date": "2015-12-01T08:36:28Z", "content": "Tony Blair was guilty of \u201ccriminal irresponsibility\u201d for launching the Iraq war in 2003 based on the testimony of one discredited local politician who said that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, Ken Livingstone has said.The former London mayor spoke out as he defended his claim last week that Blair was to blame for the 52 deaths in the 7/7 bombings in London in 2005 after ignoring warnings that the invasion of Iraq would provoke terrorists.His claims prompted calls at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday night for Livingstone to be sacked from his role as co-convenor of Labour\u2019s defence role.But Livingstone strongly defended his remarks on Question Time on BBC1 last week in which he said that Blair\u2019s failure to heed warnings from the security services about the impact of the invasion of Iraq on terrorism had \u201ckilled 52 Londoners\u201d.He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: \u201cI simply told the truth.

Livingstone suggested that the party\u2019s national executive committee, of which he is a member, should have a role in deciding the parliamentary party\u2019s position on airstrikes in Syria.Hodges said the impending Commons vote on the issue required Corbyn to take a clear view. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Sunday trading but this is a matter of war and peace,\u201d he said. Livingstone said the NEC could deal with the issue. \u201cWe are stuck with a parliamentary party that is clearly far to the right of the membership.

His removal and the emergence of\u00a0Isis\u00a0is testimony to the accuracy of\u00a0his\u00a0judgment.The removal of the equally brutal Gaddafi from Libya, and the subsequent disintegration of that state, is further testimony to the misjudgment of European politicians. The removal of\u00a0a\u00a0dictator, before a stable\u00a0replacement\u00a0is available, simply creates a vacuum which destructive elements quickly exploit.Assad kept the lid on Syria, until overflow from the disintegration of Iraq fractured his regime.

But the fact is that by the time the war started, the highly regarded UN weapons inspector Hans Blix hadn\u2019t found any such weapons and didn\u2019t believe he was going to.Twelve and a half years on from the march via which over a million of us tried to give Blair a get-out-of-jail card, it still troubles me that a prime minister who until that point had been among the most sure-footed this country had elected in generations either could not or would not see that it was entirely in Saddam\u2019s interests both to have destroyed his weapons of mass destruction and to be maintaining some uncertainty as to whether he had done so.Jeremy WaxmanSaltaire, West Yorkshire\u2022 Sadly, the rise of Isis was a relatively milder consequence of the Iraq war. The wider consequence was the creation of a religious war across the whole of the Middle East. Before Iraq, al-Qaida was not attacking Shia or Kurd. Its targets were the west. Sunni and Shia have always been on opposing sides but there were no conflicts in the Middle East based on this religious division.As Martin Chulov (The crucial point: a partial acknowledgment that without the war there would have been no Isis, 26 October) quite rightly states, the Iraq war stoked these divisions, destroying the country, favouring Shia, oppressing Sunni and generating the chaos of a civil religious war. This division has now broadened into Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Lebanon, and the Middle East is on fire as Sunni and Shia fight a religious war that is every day becoming a single international conflict with the US on one\u00a0side and Russia on the other.Chris OwenHolywood, County Down\u2022 Martin Chulov\u2019s reference to Abu Ghraib resonates in Syria. I was in Damascus when events at Abu Ghraib surfaced and while meeting with Bouthaina Shaaban, media adviser to president Bashar al-Assad, I voiced my concern about the many young Syrian men who seemed keen to go to Iraq to fight. More young lives lost, I felt. \u201cThey have seen what happened in Abu Ghraib,\u201d she said, \u201cand they have to go.\u201dMary RussellOxford\u2022 The main outstanding issue about the Iraq war is how and why it came to be that when British forces landed in Iraq their stated purpose was to find and destroy weapons of mass destruction, but when they departed their stated achievement had been the overthrow of the Iraqi regime which, incidentally, posed no threat to the security of Britain or its military allies. That goes well beyond mere apologetics. When the Chilcot inquiry has shed some forensic light on this issue it should be easier to make a final judgment on the war and Britain\u2019s role in it.Robin WendtChester\u2022 Tony Blair\u2019s pre-emptive strike against Chilcot and the publication of the Chilcot report, still, I believe, leave one key aspect of the affair unanswered. Let me recount an incident that took place in Italy in May 2003.While eating out one evening, I was able to prevail on other diners to make space for an American family. Once all were seated I engaged in the sort of conversation one has in these situations; talk touched on the invasion of Iraq. The father, a notable US academic, stated quite firmly that it was Blair who persuaded the American intellectual elite that it was right to launch the war on Saddam Hussein.Ever since that moment I have watched for anything that focuses on this aspect of the affair, and I believe that Chilcot did not consider Blair\u2019s role in influencing US public opinion; why should he, when accountability is restricted to the \u201cline management\u201d within a nation state? The publication of the dialogue between Blair and Bush may go some way towards addressing this, but is unlikely to reveal the ultimate spin.It seems that it is this triangulation for which Bush was grateful, and for which the US right continues to show gratitude to Blair through channelling generous lecture fees to him. Blair will continue to prevaricate with qualified apologies and regret for things that are peripheral to the main point. Only an international inquiry, dare I say an international court, is able to properly consider Blair\u2019s role in propping up the intellectually weak US argument for war.Will MessengerMoreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire\u2022 There is one problem with Tony Blair\u2019s qualified mea culpa: Britain did not overthrow Saddam. Neither did it to any significant degree slaughter the civilian population, bomb cities, destroy infrastructure or desecrate holy places. In fact the UK did virtually nothing in the Iraq war after the initial seizure of Basra except hand it over to pro-Iranian militias and retreat to the safety of its barracks at Basra airport, there to await relief from US forces. Blair\u2019s comments are an arrogant repetition of the lie that the UK made any difference at all to either going to war or in determining the outcome. From the outset of hostilities Blair\u2019s war aim was the avoidance of casualties. The best (or worst) that can be laid at Blair\u2019s feet is that he gave moral cover to the US, which made it contemptuously clear that it would proceed with the war no matter what the UK did or didn\u2019t do in support. Blair should admit it: the UK\u2019s participation in the Iraq war was an irrelevance. He should then sleep sound in the knowledge that the only war crimes he was guilty of are hubris and cowardice.Chris ForseSnitterfield, Warwickshire\u2022 It seems Tony Blair is still at it \u2013 twisting and turning as usual. He says he apologises for \u201cthe intelligence being wrong\u201d but what he really should say is: \u201cI apologise for the intelligence being correct but we ignored that and told the general public and parliament a totally different story to suit our intentions.\u201d Why is there still a need to listen to him?Henk SlagterHazlemere, Buckinghamshire\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Iraq war inquiry", "Tony Blair", "Iraq", "Politics", "UK news", "Saddam Hussein", "World news", "Islamic State", "Libya", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Bashar al-Assad", "Military", "Foreign policy"], "title": "Tony Blair\u2019s partial apology for Iraq isn\u2019t enough | Letters"},{"date": "2015-10-26T09:11:17Z", "content": "Did Tony Blair\u2019s statements about taking Britain to war in Iraq constitute an apology? As far as Britain\u2019s national newspapers were concerned, they certainly did not.Most of the editorials and commentaries view his CNN interview as a spin operation ahead of the publication of the Chilcot report, which is expected, wrote the Guardian\u2019s Richard Norton-Taylor, to be \u201cdamning.\u201dThe Daily Mail accused the former prime minister of weasel words in \u201can apology of sorts.\u201d The Daily Mirror thought he had delivered a \u201chalf-hearted apology\u201d that \u201cwill bring no comfort to families whose loved ones never came home.\u201d The Daily Telegraph, rejecting any sense that it amounted to an apology, said Blair was \u201cmaking sure the political ground has been prepared for the fight to defend his reputation.\u201dAs for the Times, its opinionated news page headline reflected its scepticism, \u201cBlair gets his Iraq defence out early.\u201d The Independent argued that Blair\u2019s \u201cadmission... represents progress in coming to some sort of understanding about that ill-starred adventure and its longer-term consequences.\u201dAnd the Morning Star saw Blair\u2019s argument that \u201c\u2018the intelligence we received was wrong\u2019... is not an apology \u2014 it is blaming British and other intelligence agencies for making mistakes.\u201dSo left, right and centre appeared to agree that Blair\u2019s pre-Chilcot interview raised more questions than it answered.For the Indy, \u201capologies and semi-apologies... are no substitute for a thorough investigation into the decision to go to a war that had such grievous consequences.\u201dSeeing the rise of Isis and the conflicts across the Middle East as the result of the 2003 invasion, the paper stated: \u201cThat we can trace the plight of Syrian and Iraqi refugees back to those conversations between Mr Blair and President George Bush at Camp David is now acknowledged by at least one of those men...Whatever Mr Blair says now will not, in the short run, save a single refugee child from drowning in the Mediterranean or freezing in a mountain camp in Lebanon or the Balkans. It will not prevent a single woman being raped by militants from Isis, al-Shabaab or Boko Haram, nor the attempted genocide of minorities and destruction of human rights and cultural heritage. We shouldn\u2019t let the events of 2003 distract us from action now.\u201dIn the Sun, Trevor Kavanagh said Blair - the \u201cGreat Spinner\u201d - had \u201crejected any blame for the greatest geopolitical catastrophe this century.\u201d In so doing, he confirmed that he \u201ctook this country to war on a false prospectus, certain of victory and determined at all costs to support President George W Bush.\u201dAfter referring to Blair\u2019s interview answers as \u201cweasel words\u201d, Kavanagh continued:\u201cBlair suggests he did not foresee the inevitable chaos in Iraq once Saddam was toppled. But the consequences were widely discussed at the time.In the run-up to the invasion, we saw detailed blueprints for post-war reconstruction, with multi-billion dollar plans for a stable peacetime Iraq.There would be new roads, water supplies, hospitals and schools. Industrial generators would be flown in to keep lights burning while new power stations were constructed. Instead, power was cut off and people were left to drink from puddles.\u201dCon Couglin, in the Telegraph, pointed out that before Blair commited British forces to join the US-led coalition to overthrow Saddam Hussein, \u201cradical Islamist groups such as Isis and al-Qaida barely featured on the political terrain of either country.\u201dBut it would be unfair, he contended, to blame Blair and Bush \u201centirely\u201d for the rise of Islamist-linked militants because it was a coincidence of events. He concluded: \u201cThe real blame lies with a more recent generation of politicians who failed to grasp the importance of maintaining stability in both Iraq and Syria.\u201dMichael Burleigh, in the Mail, noted a crucial omission from Blair\u2019s not-apology:\u201cThere was no reference in his CNN interview about the recent revelation that he had committed Britain to war in Iraq at least a month before he met Bush at his ranch in Texas in April 2002...Only last week, we learnt from a newly unearthed memo from the then US secretary of state, Colin Powell, written a month earlier to Bush, that \u2018on Iraq, Blair will be with us should military operations be necessary\u0085.\u2019 This means that Blair was privately committed to war, which belied his public position that he was going down the diplomatic route to try to avoid it.\u201dBut the editorial in the Mirror will probably have a greater resonance because of the paper\u2019s Labour party loyalties. Acknowledging that Blair has already been able to read large parts of the Chilcot report, it described his \u201csquirming\u201d statement as a \u201cpreemptive strike\u201d and \u201ca semi-apology.\u201d It believed Blair \u201cwill never face up to the enormity of his actions. He will never say sorry for all he has done\u201d, adding:\u201cThe central charge against him remains woefully unaddressed \u2013 that he took this country to war upon a lie. And as a result of his actions 179 brave British soldiers lie dead, alongside thousands of US allies and untold numbers of Iraqi citizens.\u201dWe should remind ourselves that the Mirror (then edited by Piers Morgan) opposed the Iraq invasion. Some papers, notably the Sun, were gung-ho for war in 2003. However, the post-war realisation that Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction and that Britain\u2019s intelligence was flawed (and/or non-existent) changed the minds of most of the warmongers. Some still plug away, of course, viewing regime change in Iraq as justification enough.

The price of Brent crude has climbed 2.6% to $35.37 a barrel today.A notable exception is the FTSE 100 index in London, which has fallen more than 50 points to 5979.15, a fall of 0.85%. With this, we are closing up for the day. Thank you for all your comments. We will be back tomorrow.\n\n2.34pm GMT\n14:34\n\nThere\u2019s been a spate of job loss announcements by major British-based companies in the past fortnight or so, with Centrica today and Bombardier yesterday the latest companies to talk about job cuts. We\u2019ve done a round-up of companies axeing jobs in the UK, and looked at what it means for the wider economy.Allan Monks, UK economist at JPMorgan Chase, said:The one thing everyone is looking for at the moment is a sign that there is a slide in business sentiment. In the manufacturing sector in particular the trend doesn\u2019t look encouraging.\u201d\n\n2.02pm GMT\n14:02\n\nHere\u2019s some reaction to the Asda sales slump, which confirmed its position as the worst-performing of the Big Four supermarkets over the Christmas period, amid a fierce price war. George Scott, senior analyst at Verdict Retail, has looked at the chain\u2019s problems in detail.Asda\u2019s now prolonged story of negative like-for-like sales shows that it has not done enough to broaden its appeal beyond price. Indeed news this week that it has asked suppliers for cash contributions to help cover costs of promotions reflects its predicament. Away from price, Asda has a relatively weak reputation for quality, with its more upmarket Extra Special label needing greater product coverage and marketing communications. While its more functional instore experience sits well with its traditional shoppers, it also needs to do more to improve its staffing levels, adding reasons to visit, if it is to claw back ground from the discounters \u2013 Tesco has been leading by example on this front with good effect.\u201d He noted that Asda had announced some positive steps for this year, including the modernisation of 95 large stores, mostly around layout and merchandising. It also plans to further simplify its head office structure,and has joined the EMD European supermarket alliance, which will give it added buying power and allow it compete more strongly on price.If it is to improve its outlook Asda however needs to evolve its mainstay food positioning. Indeed its George fashion and home label, which has been performing strongly for some time, has exactly the type of balanced consideration of price and quality which that it needs to aim for in food.\u201d\n\n1.02pm GMT\n13:02\n\nAsda has reported a sharp fall in sales over Christmas as it failed to stem an exodus of shoppers to German discount chains Aldi and Lidl.The UK supermarket chain, owned by US retail giant Wal-mart, posted a 5.8% decline in like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to 1 January, marking the sixth quarter of falling sales. It is a steeper fall than the 4.5% and 4.7% declines seen in the previous two quarters.However, the company stressed that profitability in the quarter remained stable.Updated\nat 2.16pm GMT\n\n\n12.58pm GMT\n12:58\n\nEuropean shares have hit a two-week high, helped by gains in technology shares led by France\u2019s Capgemini which reported a 20% rise in full-year profits. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.7% to 1304.31.The FTSE 100 index in London is still down, however. It has slipped 24 points or 0.4%, but is holding above the 6000 mark at 6006.36.\n\n12.55pm GMT\n12:55\n\nThe minutes of the European Central Bank\u2019s January meeting are out. They show that policymakers thought that the eurozone\u2019s modest recovery was continuing but flagged up rising risks to the growth outlook. They also pointed to weak wage growth and other signs that low energy prices could feed through into the price of other goods and services \u2013 so-called second-round effects that could keep inflation low.The ECB\u2019s governing council left interest rates unchanged at the meeting, but its president Mario Draghi dropped heavy hints that it could ease policy at the next meeting on 10 March.The minutes said:While incoming information had confirmed the ongoing moderate recovery... downside risks had increased again amid heightened uncertainty about the growth prospects of emerging market economies, volatility in the financial and commodity markets and geopolitical risks.Inflation had continued to be weaker than expected, mainly owing to the renewed sharp fall in oil prices, but also to persistently subdued underlying price pressures. Weaker than anticipated growth in wages, in conjunction with declining inflation expectations, could also signal increased risks of second-round effects.\n\n12.10pm GMT\n12:10\n\nAfter a bit of a wobble earlier on, the rally on European stock markets continues, underpinned by rising oil prices.London\u2019s leading share index, the FTSE 100, is the only exception, trading down 0.3% or 16 points at 6015.05.Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.6% ahead, France\u2019s CAC has gained 0.8% while Spain\u2019s Ibex and Italy\u2019s FTSE Mib are just over 1% higher.Crude oil prices are rising again, adding to yesterday\u2019s 7% leap. Brent crude is up 2.1% at $35.24 a barrel after encouraging comments from Iraq\u2019s oil minister. He said talks would continue between Opec and non-Opec members about how to shore up oil prices, and that producers needed to find a way of restoring \u201cnormal\u201d prices.The Paris-based OECD think tank has called for less austerity and more public investment as it cut its growth forecasts. And Britain\u2019s productivity gap with other major economies has widened to the worst level since records began in 1991.\n\n12.00pm GMT\n12:00\n\nHere is some reaction to the UK\u2019s poor productivity figures.TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said:For all the good news on rising employment, the UK is still not creating enough quality jobs.The yawning productivity gap between us and other countries shows how much room there is for us to do better.\u201dWorkplace management firm Condeco Software is calling for more flexible working, saying the impact on productivity is well-documented.There is increased need to take the potential of flexible working seriously. In research by Vodafone, which surveyed 8,000 global employers and employees, 83% said they had seen an improvement in productivity after introducing flexible working arrangements. In addition, 61% of respondents said profits had increased. This latest report adds to research suggesting that UK businesses could make productivity gains of \u00a38.1bn by optimising flexible working.\n\n11.32am GMT\n11:32\n\nOil prices are pushing higher again, with Brent crude rising 2.6% to $35.39 a barrel, after comments from Iraq\u2019s oil minister.Adel Abdul Mahdi said talks would continue between Opec and non-Opec members about how to shore up oil prices, a day after a meeting aimed at reaching a global pact to freeze production ended inconclusively.In his first public comments since the meeting between oil ministers from Iran, Iraq, Qatar and Venezuela in Tehran yesterday, the Iraqi oil minister said producers needed to find a way of restoring \u201cnormal\u201d prices and that rapprochement between the oil cartel and non-Opec members was a step in the right direction.Two of the world\u2019s biggest exporters \u2013 Opec leader Saudi Arabia and Russia, which is not a member of the cartel \u2013 reached a surprise compromise deal earlier this week to freeze output at January levels if other producers join in.A lot hinges on Iran, whose oil minister praised the plan yesterday \u2013 but did not commit to reining in the country\u2019s own growing output.Updated\nat 11.32am GMT\n\n\n11.00am GMT\n11:00\n\nWe\u2019ve long known that despite decent economic growth, UK productivity growth isn\u2019t great (why, nobody really knows - it\u2019s called the productivity puzzle). Official figures now show that productivity gap between Britain and other G-7 countries has widened to the biggest since records began in 1991. The figures underscore the challenge for the chancellor, George Osborne, who has made raising the UK\u2019s poor productivity growth a priority.In 2014, output per hour in the UK was 18 percentage points below the average for the rest of the G-7 economies, final figures from the Office for National Statistics showed this morning.For the first time, the ONS has published international comparisons of productivity at a sectoral level. The results show that UK labour productivity trails behind the US in all sub-sectors and particularly in manufacturing.In financial services, the UK\u2019s comparative productivity has worsened sharply since 2009 and trails France and Italy as well as the US. The UK was 5% more productive than Germany but 6% less productive than France, and 22% less productive than the US between 2010 and 2014. When looking at manufacturing, the UK was 24% less productive than Germany, 18% behind France and 45% less productive than the USA. \n\n10.15am GMT\n10:15\n\nOne of the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governors, Jon Cunliffe, said this morning that the recent shift in market expectations regarding the timing of the first interest rate hike was not justified.A month ago, financial markets were expecting the first rate hike from the Bank in 2017, but are now pricing in a rise in the second quarter of 2019.Cunliffe said at an event in Brussels held by the Swiss Finance Council:I can\u2019t see anything in the economic news that would lead to a shift like that.\u201d\n\n10.05am GMT\n10:05\n\nThe OECD has called for its rich-country members to ease up on austerity and collectively agree to spend more on infrastructure projects to boost flagging growth.Our economics editor Larry Elliott reports:The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development expressed concern about the state of the global economy as it cut growth forecasts made three months ago and warned that low interest rates and money creation by central banks were no longer enough for a lasting recovery.Marking the latest stage in its shift away from support for austerity, the OECD criticised the over-reliance on monetary policy \u2013 low interest rates and the money-creation process known as quantitative easing \u2013 and urged that countries adopt a more balanced approach.The OECD has in the past supported the deficit-reduction programme taken by the UK chancellor, George Osborne, but believes Britain should now join with other countries in spending more on public investment.You can read the full story here.\n\n9.52am GMT\n09:52\n\nAlastair McCaig, market analyst at online trading firm IG, has sent us his thoughts on the markets.Early trading in Europe has seen markets creep higher with levels of enthusiasm normally shown by teenagers tidying their rooms. The FTSE has an added disadvantage as Shell, GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca all go ex-dividend, knocking 24 points off the index. The importance of David Cameron\u2019s negotiations at the EU summit can\u2019t be underestimated, as a failure to get a resolution at this meeting will almost certainly derail a Brexit referendum in June. The IG Brexit binary still indicates a 67% chance that the UK will vote to remain in the EU. Oil continues to levitate just above the $30 level as traders gauge how likely it is that major oil producers will adhere to the new production cap. It was the turn of Iran and Iraq to discuss production levels yesterday, and although Iran made all the right noises it simultaneously failed to make any promises. Considering it has only just managed to get off an oil embargo list, Iran could be forgiven for being a little reluctant to reduce capacity.\u201d\n\n9.39am GMT\n09:39\n\nJapanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said this morning he hopes the Bank of Japan\u2019s move to negative interest rates will support consumer spending and investment.Speaking at a meeting of government ministers, he added that the government is monitoring moves in financial markets and hopes to cooperate with G-7 countries as needed.

I also think it is an important message to send to those people with children living on Nauru at the moment, that there is a continuation of the government\u2019s policy.\u201d Fionnagh Dougan, chief executive of Children\u2019s Health Queensland, said in a statement on Sunday that Asha would be discharged \u201cwithin the next 24 hours\u201d and that the hospital had been advised that she would be housed in the community.\u201cThe department further advised that there is no imminent plan for the family to return to Nauru and the family\u2019s case is under consideration,\u201d she said. \u201cChildren\u2019s Health Queensland is currently working with the department on finalising arrangements for the safe relocation of the family.\u201dDougan said Asha had recovered well from burns sustained on Nauru and had been staying in the hospital\u2019s family accommodation with her mother because she no longer required treatment in the burns unit.\u201cThank you to all those involved in caring for Baby Asha and her family in recent weeks,\u201d she said.Reports had emerged earlier on Sunday that negotiations were under way to transfer Asha into community detention after protests erupted outside the hospital on Saturday night. Related: Baby Asha: protest swells at hospital amid fears of imminent removal Doctors had refused to release Asha to detention centre guards lest she be returned to offshore detention centre.Amid signs on Saturday that border officers and their private security contractor Serco were preparing to act, hundreds of protesters surrounded the exits of the hospital on Saturday night and checked cars that were leaving to make sure Asha, who was born in Australia to Nepalese Christian asylum seeker parents, was not being smuggled out.Prof Brian Owler, president of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), told Guardian Australia he had been concerned at reports that security guards would be sent to forcibly remove Asha from the hospital, saying it would be a violation of Australia\u2019s duty of care for Asha to be returned to Nauru.\u201cI spoke to a number of people last night including Bill Shorten, who then called the prime minister to seek reassurance that this would not happen,\u201d Owler told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhile it wasn\u2019t confirmed that that wouldn\u2019t happen ... the issue was at least raised with him.\u201dConcern Asha and would be moved was heightened on Saturday when her mother was placed in a communication blackout and was unable to be contacted by her lawyers or her advocate, Natasha Blucher. Transfers are commonly preceded by communication blackouts. Blucher told Guardian Australia on Sunday that she had still not been able to get in touch with Asha\u2019s mother.Owler said doctors at the hospital had an \u201cabsolute ethical obligation\u201d not to release Asha until they were certain she had a safe place to go saying: \u201cyou are not allowed to release a child into any situation where they might be exposed to harm. It is absolutely shown that offshore detention is harmful to children.He said the AMA fully supported the Brisbane hospital staff.\u201cOf course there\u2019s an ethical and moral obligation on them to keep that child in hospital. You wouldn\u2019t expect them to release any child back into that situation so why would you expect them to do it to an asylum seeker?\u201cThis is not a grey area, it\u2019s very clear what your obligations are.\u201dHowever Owler said he did not support a boycott of the offshore processing system, which is being pushed by some in the medical profession, saying that it would not stop Australian doctors from going to treat people, and would just encourage the centres to hire more doctors from overseas.Dutton, speaking on Sunday, defended the government\u2019s border protection policy and said Baby Asha had always been bound for community detention rather than a return to the offshore processing system.He suggested reports had been \u201chijacked\u201d by refugee advocates, which he suggested were \u201cmore interested in their own media profile\u201d than about the child\u2019s welfare, and appeared to lump the AMA in with that group.\u201cMy desire is to make sure we keep the boats stopped, get kids out of detention and we\u2019re not going to deviate from that course,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no special treatment, no different treatment from this family. There wasn\u2019t for the family before them and won\u2019t be for the family after them. \u201cWe are going to have a consistency of approach here because intelligence out of Indonesia recently was people smugglers were reporting the comments of [state Labor premiers Daniel Andrews and Annastacia Palaszczuk] ... to say that there was going to be a change in the policy.\u201dOwler accused the government of intimidating medical professionals.\u201cTo have an act that suggests you can be prosecuted and jailed for two years is a completely different issue,\u201d he said.\u201cThe Border Force Act is a form of intimidation itself. And I have to say there are a number of other doctors who have spoken out, who do feel their current situation with calls of an aggressive nature from the department has been intimidating. That is a situation which can not be allowed to continue.\u201dHe said the calls were \u201cheavy-handed\u201d. Asha was born in Australia but transferred to Nauru with her family at the age of five months. She returned to Australia and was taken to hospital several weeks ago after being burned with boiling water on Nauru.She and her family are among the 267 asylum seekers subject to a recent high court decision, which upheld the legality of the offshore processing system. Related: Doctors to propose boycott of Australian immigration detention system At a forum in Sydney on Sunday, the AMA called for a moratorium on children being sent back to detention centres, the immediate release of all children in both offshore and onshore detention centres, the establishment of a transparent and independent national statutory body of clinical experts to investigate the health and welfare of asylum seekers, and a revision of government policies.In his speech to the forum Owler described the centres as \u201cstate sanctioned child abuse\u201d and said the Department of Immigration and Border Protection was \u201cpulling apart the moral fabric of this country.\u201d\u201cThere are times, in any nation, where the medical profession must act in the interests not only of our patients as individuals, or for patients in a health system, but it must act in the national interest,\u201d Owler said.In a statement on Sunday, Labor\u2019s immigration and border protection spokesman, Richard Marles, said Asha\u2019s care \u201cmust be in accordance with treating doctors\u2019 advice\u201d and called on the government to handle the case \u201cwith sensitivity\u201d and in accordance with its international obligations.\u201cThe government must give an assurance to the Australian community that it is caring for Baby Asha in this way,\u201d Marles said.He did not comment on the possibility of her return to Nauru.

A study released by the OECD this week says so and the data, which examines the quality of employment, also shows that Australia has one of the highest levels of job quality in the OECD.Whenever I write about employment the common refrain is that the data ignores the quality of work \u2013 that it doesn\u2019t differentiate between a good job and one that is low-paid with equally low security. A new database from the OECD attempts to measure the good jobs. Related: The latest job figures are promising \u2013 but can they last amid the economic gloom? | Greg Jericho In defining quality employment, the OECD brakes it into three parts: 1. Earnings quality: how employment contributes to material living conditions, and how the earnings are distributed across the workforce.2. Labour market security: the level of risk of becoming and staying unemployed and also, importantly, the economic consequences for workers of being laid-off.3. The quality of the working environment: the nature and content of the work, and how much pressure the work involves. Across such measures the OECD found that Australia does quite well, noting that \u201cjob quality is the highest in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxemburg, Norway and Switzerland\u201d.On the measure of earnings quality, Australia\u2019s lower levels of inequality compared with the US, Canada and the UK saw its quality of earnings much improved compared with the more standard measure of \u201caverage earnings\u201d:Where Australia comes to the fore is on the measure of \u201cjob strain\u201d. This attempts to look at the level of work required to be done by employees relative to the amount of resources available. Here Australia was second-best, only behind New Zealand.Australia also performed well on the measures of unemployment risk \u2013 reflecting the strength of our labour market compared with most other OECD nations.But the rate of our unemployment benefits did seem to have Australia scoring only in the middle on the measure of labour market insecurity. While losing a job was not viewed as detrimental to one\u2019s income, as in nations such as the US, UK or New Zealand, Australia scored well below the most secure employment nations such as Norway, Switzerland and Luxembourg:The OECD also examined the impact of the global financial crisis.It found that in the United Kingdom, where employment is almost back to pre-GFC levels, earnings quality decreased form 2007-2013. In essence the results show that in the UK the work that replaced the jobs lost during the GFC was of lower quality \u2013 bad jobs replacing good ones.In Australia, even with our low wage growth, average earnings have risen better than most across the OECD. But because of an increase in inequality from 2007 to 2013, the growth in \u201cquality earnings\u201d in Australia in that time is slightly less than average:The OECD found that differences in the quality of work extended across the labour force. It found that youth and \u201cthe unskilled not only tend to have the worst performance in terms of employment but they also have lower earnings and considerably higher labour market insecurity and higher job strain.\u201dCertainly, in all but three countries, job insecurity was greater for low-skilled workers than it was for high-skilled.The difference between the levels of job security was generally more marked in those nations with high unemployment, but Australia found itself in the middle of the pack:The study also found that across the OECD women suffer from substantially lower employment rates than men and face a large pay gap. They are on average, however, less likely than men to experience job strain:Young people are the ones for whom job insecurity is the greatest, and they and low-skilled workers are also more likely to be in a position of job strain.The study also found that there was no trade-off between job quality and higher employment rates. In fact it found that \u201ccountries that do relatively poorly with respect to job quality tend to have relatively low employment rates and vice-versa\u201d.For example, those countries with low levels of job strain were shown to be more likely to have high levels of employment \u2013 in effect showing you don\u2019t need to have employees doing more work to reduce unemployment:Similarly, while the link between labour market security and employment was less strong, there was certainly a positive relationship between the two. Those nations whose employees were less at risk from loss of income due to losing their job \u2013 either through having high unemployment benefits or insurance, or solid employment growth \u2013 were found to be more likely to have higher rates of employment:The study also dispelled the belief that high wages hurt employment. There was essentially no link between the two, but if anything there was a slight relationship wherein nations with higher levels of quality earnings also had higher levels of employment:Everyone knows that not all jobs are equal \u2013 even within the same occupation there are good jobs and jobs with little security. Often we\u2019re told by business groups that we need to worry about competitiveness and that Australian wages are too high and our labour conditions need to be more flexible (i.e. less secure for employees) if we are to reduce unemployment and get more people into work.This new data from the OECD is a strong rebuke to such notions.", "tags": ["Australia unemployment and employment statistics", "Australian economy", "Business", "Business (Australia)"], "title": "Australia can have good jobs without sacrificing employment growth | Greg Jericho"},{"date": "2015-12-01T17:42:11Z", "content": "The Guardian Small Business Network and Kia are offering one small business owner two tickets to the Australian Open men\u2019s singles semi-final in celebration of the launch of the All-New Kia Optima.The tennis tournament is taking place in Melbourne and the prize comes with return flights from London (with a flexible return date) and three nights accommodation.

Related: What\u2019s behind Beijing\u2019s drive to control the South China Sea? | Howard W French Australia faces a delicate balancing act responding to the rise of China, which is its biggest trading partner, and continuing its long-standing alliance with the US.Beijing rebuked the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in September after he said China was \u201cpushing the envelope\u201d in the South China Sea. Late last year, Turnbull said he and Barack Obama were \u201cvery much of the same mind\u201d on regional issues.Nonetheless, Australia signed a free trade agreement with China, which attracted some criticism from trade unions but came into force in December.", "tags": ["South China Sea", "Julie Bishop", "Australian politics", "Australia news", "China", "Coalition", "Asia Pacific", "Philippines"], "title": "China warns Australia over challenge to South China Sea activities"},{"date": "2016-02-12T00:49:23Z", "content": "If you look around other liberal democracies, it might seem like the left is having a moment.In the United States, a self-described socialist is putting in a strong challenge for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination, and and mobilising a movement which aims to force the party to the left. In the United Kingdom, another socialist \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 was last year elected Labour leader on the back of a surge of new party members, who rejected the legacy of Blairism. Neither of these men may win government, but they both have already been transformational figures within parties that had never shaken off their complacent, third-way neoliberalism. In Europe, new parties on the left like Syriza and Podemos have had mixed success in delivering on their aims even when elected, but they have nevertheless been established, competed, and caused huge headaches for the established center-left parties. Australia seems like the odd man out. The only discernible move to the left in recent national parliamentary politics has been the sacking of the most conservative prime minister in living memory and his replacement with someone from the Liberal party\u2019s money wing. It\u2019s hardly a Sanders-style \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d. The Labor party has no Sanders or Corbyn on the horizon. It\u2019s still stuck in the essentially reactive and defensive position it adopted when last in government. It has no transformational social or political agenda, and its current plans seem to be more tinkering around the edges of the neoliberal consensus. At best it seems to want to reinstate elements of the Gillard legacy \u2013 like a carbon trading scheme \u2013 that even Malcolm Turnbull has previously agreed with. Worse, in its increasingly forlorn obsession with electability, the ALP has actively colluded in the construction of the west\u2019s most heinous refugee policy.  Related: Senate voting changes: Coalition wins over Nick Xenophon and Greens Even the Greens, under the emphasis provided by their new leader, seem much less like an insurgent third force connected to a vibrant social movement, and more as a group with a focus on parliamentary deal-making. And today came the news that the Greens have concluded a bargain with the government which would allow them to proceed to a double dissolution, and would likely wipe out micro parties.Under Di Natale \u2013 despite his claims that he wants them to be a party of government \u2013 you could be forgiven for thinking that the Greens are treading water, leveraging their current share of the vote for a place at the table in political deals. Perhaps this timidity on the official left is because Australia was spared the worst of the recession that ravaged North America and Europe from 2008. Tough economic times are both politically polarising, and conducive to the formulation of new kinds of political demands, from new social movements. This, in turn, leads to pressure on major parties, and tangible reforms. The Sanders candidacy can be traced directly back to the highlighting of inequality and corporate malfeasance by Occupy Wall Street. Experienced activists who were there at the beginning are now working on a presidential campaign that might finally bring the Democratic Party to constraining corporatist excess. Australia was shielded from the worst of the crash by mining revenues. Inequality increased, but those who suffered most remained on the margins. That appears to be changing quickly, and it may be that this galvanises a broader movement. If you want to see how quickly a movement can still develop and score victories in Australia, recent events in the fight against offshore detention offer a good example. The events which led to several premiers writing to the prime minister to offer to support children due to be returned to Nauru snowballed quickly, due to pressure from progressive churches, refugee advocates, and NGOs. #LetThemStay continues as a truly national movement does battle with a government which is determined to send babies back to detention. The federal ALP has been left looking flat-footed, as its members struggle to defend a policy that is not only indefensible, but suddenly looks less popular than had been imagined.

The arrangement falls short of a formal ceasefire but is seen as a key step towards de-escalating the five-year conflict.Last Friday the 20-strong ISSG announced in Munich that it would be trying to secure a cessation in a week, but the intervening days have seen no let-up in violence, with Russia continuing airstrikes against moderate opposition forces, according to diplomats monitoring the crisis. Russia says it is targeting \u201cterrorists\u201d, echoing the Syrian government\u2019s blanket description of all Assad\u2019s opponents. Related: UN to dispatch first food airdrops into Syria The hope is that if a joint US-Russian position can be agreed, the UN will negotiate the details of implementation with the parties on the ground. The UN\u2019s Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura, who was on his way back from meetings Damascus, took part in the talks by videolink.\u201cWe need real talks about peace, not just talks about talks,\u201d de Mistura told the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagblad. \u201cNow the Americans and Russians must sit down and agree on a concrete plan on the cessation of hostilities between today and mid-next week. Now the ball is in their court.\u201dThe only progress since the Munich meeting has been the start of deliveries of humanitarian aid to seven besieged areas across the country. \u201cHumanitarian access has improved this week, but it needs to become a routine, and we also need to see detainees released,\u201d one western official told the Guardian. Air drops to other areas, including Deir el-Zor, which is under siege by Isis, are to begin within days.But rebels from the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army complained that there had been no response to urgent appeals for help to be sent to 12,000 people in Daraya, west of Damascus, the target of a fierce military campaign by government forces and Hezbollah. Last year it was hit by 6,580 barrel bombs, the FSA said.If there are grounds for optimism, it is in the apparently narrowing gap between Washington and Moscow. The high level of interest is shown by the fact that the US team in Geneva is led by Rob Malley, Barack Obama\u2019s chief adviser on Syria, and the Russian side by Alexander Lavrentiev, who does the same job for Vladimir Putin.Western sources said it was vital to ensure that any cessation of violence and aid deliveries were clearly linked to a \u201cpolitical transition\u201d \u2013 meaning talks on Syria\u2019s future and Assad\u2019s role. Russia has been reluctant to address that.Since the start of the conflict in 2011 western governments have hoped that Moscow would pressure Assad into changing policy, though that has never happened in any significant way. But Russia\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said in an interview that Assad needs to respond to the Munich agreement \u2013 hinting strongly at disagreements with Damascus. Related: Refugees are becoming Russia's weapon of choice in Syria \u201cRussia has invested very seriously in this crisis, politically, diplomatically and now also militarily,\u201d Churkin told the Kommersant daily. \u201cTherefore we would like al-Assad also to respond to this,\u201d he said, adding that the Syrian leader\u2019s stance \u201cis not in accord with the diplomatic efforts that Russia is making\u201d.Churkin was responding to an interview by Assad \u2013 just before the Munich deal \u2013 in which he pledged to retake the whole of the country and appeared to rule out negotiations. \u201cIf they proceed on the basis that no ceasefire is necessary and they need to fight to a victorious end, then this conflict will last a very long time and that is terrifying to imagine,\u201d Churkin said. Syria is \u201calready on the brink of falling apart,\u201d he added.Even if a cessation of hostilities deal is agreed, it is likely to be fragile and viewed with suspicion, especially by rebels who fear they may be walking into a trap. De Mistura implicitly acknowledged this, admitting that it would not be possible \u201crealistically\u201d to reconvene the Geneva talks, as originally scheduled, on 25 February, but they \u201cintend to do so soon\u201d. Meetings began on 29 January but were suspended after just three days without results as Russian airstrikes intensified.Further evidence of intense diplomatic activity around the crisis came in a phonecall between Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, who backs the anti-Assad rebels as firmly as Moscow has supported the Syrian leader. The Saudis also work closely with Turkey, which is increasingly at odds with Russia over Kurdish involvement in the fighting.Fighting continued in Aleppo and Hasakah province, with reports of Russian airstrikes and Turkey bombing Syrian Kurdish forces in the northern border area. The Red Cross said it was \u201cdeeply alarmed by the situation in the Aleppo region, where fighting is intensifying, hospitals and health workers have been targeted, people have no water or electricity and more than 70,000 have now fled their homes\u201d.", "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Russia", "Europe", "US news", "Bashar al-Assad"], "title": "All eyes on US and Russia as Syria deadline passes"},{"date": "2016-02-08T16:34:15Z", "content": "The Doomsday Clock is still set at three minutes to midnight, the closest it has come to the world\u2019s destruction since the iciest days of the cold war, despite the nuclear deal with Iran and the Paris deal over climate change.North Korea, whose launch of a long-range rocket on Sunday followed close on a nuclear test which it claimed gave it the capability to \u201cwipe out the whole territory of the US all at once\u201d, was a factor in the decision by The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists last month to keep the symbolic countdown to three minutes to apocalypse.But it was not the only factor; far from it. \u201cThe world may be used to outrageous rhetoric from North Korea, but officials in several other countries made irresponsible comments in 2015 about raising the alert status of nuclear weapon systems, acquiring nuclear capabilities, and even using nuclear weapons\u201d, said the Bulletin\u2019s Science and Security Board.

Meetings began on 29 January but were suspended after just three days without results as Russian airstrikes intensified.Further evidence of intense diplomatic activity around the crisis came in a phonecall between Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, who backs the anti-Assad rebels as firmly as Moscow has supported the Syrian leader.

This is why the truce includes loopholes large enough to fly a few dozen Russian jets through.The statement by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), a contact group of 17 countries on both sides of the civil war, agreed \u201ca nationwide cessation of hostilities\u201d. But an exemption was carved out for Isis, Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian branch) and \u201cother groups designated as terrorist organisations by the United Nations security council\u201d. This sounds reasonable. However, both Russia and Iran \u2013 which has mobilised and led the ground forces operating under Moscow\u2019s air cover \u2013 consider virtually all Syrian rebel groups operating around Aleppo, the site of the past week\u2019s fiercest fighting, to fall into this expansive category. Related: Syria: cessation of hostilities 'within a week' agreed at Munich talks \u2013 as it happened The truth is more complicated. In the strip of rebel-held territory between Aleppo and Turkey, al-Nusra is indeed a powerful force. But it operates as part of a larger Turkish and Saudi-backed rebel coalition, Jaish al-Fatah, which also includes less extreme, though still ultraconservative, Islamist groups. The most significant of these is Ahrar al-Sham. It is these groups, and not Isis, that represent the bulk of targets in the Russian campaign, notwithstanding the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda.Washington, Ankara, Riyadh and Doha don\u2019t completely agree on how this middle ground of Islamists should be handled. The US understands that their views are in tension with the civil, pluralistic Syrian state that must follow Bashar al-Assad. Saudi Arabia and Turkey don\u2019t really care. But no one wants them bombed. Isis might exploit the vacuum, and it would bind the less extreme groups more tightly to their sometime al-Nusra collaborators.The Munich truce says that an ISSG taskforce co-chaired by Russia and the US will \u201cdelineate\u201d Isis and al-Nusra territory and resolve disputes that arise later. But groups are intermingled on the battlefield in the complex suburban geography of Aleppo and its environs, and the affiliations of individual battalions can be fluid.Russia\u2019s spectacular battlefield gains in the past month make it less inclined to accommodate American or Saudi preferences. And its offensive is doubly advantageous: not only is Assad winning, but the ensuing refugee flow leaves Europe even more desperate to make the problem go away, whatever the price. Moscow may therefore simply ignore these procedural niceties, and the US might be inclined to go along with this.After all, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, speaking alongside his Russian counterpart today, stated emphatically that \u201cit was not Russia or Iran who stopped a ceasefire from being adopted at the very beginning. I want to make that very, very clear.\u201d This was a remarkable, stinging attack on Saudi Arabia and Turkey. These countries had indeed worried that a ceasefire without a parallel political transition away from Assad would freeze the status quo, leave the regime permanently in place and therefore help Isis to thrive.Over the past week, the rebels\u2019 increasingly wretched position \u2013 the very real sense that they might, simply, be obliterated \u2013 and the US\u2019s unwillingness to push back seemed to have persuaded these powers to back the ceasefire. But Kerry\u2019s remarks \u2013 exculpatory towards Moscow and Tehran, and implicitly censorious of the US\u2019s own allies \u2013 will deepen Turkey and the Gulf states\u2019 gloom at the changing balance of power and influence in the region.It will also be interesting to see how the truce affects the relationship between Russia and its Syrian client. Less than a week ago, one of Assad\u2019s senior advisers, emboldened by the military turnaround, insisted that suggestions of a ceasefire were the work of states that \u201cdo not want an end to terrorism\u201d and merely wanted to aid rebels. Yet Assad could do little but accept the deal cut over his head. His army is in tatters, with Russia doing the bombing and Iran-led forces largely doing the fighting. His regime has been saved, but he will be nervous about his impotence over diplomacy that could affect his personal future.Russia is unlikely to forgo its military momentum. It has every hope of not only cutting rebels off from their Turkish supply lines, but perhaps also retaking regime territory elsewhere. If Aleppo, why not Palmyra? Writing on Wednesday, Vitaly Naumkin, a Russian academic closely involved in Syrian diplomacy, suggested that the regime\u2019s goals include the \u201cestablishment of a bridgehead for a massive offensive on [Isis] strongholds in the east\u201d. This process could be less problematic in places where Isis is the only real opposition, but in other, less clear-cut battlefields \u2013 around Deraa in the south, for instance, we will have renewed spats over who is a terrorist and who is not.Kerry clearly hopes that this truce will be a stepping stone to a broader ceasefire. Today\u2019s ISSG statement reiterates the lofty aim of an agreement on political transition \u2013 to include elections and a new constitution \u2013 within six months. But if Russia is bent on a military solution, it will pocket the gains of this agreement.

Like those who celebrate on the 25th food is central to the festivities, with sweet porridge made from grains and goose cooked in sour cream among popular dishes.So while the thought of another big meal may be enough to make anyone groan, on the plus side there is the extended holidays, which for most Russians start on new year\u2019s day. Here\u2019s how Russians have been enjoying the holiday, with the political elite leading the way. Just like on his birthday, Vladimir Putin was seen enjoying a festive game of ice hockey in the winter Olympic resort of Sochi on Christmas eve (6 January). Then he attended midnight mass in Turginovo in the Tver region, 90 miles from Moscow, reportedly in the cathedral where his parents were baptised in 1911. The Kremlin\u2019s official Christmas message later commended the Orthodox church and other Christians for their \u201cresponsible service\u201d to Russian society. The powerhouses of the church and the state have become increasingly aligned during Putin\u2019s tenure. In Moscow the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, joined the Patriarch Kirill for a Christmas day liturgy in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, that once played host to Pussy Riot\u2019s punk prayer. The patriarch, who is the head of the Orthodox church, marked the day by offering his support to Russia\u2019s bombing campaign in Syria, which he said was protecting the nation from \u201cterrorism\u201d, AFP reported.Celebrations were in full force across the post-Soviet world. In Belarus army recruits lined up to kiss the cross on a freezing day in the capital, Minsk. In Georgia, thousands took the streets of Tbilisi for a Christmas day procession. And in Kiev, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Orthodox led the Christmas eve celebrations. But it\u2019s sure to be a less than happy Christmas for the long haul truckers who have been camped out in a frozen Ikea car park to the north of Moscow since 3 December.

Like those who celebrate on the 25th food is central to the festivities, with sweet porridge made from grains and goose cooked in sour cream among popular dishes.So while the thought of another big meal may be enough to make anyone groan, on the plus side there is the extended holidays, which for most Russians start on new year\u2019s day. Here\u2019s how Russians have been enjoying the holiday, with the political elite leading the way. Just like on his birthday, Vladimir Putin was seen enjoying a festive game of ice hockey in the winter Olympic resort of Sochi on Christmas eve (6 January). Then he attended midnight mass in Turginovo in the Tver region, 90 miles from Moscow, reportedly in the cathedral where his parents were baptised in 1911. The Kremlin\u2019s official Christmas message later commended the Orthodox church and other Christians for their \u201cresponsible service\u201d to Russian society. The powerhouses of the church and the state have become increasingly aligned during Putin\u2019s tenure. In Moscow the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, joined the Patriarch Kirill for a Christmas day liturgy in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, that once played host to Pussy Riot\u2019s punk prayer. The patriarch, who is the head of the Orthodox church, marked the day by offering his support to Russia\u2019s bombing campaign in Syria, which he said was protecting the nation from \u201cterrorism\u201d, AFP reported.Celebrations were in full force across the post-Soviet world. In Belarus army recruits lined up to kiss the cross on a freezing day in the capital, Minsk. In Georgia, thousands took the streets of Tbilisi for a Christmas day procession. And in Kiev, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Orthodox led the Christmas eve celebrations. But it\u2019s sure to be a less than happy Christmas for the long haul truckers who have been camped out in a frozen Ikea car park to the north of Moscow since 3 December.

The arrangement falls short of a formal ceasefire but is seen as a key step towards de-escalating the five-year conflict.Last Friday the 20-strong ISSG announced in Munich that it would be trying to secure a cessation in a week, but the intervening days have seen no let-up in violence, with Russia continuing airstrikes against moderate opposition forces, according to diplomats monitoring the crisis. Russia says it is targeting \u201cterrorists\u201d, echoing the Syrian government\u2019s blanket description of all Assad\u2019s opponents. Related: UN to dispatch first food airdrops into Syria The hope is that if a joint US-Russian position can be agreed, the UN will negotiate the details of implementation with the parties on the ground. The UN\u2019s Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura, who was on his way back from meetings Damascus, took part in the talks by videolink.\u201cWe need real talks about peace, not just talks about talks,\u201d de Mistura told the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagblad. \u201cNow the Americans and Russians must sit down and agree on a concrete plan on the cessation of hostilities between today and mid-next week. Now the ball is in their court.\u201dThe only progress since the Munich meeting has been the start of deliveries of humanitarian aid to seven besieged areas across the country. \u201cHumanitarian access has improved this week, but it needs to become a routine, and we also need to see detainees released,\u201d one western official told the Guardian. Air drops to other areas, including Deir el-Zor, which is under siege by Isis, are to begin within days.But rebels from the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army complained that there had been no response to urgent appeals for help to be sent to 12,000 people in Daraya, west of Damascus, the target of a fierce military campaign by government forces and Hezbollah. Last year it was hit by 6,580 barrel bombs, the FSA said.If there are grounds for optimism, it is in the apparently narrowing gap between Washington and Moscow. The high level of interest is shown by the fact that the US team in Geneva is led by Rob Malley, Barack Obama\u2019s chief adviser on Syria, and the Russian side by Alexander Lavrentiev, who does the same job for Vladimir Putin.Western sources said it was vital to ensure that any cessation of violence and aid deliveries were clearly linked to a \u201cpolitical transition\u201d \u2013 meaning talks on Syria\u2019s future and Assad\u2019s role. Russia has been reluctant to address that.Since the start of the conflict in 2011 western governments have hoped that Moscow would pressure Assad into changing policy, though that has never happened in any significant way. But Russia\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said in an interview that Assad needs to respond to the Munich agreement \u2013 hinting strongly at disagreements with Damascus. Related: Refugees are becoming Russia's weapon of choice in Syria \u201cRussia has invested very seriously in this crisis, politically, diplomatically and now also militarily,\u201d Churkin told the Kommersant daily. \u201cTherefore we would like al-Assad also to respond to this,\u201d he said, adding that the Syrian leader\u2019s stance \u201cis not in accord with the diplomatic efforts that Russia is making\u201d.Churkin was responding to an interview by Assad \u2013 just before the Munich deal \u2013 in which he pledged to retake the whole of the country and appeared to rule out negotiations. \u201cIf they proceed on the basis that no ceasefire is necessary and they need to fight to a victorious end, then this conflict will last a very long time and that is terrifying to imagine,\u201d Churkin said. Syria is \u201calready on the brink of falling apart,\u201d he added.Even if a cessation of hostilities deal is agreed, it is likely to be fragile and viewed with suspicion, especially by rebels who fear they may be walking into a trap. De Mistura implicitly acknowledged this, admitting that it would not be possible \u201crealistically\u201d to reconvene the Geneva talks, as originally scheduled, on 25 February, but they \u201cintend to do so soon\u201d. Meetings began on 29 January but were suspended after just three days without results as Russian airstrikes intensified.Further evidence of intense diplomatic activity around the crisis came in a phonecall between Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, who backs the anti-Assad rebels as firmly as Moscow has supported the Syrian leader. The Saudis also work closely with Turkey, which is increasingly at odds with Russia over Kurdish involvement in the fighting.Fighting continued in Aleppo and Hasakah province, with reports of Russian airstrikes and Turkey bombing Syrian Kurdish forces in the northern border area. The Red Cross said it was \u201cdeeply alarmed by the situation in the Aleppo region, where fighting is intensifying, hospitals and health workers have been targeted, people have no water or electricity and more than 70,000 have now fled their homes\u201d.", "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Russia", "Europe", "US news", "Bashar al-Assad"], "title": "All eyes on US and Russia as Syria deadline passes"},{"date": "2016-02-12T16:36:51Z", "content": "Putting aside the unfortunate historical ring to \u201cpeace\u201d agreements signed in Munich, today\u2019s Syrian truce is deeply flawed and unlikely to hold for long. The \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d \u2013 for it is not a true ceasefire \u2013 has been hailed as a landmark piece of diplomacy that brings some respite to a war that long ago spiralled out of control.The veteran diplomat Lord Williams told the BBC: \u201cIn a cold war fashion, the two superpowers have taken ownership of the problem.\u201d In fact, it is the US and Europe that appear to own the problem, while Russia has held tight to the solution. Washington, wielding words, has few credible means of enforcement against Moscow, wielding unguided, though effective, bombs. This is why the truce includes loopholes large enough to fly a few dozen Russian jets through.The statement by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), a contact group of 17 countries on both sides of the civil war, agreed \u201ca nationwide cessation of hostilities\u201d. But an exemption was carved out for Isis, Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian branch) and \u201cother groups designated as terrorist organisations by the United Nations security council\u201d. This sounds reasonable. However, both Russia and Iran \u2013 which has mobilised and led the ground forces operating under Moscow\u2019s air cover \u2013 consider virtually all Syrian rebel groups operating around Aleppo, the site of the past week\u2019s fiercest fighting, to fall into this expansive category. Related: Syria: cessation of hostilities 'within a week' agreed at Munich talks \u2013 as it happened The truth is more complicated. In the strip of rebel-held territory between Aleppo and Turkey, al-Nusra is indeed a powerful force. But it operates as part of a larger Turkish and Saudi-backed rebel coalition, Jaish al-Fatah, which also includes less extreme, though still ultraconservative, Islamist groups. The most significant of these is Ahrar al-Sham. It is these groups, and not Isis, that represent the bulk of targets in the Russian campaign, notwithstanding the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda.Washington, Ankara, Riyadh and Doha don\u2019t completely agree on how this middle ground of Islamists should be handled. The US understands that their views are in tension with the civil, pluralistic Syrian state that must follow Bashar al-Assad. Saudi Arabia and Turkey don\u2019t really care. But no one wants them bombed. Isis might exploit the vacuum, and it would bind the less extreme groups more tightly to their sometime al-Nusra collaborators.The Munich truce says that an ISSG taskforce co-chaired by Russia and the US will \u201cdelineate\u201d Isis and al-Nusra territory and resolve disputes that arise later. But groups are intermingled on the battlefield in the complex suburban geography of Aleppo and its environs, and the affiliations of individual battalions can be fluid.Russia\u2019s spectacular battlefield gains in the past month make it less inclined to accommodate American or Saudi preferences. And its offensive is doubly advantageous: not only is Assad winning, but the ensuing refugee flow leaves Europe even more desperate to make the problem go away, whatever the price. Moscow may therefore simply ignore these procedural niceties, and the US might be inclined to go along with this.After all, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, speaking alongside his Russian counterpart today, stated emphatically that \u201cit was not Russia or Iran who stopped a ceasefire from being adopted at the very beginning. I want to make that very, very clear.\u201d This was a remarkable, stinging attack on Saudi Arabia and Turkey. These countries had indeed worried that a ceasefire without a parallel political transition away from Assad would freeze the status quo, leave the regime permanently in place and therefore help Isis to thrive.Over the past week, the rebels\u2019 increasingly wretched position \u2013 the very real sense that they might, simply, be obliterated \u2013 and the US\u2019s unwillingness to push back seemed to have persuaded these powers to back the ceasefire. But Kerry\u2019s remarks \u2013 exculpatory towards Moscow and Tehran, and implicitly censorious of the US\u2019s own allies \u2013 will deepen Turkey and the Gulf states\u2019 gloom at the changing balance of power and influence in the region.It will also be interesting to see how the truce affects the relationship between Russia and its Syrian client. Less than a week ago, one of Assad\u2019s senior advisers, emboldened by the military turnaround, insisted that suggestions of a ceasefire were the work of states that \u201cdo not want an end to terrorism\u201d and merely wanted to aid rebels. Yet Assad could do little but accept the deal cut over his head. His army is in tatters, with Russia doing the bombing and Iran-led forces largely doing the fighting. His regime has been saved, but he will be nervous about his impotence over diplomacy that could affect his personal future.Russia is unlikely to forgo its military momentum. It has every hope of not only cutting rebels off from their Turkish supply lines, but perhaps also retaking regime territory elsewhere. If Aleppo, why not Palmyra? Writing on Wednesday, Vitaly Naumkin, a Russian academic closely involved in Syrian diplomacy, suggested that the regime\u2019s goals include the \u201cestablishment of a bridgehead for a massive offensive on [Isis] strongholds in the east\u201d. This process could be less problematic in places where Isis is the only real opposition, but in other, less clear-cut battlefields \u2013 around Deraa in the south, for instance, we will have renewed spats over who is a terrorist and who is not.Kerry clearly hopes that this truce will be a stepping stone to a broader ceasefire. Today\u2019s ISSG statement reiterates the lofty aim of an agreement on political transition \u2013 to include elections and a new constitution \u2013 within six months. But if Russia is bent on a military solution, it will pocket the gains of this agreement. As pressure in Syria\u2019s north eases and regime control spreads, the incentives to push out Assad and reform the regime shrink. Truce and talks should have come as a package.

Medvedev\u2019s French counterpart, Manuel Valls, told the conference: \u201cTo find the path to peace again, the Russian bombing of civilians [in Syria] has to stop.\u201d The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said most of Russia\u2019s attacks had been against legitimate opposition groups in Syria.\u201cThis is the moment. This is a hinge point,\u201d he said. \u201cDecisions made in the coming days and weeks, and a few months could end the war in Syria \u2013 or could define a very difficult set of choices for the future.\u201cThe war in Syria has now lasted for almost five years and shows no signs of burning itself out, which is why we are so focused on a political track.

Sergey Lavrov said military cooperation between the US and Russia was the \u201ckey tool\u201d to ensuring the humanitarian supplies were delivered and hostilities ended.\u201cIf we are moving closer to practical goals of [a] truce then, without cooperation between the military, nothing will work out,\u201d he told the Munich conference.The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said the chance of a truce depended on Russia\u2019s actions: \u201cUnless Russia over the next days is going to stop, or at least significantly scale back that bombing, the moderate armed opposition will not join in this [peace] process. They cannot be expected to join in this process.\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign ministry said Russia\u2019s military action had \u201cseriously compromised\u201d the peace process, while the Turkish foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, said on Twitter: \u201cWhat is important now is embracing this opportunity, stopping the airstrikes, ceasing targeting civilians and providing humanitarian access.\u201d Related: Syria war cessation deal relies on something in short supply: trust The Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, told the conference the situation was more serious than the cold war. \u201cWe are probably facing a hot war,\u201d she said. \u201cRussia is demonstrating open military aggression in Ukraine, open military aggression in Syria. There is nothing cold about this, it is very hot.\u201dRussian aircraft were seen in action over northern Syria again on Friday. Its intervention in the conflict since late September has significantly strengthened the hand of President Bashar al-Assad, who on Friday vowed to regain control of the entire country. His comments dealt a swift blow to international efforts to secure a ceasefire, deliver aid and promote a negotiated solution to the war that has killed more than a quarter of a million civilians.The Syrian Observatory said that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed by Russian airstrikes in Syria.Kerry said earlier that if the peace plan agreed on Friday failed, more foreign troops could enter the conflict. \u201cIf the Assad regime does not live up to its responsibilities, and if the Iranians and the Russians do not hold Assad to the promises that they have made ... then the international community obviously is not going to sit there like fools and watch this,\u201d he said.

Like those who celebrate on the 25th food is central to the festivities, with sweet porridge made from grains and goose cooked in sour cream among popular dishes.So while the thought of another big meal may be enough to make anyone groan, on the plus side there is the extended holidays, which for most Russians start on new year\u2019s day. Here\u2019s how Russians have been enjoying the holiday, with the political elite leading the way. Just like on his birthday, Vladimir Putin was seen enjoying a festive game of ice hockey in the winter Olympic resort of Sochi on Christmas eve (6 January). Then he attended midnight mass in Turginovo in the Tver region, 90 miles from Moscow, reportedly in the cathedral where his parents were baptised in 1911. The Kremlin\u2019s official Christmas message later commended the Orthodox church and other Christians for their \u201cresponsible service\u201d to Russian society. The powerhouses of the church and the state have become increasingly aligned during Putin\u2019s tenure. In Moscow the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, joined the Patriarch Kirill for a Christmas day liturgy in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, that once played host to Pussy Riot\u2019s punk prayer. The patriarch, who is the head of the Orthodox church, marked the day by offering his support to Russia\u2019s bombing campaign in Syria, which he said was protecting the nation from \u201cterrorism\u201d, AFP reported.Celebrations were in full force across the post-Soviet world. In Belarus army recruits lined up to kiss the cross on a freezing day in the capital, Minsk. In Georgia, thousands took the streets of Tbilisi for a Christmas day procession. And in Kiev, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Orthodox led the Christmas eve celebrations.

The arrangement falls short of a formal ceasefire but is seen as a key step towards de-escalating the five-year conflict.Last Friday the 20-strong ISSG announced in Munich that it would be trying to secure a cessation in a week, but the intervening days have seen no let-up in violence, with Russia continuing airstrikes against moderate opposition forces, according to diplomats monitoring the crisis. Russia says it is targeting \u201cterrorists\u201d, echoing the Syrian government\u2019s blanket description of all Assad\u2019s opponents. Related: UN to dispatch first food airdrops into Syria The hope is that if a joint US-Russian position can be agreed, the UN will negotiate the details of implementation with the parties on the ground. The UN\u2019s Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura, who was on his way back from meetings Damascus, took part in the talks by videolink.\u201cWe need real talks about peace, not just talks about talks,\u201d de Mistura told the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagblad. \u201cNow the Americans and Russians must sit down and agree on a concrete plan on the cessation of hostilities between today and mid-next week. Now the ball is in their court.\u201dThe only progress since the Munich meeting has been the start of deliveries of humanitarian aid to seven besieged areas across the country. \u201cHumanitarian access has improved this week, but it needs to become a routine, and we also need to see detainees released,\u201d one western official told the Guardian. Air drops to other areas, including Deir el-Zor, which is under siege by Isis, are to begin within days.But rebels from the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army complained that there had been no response to urgent appeals for help to be sent to 12,000 people in Daraya, west of Damascus, the target of a fierce military campaign by government forces and Hezbollah. Last year it was hit by 6,580 barrel bombs, the FSA said.If there are grounds for optimism, it is in the apparently narrowing gap between Washington and Moscow. The high level of interest is shown by the fact that the US team in Geneva is led by Rob Malley, Barack Obama\u2019s chief adviser on Syria, and the Russian side by Alexander Lavrentiev, who does the same job for Vladimir Putin.Western sources said it was vital to ensure that any cessation of violence and aid deliveries were clearly linked to a \u201cpolitical transition\u201d \u2013 meaning talks on Syria\u2019s future and Assad\u2019s role. Russia has been reluctant to address that.Since the start of the conflict in 2011 western governments have hoped that Moscow would pressure Assad into changing policy, though that has never happened in any significant way. But Russia\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said in an interview that Assad needs to respond to the Munich agreement \u2013 hinting strongly at disagreements with Damascus. Related: Refugees are becoming Russia's weapon of choice in Syria \u201cRussia has invested very seriously in this crisis, politically, diplomatically and now also militarily,\u201d Churkin told the Kommersant daily. \u201cTherefore we would like al-Assad also to respond to this,\u201d he said, adding that the Syrian leader\u2019s stance \u201cis not in accord with the diplomatic efforts that Russia is making\u201d.Churkin was responding to an interview by Assad \u2013 just before the Munich deal \u2013 in which he pledged to retake the whole of the country and appeared to rule out negotiations. \u201cIf they proceed on the basis that no ceasefire is necessary and they need to fight to a victorious end, then this conflict will last a very long time and that is terrifying to imagine,\u201d Churkin said. Syria is \u201calready on the brink of falling apart,\u201d he added.Even if a cessation of hostilities deal is agreed, it is likely to be fragile and viewed with suspicion, especially by rebels who fear they may be walking into a trap. De Mistura implicitly acknowledged this, admitting that it would not be possible \u201crealistically\u201d to reconvene the Geneva talks, as originally scheduled, on 25 February, but they \u201cintend to do so soon\u201d. Meetings began on 29 January but were suspended after just three days without results as Russian airstrikes intensified.Further evidence of intense diplomatic activity around the crisis came in a phonecall between Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, who backs the anti-Assad rebels as firmly as Moscow has supported the Syrian leader. The Saudis also work closely with Turkey, which is increasingly at odds with Russia over Kurdish involvement in the fighting.Fighting continued in Aleppo and Hasakah province, with reports of Russian airstrikes and Turkey bombing Syrian Kurdish forces in the northern border area. The Red Cross said it was \u201cdeeply alarmed by the situation in the Aleppo region, where fighting is intensifying, hospitals and health workers have been targeted, people have no water or electricity and more than 70,000 have now fled their homes\u201d.", "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Russia", "Europe", "US news", "Bashar al-Assad"], "title": "All eyes on US and Russia as Syria deadline passes"},{"date": "2016-02-12T16:36:51Z", "content": "Putting aside the unfortunate historical ring to \u201cpeace\u201d agreements signed in Munich, today\u2019s Syrian truce is deeply flawed and unlikely to hold for long. The \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d \u2013 for it is not a true ceasefire \u2013 has been hailed as a landmark piece of diplomacy that brings some respite to a war that long ago spiralled out of control.The veteran diplomat Lord Williams told the BBC: \u201cIn a cold war fashion, the two superpowers have taken ownership of the problem.\u201d In fact, it is the US and Europe that appear to own the problem, while Russia has held tight to the solution. Washington, wielding words, has few credible means of enforcement against Moscow, wielding unguided, though effective, bombs. This is why the truce includes loopholes large enough to fly a few dozen Russian jets through.The statement by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), a contact group of 17 countries on both sides of the civil war, agreed \u201ca nationwide cessation of hostilities\u201d. But an exemption was carved out for Isis, Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian branch) and \u201cother groups designated as terrorist organisations by the United Nations security council\u201d. This sounds reasonable. However, both Russia and Iran \u2013 which has mobilised and led the ground forces operating under Moscow\u2019s air cover \u2013 consider virtually all Syrian rebel groups operating around Aleppo, the site of the past week\u2019s fiercest fighting, to fall into this expansive category. Related: Syria: cessation of hostilities 'within a week' agreed at Munich talks \u2013 as it happened The truth is more complicated. In the strip of rebel-held territory between Aleppo and Turkey, al-Nusra is indeed a powerful force. But it operates as part of a larger Turkish and Saudi-backed rebel coalition, Jaish al-Fatah, which also includes less extreme, though still ultraconservative, Islamist groups. The most significant of these is Ahrar al-Sham. It is these groups, and not Isis, that represent the bulk of targets in the Russian campaign, notwithstanding the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda.Washington, Ankara, Riyadh and Doha don\u2019t completely agree on how this middle ground of Islamists should be handled. The US understands that their views are in tension with the civil, pluralistic Syrian state that must follow Bashar al-Assad. Saudi Arabia and Turkey don\u2019t really care. But no one wants them bombed. Isis might exploit the vacuum, and it would bind the less extreme groups more tightly to their sometime al-Nusra collaborators.The Munich truce says that an ISSG taskforce co-chaired by Russia and the US will \u201cdelineate\u201d Isis and al-Nusra territory and resolve disputes that arise later. But groups are intermingled on the battlefield in the complex suburban geography of Aleppo and its environs, and the affiliations of individual battalions can be fluid.Russia\u2019s spectacular battlefield gains in the past month make it less inclined to accommodate American or Saudi preferences. And its offensive is doubly advantageous: not only is Assad winning, but the ensuing refugee flow leaves Europe even more desperate to make the problem go away, whatever the price. Moscow may therefore simply ignore these procedural niceties, and the US might be inclined to go along with this.After all, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, speaking alongside his Russian counterpart today, stated emphatically that \u201cit was not Russia or Iran who stopped a ceasefire from being adopted at the very beginning. I want to make that very, very clear.\u201d This was a remarkable, stinging attack on Saudi Arabia and Turkey. These countries had indeed worried that a ceasefire without a parallel political transition away from Assad would freeze the status quo, leave the regime permanently in place and therefore help Isis to thrive.Over the past week, the rebels\u2019 increasingly wretched position \u2013 the very real sense that they might, simply, be obliterated \u2013 and the US\u2019s unwillingness to push back seemed to have persuaded these powers to back the ceasefire. But Kerry\u2019s remarks \u2013 exculpatory towards Moscow and Tehran, and implicitly censorious of the US\u2019s own allies \u2013 will deepen Turkey and the Gulf states\u2019 gloom at the changing balance of power and influence in the region.It will also be interesting to see how the truce affects the relationship between Russia and its Syrian client. Less than a week ago, one of Assad\u2019s senior advisers, emboldened by the military turnaround, insisted that suggestions of a ceasefire were the work of states that \u201cdo not want an end to terrorism\u201d and merely wanted to aid rebels. Yet Assad could do little but accept the deal cut over his head. His army is in tatters, with Russia doing the bombing and Iran-led forces largely doing the fighting. His regime has been saved, but he will be nervous about his impotence over diplomacy that could affect his personal future.Russia is unlikely to forgo its military momentum. It has every hope of not only cutting rebels off from their Turkish supply lines, but perhaps also retaking regime territory elsewhere. If Aleppo, why not Palmyra? Writing on Wednesday, Vitaly Naumkin, a Russian academic closely involved in Syrian diplomacy, suggested that the regime\u2019s goals include the \u201cestablishment of a bridgehead for a massive offensive on [Isis] strongholds in the east\u201d. This process could be less problematic in places where Isis is the only real opposition, but in other, less clear-cut battlefields \u2013 around Deraa in the south, for instance, we will have renewed spats over who is a terrorist and who is not.Kerry clearly hopes that this truce will be a stepping stone to a broader ceasefire. Today\u2019s ISSG statement reiterates the lofty aim of an agreement on political transition \u2013 to include elections and a new constitution \u2013 within six months. But if Russia is bent on a military solution, it will pocket the gains of this agreement. As pressure in Syria\u2019s north eases and regime control spreads, the incentives to push out Assad and reform the regime shrink. Truce and talks should have come as a package.

This is a hinge point,\u201d he said. \u201cDecisions made in the coming days and weeks, and a few months could end the war in Syria \u2013 or could define a very difficult set of choices for the future.\u201cThe war in Syria has now lasted for almost five years and shows no signs of burning itself out, which is why we are so focused on a political track. If the international community and the Syrians themselves miss the opportunity now before us to achieve that political resolution to the conflict [then] the violence, the bloodshed, the torture, the bombing, and the anguish will continue \u2013 so will the siren call to jihad.\u201dHowever, Russia\u2019s foreign minister said the chances of securing a ceasefire within a week were less than 50% and his country remained deeply suspicious of US intentions. Sergey Lavrov said military cooperation between the US and Russia was the \u201ckey tool\u201d to ensuring the humanitarian supplies were delivered and hostilities ended.\u201cIf we are moving closer to practical goals of [a] truce then, without cooperation between the military, nothing will work out,\u201d he told the Munich conference.The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said the chance of a truce depended on Russia\u2019s actions: \u201cUnless Russia over the next days is going to stop, or at least significantly scale back that bombing, the moderate armed opposition will not join in this [peace] process. They cannot be expected to join in this process.\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign ministry said Russia\u2019s military action had \u201cseriously compromised\u201d the peace process, while the Turkish foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, said on Twitter: \u201cWhat is important now is embracing this opportunity, stopping the airstrikes, ceasing targeting civilians and providing humanitarian access.\u201d Related: Syria war cessation deal relies on something in short supply: trust The Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, told the conference the situation was more serious than the cold war. \u201cWe are probably facing a hot war,\u201d she said. \u201cRussia is demonstrating open military aggression in Ukraine, open military aggression in Syria. There is nothing cold about this, it is very hot.\u201dRussian aircraft were seen in action over northern Syria again on Friday. Its intervention in the conflict since late September has significantly strengthened the hand of President Bashar al-Assad, who on Friday vowed to regain control of the entire country. His comments dealt a swift blow to international efforts to secure a ceasefire, deliver aid and promote a negotiated solution to the war that has killed more than a quarter of a million civilians.The Syrian Observatory said that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed by Russian airstrikes in Syria.Kerry said earlier that if the peace plan agreed on Friday failed, more foreign troops could enter the conflict. \u201cIf the Assad regime does not live up to its responsibilities, and if the Iranians and the Russians do not hold Assad to the promises that they have made ... then the international community obviously is not going to sit there like fools and watch this,\u201d he said.  Related: Turkey shells Kurdish forces in Syria 'in retaliation for attack on border posts' \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said Saudi Arabia had sent troops and fighter jets to Turkey\u2019s Incirlik military base ahead of a possible ground invasion of Syria, but did not reveal any numbers.\u201cWe have always emphasised the need for an extensive result-oriented strategy in the fight against [Isis]. If we have such a strategy, then Turkey and Saudi Arabia may launch an operation from the land,\u201d he told a Turkish newspaper. The Saudi foreign minister said his country would be \u201cready to participate\u201d in ground action and reiterated a desire to see the Syrian president deposed.\u201cThere will be no Bashar al-Assad in the future,\u201d Adel al-Jubeir told Germany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. \u201cIt might take three months, it might take six months or three years \u2013 but he will no longer carry responsibility for Syria.

Russian media demonise the US, the UK and Germany. President Obama and Dr Merkel are under constant attack. Clearly the often obscene attacks against western leaders are aimed at weakening their public standing, and eroding western values and the cohesion and security of the European Union and its historical ties to the United States. Related: West must condemn Russian action in Syria | Letters President Putin of Russia, buoyed by extraordinarily high oil prices and perceiving no possible credible response from Nato, set about to dismember Ukraine. This has turned into a fiasco for Russia. The pain of sanctions has been exacerbated by a dramatic drop in the price of oil and other commodities. Counter-sanctions by Russia to stop imports of food from Ukraine, Poland, Turkey and the Baltic states have led to steep rises in the price of food, the pain of which has been doubled by the falling value of the rouble and cutbacks of medical and other services.Clearly, the people of Russia have been caused undue suffering by the imprudent decisions of their leader.

It has been some time since the rebel-held city of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, on the war-torn fringes of Europe, has witnessed any frontline action. An explosion sends pulses racing. \u201cFinally,\u201d grins one of the men. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight.\u201dBut, with a large gathering fast approaching, the bikers soon put themselves back to work. After all, their stage is not going to build itself. Their magical oak tree stands unfinished; a phoenix costume needs its full, resplendent plumage.Such are the confounding contrasts among the Luhansk chapter of the Night Wolves, Russia\u2019s largest and most infamous motorcycle club. The men now busily constructing a winter wonderland for the children of this battle-scarred city are the same bearded, tattooed bikers who inject extreme, flag-waving nationalism into motorcycle rallies, who fight alongside Russian-backed, separatist militias, and deride the \u201cSatanism\u201d of the west.A few weeks later, the club would open its huge, rusting gates to the public, unleashing a strange brew of bike stunts, Slavic fairytales and patriotic pageantry, to see in the new year. Converted from a disused sports complex, the Night Wolves\u2019 base is a militaristic, Mad Max mishmash of wrecked tanks, spent artillery shells and technicolour murals. At the rear, behind a museum of Soviet-era cars, the men grow vegetables and tend beehives.The stars of the forthcoming show are Luhansk\u2019s own few-dozen Night Wolves. Denis Kuznetsov, the brooding, soft-spoken deputy commander, has left his wife and children in Moscow to support Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian insurgency; Vitaly \u201cThe Prosecutor\u201d Kishkinov is their severe, swaggering boss; Sergey \u201cMosquito\u201d Komarov is a baby-faced biker whose warmth and ebullience at times fail to eclipse the lasting trauma caused by fighting in Russia\u2019s ruthless campaign in Chechnya. Then there is Shamil Shakov, a psychologist from Siberia, whose stillness and new-age spirituality have led him to serve as the group\u2019s unofficial sage.Despite their penchant for chromed theatrics, the Night Wolves are no marginal subculture: they ride at the vanguard of Russia\u2019s new wave of ultranationalism. The club boasts thousands of members across eastern Europe and enjoys close relations with the Russian president, leading some to dub them Putin\u2019s Angels. Their presence here \u2013 and their role in the ongoing conflict \u2013 sheds light on the war in Donbass (eastern Ukraine), on Putin\u2019s style of domestic politics, and on Russia\u2019s ever-deteriorating relationship with the west.While its Moscow HQ has had international media attention, the club\u2019s outpost in the self-proclaimed Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (LNR) remains largely unreported. But after more than a month of negotiations, a small team and I secured unrestricted access to shoot a documentary about the group. Weighed down with camera gear, our pockets stuffed with roubles, we crossed the conflict\u2019s buffer zone and journeyed deep into the country\u2019s separatist heartland to meet them.***On a cold, grey morning in Luhansk, one of Ukraine\u2019s bleakest and best-preserved Soviet cities, we meet Kuznetsov at the Night Wolves\u2019 base. In the courtyard, club members arrange props and saw logs for the forthcoming show. Framed by the flag of Novorossiya, Ukraine\u2019s loose confederation of rebel-held territories, Kuznetsov wears a biker jacket over military fatigues, his olive-green beret badged with a hammer and sickle to round off the Easy Rider guerrilla look. For the Night Wolves, image is king.\u201cEverything was inspired by American clubs, even the way we dress,\u201d Kuznetsov explains. \u201cWe took the best and reproduced it in our way. The club was created to fight against the USSR, but in the end we started working with the state.\u201dKuznetsov joined the Night Wolves in the early 90s, after meeting the club\u2019s charismatic leader, Alexander Zaldostanov, who trained in medicine and is known as \u201cThe Surgeon\u201d. Kuznetsov\u2019s role in the club would eventually shift from motorcycle enthusiast to militant fighter. As the Maidan street protests engulfed Kiev in the winter of 2013-14, in a bloody push towards integration with Europe, he was among a swath of ethnic Russians who saw only a violent coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.Stoked by the Kremlin\u2019s narrative that Ukrainian \u201cfascists\u201d, aided and abetted by the CIA, had overthrown a legitimate, pro-Russian government (the notorious kleptocracy of Viktor Yanukovych, accused of presiding over a \u201cmafia\u201d administration that cost the country billions of dollars), Kuznetsov left his family in Moscow in February 2014 and headed south. He and other bikers actively engaged in Russia\u2019s covert invasion of Crimea, swapping leathers for body armour; that summer, they joined Ukraine\u2019s separatist insurgency.\u201cThe Maidan movement was starting in Crimea. We decided to invest all our strength in preventing it,\u201d Kuznetsov tells us one evening in his sleeping quarters, over shots of fiery moonshine. Religious icons, separatist banners, war medals and Kalashnikov rifles furnish the room, alongside a wolf-emblazoned dreamcatcher and a portrait of Kuznetsov\u2019s grandfather in the second world war.\u201cThe Night Wolves built the first checkpoints,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were the first to be given weapons and to patrol Sevastopol. I am one of the million reasons Crimea finally was annexed.\u201d The US later sanctioned the Night Wolves for storming a gas facility and Ukrainian naval base on the Black Sea peninsula, blocking any assets they might have in the US and banning contact with US citizens \u2013 a token gesture, given the unlikelihood of patriotic Russians investing there. Meanwhile, in Moscow, The Surgeon received a medal for his efforts.For Kuznetsov and his fellow Night Wolves, the collapse of the Soviet Union remains a source of profound regret; Crimea\u2019s annexation gave them the perfect opportunity to help Russia reassert its strength and resurrect a lost domain. \u201cThe USSR was the most powerful empire in the world,\u201d he muses one cold, overcast morning, walking among the carcasses of Soviet-era tanks salvaged from the Donbass battlefield. \u201cAnd in one hour, without a single shot, it was over. We lost everything we had for bubble gum and jeans. And McDonald\u2019s.\u201d He recounts the penury of Moscow in the chaotic aftermath: empty shops and queues to buy basic groceries with coupons. For Kuznetsov, the west can tolerate only a crippled post-Soviet state, not a resurgent Russia. \u201cSuddenly, everyone loved us. Now that we\u2019re here and strong, no one likes us. When I was lying on the floor, everyone loved me.\u201dBut Kuznetsov\u2019s role in Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea, and in the conflict in Donbass, has come at a price. He has received medals but barely been home. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m a real traitor: I betrayed my family,\u201d he admits. \u201cMy wife didn\u2019t understand. I\u2019m a grown man. I had an income, three children. What was I looking for? But I had to go.\u201dThe USSR was the most powerful empire in the world. And in one hour, without a single shot, it was overThe Night Wolves first roared out from Moscow\u2019s 1980s underground. In the liberalised environment that flourished under Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s perestroika reforms, kindred bikers and metalheads partied to rock music, provided security for bands and ran protection rackets, tearing around the capital on their Soviet-era Dnepr, Jawa and Voskhod motorcycles. \u201cWe were a powerful band on wheels,\u201d Kuznetsov recalls. \u201cWe were driving fast in Moscow by night, escaping the police.\u201dSince those early years, he and his fellow Night Wolves have evolved from an anarchic posse of petrolheads into a key component of the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda machine. August 1991 marked a pivotal moment, as they moved in from the margins to join the resistance against the failed anti-Gorbachev putsch launched by communist hardliners.In Russia\u2019s rocky 90s, the club began hosting annual motorcycle shows and launched a Wolf Wear clothing line. Putin has since become its most powerful patron, sanctioning huge grants and driving a three-wheeled Harley-Davidson as a Night Wolves outrider. They ride across Slavic landscapes to Orthodox holy sites, and stage shows that combine stunts, special effects and hard rock with zealous patriotism and pyrotechnics.Russia expert Mark Galeotti, a professor of global affairs at New York University, says the Night Wolves are not part of the counterculture; they are \u201ccountercountercultural\u201d, acting as \u201coutlaws yet tools of the state\u201d. In other words, the Kremlin has brought them in from the fringes to exploit their pro-Putinism, fervent Orthodoxy and anti-American rhetoric as a potent source of soft power. A Harley-Davidson rally from Moscow to Berlin last April retraced the Red Army\u2019s route to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany; in August, in Sevastopol, the bikers staged a second world war re-creation in a performance complete with lasers, rock music and motorcycle stunts. Meanwhile, opposition activist Alexei Navalny has uncovered the flow of millions of roubles from the Russian government to the club, including funds to perform anti-western children\u2019s shows. Throw in their Soviet revivalism and large cache of assault rifles, and you have quite a cocktail.Anyone can apply to be in the Night Wolves. Drug addicts can't join. Neither can gay men. Women can't join, eitherOn our first day in Luhansk, Vitaly Kishkinov, the bullish boss of the local chapter, gives us a tour of the base. Over the next week, we get to know his men beyond the two-dimensional characters the club so readily projects. Kishkinov, however, remains stubbornly opaque and ideological \u2013 a consummate rebel leader.\u201cI love my country, I received it with my mother\u2019s milk,\u201d he tells us in front of a large mural inspired by Mad Max, featuring a fanged, fuel-belching tanker bursting through a brick wall. \u201cI am proud of my ancestors, proud of our Great Victory [in the second world war], proud of our grandfathers who shed blood and came back with medals. There\u2019s no force on Earth that can make me think differently.\u201d For Kishkinov, the irony of delivering such a patriotic monologue against the backdrop of a Hollywood hit is no obstacle.Kishkinov, whose wife and two children live elsewhere in Luhansk while he immerses himself in the club, takes us to what he calls \u201cthe museum\u201d \u2013 part games room, part shrine. A billiards table is draped with wolfskins. One corner is dedicated to his celebrity friends, including photographs of crooner Grigory Leps, who was sanctioned by the US for suspected mafia ties. Orthodox icons and crucifixes plaster the walls, alongside portraits of Stalin and Ramzan Kadyrov, Putin\u2019s puppet warlord in Chechnya. Elsewhere in the dark room, a sign reads, in Russian, \u201cI will buy the skin of Obama.\u201dWho can join the Night Wolves, I ask Kishkinov. \u201cAnyone can apply, anyone with the desire to join,\u201d he says, adding pointedly: \u201cDrug addicts can\u2019t join. Neither can pederasts. [He uses the Russian homophobic slang for gay men.] Women can\u2019t join, either: it\u2019s a men\u2019s club.\u201dWhy not gay men? Kishkinov, whose star in the Night Wolves has risen alongside Russia\u2019s hard rightward, homophobic turn, looks incredulous. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say. This is too obvious: God created us as men and women to sleep together. Gays are not normal.\u201d Turning to religion, he continues: \u201cWe are Orthodox people, and if one loses his faith in the Wolves or in Orthodoxy, life has no sense. God is with us and God helps us.\u201dKuznetsov would go even further. In a war often viewed in hyperbolic terms \u2013 the Ukrainians brand the enemy \u201cterrorists\u201d; Russian-backed forces claim to battle \u201cneo-Nazis\u201d \u2013 he employs a phrase more readily associated with militants waging jihad. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen many miracles here. We\u2019ve seen bombed churches where people survived,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a religious and spiritual war.\u201d***When separatist tensions in the Donbass region erupted into open warfare in the spring of 2014, claiming more than 9,000 lives to date, the Night Wolves were among the pro-Russian fighters deployed to carve out breakaway \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d. Several members were killed and the US government later alleged close links between the club and Russian special forces. The Night Wolves had evolved from a tool for exerting soft power to something harder and more violent.As the front line ossifies into a de facto border, the group has integrated with the rebels\u2019 internal affairs ministry, retaining a paramilitary function and substantial arsenal. But it has also returned to its civic roots: staging patriotic events, campaigning against corruption, participating in urban renewal, delivering humanitarian aid \u2013 much to the adulation of the local population.Putin\u2019s brand of politics has created an environment in which such an organisation can thrive. His brash cult of the macho celebrity is the modern-day cult of Stalin. Here, in a political arena as manipulated as a daytime melodrama, Putin is at the top of the A-list. \u201cThis man has leadership,\u201d Kuznetsov insists. \u201cHis politics are the best possible course for Russia.\u201dStalin has enjoyed a renaissance, too, as the Kremlin harnesses Soviet nostalgia to reconnect with Russia\u2019s superpower past. The Night Wolves\u2019 reverence for the dictator is clear even before you step inside their base. A flag bearing Stalin\u2019s face adorns the entrance gates, while three other banners show Jesus Christ, the tricolour of the Russian Federation and the LNR\u2019s red star emblem.On arrival in Luhansk, we visited the rebel regime\u2019s ministry of information, a vast monolith housing a warren of corridors and sullen bureaucrats. The Soviet-style paranoia of an emergent autocracy was rife; an apparatchik took our local fixer aside in a hallway and hissed: \u201cIt would be wise to stop working with such western journalists and return home at the earliest opportunity.\u201dLater, our names came up during a televised cabinet meeting. The LNR\u2019s increasingly authoritarian leader, Igor Plotnitsky, expressed clear suspicion about our work in his separatist statelet, prompting the rebels\u2019 minister of information to intervene: \u201cThey are working for the Guardian. It\u2019s just some online youth magazine.\u201d We tried to shrug off both incidents as amusing quirks, but they would come back to haunt us.We spend the following afternoon in the snug sentry hut of the Night Wolves\u2019 base. Over cups of tea and bread smeared with salo (pork fat), Sergey \u201cMosquito\u201d Komarov tells us how his life led to this moment. One of the most affable members of the chapter, he was born in a village outside Moscow and, as a teenager, served as a tankman during Russia\u2019s brutal bid to crush Chechen resistance at the turn of the millennium. It is clear the experience caused Mosquito subtle but long-term psychological damage. Biking offered a kind of therapy.\u201cWhat have I gone through? A lot. It took me two years to get over it,\u201d says Mosquito, now in his early 30s. \u201cRiding a motorbike has always been something I love. Fill up the tank and ride \u2013 your head is free from everything. Driving 2,000km is better than a month of holidays.\u201dWhile running humanitarian aid to a frontline town in Ukraine last year, he met a local girl, Nadia, whose father had already left home to fight with the separatists. She later moved in with Mosquito at the base. \u201cWe didn\u2019t choose the life we have,\u201d says Nadia, 19, resting against him in the sentry post. \u201cI don\u2019t care to be somewhere else. My man is here.\u201d Their rapport is touching, almost innocent \u2013 the sort of relationship born out of chance meetings amid the ravages of war.Before our arrival, a two-month lull broke down as both sides re-engaged in trench warfare, nightly bombardments striking the outskirts of the separatist stronghold of Donetsk. The frontline near Luhansk is calmer, though the remnants of 2014\u2019s conflagration appear everywhere: boarded-up shops, tarmac cratered by mortar fire, buildings demolished by airstrikes and artillery attacks. The most dramatic destruction lies several miles away at the airport. Clashes between pro-Kiev forces and separatist militias, including members of Luhansk\u2019s Night Wolves, backed by the might of the Russian army, dealt the terminal near-total annihilation.On a bright, windswept morning, Kishkinov shows us the devastation, navigating the massive craters that rupture the runway. One lone worker clambers over the rubble to collect an armful of bricks before walking down and dumping the debris on the ground, only to repeat the endless, empty exercise.\u201cEverything was destroyed,\u201d Kishkinov says loudly, over the wind. \u201cIt was a big battle \u2013 a very big one. Everything here is rinsed with blood, just as in the Great Patriotic War. Souls inhabit this place. The city was under siege. When I speak about this, I have goosebumps. I wouldn\u2019t even want an enemy to go through this.\u201dIn the shadow of the ruined terminal, I press him on Russia\u2019s involvement in the war, long denied by Putin until recently, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Surely he encountered Russian troops? Surely the blame for war cannot rest solely with Ukraine? \u201cRussia is not concerned here,\u201d Kishkinov snarls in heavy, expletive-strewn Russian. \u201cNot once has Russia started war on her borders; Russia has never made war on another\u2019s territory. We are always defending ourselves from enemies who want to take our land.\u201dWe continue the final leg of the tour in silence as Kishkinov storms ahead. At his 4x4, he turns to the camera: \u201cGreetings, Europe. I wish you one thing: that your people never experience what we did here. Live in peace and remember this saying: \u2018A bad peace is better than a good war.\u2019\u201dRainclouds barrel across the sky and we depart. Like Sisyphus, the lone figure continues to toil at his impossible task, dismantling the ruined airport stone by stone.***The presence and influence of the Night Wolves in Luhansk underscores the bitter ethnic rift that runs through Ukraine. Many in the chapter are local men, yet align themselves with Moscow over Kiev, in spite of their common past and language.Regardless of his militant creed, it is a divide that troubles Kuznetsov. \u201cThere was a moment when we were fighting last year,\u201d he says. \u201cAs I approached some Ukrainian prisoners, they took their crosses, kissed them and prayed. And I knew they were saying the same prayers as I do. These were Orthodox men. Do I hate Ukrainians? No, I love them. But we have been set on each other.\u201dIt was to be our final night at the base; we kept the camera rolling amid a fug of cigarette smoke while talking and trading ideas with the bikers in their sleeping quarters. Two hours before the start of military curfew, we received a tipoff that the authorities had deemed us no longer welcome and had issued an arrest warrant. Our fixer\u2019s security and our reams of footage were at risk; we decided to hit the road as a matter of urgency.We shook hands with Kuznetsov, bade a swift goodbye and headed to the gates. Minutes later in the dark December chill, we spotted one of the older, more grizzled bikers on sentry duty. In the 90s, Ivar had seen action with the Russian army throughout the restive Caucasus. Now, in his 50s, he had found himself embroiled in yet another separatist conflict on the frontiers of Russia.The headlights of our van appeared as our fixer raced down the track to meet us outside the Night Wolves\u2019 stronghold. Within an hour, he would be speeding towards the safety of the Russian border. I would bundle into a second car with my fellow film-maker, Sebastien, before navigating a series of rural backroads to avoid rebel checkpoints. We would grab a few hours\u2019 sleep in a hostel near the frontline, leave before dawn and cross the conflict\u2019s buffer zone into government-held Ukraine by lunchtime, our footage beyond the reach of any pro-Russia militias bent on confiscating it.Before that, we had just enough time to say farewell. The city lay silent beneath a cloudless winter night. Ivar gave us a warm smile but declined to return our goodbyes. \u201cI\u2019ll just say, see you soon,\u201d he responded quietly. \u201cSince the war began, I\u2019ve stopped saying goodbye to people.\u201d", "tags": ["Ukraine", "Russia", "Vladimir Putin", "Crimea", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "Putin\u2019s Angels: the bikers battling for Russia in Ukraine"},{"date": "2016-02-08T16:34:15Z", "content": "The Doomsday Clock is still set at three minutes to midnight, the closest it has come to the world\u2019s destruction since the iciest days of the cold war, despite the nuclear deal with Iran and the Paris deal over climate change.North Korea, whose launch of a long-range rocket on Sunday followed close on a nuclear test which it claimed gave it the capability to \u201cwipe out the whole territory of the US all at once\u201d, was a factor in the decision by The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists last month to keep the symbolic countdown to three minutes to apocalypse.But it was not the only factor; far from it. \u201cThe world may be used to outrageous rhetoric from North Korea, but officials in several other countries made irresponsible comments in 2015 about raising the alert status of nuclear weapon systems, acquiring nuclear capabilities, and even using nuclear weapons\u201d, said the Bulletin\u2019s Science and Security Board. It added: \u201c...the United States, Russia, and other nuclear weapons countries are engaged in programmes to modernize their nuclear arsenals, suggesting that they plan to keep and maintain the readiness of their nuclear weapons for decades at least\u2014despite their pledges, codified in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to pursue nuclear disarmament.\u201dThe Bulletin scientists continue: \u201cThe Russians will have fewer launchers, but their future force will be more mobile and have more flexibly targeted warheads. The United States plans to spend $350bn in the next 10 years to maintain and modernize its nuclear forces and infrastructure, despite rhetoric about a nuclear weapons-free world.\u201cWith no follow-on arms control agreement in sight and deeply disturbing nuclear rhetoric issuing from Russia, the risks of short launch times, of large warhead stockpiles, and of narrowing channels for averting crisis recall the dark days of the cold war.\u201d Drop the rhetoric and \u201cengage North Korea to reduce nuclear risks\u201d, says the Bulletin. \u201cNeighbours in Asia face the most urgent threat, but as North Korea improves its nuclear and missile arsenals, the threat will rapidly become global.

Like those who celebrate on the 25th food is central to the festivities, with sweet porridge made from grains and goose cooked in sour cream among popular dishes.So while the thought of another big meal may be enough to make anyone groan, on the plus side there is the extended holidays, which for most Russians start on new year\u2019s day. Here\u2019s how Russians have been enjoying the holiday, with the political elite leading the way. Just like on his birthday, Vladimir Putin was seen enjoying a festive game of ice hockey in the winter Olympic resort of Sochi on Christmas eve (6 January). Then he attended midnight mass in Turginovo in the Tver region, 90 miles from Moscow, reportedly in the cathedral where his parents were baptised in 1911. The Kremlin\u2019s official Christmas message later commended the Orthodox church and other Christians for their \u201cresponsible service\u201d to Russian society. The powerhouses of the church and the state have become increasingly aligned during Putin\u2019s tenure. In Moscow the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, joined the Patriarch Kirill for a Christmas day liturgy in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, that once played host to Pussy Riot\u2019s punk prayer. The patriarch, who is the head of the Orthodox church, marked the day by offering his support to Russia\u2019s bombing campaign in Syria, which he said was protecting the nation from \u201cterrorism\u201d, AFP reported.Celebrations were in full force across the post-Soviet world. In Belarus army recruits lined up to kiss the cross on a freezing day in the capital, Minsk. In Georgia, thousands took the streets of Tbilisi for a Christmas day procession. And in Kiev, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Orthodox led the Christmas eve celebrations. But it\u2019s sure to be a less than happy Christmas for the long haul truckers who have been camped out in a frozen Ikea car park to the north of Moscow since 3 December.

The arrangement falls short of a formal ceasefire but is seen as a key step towards de-escalating the five-year conflict.Last Friday the 20-strong ISSG announced in Munich that it would be trying to secure a cessation in a week, but the intervening days have seen no let-up in violence, with Russia continuing airstrikes against moderate opposition forces, according to diplomats monitoring the crisis. Russia says it is targeting \u201cterrorists\u201d, echoing the Syrian government\u2019s blanket description of all Assad\u2019s opponents. Related: UN to dispatch first food airdrops into Syria The hope is that if a joint US-Russian position can be agreed, the UN will negotiate the details of implementation with the parties on the ground. The UN\u2019s Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura, who was on his way back from meetings Damascus, took part in the talks by videolink.\u201cWe need real talks about peace, not just talks about talks,\u201d de Mistura told the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagblad. \u201cNow the Americans and Russians must sit down and agree on a concrete plan on the cessation of hostilities between today and mid-next week. Now the ball is in their court.\u201dThe only progress since the Munich meeting has been the start of deliveries of humanitarian aid to seven besieged areas across the country. \u201cHumanitarian access has improved this week, but it needs to become a routine, and we also need to see detainees released,\u201d one western official told the Guardian. Air drops to other areas, including Deir el-Zor, which is under siege by Isis, are to begin within days.But rebels from the Southern Front of the Free Syrian Army complained that there had been no response to urgent appeals for help to be sent to 12,000 people in Daraya, west of Damascus, the target of a fierce military campaign by government forces and Hezbollah. Last year it was hit by 6,580 barrel bombs, the FSA said.If there are grounds for optimism, it is in the apparently narrowing gap between Washington and Moscow. The high level of interest is shown by the fact that the US team in Geneva is led by Rob Malley, Barack Obama\u2019s chief adviser on Syria, and the Russian side by Alexander Lavrentiev, who does the same job for Vladimir Putin.Western sources said it was vital to ensure that any cessation of violence and aid deliveries were clearly linked to a \u201cpolitical transition\u201d \u2013 meaning talks on Syria\u2019s future and Assad\u2019s role. Russia has been reluctant to address that.Since the start of the conflict in 2011 western governments have hoped that Moscow would pressure Assad into changing policy, though that has never happened in any significant way. But Russia\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said in an interview that Assad needs to respond to the Munich agreement \u2013 hinting strongly at disagreements with Damascus. Related: Refugees are becoming Russia's weapon of choice in Syria \u201cRussia has invested very seriously in this crisis, politically, diplomatically and now also militarily,\u201d Churkin told the Kommersant daily. \u201cTherefore we would like al-Assad also to respond to this,\u201d he said, adding that the Syrian leader\u2019s stance \u201cis not in accord with the diplomatic efforts that Russia is making\u201d.Churkin was responding to an interview by Assad \u2013 just before the Munich deal \u2013 in which he pledged to retake the whole of the country and appeared to rule out negotiations. \u201cIf they proceed on the basis that no ceasefire is necessary and they need to fight to a victorious end, then this conflict will last a very long time and that is terrifying to imagine,\u201d Churkin said. Syria is \u201calready on the brink of falling apart,\u201d he added.Even if a cessation of hostilities deal is agreed, it is likely to be fragile and viewed with suspicion, especially by rebels who fear they may be walking into a trap. De Mistura implicitly acknowledged this, admitting that it would not be possible \u201crealistically\u201d to reconvene the Geneva talks, as originally scheduled, on 25 February, but they \u201cintend to do so soon\u201d. Meetings began on 29 January but were suspended after just three days without results as Russian airstrikes intensified.Further evidence of intense diplomatic activity around the crisis came in a phonecall between Putin and King Salman of Saudi Arabia, who backs the anti-Assad rebels as firmly as Moscow has supported the Syrian leader. The Saudis also work closely with Turkey, which is increasingly at odds with Russia over Kurdish involvement in the fighting.Fighting continued in Aleppo and Hasakah province, with reports of Russian airstrikes and Turkey bombing Syrian Kurdish forces in the northern border area. The Red Cross said it was \u201cdeeply alarmed by the situation in the Aleppo region, where fighting is intensifying, hospitals and health workers have been targeted, people have no water or electricity and more than 70,000 have now fled their homes\u201d.", "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Russia", "Europe", "US news", "Bashar al-Assad"], "title": "All eyes on US and Russia as Syria deadline passes"},{"date": "2016-02-12T16:36:51Z", "content": "Putting aside the unfortunate historical ring to \u201cpeace\u201d agreements signed in Munich, today\u2019s Syrian truce is deeply flawed and unlikely to hold for long. The \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d \u2013 for it is not a true ceasefire \u2013 has been hailed as a landmark piece of diplomacy that brings some respite to a war that long ago spiralled out of control.The veteran diplomat Lord Williams told the BBC: \u201cIn a cold war fashion, the two superpowers have taken ownership of the problem.\u201d In fact, it is the US and Europe that appear to own the problem, while Russia has held tight to the solution. Washington, wielding words, has few credible means of enforcement against Moscow, wielding unguided, though effective, bombs. This is why the truce includes loopholes large enough to fly a few dozen Russian jets through.The statement by the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), a contact group of 17 countries on both sides of the civil war, agreed \u201ca nationwide cessation of hostilities\u201d. But an exemption was carved out for Isis, Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian branch) and \u201cother groups designated as terrorist organisations by the United Nations security council\u201d. This sounds reasonable. However, both Russia and Iran \u2013 which has mobilised and led the ground forces operating under Moscow\u2019s air cover \u2013 consider virtually all Syrian rebel groups operating around Aleppo, the site of the past week\u2019s fiercest fighting, to fall into this expansive category. Related: Syria: cessation of hostilities 'within a week' agreed at Munich talks \u2013 as it happened The truth is more complicated. In the strip of rebel-held territory between Aleppo and Turkey, al-Nusra is indeed a powerful force. But it operates as part of a larger Turkish and Saudi-backed rebel coalition, Jaish al-Fatah, which also includes less extreme, though still ultraconservative, Islamist groups. The most significant of these is Ahrar al-Sham. It is these groups, and not Isis, that represent the bulk of targets in the Russian campaign, notwithstanding the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda.Washington, Ankara, Riyadh and Doha don\u2019t completely agree on how this middle ground of Islamists should be handled. The US understands that their views are in tension with the civil, pluralistic Syrian state that must follow Bashar al-Assad. Saudi Arabia and Turkey don\u2019t really care. But no one wants them bombed. Isis might exploit the vacuum, and it would bind the less extreme groups more tightly to their sometime al-Nusra collaborators.The Munich truce says that an ISSG taskforce co-chaired by Russia and the US will \u201cdelineate\u201d Isis and al-Nusra territory and resolve disputes that arise later. But groups are intermingled on the battlefield in the complex suburban geography of Aleppo and its environs, and the affiliations of individual battalions can be fluid.Russia\u2019s spectacular battlefield gains in the past month make it less inclined to accommodate American or Saudi preferences. And its offensive is doubly advantageous: not only is Assad winning, but the ensuing refugee flow leaves Europe even more desperate to make the problem go away, whatever the price. Moscow may therefore simply ignore these procedural niceties, and the US might be inclined to go along with this.After all, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, speaking alongside his Russian counterpart today, stated emphatically that \u201cit was not Russia or Iran who stopped a ceasefire from being adopted at the very beginning. I want to make that very, very clear.\u201d This was a remarkable, stinging attack on Saudi Arabia and Turkey. These countries had indeed worried that a ceasefire without a parallel political transition away from Assad would freeze the status quo, leave the regime permanently in place and therefore help Isis to thrive.Over the past week, the rebels\u2019 increasingly wretched position \u2013 the very real sense that they might, simply, be obliterated \u2013 and the US\u2019s unwillingness to push back seemed to have persuaded these powers to back the ceasefire. But Kerry\u2019s remarks \u2013 exculpatory towards Moscow and Tehran, and implicitly censorious of the US\u2019s own allies \u2013 will deepen Turkey and the Gulf states\u2019 gloom at the changing balance of power and influence in the region.It will also be interesting to see how the truce affects the relationship between Russia and its Syrian client. Less than a week ago, one of Assad\u2019s senior advisers, emboldened by the military turnaround, insisted that suggestions of a ceasefire were the work of states that \u201cdo not want an end to terrorism\u201d and merely wanted to aid rebels. Yet Assad could do little but accept the deal cut over his head. His army is in tatters, with Russia doing the bombing and Iran-led forces largely doing the fighting. His regime has been saved, but he will be nervous about his impotence over diplomacy that could affect his personal future.Russia is unlikely to forgo its military momentum. It has every hope of not only cutting rebels off from their Turkish supply lines, but perhaps also retaking regime territory elsewhere. If Aleppo, why not Palmyra? Writing on Wednesday, Vitaly Naumkin, a Russian academic closely involved in Syrian diplomacy, suggested that the regime\u2019s goals include the \u201cestablishment of a bridgehead for a massive offensive on [Isis] strongholds in the east\u201d. This process could be less problematic in places where Isis is the only real opposition, but in other, less clear-cut battlefields \u2013 around Deraa in the south, for instance, we will have renewed spats over who is a terrorist and who is not.Kerry clearly hopes that this truce will be a stepping stone to a broader ceasefire. Today\u2019s ISSG statement reiterates the lofty aim of an agreement on political transition \u2013 to include elections and a new constitution \u2013 within six months. But if Russia is bent on a military solution, it will pocket the gains of this agreement. As pressure in Syria\u2019s north eases and regime control spreads, the incentives to push out Assad and reform the regime shrink. Truce and talks should have come as a package.

Medvedev\u2019s French counterpart, Manuel Valls, told the conference: \u201cTo find the path to peace again, the Russian bombing of civilians [in Syria] has to stop.\u201d The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said most of Russia\u2019s attacks had been against legitimate opposition groups in Syria.\u201cThis is the moment. This is a hinge point,\u201d he said. \u201cDecisions made in the coming days and weeks, and a few months could end the war in Syria \u2013 or could define a very difficult set of choices for the future.\u201cThe war in Syria has now lasted for almost five years and shows no signs of burning itself out, which is why we are so focused on a political track. If the international community and the Syrians themselves miss the opportunity now before us to achieve that political resolution to the conflict [then] the violence, the bloodshed, the torture, the bombing, and the anguish will continue \u2013 so will the siren call to jihad.\u201dHowever, Russia\u2019s foreign minister said the chances of securing a ceasefire within a week were less than 50% and his country remained deeply suspicious of US intentions. Sergey Lavrov said military cooperation between the US and Russia was the \u201ckey tool\u201d to ensuring the humanitarian supplies were delivered and hostilities ended.\u201cIf we are moving closer to practical goals of [a] truce then, without cooperation between the military, nothing will work out,\u201d he told the Munich conference.The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said the chance of a truce depended on Russia\u2019s actions: \u201cUnless Russia over the next days is going to stop, or at least significantly scale back that bombing, the moderate armed opposition will not join in this [peace] process. They cannot be expected to join in this process.\u201d Germany\u2019s foreign ministry said Russia\u2019s military action had \u201cseriously compromised\u201d the peace process, while the Turkish foreign minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, said on Twitter: \u201cWhat is important now is embracing this opportunity, stopping the airstrikes, ceasing targeting civilians and providing humanitarian access.\u201d Related: Syria war cessation deal relies on something in short supply: trust The Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskait\u0117, told the conference the situation was more serious than the cold war. \u201cWe are probably facing a hot war,\u201d she said. \u201cRussia is demonstrating open military aggression in Ukraine, open military aggression in Syria. There is nothing cold about this, it is very hot.\u201dRussian aircraft were seen in action over northern Syria again on Friday. Its intervention in the conflict since late September has significantly strengthened the hand of President Bashar al-Assad, who on Friday vowed to regain control of the entire country. His comments dealt a swift blow to international efforts to secure a ceasefire, deliver aid and promote a negotiated solution to the war that has killed more than a quarter of a million civilians.The Syrian Observatory said that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed by Russian airstrikes in Syria.Kerry said earlier that if the peace plan agreed on Friday failed, more foreign troops could enter the conflict. \u201cIf the Assad regime does not live up to its responsibilities, and if the Iranians and the Russians do not hold Assad to the promises that they have made ... then the international community obviously is not going to sit there like fools and watch this,\u201d he said.

Weighed down with camera gear, our pockets stuffed with roubles, we crossed the conflict\u2019s buffer zone and journeyed deep into the country\u2019s separatist heartland to meet them.***On a cold, grey morning in Luhansk, one of Ukraine\u2019s bleakest and best-preserved Soviet cities, we meet Kuznetsov at the Night Wolves\u2019 base. In the courtyard, club members arrange props and saw logs for the forthcoming show. Framed by the flag of Novorossiya, Ukraine\u2019s loose confederation of rebel-held territories, Kuznetsov wears a biker jacket over military fatigues, his olive-green beret badged with a hammer and sickle to round off the Easy Rider guerrilla look. For the Night Wolves, image is king.\u201cEverything was inspired by American clubs, even the way we dress,\u201d Kuznetsov explains. \u201cWe took the best and reproduced it in our way. The club was created to fight against the USSR, but in the end we started working with the state.\u201dKuznetsov joined the Night Wolves in the early 90s, after meeting the club\u2019s charismatic leader, Alexander Zaldostanov, who trained in medicine and is known as \u201cThe Surgeon\u201d. Kuznetsov\u2019s role in the club would eventually shift from motorcycle enthusiast to militant fighter. As the Maidan street protests engulfed Kiev in the winter of 2013-14, in a bloody push towards integration with Europe, he was among a swath of ethnic Russians who saw only a violent coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.Stoked by the Kremlin\u2019s narrative that Ukrainian \u201cfascists\u201d, aided and abetted by the CIA, had overthrown a legitimate, pro-Russian government (the notorious kleptocracy of Viktor Yanukovych, accused of presiding over a \u201cmafia\u201d administration that cost the country billions of dollars), Kuznetsov left his family in Moscow in February 2014 and headed south. He and other bikers actively engaged in Russia\u2019s covert invasion of Crimea, swapping leathers for body armour; that summer, they joined Ukraine\u2019s separatist insurgency.\u201cThe Maidan movement was starting in Crimea. We decided to invest all our strength in preventing it,\u201d Kuznetsov tells us one evening in his sleeping quarters, over shots of fiery moonshine. Religious icons, separatist banners, war medals and Kalashnikov rifles furnish the room, alongside a wolf-emblazoned dreamcatcher and a portrait of Kuznetsov\u2019s grandfather in the second world war.\u201cThe Night Wolves built the first checkpoints,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were the first to be given weapons and to patrol Sevastopol. I am one of the million reasons Crimea finally was annexed.\u201d The US later sanctioned the Night Wolves for storming a gas facility and Ukrainian naval base on the Black Sea peninsula, blocking any assets they might have in the US and banning contact with US citizens \u2013 a token gesture, given the unlikelihood of patriotic Russians investing there. Meanwhile, in Moscow, The Surgeon received a medal for his efforts.For Kuznetsov and his fellow Night Wolves, the collapse of the Soviet Union remains a source of profound regret; Crimea\u2019s annexation gave them the perfect opportunity to help Russia reassert its strength and resurrect a lost domain. \u201cThe USSR was the most powerful empire in the world,\u201d he muses one cold, overcast morning, walking among the carcasses of Soviet-era tanks salvaged from the Donbass battlefield. \u201cAnd in one hour, without a single shot, it was over. We lost everything we had for bubble gum and jeans. And McDonald\u2019s.\u201d He recounts the penury of Moscow in the chaotic aftermath: empty shops and queues to buy basic groceries with coupons. For Kuznetsov, the west can tolerate only a crippled post-Soviet state, not a resurgent Russia. \u201cSuddenly, everyone loved us. Now that we\u2019re here and strong, no one likes us. When I was lying on the floor, everyone loved me.\u201dBut Kuznetsov\u2019s role in Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea, and in the conflict in Donbass, has come at a price. He has received medals but barely been home. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m a real traitor: I betrayed my family,\u201d he admits. \u201cMy wife didn\u2019t understand. I\u2019m a grown man. I had an income, three children. What was I looking for? But I had to go.\u201dThe USSR was the most powerful empire in the world. And in one hour, without a single shot, it was overThe Night Wolves first roared out from Moscow\u2019s 1980s underground. In the liberalised environment that flourished under Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s perestroika reforms, kindred bikers and metalheads partied to rock music, provided security for bands and ran protection rackets, tearing around the capital on their Soviet-era Dnepr, Jawa and Voskhod motorcycles. \u201cWe were a powerful band on wheels,\u201d Kuznetsov recalls. \u201cWe were driving fast in Moscow by night, escaping the police.\u201dSince those early years, he and his fellow Night Wolves have evolved from an anarchic posse of petrolheads into a key component of the Kremlin\u2019s propaganda machine. August 1991 marked a pivotal moment, as they moved in from the margins to join the resistance against the failed anti-Gorbachev putsch launched by communist hardliners.In Russia\u2019s rocky 90s, the club began hosting annual motorcycle shows and launched a Wolf Wear clothing line. Putin has since become its most powerful patron, sanctioning huge grants and driving a three-wheeled Harley-Davidson as a Night Wolves outrider. They ride across Slavic landscapes to Orthodox holy sites, and stage shows that combine stunts, special effects and hard rock with zealous patriotism and pyrotechnics.Russia expert Mark Galeotti, a professor of global affairs at New York University, says the Night Wolves are not part of the counterculture; they are \u201ccountercountercultural\u201d, acting as \u201coutlaws yet tools of the state\u201d. In other words, the Kremlin has brought them in from the fringes to exploit their pro-Putinism, fervent Orthodoxy and anti-American rhetoric as a potent source of soft power. A Harley-Davidson rally from Moscow to Berlin last April retraced the Red Army\u2019s route to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany; in August, in Sevastopol, the bikers staged a second world war re-creation in a performance complete with lasers, rock music and motorcycle stunts. Meanwhile, opposition activist Alexei Navalny has uncovered the flow of millions of roubles from the Russian government to the club, including funds to perform anti-western children\u2019s shows. Throw in their Soviet revivalism and large cache of assault rifles, and you have quite a cocktail.Anyone can apply to be in the Night Wolves. Drug addicts can't join. Neither can gay men. Women can't join, eitherOn our first day in Luhansk, Vitaly Kishkinov, the bullish boss of the local chapter, gives us a tour of the base. Over the next week, we get to know his men beyond the two-dimensional characters the club so readily projects. Kishkinov, however, remains stubbornly opaque and ideological \u2013 a consummate rebel leader.\u201cI love my country, I received it with my mother\u2019s milk,\u201d he tells us in front of a large mural inspired by Mad Max, featuring a fanged, fuel-belching tanker bursting through a brick wall. \u201cI am proud of my ancestors, proud of our Great Victory [in the second world war], proud of our grandfathers who shed blood and came back with medals. There\u2019s no force on Earth that can make me think differently.\u201d For Kishkinov, the irony of delivering such a patriotic monologue against the backdrop of a Hollywood hit is no obstacle.Kishkinov, whose wife and two children live elsewhere in Luhansk while he immerses himself in the club, takes us to what he calls \u201cthe museum\u201d \u2013 part games room, part shrine. A billiards table is draped with wolfskins. One corner is dedicated to his celebrity friends, including photographs of crooner Grigory Leps, who was sanctioned by the US for suspected mafia ties. Orthodox icons and crucifixes plaster the walls, alongside portraits of Stalin and Ramzan Kadyrov, Putin\u2019s puppet warlord in Chechnya. Elsewhere in the dark room, a sign reads, in Russian, \u201cI will buy the skin of Obama.\u201dWho can join the Night Wolves, I ask Kishkinov. \u201cAnyone can apply, anyone with the desire to join,\u201d he says, adding pointedly: \u201cDrug addicts can\u2019t join. Neither can pederasts. [He uses the Russian homophobic slang for gay men.] Women can\u2019t join, either: it\u2019s a men\u2019s club.\u201dWhy not gay men? Kishkinov, whose star in the Night Wolves has risen alongside Russia\u2019s hard rightward, homophobic turn, looks incredulous. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say. This is too obvious: God created us as men and women to sleep together. Gays are not normal.\u201d Turning to religion, he continues: \u201cWe are Orthodox people, and if one loses his faith in the Wolves or in Orthodoxy, life has no sense. God is with us and God helps us.\u201dKuznetsov would go even further. In a war often viewed in hyperbolic terms \u2013 the Ukrainians brand the enemy \u201cterrorists\u201d; Russian-backed forces claim to battle \u201cneo-Nazis\u201d \u2013 he employs a phrase more readily associated with militants waging jihad. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen many miracles here. We\u2019ve seen bombed churches where people survived,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a religious and spiritual war.\u201d***When separatist tensions in the Donbass region erupted into open warfare in the spring of 2014, claiming more than 9,000 lives to date, the Night Wolves were among the pro-Russian fighters deployed to carve out breakaway \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d. Several members were killed and the US government later alleged close links between the club and Russian special forces. The Night Wolves had evolved from a tool for exerting soft power to something harder and more violent.As the front line ossifies into a de facto border, the group has integrated with the rebels\u2019 internal affairs ministry, retaining a paramilitary function and substantial arsenal. But it has also returned to its civic roots: staging patriotic events, campaigning against corruption, participating in urban renewal, delivering humanitarian aid \u2013 much to the adulation of the local population.Putin\u2019s brand of politics has created an environment in which such an organisation can thrive. His brash cult of the macho celebrity is the modern-day cult of Stalin. Here, in a political arena as manipulated as a daytime melodrama, Putin is at the top of the A-list. \u201cThis man has leadership,\u201d Kuznetsov insists. \u201cHis politics are the best possible course for Russia.\u201dStalin has enjoyed a renaissance, too, as the Kremlin harnesses Soviet nostalgia to reconnect with Russia\u2019s superpower past. The Night Wolves\u2019 reverence for the dictator is clear even before you step inside their base. A flag bearing Stalin\u2019s face adorns the entrance gates, while three other banners show Jesus Christ, the tricolour of the Russian Federation and the LNR\u2019s red star emblem.On arrival in Luhansk, we visited the rebel regime\u2019s ministry of information, a vast monolith housing a warren of corridors and sullen bureaucrats. The Soviet-style paranoia of an emergent autocracy was rife; an apparatchik took our local fixer aside in a hallway and hissed: \u201cIt would be wise to stop working with such western journalists and return home at the earliest opportunity.\u201dLater, our names came up during a televised cabinet meeting. The LNR\u2019s increasingly authoritarian leader, Igor Plotnitsky, expressed clear suspicion about our work in his separatist statelet, prompting the rebels\u2019 minister of information to intervene: \u201cThey are working for the Guardian. It\u2019s just some online youth magazine.\u201d We tried to shrug off both incidents as amusing quirks, but they would come back to haunt us.We spend the following afternoon in the snug sentry hut of the Night Wolves\u2019 base. Over cups of tea and bread smeared with salo (pork fat), Sergey \u201cMosquito\u201d Komarov tells us how his life led to this moment. One of the most affable members of the chapter, he was born in a village outside Moscow and, as a teenager, served as a tankman during Russia\u2019s brutal bid to crush Chechen resistance at the turn of the millennium. It is clear the experience caused Mosquito subtle but long-term psychological damage. Biking offered a kind of therapy.\u201cWhat have I gone through? A lot. It took me two years to get over it,\u201d says Mosquito, now in his early 30s. \u201cRiding a motorbike has always been something I love. Fill up the tank and ride \u2013 your head is free from everything. Driving 2,000km is better than a month of holidays.\u201dWhile running humanitarian aid to a frontline town in Ukraine last year, he met a local girl, Nadia, whose father had already left home to fight with the separatists. She later moved in with Mosquito at the base. \u201cWe didn\u2019t choose the life we have,\u201d says Nadia, 19, resting against him in the sentry post. \u201cI don\u2019t care to be somewhere else. My man is here.\u201d Their rapport is touching, almost innocent \u2013 the sort of relationship born out of chance meetings amid the ravages of war.Before our arrival, a two-month lull broke down as both sides re-engaged in trench warfare, nightly bombardments striking the outskirts of the separatist stronghold of Donetsk. The frontline near Luhansk is calmer, though the remnants of 2014\u2019s conflagration appear everywhere: boarded-up shops, tarmac cratered by mortar fire, buildings demolished by airstrikes and artillery attacks. The most dramatic destruction lies several miles away at the airport. Clashes between pro-Kiev forces and separatist militias, including members of Luhansk\u2019s Night Wolves, backed by the might of the Russian army, dealt the terminal near-total annihilation.On a bright, windswept morning, Kishkinov shows us the devastation, navigating the massive craters that rupture the runway. One lone worker clambers over the rubble to collect an armful of bricks before walking down and dumping the debris on the ground, only to repeat the endless, empty exercise.\u201cEverything was destroyed,\u201d Kishkinov says loudly, over the wind. \u201cIt was a big battle \u2013 a very big one. Everything here is rinsed with blood, just as in the Great Patriotic War. Souls inhabit this place. The city was under siege. When I speak about this, I have goosebumps. I wouldn\u2019t even want an enemy to go through this.\u201dIn the shadow of the ruined terminal, I press him on Russia\u2019s involvement in the war, long denied by Putin until recently, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Surely he encountered Russian troops? Surely the blame for war cannot rest solely with Ukraine? \u201cRussia is not concerned here,\u201d Kishkinov snarls in heavy, expletive-strewn Russian. \u201cNot once has Russia started war on her borders; Russia has never made war on another\u2019s territory. We are always defending ourselves from enemies who want to take our land.\u201dWe continue the final leg of the tour in silence as Kishkinov storms ahead. At his 4x4, he turns to the camera: \u201cGreetings, Europe. I wish you one thing: that your people never experience what we did here. Live in peace and remember this saying: \u2018A bad peace is better than a good war.\u2019\u201dRainclouds barrel across the sky and we depart. Like Sisyphus, the lone figure continues to toil at his impossible task, dismantling the ruined airport stone by stone.***The presence and influence of the Night Wolves in Luhansk underscores the bitter ethnic rift that runs through Ukraine. Many in the chapter are local men, yet align themselves with Moscow over Kiev, in spite of their common past and language.Regardless of his militant creed, it is a divide that troubles Kuznetsov. \u201cThere was a moment when we were fighting last year,\u201d he says. \u201cAs I approached some Ukrainian prisoners, they took their crosses, kissed them and prayed. And I knew they were saying the same prayers as I do. These were Orthodox men. Do I hate Ukrainians? No, I love them. But we have been set on each other.\u201dIt was to be our final night at the base; we kept the camera rolling amid a fug of cigarette smoke while talking and trading ideas with the bikers in their sleeping quarters. Two hours before the start of military curfew, we received a tipoff that the authorities had deemed us no longer welcome and had issued an arrest warrant. Our fixer\u2019s security and our reams of footage were at risk; we decided to hit the road as a matter of urgency.We shook hands with Kuznetsov, bade a swift goodbye and headed to the gates. Minutes later in the dark December chill, we spotted one of the older, more grizzled bikers on sentry duty. In the 90s, Ivar had seen action with the Russian army throughout the restive Caucasus. Now, in his 50s, he had found himself embroiled in yet another separatist conflict on the frontiers of Russia.The headlights of our van appeared as our fixer raced down the track to meet us outside the Night Wolves\u2019 stronghold. Within an hour, he would be speeding towards the safety of the Russian border. I would bundle into a second car with my fellow film-maker, Sebastien, before navigating a series of rural backroads to avoid rebel checkpoints. We would grab a few hours\u2019 sleep in a hostel near the frontline, leave before dawn and cross the conflict\u2019s buffer zone into government-held Ukraine by lunchtime, our footage beyond the reach of any pro-Russia militias bent on confiscating it.Before that, we had just enough time to say farewell. The city lay silent beneath a cloudless winter night. Ivar gave us a warm smile but declined to return our goodbyes. \u201cI\u2019ll just say, see you soon,\u201d he responded quietly. \u201cSince the war began, I\u2019ve stopped saying goodbye to people.\u201d", "tags": ["Ukraine", "Russia", "Vladimir Putin", "Crimea", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "Putin\u2019s Angels: the bikers battling for Russia in Ukraine"},{"date": "2016-01-28T21:06:53Z", "content": "The price of oil jumped 8% at one stage on Thursday after Russian officials said they would discuss production cuts with Saudi Arabia and other Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) at a meeting next month.Brent blend almost hit $36 per barrel before sinking back to just over $34 as Saudi sources played down suggestions it had already considered reining in crude volumes.Alexander Novak, the Russian energy minister, said that 5% reductions had been considered in the past with Opec and would come up again in discussions planned for February.\u201cWe had these sorts of consultations before, when the situation was somewhat different. As we see, prices have fallen,\u201d Novak told the Interfax news agency.

But at a meeting of the cartel last month in Vienna, the Saudis argued against changing Opec output targets.A little over a week ago the value of Brent slumped to 13 year lows below $28 in the aftermath of some nuclear sanctions being lifted from Iran, a move which will lead to huge new oil exports being made available.", "tags": ["Business", "Oil", "Global economy", "Oil and gas companies", "Commodities", "Energy industry", "Economics", "Petrol prices", "Money", "Motoring", "Russia", "Saudi Arabia", "Europe", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "title": "Oil price jumps as Russia hints at production cuts"},{"date": "2016-02-17T00:13:39Z", "content": "Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister has signalled she intends to challenge her Chinese counterpart over land reclamation activities in the South China Sea during a meeting in Beijing.Julie Bishop\u2019s stance prompted a warning from Beijing that Australia \u201cshould adopt an objective and unbiased attitude\u201d to the territorial dispute.

China\u2019s law is vague about what, exactly, will be demanded when it comes to breaking encryption, and Recode\u2019s Dawn Chmielewski writes that \u201cit could take six months for regulations to emerge that make the government\u2019s intent clear.\u201dThe British bill has faced criticism from a number of technology companies for its anti-encryption stances. In December, Apple explicitly appealed to the government to rethink the law, arguing that \u201cit would be wrong to weaken security for hundreds of millions of law-abiding customers so that it will also be weaker for the very few who pose a threat\u201d. Technology firms have warned that where Britain leads, nations with weaker human rights records may follow, citing the UK\u2019s example before cracking down on protected communications in their own nations.China\u2019s new law also restricts the right of media to report on details of terror attacks, including a provision that media and social media cannot report on details of terror activities that might lead to imitation, nor show scenes that are \u201ccruel and inhuman\u201d.", "tags": ["Encryption", "China", "Technology", "Surveillance", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "China introduces its own 'snooper's charter'"},{"date": "2016-02-17T00:13:39Z", "content": "Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister has signalled she intends to challenge her Chinese counterpart over land reclamation activities in the South China Sea during a meeting in Beijing.Julie Bishop\u2019s stance prompted a warning from Beijing that Australia \u201cshould adopt an objective and unbiased attitude\u201d to the territorial dispute.

China initiated the meeting, ending more than half a century of ostracism at the highest level.China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and seeks its reunification with the mainland. But the island has enjoyed de facto independence since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949, underpinned by American military might. Like other countries in the region, Taiwan is in dispute with Beijing over claims in the South China Sea.  Related: Historic meeting of Chinese and Taiwanese presidents prompts hope and suspicion China-Taiwan tensions have eased somewhat during Ma\u2019s time in office as his nationalist party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has expanded cross-strait trade and tourism. But the number of Taiwanese favouring reunification has been steadily falling, while suspicion of Beijing\u2019s expansionist ambitions has grown. Opinion polls suggest the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP), led for the first time by a woman, Tsai Ing-wen, is on course to win the presidency in January when Ma stands down. The party is traditionally seen as favouring independence, or at the very least maintaining the status quo. A DPP success would undoubtedly anger Xi, who has said the Taiwan issue cannot remain unresolved indefinitely.Tsai complained that the announcement of the meeting came out of the blue. \u201cTo let the people know in such a hasty and chaotic manner is damaging to Taiwan\u2019s democracy,\u201d she said. The DPP spokesman Cheng Yun-peng said: \u201cHow can people not think of this as a political operation intended to affect the election?\u201dYet if Ma is thought to be kowtowing to Xi, the Singapore meeting could backfire by stiffening opposition to China\u2019s advances. Large-scale KMT defeats in local elections last year were attributed to a backlash, especially among younger voters, against the party\u2019s perceived cosying up to Beijing. China says it has no intention of interfering in the 16 January polls, unlike in 1996 when it launched war games to try to intimidate voters. Rejecting claims that Ma was selling out Taiwan, officials said he would make no deals, private or public, and would concentrate on promoting \u201cthe peaceful development of cross-strait relations\u201d.

China\u2019s law is vague about what, exactly, will be demanded when it comes to breaking encryption, and Recode\u2019s Dawn Chmielewski writes that \u201cit could take six months for regulations to emerge that make the government\u2019s intent clear.\u201dThe British bill has faced criticism from a number of technology companies for its anti-encryption stances. In December, Apple explicitly appealed to the government to rethink the law, arguing that \u201cit would be wrong to weaken security for hundreds of millions of law-abiding customers so that it will also be weaker for the very few who pose a threat\u201d. Technology firms have warned that where Britain leads, nations with weaker human rights records may follow, citing the UK\u2019s example before cracking down on protected communications in their own nations.China\u2019s new law also restricts the right of media to report on details of terror attacks, including a provision that media and social media cannot report on details of terror activities that might lead to imitation, nor show scenes that are \u201ccruel and inhuman\u201d.", "tags": ["Encryption", "China", "Technology", "Surveillance", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "China introduces its own 'snooper's charter'"},{"date": "2015-10-06T12:21:47Z", "content": "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a British attitude which treats China as a sweatshop on the Pearl River,\u201d George Osborne opined during a trip to the world\u2019s second largest economy in 2013.\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m trying to do this week in China is change British attitudes,\u201d he said.The chancellor\u2019s message appears to have eluded the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt.

In this thematically linked sequence, Doherty, an outstanding young poet, uses our orbital trash, the bric-a-brac of communication tech and a deflating space race as a hook for her interrogations. Even a familiar notion is reinvigorated: the pathos of the first dog in space is not a subject previously untouched, but in her eulogy to Laika, Doherty marries cool rigour and generosity without sentimentality, and if you can get to the end without tearing up you\u2019re stronger than I.Any new novel by Cisco, one of the key figures in the experimental fantastic, is cause for delight.

China initiated the meeting, ending more than half a century of ostracism at the highest level.China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and seeks its reunification with the mainland. But the island has enjoyed de facto independence since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949, underpinned by American military might. Like other countries in the region, Taiwan is in dispute with Beijing over claims in the South China Sea.  Related: Historic meeting of Chinese and Taiwanese presidents prompts hope and suspicion China-Taiwan tensions have eased somewhat during Ma\u2019s time in office as his nationalist party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has expanded cross-strait trade and tourism. But the number of Taiwanese favouring reunification has been steadily falling, while suspicion of Beijing\u2019s expansionist ambitions has grown. Opinion polls suggest the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP), led for the first time by a woman, Tsai Ing-wen, is on course to win the presidency in January when Ma stands down. The party is traditionally seen as favouring independence, or at the very least maintaining the status quo. A DPP success would undoubtedly anger Xi, who has said the Taiwan issue cannot remain unresolved indefinitely.Tsai complained that the announcement of the meeting came out of the blue. \u201cTo let the people know in such a hasty and chaotic manner is damaging to Taiwan\u2019s democracy,\u201d she said. The DPP spokesman Cheng Yun-peng said: \u201cHow can people not think of this as a political operation intended to affect the election?\u201dYet if Ma is thought to be kowtowing to Xi, the Singapore meeting could backfire by stiffening opposition to China\u2019s advances. Large-scale KMT defeats in local elections last year were attributed to a backlash, especially among younger voters, against the party\u2019s perceived cosying up to Beijing. China says it has no intention of interfering in the 16 January polls, unlike in 1996 when it launched war games to try to intimidate voters. Rejecting claims that Ma was selling out Taiwan, officials said he would make no deals, private or public, and would concentrate on promoting \u201cthe peaceful development of cross-strait relations\u201d. Since neither leader recognises the other as a head of state, the two men will address each other \u201cMr\u201d.

China initiated the meeting, ending more than half a century of ostracism at the highest level.China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and seeks its reunification with the mainland. But the island has enjoyed de facto independence since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949, underpinned by American military might. Like other countries in the region, Taiwan is in dispute with Beijing over claims in the South China Sea.  Related: Historic meeting of Chinese and Taiwanese presidents prompts hope and suspicion China-Taiwan tensions have eased somewhat during Ma\u2019s time in office as his nationalist party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has expanded cross-strait trade and tourism. But the number of Taiwanese favouring reunification has been steadily falling, while suspicion of Beijing\u2019s expansionist ambitions has grown. Opinion polls suggest the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP), led for the first time by a woman, Tsai Ing-wen, is on course to win the presidency in January when Ma stands down. The party is traditionally seen as favouring independence, or at the very least maintaining the status quo. A DPP success would undoubtedly anger Xi, who has said the Taiwan issue cannot remain unresolved indefinitely.Tsai complained that the announcement of the meeting came out of the blue. \u201cTo let the people know in such a hasty and chaotic manner is damaging to Taiwan\u2019s democracy,\u201d she said. The DPP spokesman Cheng Yun-peng said: \u201cHow can people not think of this as a political operation intended to affect the election?\u201dYet if Ma is thought to be kowtowing to Xi, the Singapore meeting could backfire by stiffening opposition to China\u2019s advances. Large-scale KMT defeats in local elections last year were attributed to a backlash, especially among younger voters, against the party\u2019s perceived cosying up to Beijing. China says it has no intention of interfering in the 16 January polls, unlike in 1996 when it launched war games to try to intimidate voters. Rejecting claims that Ma was selling out Taiwan, officials said he would make no deals, private or public, and would concentrate on promoting \u201cthe peaceful development of cross-strait relations\u201d.

China\u2019s law is vague about what, exactly, will be demanded when it comes to breaking encryption, and Recode\u2019s Dawn Chmielewski writes that \u201cit could take six months for regulations to emerge that make the government\u2019s intent clear.\u201dThe British bill has faced criticism from a number of technology companies for its anti-encryption stances.

Technology firms have warned that where Britain leads, nations with weaker human rights records may follow, citing the UK\u2019s example before cracking down on protected communications in their own nations.China\u2019s new law also restricts the right of media to report on details of terror attacks, including a provision that media and social media cannot report on details of terror activities that might lead to imitation, nor show scenes that are \u201ccruel and inhuman\u201d.", "tags": ["Encryption", "China", "Technology", "Surveillance", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "China introduces its own 'snooper's charter'"},{"date": "2015-10-06T12:21:47Z", "content": "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a British attitude which treats China as a sweatshop on the Pearl River,\u201d George Osborne opined during a trip to the world\u2019s second largest economy in 2013.\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m trying to do this week in China is change British attitudes,\u201d he said.The chancellor\u2019s message appears to have eluded the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt.

Nearly 85% of migrants worked more than 44 hours a week, earning an average of just \u00a3270 per month.The consequences of such relentless work can be dire. Reports in China\u2019s state-run media last year claimed that a staggering 600,000 citizens were dying from over-work each year.A 2012 editorial in the China Daily newspaper complained: \u201cEmployers cajole, persuade, goad or force their workers to work overtime because they want to perform better in China\u2019s highly competitive market to ensure that they don\u2019t go out of business.\u201dBetter-off Chinese people are suffering, too.

Chinese experts have urged employers to reduce workloads as a way of boosting productivity. \u201cWorking overtime is not good for workers\u2019 health and does not improve productivity and efficiency,\u201d said Li, the Beijing-based labour economist.\u201cChinese workers have to work longer hours than their peers from the more developed countries, such as the UK and US, because China\u2019s production efficiency still lags significantly far behind those countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we are still at the developmental stage of chasing GDP growth and increasing total production, long working hours will persist for a certain time.\u201d Additional reporting by Luna Lin", "tags": ["China", "Conservative conference 2015", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Work-life balance", "Money", "UK news", "Work & careers", "Conservatives", "Politics"], "title": "How hard does China work?"},{"date": "2015-12-23T09:00:00Z", "content": "After a strange turn of events, Zanna and her best friend Deeba follow the trail of a broken umbrella to a wheel.

hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, launched on pay-TV cable and satellite service Shanghai Dragon TV on 19 October.The series, which airs across China and Taiwan, has so far

online audience of 173 million across the series so far, aggregating figures from China\u2019s eight biggest video platforms including Tencent, Youku, Tudou, Sohu, Iqiyi and Baofeng.Paul Dempsey,

China initiated the meeting, ending more than half a century of ostracism at the highest level.China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and seeks its reunification with the mainland. But the island has enjoyed de facto independence since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949, underpinned by American military might. Like other countries in the region, Taiwan is in dispute with Beijing over claims in the South China Sea.  Related: Historic meeting of Chinese and Taiwanese presidents prompts hope and suspicion China-Taiwan tensions have eased somewhat during Ma\u2019s time in office as his nationalist party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has expanded cross-strait trade and tourism. But the number of Taiwanese favouring reunification has been steadily falling, while suspicion of Beijing\u2019s expansionist ambitions has grown. Opinion polls suggest the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP), led for the first time by a woman, Tsai Ing-wen, is on course to win the presidency in January when Ma stands down. The party is traditionally seen as favouring independence, or at the very least maintaining the status quo. A DPP success would undoubtedly anger Xi, who has said the Taiwan issue cannot remain unresolved indefinitely.Tsai complained that the announcement of the meeting came out of the blue. \u201cTo let the people know in such a hasty and chaotic manner is damaging to Taiwan\u2019s democracy,\u201d she said. The DPP spokesman Cheng Yun-peng said: \u201cHow can people not think of this as a political operation intended to affect the election?\u201dYet if Ma is thought to be kowtowing to Xi, the Singapore meeting could backfire by stiffening opposition to China\u2019s advances. Large-scale KMT defeats in local elections last year were attributed to a backlash, especially among younger voters, against the party\u2019s perceived cosying up to Beijing. China says it has no intention of interfering in the 16 January polls, unlike in 1996 when it launched war games to try to intimidate voters. Rejecting claims that Ma was selling out Taiwan, officials said he would make no deals, private or public, and would concentrate on promoting \u201cthe peaceful development of cross-strait relations\u201d.

Technology firms have warned that where Britain leads, nations with weaker human rights records may follow, citing the UK\u2019s example before cracking down on protected communications in their own nations.China\u2019s new law also restricts the right of media to report on details of terror attacks, including a provision that media and social media cannot report on details of terror activities that might lead to imitation, nor show scenes that are \u201ccruel and inhuman\u201d.", "tags": ["Encryption", "China", "Technology", "Surveillance", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "China introduces its own 'snooper's charter'"},{"date": "2015-10-06T12:21:47Z", "content": "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a British attitude which treats China as a sweatshop on the Pearl River,\u201d George Osborne opined during a trip to the world\u2019s second largest economy in 2013.\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m trying to do this week in China is change British attitudes,\u201d he said.The chancellor\u2019s message appears to have eluded the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt.

Nearly 85% of migrants worked more than 44 hours a week, earning an average of just \u00a3270 per month.The consequences of such relentless work can be dire.

Chinese experts have urged employers to reduce workloads as a way of boosting productivity. \u201cWorking overtime is not good for workers\u2019 health and does not improve productivity and efficiency,\u201d said Li, the Beijing-based labour economist.\u201cChinese workers have to work longer hours than their peers from the more developed countries, such as the UK and US, because China\u2019s production efficiency still lags significantly far behind those countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we are still at the developmental stage of chasing GDP growth and increasing total production, long working hours will persist for a certain time.\u201d Additional reporting by Luna Lin", "tags": ["China", "Conservative conference 2015", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Work-life balance", "Money", "UK news", "Work & careers", "Conservatives", "Politics"], "title": "How hard does China work?"},{"date": "2015-12-23T09:00:00Z", "content": "After a strange turn of events, Zanna and her best friend Deeba follow the trail of a broken umbrella to a wheel.

Comradely and sympathetic without losing critical edge, Taylor always combines anger and rigour with rare and clear subtlety. Her examination of the changing contours of radical race politics is bound to be indispensable.Autobiographies often revolve around specialness, self-aggrandisement camouflaged as the opposite. \u201cI was always a weird kid\u201d, and so on.

Crumbs is an Ethiopian-Spanish-Finnish co-production, from the melancholy wing of the (newly trendy) tradition of Afrofuturism. Afrodystopianism? Afropostfuturism, surely. In an eerie bowling hall, a sweet love story commences between the superb leads, Selam Tesfayie and Daniel Tadesse. Director Miguel Llans\u00f3 and the team do miracles with their micro budget: a dilapidated spaceship hangs above an Ethiopia of ghost towns, discarded tat, peculiar Nazis and a combative Santa Claus.A tactile and lovely chapbook put out by Tipped Press. In this thematically linked sequence, Doherty, an outstanding young poet, uses our orbital trash, the bric-a-brac of communication tech and a deflating space race as a hook for her interrogations. Even a familiar notion is reinvigorated: the pathos of the first dog in space is not a subject previously untouched, but in her eulogy to Laika, Doherty marries cool rigour and generosity without sentimentality, and if you can get to the end without tearing up you\u2019re stronger than I.Any new novel by Cisco, one of the key figures in the experimental fantastic, is cause for delight. Animal Money, like most of his work, is brilliant and demanding and sui generis. Like the sentient money it depicts, the book seems to expand and forge on with its own strange conspiracies.

China initiated the meeting, ending more than half a century of ostracism at the highest level.China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and seeks its reunification with the mainland. But the island has enjoyed de facto independence since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949, underpinned by American military might. Like other countries in the region, Taiwan is in dispute with Beijing over claims in the South China Sea.  Related: Historic meeting of Chinese and Taiwanese presidents prompts hope and suspicion China-Taiwan tensions have eased somewhat during Ma\u2019s time in office as his nationalist party, the Kuomintang (KMT), has expanded cross-strait trade and tourism. But the number of Taiwanese favouring reunification has been steadily falling, while suspicion of Beijing\u2019s expansionist ambitions has grown. Opinion polls suggest the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP), led for the first time by a woman, Tsai Ing-wen, is on course to win the presidency in January when Ma stands down. The party is traditionally seen as favouring independence, or at the very least maintaining the status quo. A DPP success would undoubtedly anger Xi, who has said the Taiwan issue cannot remain unresolved indefinitely.Tsai complained that the announcement of the meeting came out of the blue. \u201cTo let the people know in such a hasty and chaotic manner is damaging to Taiwan\u2019s democracy,\u201d she said. The DPP spokesman Cheng Yun-peng said: \u201cHow can people not think of this as a political operation intended to affect the election?\u201dYet if Ma is thought to be kowtowing to Xi, the Singapore meeting could backfire by stiffening opposition to China\u2019s advances. Large-scale KMT defeats in local elections last year were attributed to a backlash, especially among younger voters, against the party\u2019s perceived cosying up to Beijing. China says it has no intention of interfering in the 16 January polls, unlike in 1996 when it launched war games to try to intimidate voters. Rejecting claims that Ma was selling out Taiwan, officials said he would make no deals, private or public, and would concentrate on promoting \u201cthe peaceful development of cross-strait relations\u201d. Since neither leader recognises the other as a head of state, the two men will address each other \u201cMr\u201d.

Washington has been assiduously courting Hanoi as part its regional power struggle with Beijing. Observers say Xi may hope to mend fences and strengthen pro-China leadership contenders prior to Vietnam\u2019s Communist party national congress next year.

China\u2019s law is vague about what, exactly, will be demanded when it comes to breaking encryption, and Recode\u2019s Dawn Chmielewski writes that \u201cit could take six months for regulations to emerge that make the government\u2019s intent clear.\u201dThe British bill has faced criticism from a number of technology companies for its anti-encryption stances.

Technology firms have warned that where Britain leads, nations with weaker human rights records may follow, citing the UK\u2019s example before cracking down on protected communications in their own nations.China\u2019s new law also restricts the right of media to report on details of terror attacks, including a provision that media and social media cannot report on details of terror activities that might lead to imitation, nor show scenes that are \u201ccruel and inhuman\u201d.", "tags": ["Encryption", "China", "Technology", "Surveillance", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "title": "China introduces its own 'snooper's charter'"},{"date": "2015-10-06T12:21:47Z", "content": "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a British attitude which treats China as a sweatshop on the Pearl River,\u201d George Osborne opined during a trip to the world\u2019s second largest economy in 2013.\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m trying to do this week in China is change British attitudes,\u201d he said.The chancellor\u2019s message appears to have eluded the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt.

Nearly 85% of migrants worked more than 44 hours a week, earning an average of just \u00a3270 per month.The consequences of such relentless work can be dire. Reports in China\u2019s state-run media last year claimed that a staggering 600,000 citizens were dying from over-work each year.A 2012 editorial in the China Daily newspaper complained: \u201cEmployers cajole, persuade, goad or force their workers to work overtime because they want to perform better in China\u2019s highly competitive market to ensure that they don\u2019t go out of business.\u201dBetter-off Chinese people are suffering, too.

Chinese experts have urged employers to reduce workloads as a way of boosting productivity. \u201cWorking overtime is not good for workers\u2019 health and does not improve productivity and efficiency,\u201d said Li, the Beijing-based labour economist.\u201cChinese workers have to work longer hours than their peers from the more developed countries, such as the UK and US, because China\u2019s production efficiency still lags significantly far behind those countries,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we are still at the developmental stage of chasing GDP growth and increasing total production, long working hours will persist for a certain time.\u201d Additional reporting by Luna Lin", "tags": ["China", "Conservative conference 2015", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Work-life balance", "Money", "UK news", "Work & careers", "Conservatives", "Politics"], "title": "How hard does China work?"},{"date": "2015-12-23T09:00:00Z", "content": "After a strange turn of events, Zanna and her best friend Deeba follow the trail of a broken umbrella to a wheel.

hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, launched on pay-TV cable and satellite service Shanghai Dragon TV on 19 October.The series, which airs across China and Taiwan, has so far

online audience of 173 million across the series so far, aggregating figures from China\u2019s eight biggest video platforms including Tencent, Youku, Tudou, Sohu, Iqiyi and Baofeng.Paul Dempsey, president of global markets at BBC Worldwide, used the success in China to highlight the strength of the Top Gear franchise.Some observers question whether the loss of Clarkson, Hammond and May may

world\u2019s favourite motoring entertainment show,\u201d said Dempsey. \u201cIt\u2019s also testament to a successful collaboration between our own UK producers and their Chinese counterparts who have recreated a British institution for a whole new audience.\u201dThe collaboration was perhaps not so successful for series one, which averaged about half the TV viewing and drew only 33 million

He added that Tokyo was not considering a fresh stimulus.The plea for big business to support the recovery came as official data on Monday showed Japan\u2019s economy shrank by an annualised 0.8% in July to September after a deeper than previously estimated 0.7% contraction in the previous three months, providing the two consecutive quarters of declines needed to mark a recession. Analysts said labour shortages were a significant feature of an ageing population in a country that had put severe restrictions on immigration. But the government maintained its cautiously upbeat outlook, saying that despite a downturn in national income during the summer and autumn, an improved outlook for jobs and wages would mean a return to growth later in the year. \u201cWhile there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of the various [stimulus] steps taken so far,\u201d Amari said.

The shutdown of nuclear plants has seen Japan increasingly reliant on fossil fuel imports that have hit its emissions-cutting ambitions.

At 13.7MW when finished, it would not make the top 100 of the world\u2019s largest solar photovoltaic farms.In the UK, water company United Utilities started work last year on a floating solar farm on a Greater Manchester reservoir, which will be Europe\u2019s largest once complete.

This has obviously had a big effect on inflation and on inflation expectations.\u201dMarkets had been divided on whether the central bank would opt for more stimulus as slumping oil costs and soft consumer spending have ground inflation to a halt in the world\u2019s third biggest economy.Earlier on Friday, official data showed Japan\u2019s inflation rate came in at 0.5% in 2015, way below the BoJ\u2019s 2.0% target, as the government struggles to convince cautious firms to usher in big wage hikes to stir spending and drive up prices.\u201cThe 2% target is now totally out of reach,\u201d said Taro Saito, economist at NLI Research Institute.The bank extended the deadline for achieving its 2% inflation target to the first half of fiscal 2017 from its previous estimate of the second half of fiscal 2016.Other data published on Friday pointed to a weak economy with spending by households in December falling 4.4% from a year ago and monthly industrial production contracting 1.4%.The BoJ cut its core consumer inflation forecast for the coming fiscal year beginning in April to 0.8% from 1.4% projected three months ago.The authorities will be hoping negative interest rates encourage commercial banks to lend more to promote investment and growth.The rate cut had an immediate knock-on effect, sending shares on the Nikkei average up by more than 500 points early on Friday afternoon. However, shares soon plunged back down again as traders digested the broader implications of the move, which forced down the value of the yen and which could spark a currency war.\u201cThe fact markets pared back this bounce soon after the announcement may in some respects reflect growing market concern that central banks are delving into a tit-for-tat currency devaluation war,\u201d said Angus Nicholson at the online trading firm IG in Melbourne.\u201cAnd the grand macro-economic elephant in the room is what happens if China is forced into a major one-off devaluation in retaliation. Markets are unlikely to react well to a big yuan devaluation, and the further the ECB and the BoJ force their currencies down the more they push China to act.\u201dThe decision came a day after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, lost one of the key architects of his inflation-oriented economic policy, known as \u201cAbenomics\u201d. Akira Amari was forced to resign as economy minister on Thursday following allegations that he and his aides received bribes from a construction company. Amari has denied any wrongdoing.Jesper Koll, chief executive officer at WisdomTree Japan, applauded the BoJ\u2019s decision. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with governor Kuroda\u2019s leadership today \u2013 adopting negative rates is exactly what was needed to re-assert the relentless, pro-active and pro-growth determination that underlies Abenomics,\u201d he said.\u201cThe fact that Kuroda has gone out on a limb \u2013 with a 5-4 vote \u2013 reasserts that this is his BoJ, not the technocratic non-risk taking BoJ of the past.

The shutdown of nuclear plants has seen Japan increasingly reliant on fossil fuel imports that have hit its emissions-cutting ambitions. The Yamakura dam power plant will see more than 50,000 solar photovoltaic panels cover a 180,000 m sq area, but compared to other land-based plants it is relatively small. At 13.7MW when finished, it would not make the top 100 of the world\u2019s largest solar photovoltaic farms.In the UK, water company United Utilities started work last year on a floating solar farm on a Greater Manchester reservoir, which will be Europe\u2019s largest once complete. Kyocera said it was turning to water because of a scarcity of land for utility-scale solar in Japan.Ray Noble, a solar adviser at the UK-based Renewable Energy Association, said that the technology was relatively straightforward but the only reason to build floating farms would be if land was very tight.\u201cIf you\u2019re short on land like they are in Japan, you could build on water. But in the UK with plenty of industrialised areas, it\u2019s cheaper to put solar on land than on water.\u201dThe main challenge was to keep wiring away from the water and put the inverters - which convert the electricity generated into a usable form - on floating structures. But he added: \u201cIf anything goes wrong, I\u2019ve always said electricity and water don\u2019t mix.\u201dKyocera has already built three floating solar farms, which are much smaller than the new one, which was first announced in October 2014.", "tags": ["Solar power", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Energy", "Environment", "Renewable energy", "World news", "Technology", "Energy"], "title": "Japan begins work on 'world's largest' floating solar farm"},{"date": "2016-01-29T06:54:27Z", "content": "Japan\u2019s central bank has made a shock decision to adopt negative interest rates, in an attempt to protect the flagging economy from market volatility and fears over the global economy.In a 5-4 vote, the bank\u2019s board imposed a 0.1% fee on deposits left with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) \u2013 in effect a negative interest rate.The move, which follows the similarly aggressive precedent set by the European Central Bank in June 2014, is designed to encourage commercial banks to use excess reserves they keep with the central bank to lend to businesses.The surprise decision came just days after the bank\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, suggested he had dismissed any drastic easing measures to boost business confidence.On Friday, the bank said it had not ruled out a further cut. \u201cThe BoJ will cut the interest rate further into negative territory if judged as necessary,\u201d it said in a statement.It said the move was intended to lessen the risk to Japanese business confidence from turbulence in the global economy, a week after data showed the Chinese economy had grown at its slowest pace for a quarter of a century in 2015.Some BoJ board members are reported to have voiced concern that slumping Tokyo stocks could threaten attempts to get firms to boost capital expenditure.The shift to negative interest rates \u2013 which in effect \u201ctaxes\u201d financial institutions for parking excess reserves with the BoJ \u2013 is seen as an attempt to drag Japan out of its deflationary mindset.Policymakers have been trying to achieve that through qualitative and quantitative easing, under which the BoJ expands its monetary base through the aggressive purchase of Japanese government bonds and risky assets.But with so few assets let to buy, that policy appears to have run its course, according to some analysts. \u201cI think this is a regime change and the BoJ\u2019s main policy tool is now negative interest rates,\u201d said Daiju Aoki, an economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. \u201cThis shows that the ability to buy more Japanese government bonds is limited.\u201dThe decision took some analysts by surprise. \u201cKuroda had been saying that he didn\u2019t think something like this would help so it is a bit surprising and it\u2019s clear the market has been surprised by it,\u201d said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA based in Tokyo.\u201cThe banking sector is getting smoked right now, though everything else seems to be doing just fine. This has obviously had a big effect on inflation and on inflation expectations.\u201dMarkets had been divided on whether the central bank would opt for more stimulus as slumping oil costs and soft consumer spending have ground inflation to a halt in the world\u2019s third biggest economy.Earlier on Friday, official data showed Japan\u2019s inflation rate came in at 0.5% in 2015, way below the BoJ\u2019s 2.0% target, as the government struggles to convince cautious firms to usher in big wage hikes to stir spending and drive up prices.\u201cThe 2% target is now totally out of reach,\u201d said Taro Saito, economist at NLI Research Institute.The bank extended the deadline for achieving its 2% inflation target to the first half of fiscal 2017 from its previous estimate of the second half of fiscal 2016.Other data published on Friday pointed to a weak economy with spending by households in December falling 4.4% from a year ago and monthly industrial production contracting 1.4%.The BoJ cut its core consumer inflation forecast for the coming fiscal year beginning in April to 0.8% from 1.4% projected three months ago.The authorities will be hoping negative interest rates encourage commercial banks to lend more to promote investment and growth.The rate cut had an immediate knock-on effect, sending shares on the Nikkei average up by more than 500 points early on Friday afternoon. However, shares soon plunged back down again as traders digested the broader implications of the move, which forced down the value of the yen and which could spark a currency war.\u201cThe fact markets pared back this bounce soon after the announcement may in some respects reflect growing market concern that central banks are delving into a tit-for-tat currency devaluation war,\u201d said Angus Nicholson at the online trading firm IG in Melbourne.\u201cAnd the grand macro-economic elephant in the room is what happens if China is forced into a major one-off devaluation in retaliation. Markets are unlikely to react well to a big yuan devaluation, and the further the ECB and the BoJ force their currencies down the more they push China to act.\u201dThe decision came a day after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, lost one of the key architects of his inflation-oriented economic policy, known as \u201cAbenomics\u201d.

The chief culprit is a symbol closely resembling Nazi Germany\u2019s swastika, which is used to indicate a Buddhist temple. The swastika will be replaced with a three-storey pagoda symbol when the new designs are unveiled at the end of March.Others have simply left visitors flummoxed. They include a simple \u201cX\u201d \u2013 meant to represent two truncheons \u2013 for a police box that will be replaced with a saluting officer, and a cross that is supposed to symbolise a church but which could be mistaken for a graveyard.\u201cJapan needs to create an environment where foreign visitors can easily use transport and find accommodation,\u201d the GSI said in a report quoted in the Japan Times. \u201cFor that purpose, it is especially important to disseminate multilingual maps that are easy for foreigners to understand.\u201dJapan is expecting an influx of foreign tourists for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and for the Tokyo Olympics a year later. But a weaker yen and relaxed visa regulations for visitors from China and other Asian countries have already sparked a huge increase in the number of visitors, new tourism ministry figures show.A record 19.74 million people visited Japan last year, the ministry said this week, an increase of more than 47% from 2014. The number of incoming tourists outstripped the number of Japanese people going abroad for the first time, it added.Inbound tourism suffered in the aftermath of the March 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster, but it now looks likely that Japan will achieve its target of 20 million tourists next year, four years ahead of schedule.The decision to replace the swastika came after the GSI polled more than 1,000 people from 92 countries, including tourists, embassy officials and exchange students, about the clarity of 18 symbols commonly used on maps.Despite the swastika\u2019s origins in the ancient language of Sanskrit and its centuries-old association with Japanese Buddhism, the GSI found that many tourists still associated it with the Nazis.Known as manji in Japanese, the swastika-like symbol used in tourist maps is in fact slightly different from the one preferred by Nazis. The legs on the former run anti-clockwise; in the latter, they flow in the opposite direction.The changes will not apply to Japanese-language maps, and there is no suggestion that the temples themselves should remove manji from their premises.The swastika wasn\u2019t the only source of confusion. The research revealed that the symbol for a hotel, a capital H inside a circle, looked too much like the sign commonly used for a helipad, while the traditional symbol for a post office was similarly baffling.Some of the old symbols will be retained, however, including the mark for an onsen (hot spring), which some have jokingly pointed out could just as easily represent a bowl of steaming miso soup.Of the 18 existing symbols, six will be replaced when the changes go into effect in the spring.The decision to ditch the swastika drew criticism on Japanese social media, with some arguing that it should be retained, and that tourists educate themselves about its centuries-old connection to Buddhism.One Twitter user blamed the change on \u201cignorant\u201d foreigners, while another wondered if Britain would contemplate ditching the Union Jack because it happened to be displayed by a terrorist.A tweeter based in Scotland agreed: \u201cIt is sad that Japan feel the need to censor the swastika for tourism when it had much nobler connotations pre-Nazism.\u201dThe GSI conceded that the revamp was not to everyone\u2019s liking. \u201cJapanese users are divided in their opinions on the new symbols,\u201d Takayuki Nakamura, a GSI official, told the Japan Times.\u201cSome say we should change symbols for Japanese-language maps at this opportunity, while others say the traditional symbols should stay.

The shutdown of nuclear plants has seen Japan increasingly reliant on fossil fuel imports that have hit its emissions-cutting ambitions. The Yamakura dam power plant will see more than 50,000 solar photovoltaic panels cover a 180,000 m sq area, but compared to other land-based plants it is relatively small. At 13.7MW when finished, it would not make the top 100 of the world\u2019s largest solar photovoltaic farms.In the UK, water company United Utilities started work last year on a floating solar farm on a Greater Manchester reservoir, which will be Europe\u2019s largest once complete. Kyocera said it was turning to water because of a scarcity of land for utility-scale solar in Japan.Ray Noble, a solar adviser at the UK-based Renewable Energy Association, said that the technology was relatively straightforward but the only reason to build floating farms would be if land was very tight.\u201cIf you\u2019re short on land like they are in Japan, you could build on water. But in the UK with plenty of industrialised areas, it\u2019s cheaper to put solar on land than on water.\u201dThe main challenge was to keep wiring away from the water and put the inverters - which convert the electricity generated into a usable form - on floating structures. But he added: \u201cIf anything goes wrong, I\u2019ve always said electricity and water don\u2019t mix.\u201dKyocera has already built three floating solar farms, which are much smaller than the new one, which was first announced in October 2014.", "tags": ["Solar power", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Energy", "Environment", "Renewable energy", "World news", "Technology", "Energy"], "title": "Japan begins work on 'world's largest' floating solar farm"},{"date": "2016-01-29T06:54:27Z", "content": "Japan\u2019s central bank has made a shock decision to adopt negative interest rates, in an attempt to protect the flagging economy from market volatility and fears over the global economy.In a 5-4 vote, the bank\u2019s board imposed a 0.1% fee on deposits left with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) \u2013 in effect a negative interest rate.The move, which follows the similarly aggressive precedent set by the European Central Bank in June 2014, is designed to encourage commercial banks to use excess reserves they keep with the central bank to lend to businesses.The surprise decision came just days after the bank\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, suggested he had dismissed any drastic easing measures to boost business confidence.On Friday, the bank said it had not ruled out a further cut. \u201cThe BoJ will cut the interest rate further into negative territory if judged as necessary,\u201d it said in a statement.It said the move was intended to lessen the risk to Japanese business confidence from turbulence in the global economy, a week after data showed the Chinese economy had grown at its slowest pace for a quarter of a century in 2015.Some BoJ board members are reported to have voiced concern that slumping Tokyo stocks could threaten attempts to get firms to boost capital expenditure.The shift to negative interest rates \u2013 which in effect \u201ctaxes\u201d financial institutions for parking excess reserves with the BoJ \u2013 is seen as an attempt to drag Japan out of its deflationary mindset.Policymakers have been trying to achieve that through qualitative and quantitative easing, under which the BoJ expands its monetary base through the aggressive purchase of Japanese government bonds and risky assets.But with so few assets let to buy, that policy appears to have run its course, according to some analysts. \u201cI think this is a regime change and the BoJ\u2019s main policy tool is now negative interest rates,\u201d said Daiju Aoki, an economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. \u201cThis shows that the ability to buy more Japanese government bonds is limited.\u201dThe decision took some analysts by surprise. \u201cKuroda had been saying that he didn\u2019t think something like this would help so it is a bit surprising and it\u2019s clear the market has been surprised by it,\u201d said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA based in Tokyo.\u201cThe banking sector is getting smoked right now, though everything else seems to be doing just fine. This has obviously had a big effect on inflation and on inflation expectations.\u201dMarkets had been divided on whether the central bank would opt for more stimulus as slumping oil costs and soft consumer spending have ground inflation to a halt in the world\u2019s third biggest economy.Earlier on Friday, official data showed Japan\u2019s inflation rate came in at 0.5% in 2015, way below the BoJ\u2019s 2.0% target, as the government struggles to convince cautious firms to usher in big wage hikes to stir spending and drive up prices.\u201cThe 2% target is now totally out of reach,\u201d said Taro Saito, economist at NLI Research Institute.The bank extended the deadline for achieving its 2% inflation target to the first half of fiscal 2017 from its previous estimate of the second half of fiscal 2016.Other data published on Friday pointed to a weak economy with spending by households in December falling 4.4% from a year ago and monthly industrial production contracting 1.4%.The BoJ cut its core consumer inflation forecast for the coming fiscal year beginning in April to 0.8% from 1.4% projected three months ago.The authorities will be hoping negative interest rates encourage commercial banks to lend more to promote investment and growth.The rate cut had an immediate knock-on effect, sending shares on the Nikkei average up by more than 500 points early on Friday afternoon. However, shares soon plunged back down again as traders digested the broader implications of the move, which forced down the value of the yen and which could spark a currency war.\u201cThe fact markets pared back this bounce soon after the announcement may in some respects reflect growing market concern that central banks are delving into a tit-for-tat currency devaluation war,\u201d said Angus Nicholson at the online trading firm IG in Melbourne.\u201cAnd the grand macro-economic elephant in the room is what happens if China is forced into a major one-off devaluation in retaliation. Markets are unlikely to react well to a big yuan devaluation, and the further the ECB and the BoJ force their currencies down the more they push China to act.\u201dThe decision came a day after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, lost one of the key architects of his inflation-oriented economic policy, known as \u201cAbenomics\u201d. Akira Amari was forced to resign as economy minister on Thursday following allegations that he and his aides received bribes from a construction company.

The chief culprit is a symbol closely resembling Nazi Germany\u2019s swastika, which is used to indicate a Buddhist temple. The swastika will be replaced with a three-storey pagoda symbol when the new designs are unveiled at the end of March.Others have simply left visitors flummoxed. They include a simple \u201cX\u201d \u2013 meant to represent two truncheons \u2013 for a police box that will be replaced with a saluting officer, and a cross that is supposed to symbolise a church but which could be mistaken for a graveyard.\u201cJapan needs to create an environment where foreign visitors can easily use transport and find accommodation,\u201d the GSI said in a report quoted in the Japan Times. \u201cFor that purpose, it is especially important to disseminate multilingual maps that are easy for foreigners to understand.\u201dJapan is expecting an influx of foreign tourists for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and for the Tokyo Olympics a year later. But a weaker yen and relaxed visa regulations for visitors from China and other Asian countries have already sparked a huge increase in the number of visitors, new tourism ministry figures show.A record 19.74 million people visited Japan last year, the ministry said this week, an increase of more than 47% from 2014. The number of incoming tourists outstripped the number of Japanese people going abroad for the first time, it added.Inbound tourism suffered in the aftermath of the March 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster, but it now looks likely that Japan will achieve its target of 20 million tourists next year, four years ahead of schedule.The decision to replace the swastika came after the GSI polled more than 1,000 people from 92 countries, including tourists, embassy officials and exchange students, about the clarity of 18 symbols commonly used on maps.Despite the swastika\u2019s origins in the ancient language of Sanskrit and its centuries-old association with Japanese Buddhism, the GSI found that many tourists still associated it with the Nazis.Known as manji in Japanese, the swastika-like symbol used in tourist maps is in fact slightly different from the one preferred by Nazis. The legs on the former run anti-clockwise; in the latter, they flow in the opposite direction.The changes will not apply to Japanese-language maps, and there is no suggestion that the temples themselves should remove manji from their premises.The swastika wasn\u2019t the only source of confusion. The research revealed that the symbol for a hotel, a capital H inside a circle, looked too much like the sign commonly used for a helipad, while the traditional symbol for a post office was similarly baffling.Some of the old symbols will be retained, however, including the mark for an onsen (hot spring), which some have jokingly pointed out could just as easily represent a bowl of steaming miso soup.Of the 18 existing symbols, six will be replaced when the changes go into effect in the spring.The decision to ditch the swastika drew criticism on Japanese social media, with some arguing that it should be retained, and that tourists educate themselves about its centuries-old connection to Buddhism.One Twitter user blamed the change on \u201cignorant\u201d foreigners, while another wondered if Britain would contemplate ditching the Union Jack because it happened to be displayed by a terrorist.A tweeter based in Scotland agreed: \u201cIt is sad that Japan feel the need to censor the swastika for tourism when it had much nobler connotations pre-Nazism.\u201dThe GSI conceded that the revamp was not to everyone\u2019s liking. \u201cJapanese users are divided in their opinions on the new symbols,\u201d Takayuki Nakamura, a GSI official, told the Japan Times.\u201cSome say we should change symbols for Japanese-language maps at this opportunity, while others say the traditional symbols should stay.

Japan and Russia have failed to make progress on the sovereignty dispute despite numerous rounds of talks. Japan insists that all four islands should be returned, while Russia cites a 1956 agreement under which it would return the two smaller, less developed islands, but only after the countries sign a peace treaty.Located in the northwest Pacific near the northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaido, the Northern Territories are surrounded by rich fishing grounds, mineral deposits and possibly offshore oil and gas reserves. Many of the 17,000 Japanese living there at the end of the war were forced to leave. The islands are now inhabited by about 14,000 Russians.Japan accused Russia of damaging the prospects for a breakthrough after Moscow said in June that it would accelerate building work on civilian and military infrastructure on the islands. Medvedev said the government would spend 70 billion roubles (\u00a3730m) on developing the territories over the next decade.Japan is embroiled in territorial rows on three fronts: with Russia over the Northern Territories, with China over the Senkaku islands, and with South Korea over the Takeshima islands.", "tags": ["Japan", "Russia", "Second world war", "Asia Pacific", "Europe", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Vladimir Putin"], "title": "Vladimir Putin's visit to Japan postponed indefinitely"},{"date": "2016-02-03T06:26:56Z", "content": "Japan\u2019s enduring fascination with Harry Potter has generated colossal box office receipts and book sales, and his very own theme park attraction.

He added that Tokyo was not considering a fresh stimulus.The plea for big business to support the recovery came as official data on Monday showed Japan\u2019s economy shrank by an annualised 0.8% in July to September after a deeper than previously estimated 0.7% contraction in the previous three months, providing the two consecutive quarters of declines needed to mark a recession. Analysts said labour shortages were a significant feature of an ageing population in a country that had put severe restrictions on immigration. But the government maintained its cautiously upbeat outlook, saying that despite a downturn in national income during the summer and autumn, an improved outlook for jobs and wages would mean a return to growth later in the year. \u201cWhile there are risks such as overseas developments, we expect the economy to head toward a moderate recovery thanks to the effect of the various [stimulus] steps taken so far,\u201d Amari said.

Not served by a McWaiter | Josh Barrie While McDonald\u2019s reported a 5.7% rise in US in the last three months of 2015, as well as plans to open another 60 stores in Russia this year, its Japanese sales have been hit by a series of food scandals and supply issues.In late 2014, the firm was forced to restrict sales of fries after industrial action at US ports affected shipments of thousands of tonnes of the chain\u2019s staple accompaniment to a burger to Japan.Earlier the same year, officials in China closed down the firm\u2019s poultry supplier amid allegations that it had deliberately mixed fresh chicken with expired produce. Last year, its Japan operation was hit by reports of foreign objects \u2013a piece of plastic and what appeared to be a human tooth \u2013 in McDonald\u2019s chicken nuggets and french fries.McDonald\u2019s Japan, which operates almost 3,000 stores, reported a group net loss of \u00a529 billion for the first nine months of 2015. It was expected to suffer a \u00a538 billion ($318 million) net loss for the full year, with sales forecast to drop 10%. Last year, the firm said it would close about 130 stores in Japan and refurbish 2,000 others in the next four years.The Nikkei business newspaper recently reported that the burger chain had reached out to investors about selling a part of its stake in its Japan business for 100 billion yen.The sweet-and-salty fries, which come with two types of chocolate sauce \u2013 milk and white \u2013 cost 330 yen (2.77 US dollars), compared with 270 yen for a medium-sized portion of the regular version.\u201cCustomers will find McChoco Potatoes enjoyable for different occasions, as it also makes for a great dessert. The combination creates a wonderful salty and sweet harmonious taste,\u201d the company said in a press release.Early reviews suggest the combination, while perhaps not to everyone\u2019s taste, works surprisingly well. \u201cSalt and chocolate complement each other quite well,\u201d Brian Ashcraft wrote on the Kotaku website.\u201cSince the fries are served hot, when you squirt on the sauce, the warm fries heat up the sauce.

The shutdown of nuclear plants has seen Japan increasingly reliant on fossil fuel imports that have hit its emissions-cutting ambitions. The Yamakura dam power plant will see more than 50,000 solar photovoltaic panels cover a 180,000 m sq area, but compared to other land-based plants it is relatively small. At 13.7MW when finished, it would not make the top 100 of the world\u2019s largest solar photovoltaic farms.In the UK, water company United Utilities started work last year on a floating solar farm on a Greater Manchester reservoir, which will be Europe\u2019s largest once complete. Kyocera said it was turning to water because of a scarcity of land for utility-scale solar in Japan.Ray Noble, a solar adviser at the UK-based Renewable Energy Association, said that the technology was relatively straightforward but the only reason to build floating farms would be if land was very tight.\u201cIf you\u2019re short on land like they are in Japan, you could build on water. But in the UK with plenty of industrialised areas, it\u2019s cheaper to put solar on land than on water.\u201dThe main challenge was to keep wiring away from the water and put the inverters - which convert the electricity generated into a usable form - on floating structures. But he added: \u201cIf anything goes wrong, I\u2019ve always said electricity and water don\u2019t mix.\u201dKyocera has already built three floating solar farms, which are much smaller than the new one, which was first announced in October 2014.", "tags": ["Solar power", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "Energy", "Environment", "Renewable energy", "World news", "Technology", "Energy"], "title": "Japan begins work on 'world's largest' floating solar farm"},{"date": "2016-01-29T06:54:27Z", "content": "Japan\u2019s central bank has made a shock decision to adopt negative interest rates, in an attempt to protect the flagging economy from market volatility and fears over the global economy.In a 5-4 vote, the bank\u2019s board imposed a 0.1% fee on deposits left with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) \u2013 in effect a negative interest rate.The move, which follows the similarly aggressive precedent set by the European Central Bank in June 2014, is designed to encourage commercial banks to use excess reserves they keep with the central bank to lend to businesses.The surprise decision came just days after the bank\u2019s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, suggested he had dismissed any drastic easing measures to boost business confidence.On Friday, the bank said it had not ruled out a further cut. \u201cThe BoJ will cut the interest rate further into negative territory if judged as necessary,\u201d it said in a statement.It said the move was intended to lessen the risk to Japanese business confidence from turbulence in the global economy, a week after data showed the Chinese economy had grown at its slowest pace for a quarter of a century in 2015.Some BoJ board members are reported to have voiced concern that slumping Tokyo stocks could threaten attempts to get firms to boost capital expenditure.The shift to negative interest rates \u2013 which in effect \u201ctaxes\u201d financial institutions for parking excess reserves with the BoJ \u2013 is seen as an attempt to drag Japan out of its deflationary mindset.Policymakers have been trying to achieve that through qualitative and quantitative easing, under which the BoJ expands its monetary base through the aggressive purchase of Japanese government bonds and risky assets.But with so few assets let to buy, that policy appears to have run its course, according to some analysts. \u201cI think this is a regime change and the BoJ\u2019s main policy tool is now negative interest rates,\u201d said Daiju Aoki, an economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. \u201cThis shows that the ability to buy more Japanese government bonds is limited.\u201dThe decision took some analysts by surprise. \u201cKuroda had been saying that he didn\u2019t think something like this would help so it is a bit surprising and it\u2019s clear the market has been surprised by it,\u201d said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA based in Tokyo.\u201cThe banking sector is getting smoked right now, though everything else seems to be doing just fine. This has obviously had a big effect on inflation and on inflation expectations.\u201dMarkets had been divided on whether the central bank would opt for more stimulus as slumping oil costs and soft consumer spending have ground inflation to a halt in the world\u2019s third biggest economy.Earlier on Friday, official data showed Japan\u2019s inflation rate came in at 0.5% in 2015, way below the BoJ\u2019s 2.0% target, as the government struggles to convince cautious firms to usher in big wage hikes to stir spending and drive up prices.\u201cThe 2% target is now totally out of reach,\u201d said Taro Saito, economist at NLI Research Institute.The bank extended the deadline for achieving its 2% inflation target to the first half of fiscal 2017 from its previous estimate of the second half of fiscal 2016.Other data published on Friday pointed to a weak economy with spending by households in December falling 4.4% from a year ago and monthly industrial production contracting 1.4%.The BoJ cut its core consumer inflation forecast for the coming fiscal year beginning in April to 0.8% from 1.4% projected three months ago.The authorities will be hoping negative interest rates encourage commercial banks to lend more to promote investment and growth.The rate cut had an immediate knock-on effect, sending shares on the Nikkei average up by more than 500 points early on Friday afternoon. However, shares soon plunged back down again as traders digested the broader implications of the move, which forced down the value of the yen and which could spark a currency war.\u201cThe fact markets pared back this bounce soon after the announcement may in some respects reflect growing market concern that central banks are delving into a tit-for-tat currency devaluation war,\u201d said Angus Nicholson at the online trading firm IG in Melbourne.\u201cAnd the grand macro-economic elephant in the room is what happens if China is forced into a major one-off devaluation in retaliation. Markets are unlikely to react well to a big yuan devaluation, and the further the ECB and the BoJ force their currencies down the more they push China to act.\u201dThe decision came a day after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, lost one of the key architects of his inflation-oriented economic policy, known as \u201cAbenomics\u201d. Akira Amari was forced to resign as economy minister on Thursday following allegations that he and his aides received bribes from a construction company.

The chief culprit is a symbol closely resembling Nazi Germany\u2019s swastika, which is used to indicate a Buddhist temple. The swastika will be replaced with a three-storey pagoda symbol when the new designs are unveiled at the end of March.Others have simply left visitors flummoxed. They include a simple \u201cX\u201d \u2013 meant to represent two truncheons \u2013 for a police box that will be replaced with a saluting officer, and a cross that is supposed to symbolise a church but which could be mistaken for a graveyard.\u201cJapan needs to create an environment where foreign visitors can easily use transport and find accommodation,\u201d the GSI said in a report quoted in the Japan Times. \u201cFor that purpose, it is especially important to disseminate multilingual maps that are easy for foreigners to understand.\u201dJapan is expecting an influx of foreign tourists for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and for the Tokyo Olympics a year later. But a weaker yen and relaxed visa regulations for visitors from China and other Asian countries have already sparked a huge increase in the number of visitors, new tourism ministry figures show.A record 19.74 million people visited Japan last year, the ministry said this week, an increase of more than 47% from 2014. The number of incoming tourists outstripped the number of Japanese people going abroad for the first time, it added.Inbound tourism suffered in the aftermath of the March 2011 tsunami and Fukushima nuclear disaster, but it now looks likely that Japan will achieve its target of 20 million tourists next year, four years ahead of schedule.The decision to replace the swastika came after the GSI polled more than 1,000 people from 92 countries, including tourists, embassy officials and exchange students, about the clarity of 18 symbols commonly used on maps.Despite the swastika\u2019s origins in the ancient language of Sanskrit and its centuries-old association with Japanese Buddhism, the GSI found that many tourists still associated it with the Nazis.Known as manji in Japanese, the swastika-like symbol used in tourist maps is in fact slightly different from the one preferred by Nazis. The legs on the former run anti-clockwise; in the latter, they flow in the opposite direction.The changes will not apply to Japanese-language maps, and there is no suggestion that the temples themselves should remove manji from their premises.The swastika wasn\u2019t the only source of confusion. The research revealed that the symbol for a hotel, a capital H inside a circle, looked too much like the sign commonly used for a helipad, while the traditional symbol for a post office was similarly baffling.Some of the old symbols will be retained, however, including the mark for an onsen (hot spring), which some have jokingly pointed out could just as easily represent a bowl of steaming miso soup.Of the 18 existing symbols, six will be replaced when the changes go into effect in the spring.The decision to ditch the swastika drew criticism on Japanese social media, with some arguing that it should be retained, and that tourists educate themselves about its centuries-old connection to Buddhism.One Twitter user blamed the change on \u201cignorant\u201d foreigners, while another wondered if Britain would contemplate ditching the Union Jack because it happened to be displayed by a terrorist.A tweeter based in Scotland agreed: \u201cIt is sad that Japan feel the need to censor the swastika for tourism when it had much nobler connotations pre-Nazism.\u201dThe GSI conceded that the revamp was not to everyone\u2019s liking. \u201cJapanese users are divided in their opinions on the new symbols,\u201d Takayuki Nakamura, a GSI official, told the Japan Times.\u201cSome say we should change symbols for Japanese-language maps at this opportunity, while others say the traditional symbols should stay.

But we need to resolve the islands issue first because that is the source of all of the problems we are having now.\u201dKyodo News quoted unnamed Japanese government sources as saying that Putin\u2019s visit would be \u201cdifficult to realise\u201d by the end of the year, adding that Russian airstrikes in Syria had also made it \u201ctough\u201d to arrange. Putin will not be among the leaders attending the G7 summit in Japan next year after Russia was banished from the group following its annexation of Crimea last year.But Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said Tokyo would continue to explore the possibility of a visit this year, as agreed between Putin and Abe at last November\u2019s Apec summit in Beijing. Japan and Russia have failed to make progress on the sovereignty dispute despite numerous rounds of talks. Japan insists that all four islands should be returned, while Russia cites a 1956 agreement under which it would return the two smaller, less developed islands, but only after the countries sign a peace treaty.Located in the northwest Pacific near the northernmost Japanese island of Hokkaido, the Northern Territories are surrounded by rich fishing grounds, mineral deposits and possibly offshore oil and gas reserves. Many of the 17,000 Japanese living there at the end of the war were forced to leave. The islands are now inhabited by about 14,000 Russians.Japan accused Russia of damaging the prospects for a breakthrough after Moscow said in June that it would accelerate building work on civilian and military infrastructure on the islands. Medvedev said the government would spend 70 billion roubles (\u00a3730m) on developing the territories over the next decade.Japan is embroiled in territorial rows on three fronts: with Russia over the Northern Territories, with China over the Senkaku islands, and with South Korea over the Takeshima islands.", "tags": ["Japan", "Russia", "Second world war", "Asia Pacific", "Europe", "World news", "Shinzo Abe", "Vladimir Putin"], "title": "Vladimir Putin's visit to Japan postponed indefinitely"},{"date": "2015-10-14T05:30:01Z", "content": "Nestling in the warm, sub-tropical waters 37 miles south of Kyushu, Japan\u2019s third largest island, the towering mountains and ancient forests of Yakushima make it a secluded and largely unspoilt paradise, which feels a world away from the hustle and bustle of Japan\u2019s megacities. Designated a Unesco world heritage site in 1993, the island has long been revered by the Japanese as one of the country\u2019s natural wonders, but it is only in recent years that foreign visitors have started to discover Yakushima\u2019s secrets.This small, round island has an incredibly mountainous interior, but at only 17 miles wide, it is possible to see all of the main sights and get a good taste of island life in just a few days. Miyanoura-dake (1,935m) is one of Japan\u2019s famous One Hundred Mountains, and is the country\u2019s most southerly point where snow can be found in winter. But Yakushima is best known for the extensive and hauntingly beautiful forests that cover most of the island, home to Japanese cedar trees (known as Yakusugi), some of which are thousands of years old. Walking through these moody, temperate rainforests, full of fairytale-like trees with twisted moss-covered roots, it is no surprise to learn that the island was the inspiration for acclaimed Studio Ghibli animation Princess Mononoke, directed by Hayao Miyazaki.The extremely wet climate means crystal-clear rivers tumble down from the high peaks, resulting in spectacular waterfalls, which carve their way through the granite bedrock. Lavish green, dense foliage provides the perfect home for the Yakushima macaque and the Yaku deer, both of which are smaller than their mainland counterparts but less timid, so can easily be spotted foraging near roadsides and along hiking trails. In the summer months, endangered loggerhead turtles make their nests on Yakushima\u2019s beaches, while tropical fish and corals can be found in the shallow and warm coastal waters. Geothermal hot springs (onsen) are everywhere, as they are in most of Japan, and some of the island\u2019s best are right on the beach.The two main points of entry are the tiny port towns of Miyanoura and Anbo, where daily ferries from Kagoshima put in. Be sure to bring plenty of cash from the mainland as ATMs are almost non-existent and few places accept cards. A road loops around the entire island, although the western stretch is too narrow and remote for the (limited) bus service, so a rental car is the best way to get around.Outdoor activities are high on the agenda for most visitors to Yakushima, and the steep mountains and pristine forests attract hikers from all over Japan, with trails to suit all abilities. Yakusugi Land, a nature park, (two buses a day from Anbo, ticket \u00a34) is home to many impressive old cedars, and has a number of easy hikes (ranging from 30 minutes to three hours), which afford close-up views of these relics.Further north, Shiratani Unsuikyo (35 minutes from Miyanoura by bus, ticket \u00a33) is a world of mossy-green woods and babbling streams that inspired Miyazaki\u2019s animated masterpiece. The well-marked paths lead to a number of ancient, individually named cedars. For the more adventurous, this area marks the beginning (or end) of a gruelling three-day traverse across the island\u2019s interior, passing landmarks, such as Wilson\u2019s Stump (the hollow remains of a long-felled giant cedar) and the oddly-shaped granite outcrops that characterise the high mountain tops. There are a number of huts to stay in, for free, but you need to bring your own sleeping bag and cooking equipment as accommodation is extremely basic (and cold at night).For those who love soaking in hot springs, the unique Hirauchi Kaichu Onsen on the south coast is a must. It\u2019s right on the rocky shoreline and so can only be accessed twice a day, when the tide is low. Pop \u00a5100 (50p) into the honesty box, strip down (a small towel can be used to protect your modesty) and be sure to follow local etiquette by rinsing yourself before entering the pools. Just down the road is Yudomari Onsen, which has a bamboo divider to separate the sexes and, for those who can\u2019t stand the heat, the water here is a pleasant 38C.In summer, loggerhead turtles return to the place they were born some 30 years earlier to lay eggs on the beach. For night-time turtle watching with a local guide, make a reservation at the sea turtle museum (umigame-kan.org).There are exceptionally good snorkelling and sea-kayaking spots all around the island. As the rainiest place in Japan, waterfalls are ubiquitous and the most spectacular is the west coast\u2019s 88m-high Ooko-no-taki, just a short walk from the main road.The newly-opened Guesthouse Yakushima (from \u00a316pp for a dorm bed) is in a secluded spot on the south coast, close to the impressive Senpiro Waterfall and Toroki Falls (the only waterfall in Japan that flows directly into the sea). The rooms are clean, done in western and Japanese-tatami styles, and the friendly owner speaks good English.Cottage Morinokokage (from \u00a327pp) is conveniently near Anbo port and has helpful English-speaking owners. A range of cosy, pine-scented self-catering cottages offer splendid mountain views. Request the belly-filling barbecue set (for an extra \u00a316) to grill meat and vegetables under the twinkling lights of your veranda, whatever the weather.Soyotei (from \u00a376pp) is a beautiful, traditional family-run guesthouse on the less-visited north-west coast, close to one of the best beaches on the island which is a prime turtle-nesting site. Enjoy freshly caught seafood and local produce, tatami rooms with ocean views and relax in the adjoining hot spring. English is limited but the owners are attentive, and the price includes an evening meal and breakfast.JR Hotel Yakushima (doubles from \u00a3210) is the high-end option. Perched above the sea on the southern coast, the sunset views from the hotel\u2019s outdoor bath, great food and polite service are all exemplary, even by Japanese standards.There is no shortage of good food on Yakushima but, as with many out-of-the-way places in Japan, restaurants tend to close early. Seafood is the staple cuisine and is as fresh as it comes. Lean, locally sourced deer is the main meat option in any season, delicious grilled over charcoal, yakiniku-style. Should you crave fast food, there is a tiny Mos Burger in Anbo, surely the most rustic branch of this Japanese burger chain in the country. If visiting in the winter, keep your eyes peeled for small roadside stalls selling bags of ponkan and tankan, sweet and juicy varieties of oranges grown all over the island. Also, be sure to try the potent yet delicate local Mitake shochu, a distilled, sweet-potato relative of sake, best served on the rocks.For visitors fresh off the ferry, Shiosai (lunch sets from \u00a37, +81 997 42 2721) is a popular seafood restaurant just a short walk down the main street from Miyanoura port. The seasonal mackerel sashimi is a Yakushima speciality, and the fried flying fish (tobiuo) is another local favourite. Lunchtime sets are reasonably priced and typically offer a choice of sashimi or fried fish in a light tempura batter, both served with a small salad and miso soup. Popular with locals and tourists alike, an English menu is available.Rengaya in Anbo (sets from \u00a35, dinner from around \u00a316, +81 997 46 3439) is a lively establishment most well-known for its platters of deer meat and vegetables, which guests cook over a smoky grill in the centre of the table. After a long day in the mountains, stretch your legs out on the tatami mats (no chairs here) and wash everything down with a cold beer or refreshing chuhai (a carbonated alcoholic drink).On the main road in Anbo, Kamogawa (sets from \u00a35, +81 997 46 2101) is a cosy, family-run restaurant that offers satisfyingly large seafood sets at very reasonable prices.The Toppy hydrofoil takes about two hours from Kagoshima to Anbo (\u00a348 one-way) and the slower Yaku 2 ferry goes to Miyanoura once a day (\u00a327 one-way). JAL flies to the Japan mainland from various UK airports, returns from \u00a3400.

No longer satisfied with terrorising large swaths of the Middle East, it is inspiring, recruiting, training and supplying terrorists to carry out murderous acts around the world. Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year.

In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam.

The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader.

No longer satisfied with terrorising large swaths of the Middle East, it is inspiring, recruiting, training and supplying terrorists to carry out murderous acts around the world. Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world. Only a coalition led by Saudi Arabia can genuinely defeat Isis while also delegitimising the group in the eyes of the wider Muslim world. If the nations of the world hope to completely defeat Isis, they should stop falsely accusing the Saudis of creating the group and instead join them in defeating it.\u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2015 and again on 24 December 2015 to clarify Nawaf Obaid\u2019s role as a former communications adviser to the Saudi government.

In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world. Only a coalition led by Saudi Arabia can genuinely defeat Isis while also delegitimising the group in the eyes of the wider Muslim world. If the nations of the world hope to completely defeat Isis, they should stop falsely accusing the Saudis of creating the group and instead join them in defeating it.\u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2015 and again on 24 December 2015 to clarify Nawaf Obaid\u2019s role as a former communications adviser to the Saudi government.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites. The country\u2019s parliament has failed to elect a president, by law a Christian Maronite, more than 30 times, in sessions that often faileven to achieve quorum.The country\u2019s political dysfunction descended into farce last summer, when the government failed to negotiate a deal over new landfills, leaving rubbish piling up in the streets of Beirut, and prompting demonstrations protesting official corruption.", "tags": ["Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran", "Saudi Arabia"], "title": "Advantage Iran in Lebanese political proxy battle with Saudi Arabia"},{"date": "2015-10-07T10:46:13Z", "content": "The Guardian reported last week how leaked documents revealed that Britain conducted secret vote-trading deals with Saudi Arabia to ensure both states were elected to the UN human rights council (UNHRC).The elevation of the Saudi kingdom to one of the UN\u2019s most influential bodies in 2013 prompted fresh international criticism of its human rights record, the Guardian noted.A year earlier, 2012, a Shia activist, Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, then aged 17, was arrested. He faces death by crucifixion after being convicted of joining an anti-government demonstration.Britain\u2019s Ministry of Justice, meanwhile, has bidded for a \u00a35.9m contract to provide prison expertise to the Saudis. The bid was put in by Justice Solutions International, the commercial arm of the MoJ set up by the last justice secretary, Chris Grayling.Saudi Arabia is Britain\u2019s largest arms market by far. It has sold 72 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to the country in a contract worth an estimated \u00a34.4bn, upgraded Saudi Tornado aircraft (part of the controversial \u00a340bn al-Yamamah contract signed by Margaret Thatcher) in a contract worth an estimated \u00a32.5bn, and upgraded 70 US F15 combat jets in the Saudi air force.The UK Ministry of Defence has gone out its way to help the Saudis by diverting 500 lb Paveway IV guided bombs originally earmarked for the RAF to Saudi Arabia to enable it to continue striking targets in Yemen and Syria. Paveway bombs are produced by Raytheon UK.British-made Tornado GR4 ground attack fighters and Typhoons have been playing a major role in Saudi bombing strikes on Yemen where it is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The soaring number of civilian casualties in the Saudi-led bombing campaign have provoked widespread criticism. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, said last month that 2,300 civilians had been killed so far. He said both sides in the conflict shared blame, but the Saudi-led air campaign was responsible for most of the deaths.In a report released on Wednesday, Amnesty International said the British government must urgently investigate whether weapons it supplied to the Saudi airforce had killed civilians.

Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country.Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time.\u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said.Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers. Some question whether this strategy could change in the run-up to any Aramco IPO.He was happy for the Economist to depict his planned new policies as Thatcherite, saying he was \u201cmost certainly\u201d wanting to follow the free market economic path the former UK prime minster had pioneered.Western oil companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil may be very interested in an opportunity to buy into Saudi Aramco \u2013 even when their own balance sheets are being stretched by a collapsing crude values.But other state-owned petroleum groups, from China and elsewhere, would also be keen to take a stake in a company that controls more than 260bn barrels of reserves.Saudi Aramco produces all of Saudi\u2019s 10.25m barrels a day, which is more than double that of Exxon and Rosneft in Russia.The Saudi prince, who is also the defence minister, said it was right of his country to suspend diplomatic relations with fellow Opec member and regional power rival Iran, but played down any prospects of physical conflict.He said: \u201cA war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is the beginning of a major catastrophe in the region ... For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201dThe mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices. Middle East tension usually raises oil trader fears that production or transport could be hit.But in recent days the direction of travel for prices has only been downwards as sentiment concentrated on increasing supplies and weakening demand.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites.

The bid was put in by Justice Solutions International, the commercial arm of the MoJ set up by the last justice secretary, Chris Grayling.Saudi Arabia is Britain\u2019s largest arms market by far. It has sold 72 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to the country in a contract worth an estimated \u00a34.4bn, upgraded Saudi Tornado aircraft (part of the controversial \u00a340bn al-Yamamah contract signed by Margaret Thatcher) in a contract worth an estimated \u00a32.5bn, and upgraded 70 US F15 combat jets in the Saudi air force.The UK Ministry of Defence has gone out its way to help the Saudis by diverting 500 lb Paveway IV guided bombs originally earmarked for the RAF to Saudi Arabia to enable it to continue striking targets in Yemen and Syria. Paveway bombs are produced by Raytheon UK.British-made Tornado GR4 ground attack fighters and Typhoons have been playing a major role in Saudi bombing strikes on Yemen where it is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The soaring number of civilian casualties in the Saudi-led bombing campaign have provoked widespread criticism. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, said last month that 2,300 civilians had been killed so far. He said both sides in the conflict shared blame, but the Saudi-led air campaign was responsible for most of the deaths.In a report released on Wednesday, Amnesty International said the British government must urgently investigate whether weapons it supplied to the Saudi airforce had killed civilians.

Saudi Aramco is a highly secretive organisation but is likely to be valued at well over $1tn (\u00a3685bn). Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country.Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time.\u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said.Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers. Some question whether this strategy could change in the run-up to any Aramco IPO.He was happy for the Economist to depict his planned new policies as Thatcherite, saying he was \u201cmost certainly\u201d wanting to follow the free market economic path the former UK prime minster had pioneered.Western oil companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil may be very interested in an opportunity to buy into Saudi Aramco \u2013 even when their own balance sheets are being stretched by a collapsing crude values.But other state-owned petroleum groups, from China and elsewhere, would also be keen to take a stake in a company that controls more than 260bn barrels of reserves.Saudi Aramco produces all of Saudi\u2019s 10.25m barrels a day, which is more than double that of Exxon and Rosneft in Russia.The Saudi prince, who is also the defence minister, said it was right of his country to suspend diplomatic relations with fellow Opec member and regional power rival Iran, but played down any prospects of physical conflict.He said: \u201cA war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is the beginning of a major catastrophe in the region ... For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201dThe mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices. Middle East tension usually raises oil trader fears that production or transport could be hit.But in recent days the direction of travel for prices has only been downwards as sentiment concentrated on increasing supplies and weakening demand.

The beheading of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr triggered demonstrations and an arson attack at the Saudi embassy in Tehran.\u201cFollowing the signing of the interim nuclear deal in November 2013, Saudi Arabia began devoting its resources to defeating the deal, driven by fear that its contrived Iranophobia was crumbling,\u201d Zarif wrote in the American newspaper. \u201cToday, some in Riyadh not only continue to impede normalisation but are determined to drag the entire region into confrontation.\u201d Related: Rouhani races to implement nuclear deal with eye on Iran elections bounce The final nuclear deal between Iran, the US and other world powers was signed last July and could be implemented as soon as this month. In an unusually candid broadside, Zarif argued that Saudi Arabia fears a normalisation of relations between Iran and the west could leave it exposed.\u201cSaudi Arabia seems to fear that the removal of the smoke screen of the nuclear issue will expose the real global threat: its active sponsorship of violent extremism,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe barbarism is clear. At home, state executioners sever heads with swords, as in the recent execution of 47 prisoners in one day, including Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a respected religious scholar who devoted his life to promoting nonviolence and civil rights. Abroad, masked men sever heads with knives.\u201cThe Saudi strategy to derail the nuclear agreement and perpetuate \u2013 and even exacerbate \u2013 tension in the region has three components: pressuring the West; promoting regional instability through waging war in Yemen and sponsoring extremism; and directly provoking Iran.\u201dZarif added: \u201cLet us not forget that the perpetrators of many acts of terror \u2026 as well as nearly all members of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front, have been either Saudi nationals or brainwashed by petrodollar-financed demagogues who have promoted anti-Islamic messages of hatred and sectarianism for decades.\u201dOther Arab countries followed their Sunni ally in cutting or reducing diplomatic ties with predominantly Shia Iran. Officials in the US came under pressure to choose sides and found it awkward to go further than expressing \u201cconcern\u201d over the mass execution carried out by Saudi Arabia, a staunch regional ally.On the leader page of America\u2019s most prestigious newspaper, Zarif noted that Iran condemned the violence at the Saudi embassy on 2 January and an investigation is under way. \u201cWe took immediate measures to help restore order \u2026 We also took disciplinary action against those who failed to protect the embassy.\u201dSafar Ali Baratlou, a senior security official, and General Hassan Arabsorkhi, head of police special forces in Tehran, lost their jobs over the failure to stop the embassy ransacking, according to officials.Zarif also said Iran showed restraint after events such as last year\u2019s hajj in Saudi Arabia, where 464 Iranians were among more than 2,000 pilgrims killed in a stampede, and had not cut or reduced its diplomatic relations with the kingdom.\u201cWe have until now responded with restraint; but unilateral prudence is not sustainable,\u201d Zarif wrote. \u201cThis has fallen on deaf ears in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi leadership must now make a choice: They can continue supporting extremists and promoting sectarian hatred; or they can opt to play a constructive role in promoting regional stability.\u201dThe nuclear deal is set to be implement as soon as Iran meets all conditions, resulting in the lifting of some sanctions worth billions of dollars. But the White House is also considering imposing new and separate sanctions after Iran conducted two ballistic missiles tests in contravention of a UN security council resolution.Asked to comment on the Zarif\u2019s column, the Saudi embassy in Washington listed examples of what it called \u201cIran\u2019s negative policies and aggressive interferences\u201d.\u201cIt is clear from Minister Zarif\u2019s statements and those of the foreign ministry that they are out of the loop and out of touch with reality and the centers of power in Iran and are left to defend the reckless behavior of the regime\u201d, the embassy press office wrote in an email.Chris Coons, a US senator, said on Monday: \u201cWhen it comes to taking additional actions in response to the ballistic missile launches \u2013 absolutely, I think we should do so. I don\u2019t know why the administration has hesitated, but I am urging them publicly and privately to move ahead with those designations.\u201dCoons, a Democrat, discussed the nuclear deal with leaders and senior officials during a recent trip to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Austria. He added: \u201cBoth the Saudis and Turks were publicly supportive but privately expressed concerns about Iran\u2019s aggression in the region and support for disruptive elements.\u201dAmerica has to continue to \u201chold Iran\u2019s feet to the fire\u201d and maintain a \u201cvery healthy scepticism\u201d about its willingness to implement the deal, Coons said. He admitted that, even if implemented, he is not confident it will survive the next two years. \u201cIran continues to engage in bad behaviour like the ballistic missile launches, like support for regional terrorism groups that makes me very wary of any rapprochement or realliance with Iran.\u201cThere is huge anxiety in the region by our core allies about our future intentions and there is a lot of concern. There is a lot of misreading of what the agreement with Iran means. In my view, it does not mean that the United States has suddenly decided to return to a pre-1979 alignment where Iran is one of our principal allies in the region. Far from it.

No longer satisfied with terrorising large swaths of the Middle East, it is inspiring, recruiting, training and supplying terrorists to carry out murderous acts around the world. Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites.

He faces death by crucifixion after being convicted of joining an anti-government demonstration.Britain\u2019s Ministry of Justice, meanwhile, has bidded for a \u00a35.9m contract to provide prison expertise to the Saudis. The bid was put in by Justice Solutions International, the commercial arm of the MoJ set up by the last justice secretary, Chris Grayling.Saudi Arabia is Britain\u2019s largest arms market by far. It has sold 72 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to the country in a contract worth an estimated \u00a34.4bn, upgraded Saudi Tornado aircraft (part of the controversial \u00a340bn al-Yamamah contract signed by Margaret Thatcher) in a contract worth an estimated \u00a32.5bn, and upgraded 70 US F15 combat jets in the Saudi air force.The UK Ministry of Defence has gone out its way to help the Saudis by diverting 500 lb Paveway IV guided bombs originally earmarked for the RAF to Saudi Arabia to enable it to continue striking targets in Yemen and Syria. Paveway bombs are produced by Raytheon UK.British-made Tornado GR4 ground attack fighters and Typhoons have been playing a major role in Saudi bombing strikes on Yemen where it is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The soaring number of civilian casualties in the Saudi-led bombing campaign have provoked widespread criticism. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, said last month that 2,300 civilians had been killed so far. He said both sides in the conflict shared blame, but the Saudi-led air campaign was responsible for most of the deaths.In a report released on Wednesday, Amnesty International said the British government must urgently investigate whether weapons it supplied to the Saudi airforce had killed civilians.

Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country.Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time.\u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said.Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers. Some question whether this strategy could change in the run-up to any Aramco IPO.He was happy for the Economist to depict his planned new policies as Thatcherite, saying he was \u201cmost certainly\u201d wanting to follow the free market economic path the former UK prime minster had pioneered.Western oil companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil may be very interested in an opportunity to buy into Saudi Aramco \u2013 even when their own balance sheets are being stretched by a collapsing crude values.But other state-owned petroleum groups, from China and elsewhere, would also be keen to take a stake in a company that controls more than 260bn barrels of reserves.Saudi Aramco produces all of Saudi\u2019s 10.25m barrels a day, which is more than double that of Exxon and Rosneft in Russia.The Saudi prince, who is also the defence minister, said it was right of his country to suspend diplomatic relations with fellow Opec member and regional power rival Iran, but played down any prospects of physical conflict.He said: \u201cA war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is the beginning of a major catastrophe in the region ... For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201dThe mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices. Middle East tension usually raises oil trader fears that production or transport could be hit.But in recent days the direction of travel for prices has only been downwards as sentiment concentrated on increasing supplies and weakening demand.

The beheading of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr triggered demonstrations and an arson attack at the Saudi embassy in Tehran.\u201cFollowing the signing of the interim nuclear deal in November 2013, Saudi Arabia began devoting its resources to defeating the deal, driven by fear that its contrived Iranophobia was crumbling,\u201d Zarif wrote in the American newspaper. \u201cToday, some in Riyadh not only continue to impede normalisation but are determined to drag the entire region into confrontation.\u201d Related: Rouhani races to implement nuclear deal with eye on Iran elections bounce The final nuclear deal between Iran, the US and other world powers was signed last July and could be implemented as soon as this month. In an unusually candid broadside, Zarif argued that Saudi Arabia fears a normalisation of relations between Iran and the west could leave it exposed.\u201cSaudi Arabia seems to fear that the removal of the smoke screen of the nuclear issue will expose the real global threat: its active sponsorship of violent extremism,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe barbarism is clear. At home, state executioners sever heads with swords, as in the recent execution of 47 prisoners in one day, including Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a respected religious scholar who devoted his life to promoting nonviolence and civil rights. Abroad, masked men sever heads with knives.\u201cThe Saudi strategy to derail the nuclear agreement and perpetuate \u2013 and even exacerbate \u2013 tension in the region has three components: pressuring the West; promoting regional instability through waging war in Yemen and sponsoring extremism; and directly provoking Iran.\u201dZarif added: \u201cLet us not forget that the perpetrators of many acts of terror \u2026 as well as nearly all members of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front, have been either Saudi nationals or brainwashed by petrodollar-financed demagogues who have promoted anti-Islamic messages of hatred and sectarianism for decades.\u201dOther Arab countries followed their Sunni ally in cutting or reducing diplomatic ties with predominantly Shia Iran. Officials in the US came under pressure to choose sides and found it awkward to go further than expressing \u201cconcern\u201d over the mass execution carried out by Saudi Arabia, a staunch regional ally.On the leader page of America\u2019s most prestigious newspaper, Zarif noted that Iran condemned the violence at the Saudi embassy on 2 January and an investigation is under way. \u201cWe took immediate measures to help restore order \u2026 We also took disciplinary action against those who failed to protect the embassy.\u201dSafar Ali Baratlou, a senior security official, and General Hassan Arabsorkhi, head of police special forces in Tehran, lost their jobs over the failure to stop the embassy ransacking, according to officials.Zarif also said Iran showed restraint after events such as last year\u2019s hajj in Saudi Arabia, where 464 Iranians were among more than 2,000 pilgrims killed in a stampede, and had not cut or reduced its diplomatic relations with the kingdom.\u201cWe have until now responded with restraint; but unilateral prudence is not sustainable,\u201d Zarif wrote. \u201cThis has fallen on deaf ears in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi leadership must now make a choice: They can continue supporting extremists and promoting sectarian hatred; or they can opt to play a constructive role in promoting regional stability.\u201dThe nuclear deal is set to be implement as soon as Iran meets all conditions, resulting in the lifting of some sanctions worth billions of dollars. But the White House is also considering imposing new and separate sanctions after Iran conducted two ballistic missiles tests in contravention of a UN security council resolution.Asked to comment on the Zarif\u2019s column, the Saudi embassy in Washington listed examples of what it called \u201cIran\u2019s negative policies and aggressive interferences\u201d.\u201cIt is clear from Minister Zarif\u2019s statements and those of the foreign ministry that they are out of the loop and out of touch with reality and the centers of power in Iran and are left to defend the reckless behavior of the regime\u201d, the embassy press office wrote in an email.Chris Coons, a US senator, said on Monday: \u201cWhen it comes to taking additional actions in response to the ballistic missile launches \u2013 absolutely, I think we should do so. I don\u2019t know why the administration has hesitated, but I am urging them publicly and privately to move ahead with those designations.\u201dCoons, a Democrat, discussed the nuclear deal with leaders and senior officials during a recent trip to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Austria. He added: \u201cBoth the Saudis and Turks were publicly supportive but privately expressed concerns about Iran\u2019s aggression in the region and support for disruptive elements.\u201dAmerica has to continue to \u201chold Iran\u2019s feet to the fire\u201d and maintain a \u201cvery healthy scepticism\u201d about its willingness to implement the deal, Coons said. He admitted that, even if implemented, he is not confident it will survive the next two years. \u201cIran continues to engage in bad behaviour like the ballistic missile launches, like support for regional terrorism groups that makes me very wary of any rapprochement or realliance with Iran.\u201cThere is huge anxiety in the region by our core allies about our future intentions and there is a lot of concern. There is a lot of misreading of what the agreement with Iran means. In my view, it does not mean that the United States has suddenly decided to return to a pre-1979 alignment where Iran is one of our principal allies in the region. Far from it.

But it is irresponsible and dangerous to imply a general sameness between the two countries. Saudi Arabia has exported around the world an intolerant and violent ideology that inspires Islamic State and all similar groups. By contrast, the cultural export for which Iran is most well-known in the west is its thriving and poetic cinema. Iran has a long way to go at home and abroad, but let\u2019s keep things in perspective. Saudi Arabia is an ally of the west and the west\u00a0keeps closing its eyes and ears, selling it lethal\u00a0arms and denying the central role\u00a0this country plays in jihadi violence\u00a0in the name of Islam.Niloofar HaeriBaltimore, Maryland, USA\u2022 There is no reason for MPs to wait for\u00a0the formation of a committee to scrutinise arms exports (Report, 4 January). The foreign secretary told the\u00a0BBC on 11 November that we would stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis were found to have breached international law. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has said that they did just that by carrying out airstrikes on hospitals in Yemen in October and again\u00a0in December. Any MP who is interested can put down a question to the foreign secretary.Oliver MilesOxford\u2022 In his thoughtful commentary, Brian Whitaker (5 January) correctly highlights how Wahhabi Islam espoused by the Saudi kingdom since its inception in 1932 has had unimaginable repercussions. He omitted that Britain partly sired this savagery by plumping for the Sauds, instead of the Hashemites, whose legitimate legacy was diverted to Transjordan. Whitaker\u2019s chronology, however, is incorrect on the rise of Pakistani extremism, for it was Tehran that fomented sectarian agitation, especially in Karachi, forcing the hand of an insecure Zia-ul-Haq to encourage Sunni militancy to deflect attention from his discredited authority. The Saudi Shia are no worse off than Iranian Sunnis: Tehran, since the 1979 revolution, remains the largest metropolis in west Asia and the only Islamic capital without a Sunni mosque.Saeed Kamali Dehghan pointed out the plight of Iranian Sunnis who could not offer Eid prayers (31 August 2011). The Saudis will have to ride this out in the coming weeks, because the 40th day of bereavement is a high point of remembrance in Shia theology and martyrology. Tehran will assuredly note that the executed cleric\u2019s date falls on 11 February, the anniversary of the Islamic revolution, and will determinedly exploit it to the hilt.Burzine WaghmarLondon\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Saudi Arabia", "Middle East and North Africa", "Iran", "Pakistan", "Islamic State", "United Nations", "Arms trade"], "title": "Saudi Arabia exports intolerant ideology, Iran its cinema | Letters"},{"date": "2015-12-22T10:32:55Z", "content": "As the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino show, Islamic State has achieved a global reach. No longer satisfied with terrorising large swaths of the Middle East, it is inspiring, recruiting, training and supplying terrorists to carry out murderous acts around the world. Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world. Only a coalition led by Saudi Arabia can genuinely defeat Isis while also delegitimising the group in the eyes of the wider Muslim world. If the nations of the world hope to completely defeat Isis, they should stop falsely accusing the Saudis of creating the group and instead join them in defeating it.\u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2015 and again on 24 December 2015 to clarify Nawaf Obaid\u2019s role as a former communications adviser to the Saudi government.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites. The country\u2019s parliament has failed to elect a president, by law a Christian Maronite, more than 30 times, in sessions that often faileven to achieve quorum.The country\u2019s political dysfunction descended into farce last summer, when the government failed to negotiate a deal over new landfills, leaving rubbish piling up in the streets of Beirut, and prompting demonstrations protesting official corruption.", "tags": ["Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran", "Saudi Arabia"], "title": "Advantage Iran in Lebanese political proxy battle with Saudi Arabia"},{"date": "2015-10-07T10:46:13Z", "content": "The Guardian reported last week how leaked documents revealed that Britain conducted secret vote-trading deals with Saudi Arabia to ensure both states were elected to the UN human rights council (UNHRC).The elevation of the Saudi kingdom to one of the UN\u2019s most influential bodies in 2013 prompted fresh international criticism of its human rights record, the Guardian noted.A year earlier, 2012, a Shia activist, Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, then aged 17, was arrested.

The bid was put in by Justice Solutions International, the commercial arm of the MoJ set up by the last justice secretary, Chris Grayling.Saudi Arabia is Britain\u2019s largest arms market by far. It has sold 72 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to the country in a contract worth an estimated \u00a34.4bn, upgraded Saudi Tornado aircraft (part of the controversial \u00a340bn al-Yamamah contract signed by Margaret Thatcher) in a contract worth an estimated \u00a32.5bn, and upgraded 70 US F15 combat jets in the Saudi air force.The UK Ministry of Defence has gone out its way to help the Saudis by diverting 500 lb Paveway IV guided bombs originally earmarked for the RAF to Saudi Arabia to enable it to continue striking targets in Yemen and Syria. Paveway bombs are produced by Raytheon UK.British-made Tornado GR4 ground attack fighters and Typhoons have been playing a major role in Saudi bombing strikes on Yemen where it is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The soaring number of civilian casualties in the Saudi-led bombing campaign have provoked widespread criticism. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, said last month that 2,300 civilians had been killed so far. He said both sides in the conflict shared blame, but the Saudi-led air campaign was responsible for most of the deaths.In a report released on Wednesday, Amnesty International said the British government must urgently investigate whether weapons it supplied to the Saudi airforce had killed civilians.

Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country.Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time.\u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said.Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers.

For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201dThe mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices. Middle East tension usually raises oil trader fears that production or transport could be hit.But in recent days the direction of travel for prices has only been downwards as sentiment concentrated on increasing supplies and weakening demand.

The beheading of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr triggered demonstrations and an arson attack at the Saudi embassy in Tehran.\u201cFollowing the signing of the interim nuclear deal in November 2013, Saudi Arabia began devoting its resources to defeating the deal, driven by fear that its contrived Iranophobia was crumbling,\u201d Zarif wrote in the American newspaper. \u201cToday, some in Riyadh not only continue to impede normalisation but are determined to drag the entire region into confrontation.\u201d Related: Rouhani races to implement nuclear deal with eye on Iran elections bounce The final nuclear deal between Iran, the US and other world powers was signed last July and could be implemented as soon as this month. In an unusually candid broadside, Zarif argued that Saudi Arabia fears a normalisation of relations between Iran and the west could leave it exposed.\u201cSaudi Arabia seems to fear that the removal of the smoke screen of the nuclear issue will expose the real global threat: its active sponsorship of violent extremism,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe barbarism is clear. At home, state executioners sever heads with swords, as in the recent execution of 47 prisoners in one day, including Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a respected religious scholar who devoted his life to promoting nonviolence and civil rights. Abroad, masked men sever heads with knives.\u201cThe Saudi strategy to derail the nuclear agreement and perpetuate \u2013 and even exacerbate \u2013 tension in the region has three components: pressuring the West; promoting regional instability through waging war in Yemen and sponsoring extremism; and directly provoking Iran.\u201dZarif added: \u201cLet us not forget that the perpetrators of many acts of terror \u2026 as well as nearly all members of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front, have been either Saudi nationals or brainwashed by petrodollar-financed demagogues who have promoted anti-Islamic messages of hatred and sectarianism for decades.\u201dOther Arab countries followed their Sunni ally in cutting or reducing diplomatic ties with predominantly Shia Iran. Officials in the US came under pressure to choose sides and found it awkward to go further than expressing \u201cconcern\u201d over the mass execution carried out by Saudi Arabia, a staunch regional ally.On the leader page of America\u2019s most prestigious newspaper, Zarif noted that Iran condemned the violence at the Saudi embassy on 2 January and an investigation is under way. \u201cWe took immediate measures to help restore order \u2026 We also took disciplinary action against those who failed to protect the embassy.\u201dSafar Ali Baratlou, a senior security official, and General Hassan Arabsorkhi, head of police special forces in Tehran, lost their jobs over the failure to stop the embassy ransacking, according to officials.Zarif also said Iran showed restraint after events such as last year\u2019s hajj in Saudi Arabia, where 464 Iranians were among more than 2,000 pilgrims killed in a stampede, and had not cut or reduced its diplomatic relations with the kingdom.\u201cWe have until now responded with restraint; but unilateral prudence is not sustainable,\u201d Zarif wrote. \u201cThis has fallen on deaf ears in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi leadership must now make a choice: They can continue supporting extremists and promoting sectarian hatred; or they can opt to play a constructive role in promoting regional stability.\u201dThe nuclear deal is set to be implement as soon as Iran meets all conditions, resulting in the lifting of some sanctions worth billions of dollars. But the White House is also considering imposing new and separate sanctions after Iran conducted two ballistic missiles tests in contravention of a UN security council resolution.Asked to comment on the Zarif\u2019s column, the Saudi embassy in Washington listed examples of what it called \u201cIran\u2019s negative policies and aggressive interferences\u201d.\u201cIt is clear from Minister Zarif\u2019s statements and those of the foreign ministry that they are out of the loop and out of touch with reality and the centers of power in Iran and are left to defend the reckless behavior of the regime\u201d, the embassy press office wrote in an email.Chris Coons, a US senator, said on Monday: \u201cWhen it comes to taking additional actions in response to the ballistic missile launches \u2013 absolutely, I think we should do so. I don\u2019t know why the administration has hesitated, but I am urging them publicly and privately to move ahead with those designations.\u201dCoons, a Democrat, discussed the nuclear deal with leaders and senior officials during a recent trip to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Austria.

He admitted that, even if implemented, he is not confident it will survive the next two years. \u201cIran continues to engage in bad behaviour like the ballistic missile launches, like support for regional terrorism groups that makes me very wary of any rapprochement or realliance with Iran.\u201cThere is huge anxiety in the region by our core allies about our future intentions and there is a lot of concern. There is a lot of misreading of what the agreement with Iran means. In my view, it does not mean that the United States has suddenly decided to return to a pre-1979 alignment where Iran is one of our principal allies in the region. Far from it.

But it is irresponsible and dangerous to imply a general sameness between the two countries. Saudi Arabia has exported around the world an intolerant and violent ideology that inspires Islamic State and all similar groups. By contrast, the cultural export for which Iran is most well-known in the west is its thriving and poetic cinema.

The foreign secretary told the\u00a0BBC on 11 November that we would stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis were found to have breached international law. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has said that they did just that by carrying out airstrikes on hospitals in Yemen in October and again\u00a0in December. Any MP who is interested can put down a question to the foreign secretary.Oliver MilesOxford\u2022 In his thoughtful commentary, Brian Whitaker (5 January) correctly highlights how Wahhabi Islam espoused by the Saudi kingdom since its inception in 1932 has had unimaginable repercussions. He omitted that Britain partly sired this savagery by plumping for the Sauds, instead of the Hashemites, whose legitimate legacy was diverted to Transjordan. Whitaker\u2019s chronology, however, is incorrect on the rise of Pakistani extremism, for it was Tehran that fomented sectarian agitation, especially in Karachi, forcing the hand of an insecure Zia-ul-Haq to encourage Sunni militancy to deflect attention from his discredited authority. The Saudi Shia are no worse off than Iranian Sunnis: Tehran, since the 1979 revolution, remains the largest metropolis in west Asia and the only Islamic capital without a Sunni mosque.Saeed Kamali Dehghan pointed out the plight of Iranian Sunnis who could not offer Eid prayers (31 August 2011). The Saudis will have to ride this out in the coming weeks, because the 40th day of bereavement is a high point of remembrance in Shia theology and martyrology.

No longer satisfied with terrorising large swaths of the Middle East, it is inspiring, recruiting, training and supplying terrorists to carry out murderous acts around the world. Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world. Only a coalition led by Saudi Arabia can genuinely defeat Isis while also delegitimising the group in the eyes of the wider Muslim world. If the nations of the world hope to completely defeat Isis, they should stop falsely accusing the Saudis of creating the group and instead join them in defeating it.\u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2015 and again on 24 December 2015 to clarify Nawaf Obaid\u2019s role as a former communications adviser to the Saudi government.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites.

The bid was put in by Justice Solutions International, the commercial arm of the MoJ set up by the last justice secretary, Chris Grayling.Saudi Arabia is Britain\u2019s largest arms market by far. It has sold 72 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to the country in a contract worth an estimated \u00a34.4bn, upgraded Saudi Tornado aircraft (part of the controversial \u00a340bn al-Yamamah contract signed by Margaret Thatcher) in a contract worth an estimated \u00a32.5bn, and upgraded 70 US F15 combat jets in the Saudi air force.The UK Ministry of Defence has gone out its way to help the Saudis by diverting 500 lb Paveway IV guided bombs originally earmarked for the RAF to Saudi Arabia to enable it to continue striking targets in Yemen and Syria. Paveway bombs are produced by Raytheon UK.British-made Tornado GR4 ground attack fighters and Typhoons have been playing a major role in Saudi bombing strikes on Yemen where it is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The soaring number of civilian casualties in the Saudi-led bombing campaign have provoked widespread criticism. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, said last month that 2,300 civilians had been killed so far. He said both sides in the conflict shared blame, but the Saudi-led air campaign was responsible for most of the deaths.In a report released on Wednesday, Amnesty International said the British government must urgently investigate whether weapons it supplied to the Saudi airforce had killed civilians.

The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world.

Officials in the US came under pressure to choose sides and found it awkward to go further than expressing \u201cconcern\u201d over the mass execution carried out by Saudi Arabia, a staunch regional ally.On the leader page of America\u2019s most prestigious newspaper, Zarif noted that Iran condemned the violence at the Saudi embassy on 2 January and an investigation is under way. \u201cWe took immediate measures to help restore order \u2026 We also took disciplinary action against those who failed to protect the embassy.\u201dSafar Ali Baratlou, a senior security official, and General Hassan Arabsorkhi, head of police special forces in Tehran, lost their jobs over the failure to stop the embassy ransacking, according to officials.Zarif also said Iran showed restraint after events such as last year\u2019s hajj in Saudi Arabia, where 464 Iranians were among more than 2,000 pilgrims killed in a stampede, and had not cut or reduced its diplomatic relations with the kingdom.\u201cWe have until now responded with restraint; but unilateral prudence is not sustainable,\u201d Zarif wrote. \u201cThis has fallen on deaf ears in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi leadership must now make a choice: They can continue supporting extremists and promoting sectarian hatred; or they can opt to play a constructive role in promoting regional stability.\u201dThe nuclear deal is set to be implement as soon as Iran meets all conditions, resulting in the lifting of some sanctions worth billions of dollars. But the White House is also considering imposing new and separate sanctions after Iran conducted two ballistic missiles tests in contravention of a UN security council resolution.Asked to comment on the Zarif\u2019s column, the Saudi embassy in Washington listed examples of what it called \u201cIran\u2019s negative policies and aggressive interferences\u201d.\u201cIt is clear from Minister Zarif\u2019s statements and those of the foreign ministry that they are out of the loop and out of touch with reality and the centers of power in Iran and are left to defend the reckless behavior of the regime\u201d, the embassy press office wrote in an email.Chris Coons, a US senator, said on Monday: \u201cWhen it comes to taking additional actions in response to the ballistic missile launches \u2013 absolutely, I think we should do so. I don\u2019t know why the administration has hesitated, but I am urging them publicly and privately to move ahead with those designations.\u201dCoons, a Democrat, discussed the nuclear deal with leaders and senior officials during a recent trip to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Austria. He added: \u201cBoth the Saudis and Turks were publicly supportive but privately expressed concerns about Iran\u2019s aggression in the region and support for disruptive elements.\u201dAmerica has to continue to \u201chold Iran\u2019s feet to the fire\u201d and maintain a \u201cvery healthy scepticism\u201d about its willingness to implement the deal, Coons said. He admitted that, even if implemented, he is not confident it will survive the next two years. \u201cIran continues to engage in bad behaviour like the ballistic missile launches, like support for regional terrorism groups that makes me very wary of any rapprochement or realliance with Iran.\u201cThere is huge anxiety in the region by our core allies about our future intentions and there is a lot of concern. There is a lot of misreading of what the agreement with Iran means. In my view, it does not mean that the United States has suddenly decided to return to a pre-1979 alignment where Iran is one of our principal allies in the region. Far from it. It was the least bad option for how to constrain Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons programme, but our alliances with Saudi Arabia and with Israel remain central.\u201d", "tags": ["Iran", "Saudi Arabia", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran's nuclear programme", "New York Times"], "title": "Iran foreign minister accuses Saudi Arabia of 'hatred and sectarianism'"},{"date": "2016-01-06T19:05:21Z", "content": "There may, as you suggest in your editorial (3 January), be little to choose between Iran and Saudi Arabia in certain important respects. But it is irresponsible and dangerous to imply a general sameness between the two countries. Saudi Arabia has exported around the world an intolerant and violent ideology that inspires Islamic State and all similar groups. By contrast, the cultural export for which Iran is most well-known in the west is its thriving and poetic cinema. Iran has a long way to go at home and abroad, but let\u2019s keep things in perspective. Saudi Arabia is an ally of the west and the west\u00a0keeps closing its eyes and ears, selling it lethal\u00a0arms and denying the central role\u00a0this country plays in jihadi violence\u00a0in the name of Islam.Niloofar HaeriBaltimore, Maryland, USA\u2022 There is no reason for MPs to wait for\u00a0the formation of a committee to scrutinise arms exports (Report, 4 January). The foreign secretary told the\u00a0BBC on 11 November that we would stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis were found to have breached international law. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has said that they did just that by carrying out airstrikes on hospitals in Yemen in October and again\u00a0in December. Any MP who is interested can put down a question to the foreign secretary.Oliver MilesOxford\u2022 In his thoughtful commentary, Brian Whitaker (5 January) correctly highlights how Wahhabi Islam espoused by the Saudi kingdom since its inception in 1932 has had unimaginable repercussions. He omitted that Britain partly sired this savagery by plumping for the Sauds, instead of the Hashemites, whose legitimate legacy was diverted to Transjordan. Whitaker\u2019s chronology, however, is incorrect on the rise of Pakistani extremism, for it was Tehran that fomented sectarian agitation, especially in Karachi, forcing the hand of an insecure Zia-ul-Haq to encourage Sunni militancy to deflect attention from his discredited authority. The Saudi Shia are no worse off than Iranian Sunnis: Tehran, since the 1979 revolution, remains the largest metropolis in west Asia and the only Islamic capital without a Sunni mosque.Saeed Kamali Dehghan pointed out the plight of Iranian Sunnis who could not offer Eid prayers (31 August 2011). The Saudis will have to ride this out in the coming weeks, because the 40th day of bereavement is a high point of remembrance in Shia theology and martyrology. Tehran will assuredly note that the executed cleric\u2019s date falls on 11 February, the anniversary of the Islamic revolution, and will determinedly exploit it to the hilt.Burzine WaghmarLondon\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Saudi Arabia", "Middle East and North Africa", "Iran", "Pakistan", "Islamic State", "United Nations", "Arms trade"], "title": "Saudi Arabia exports intolerant ideology, Iran its cinema | Letters"},{"date": "2016-01-04T14:36:33Z", "content": "On Saturday Saudi Arabia executed 47 people, including the Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. The move prompted outrage in predominantly Shia Iran. The ensuing war of words and protests resulted in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Sudan cutting diplomatic ties with Tehran.  Related: Saudi Arabia cuts diplomatic ties with Iran after execution of cleric According to data collected by Amnesty International, at least 151 people were executed in Saudi Arabia between January and November 2015, while Human Rights Watch recorded 158in total during the year.The figures mark the highest number of recorded executions in one year since 1995, when 192 people were killed. It also marks a 67% increase on the 90 in 2014. Saudi Arabia does not release its own figures on the number of people it executes.Despite its protestations against the execution of Nimr, Iran is the only country in the Middle East and North Africa that carries out more executions than Saudi Arabia each year \u2013 globally, it is second only to China.Iranian statistics reported 289 executions in 2014 (278 men and 11 women), but Amnesty International says reliable sources put the figure far higher. It claims that at least 743 executions were carried out in 2014.It is worth noting, however, that Iran\u2019s population of almost 80 million is more than twice that of Saudi Arabia. Of the executions publicly recognised by Iranian authorities, 122 (42%) were people convicted of drug offences.Iran\u2019s figures for 2015 are set to be even larger. Between January and 1 November last year Amnesty recorded 830 executions, with the majority being related to narcotics. Similarly, nearly half of 2015 executions in Saudi Arabia were drug-related. However, the 47 executed in Saudi Arabia last Saturday were convicted of alleged terrorism-related offences. According to Amnesty, the methods of execution used in Saudi Arabia in 2014 were beheading and via firing squad, while in Iran those sentenced to death are hanged.

But the familiar act, now considered merely hooliganism, is coming back to bite the hands of the very people who endorsed it in the first place. In the latest episode, thanks to Iranian hardliners who set ablaze the Saudi embassy in Tehran and attacked its consular offices in the eastern city of Mashhad, the focus is now being shifted from the Saudi execution of 47 people in a single day to an ensuing diplomatic crisis involving Tehran. This was the moment when Iran could have argued that Saudis were to blame for the growing sectarianism in the region, but instead it scored an own goal.The focus is now less on the execution of the Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a serious critic of the Saudi monarchy, than it is on Saudi Arabia and its allies severing diplomatic ties with Tehran. Whether more countries will follow suit remains to be seen.Attacking a foreign diplomatic mission has a precedent in Iran. After the 1979 Islamic revolution, students \u2013 angry about US support for the despotic Shah \u2013 stormed the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days, sparking a crisis whose reverberations are still heard today. In 2011, another group attacked the British embassy in Tehran, ransacking offices and diplomatic residences, which resulted in Britain expelling all Iranian diplomats from London.  Related: From hostage crisis to nuclear deal: prisoner and captor look back at the Iran-US cold war Although the hostage crisis was originally started by revolutionary students without official consent, it was soon endorsed by the then supreme leader, Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini, who praised the perpetrators and labelled the embassy \u201ca den of spies\u201d. That incident has been a national day in the Persian calendar for more than three decades, celebrated annually to keep its memory alive. In 2011, however, when a mob attacked the British embassy in Tehran, Iran\u2019s current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, took the unusual step of criticising it and saying that it was not right for the students to carry out the attack, even though, he said, their sentiments were justified.As the Islamic republic tries to reintegrate itself into the international community, it finds itself hampered by the \u201cdeath to this, death to that\u201d chants at Friday prayers and the burning of enemies\u2019 flags, which have become familiar pictures that unfairly dominate the world\u2019s view of Iran. Iranian hardliners have refrained from setting fire to the Saudi flag because of the script written on it, which is an Islamic creed or Shahada, in praise of the prophet Muhammad. Since the storming of the Saudi embassy at the weekend, Iranian officials have gone to great lengths to distance themselves from the attack. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, whose administration is highly embarrassed by such attacks, strongly condemned it as \u201ctotally unjustifiable\u201d, ordering the police to identify and arrest the perpetrators.  \u201cThe actions last night by a group of radicals in Tehran and Mashhad leading to damage at the Saudi embassy and consulate are totally unjustifiable, as the buildings should be legally and religiously protected in the Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d the Iranian president was quoted as saying, according to AFP. \u201cI call on the interior minister to identify the perpetrators of this attack with firm determination and introduce them to the judiciary \u2026 so that there will be an end to such appalling actions once and for all.\u201dBut as the Persian proverb says, the antidote has come too late.

Generally NGOs are afraid to speak out about the situation because many of them have had their access restricted, especially in Darfur,\u201d explained Khairunissa Dhala, a researcher for Amnesty International.\u201cThere is a practice of repression. The government and security services regularly detain, arrest, torture and ill treat activists and others.\u201dIn Amman, the UNHCR confirmed that the majority of the deportees were from Darfur, a region that has witnesses brutal fighting between rebels and Sudanese government forces.Civil war broke out in Sudan in 2003, when rebel groups from Darfur began fighting the state, accusing them of marginalization.The government and its associated militias responded with brutality, and in the years since hundreds of thousands have been killed and 2.5 million displaced, according to the UN.The UNHCR also said the majority of deportees had registered refugee or asylum seeker status, making their forced repatriation a violation of the principle of non-refoulement \u2013 a central concept in international humanitarian law forbidding the returning of people to places where their lives or freedom will be endangered.

Related: Amnesty: delay in Qatar labour reforms is \u2018recipe for human rights disaster\u2019 It is hard to overemphasise the extent to which the corrupted, chaotic and controversial dual bidding race for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups both epitomised all that was wrong with the bloated beast Fifa had become and sowed the seeds for the slow-motion collapse that played out over the next five years. Chasing one last big payday, the biggest beasts in the Fifa jungle finally over-reached themselves.Even as bidding teams trooped home dejectedly, leaving behind piles of pointless, unread bid books, there were dark rumours of secret meetings in the five star hotels in the hills above Zurich, of trade pacts and done deals.Yet scanning the press the day after the decision, it is striking just how much space is devoted to the naive outrage of the England bid team who had just squandered \u00a321m \u2013 \u201cThey looked us in the eye and lied!\u201d \u2013 and how little to the jaw-dropping decision to take the World Cup to Qatar.That would all change. First came confirmation of the sheer scale of the machine that secured Qatar\u2019s victory \u2013 the millions lavished upon ambassadors like Zinedine Zidane and Pep Guardiola, the high-level trade talks, the low-level land deals, the network of Aspire Academies, the construction contracts.Then came the rumours, hotly denied, of bribery and corruption. Then the focus on the extreme heat in which the tournament was scheduled to be played and the machinations over moving the tournament to December. Finally, shamefully, the outrage and pressure over the hundreds of migrant workers dying in the desert to build the infrastructure to host a World Cup.It was the vote for Qatar that emboldened Mohamed bin Hammam, the Qatari Fifa executive committee member who helped deliver victory, to launch a tilt at Blatter\u2019s presidency after being frustrated by the incumbent\u2019s failure to keep his promise to step aside in 2011.Blatter, by then used to thinking two or three steps ahead and using the machinery of the Fifa presidential office to extinguish threats to his power, moved to see off Bin Hammam.Chuck Blazer, the American exco member who we now know would shortly turn FBI informant after being pursued by tax authorities over huge debts relating to the sums he had extracted from TV and marketing deals, turned on his Concacaf colleague Jack Warner and brought down the Qatari. But in the process, he would eventually spark an existential crisis for Fifa.The FBI indictment laid bare the extent to which two generations of football officials in the US and South America skimmed up to $150m from marketing and television deals over 25 years in what amounted to a \u201cWorld Cup of fraud\u201d. In the fallout, practically every presidential race and World Cup bidding scramble during that period has come under scrutiny.Qatar\u2019s triumph was also a victory for Michel Platini, who helped orchestrate its success and was open about his own vote, and a boost to his own clout within the Tudor star chamber of Fifa\u2019s executive committee.Less than a month later, he was to be found holding court with reporters at Uefa\u2019s lakeside HQ, pondering whether the tournament should be moved to winter and shared with the rest of the Gulf.And three months later still, before Uefa\u2019s congress in Paris, an emboldened Platini would agree the fateful deal with Blatter that would see him claim the \u00a31.3m he believed he was owed under the terms of an earlier agreement and sow the seeds of their potential mutual demise.And as the US delegation, including Bill Clinton, trooped home in disappointment their sense of burning injustice also played into the establishment support for an FBI investigation that would follow in short order and ultimately led to the dramatic arrests in the very same Baur au Lac hotel where bid teams had frantically, pointlessly tried to woo voters on the night before the vote.Frank Lowy, the chairman of Football Federation Australia, was furious at Australia\u2019s single vote garnered following a campaign that cost AUS$46m (\u00a322.3m) of public money, and would spend much of the next few years furiously instructing private investigators.And the vote would also signal a turning point in public perception, in which a shrug of the shoulders started to be replaced by anger. Even those of us who agree that there is a compelling case for a World Cup in the Middle East are equally convinced this was the wrong way to get there.There are just as many question marks over Russia\u2019s victory \u2013 the rented computers, later destroyed, that were dismissively offered up to investigator Michael Garcia to answer allegations of impropriety as exhibit A \u2013 but it was the fateful decision to strike out for Qatar that sent things spinning out of control.Perhaps Blatter, who insists he voted for the USA, knew it and that is why he wears a grimace more than a grin as he opens Qatar\u2019s envelope.He now says there was broad agreement between Fifa\u2019s senior powerbrokers to take the World Cup to Russia then the USA, but that Platini upset their plans. Almost immediately, Blatter was on a private plane to visit the Emir to try and smooth things over. But he knew it was a decision that would come back to bite him and Fifa.Before 2 December 2010, much of the evidence against Fifa\u2019s mafia-like structure was hiding in plain sight thanks to the diligence of a handful of investigative journalists and the odd chink of light such as the $100m ISL bribery affair. But the omert\u00e0 stayed strong.Such were the forces unleashed by the ill starred dual bidding race that it would not hold another five years, as the once all-powerful masters of Fifa\u2019s universe were targeted from without, as an emboldened FBI set about its work, and within, as they began to bring one another crashing down.Now Blatter and Platini stand on the brink of lifetime bans and the majority of those 22 voters who made the decision are either disgraced, deposed or dead. Fifa\u2019s downfall is complete, and the diligent administrators who work there must hope that something new can emerge from the burning wreckage.And yet scanning the list of candidates to replace Blatter at February\u2019s special congress \u2013 to be discussed at Wednesday\u2019s executive committee meeting along with the two upcoming World Cups and reform plans put forward by a committee populated by its own executives \u2013 it is hard to be too optimistic about what comes next.", "tags": ["Fifa", "Sepp Blatter", "Mohamed bin Hammam", "Michel Platini", "World Cup 2018", "World Cup 2022", "Jack Warner", "Football politics", "Football"], "title": "Five years after Fifa\u2019s World Cup gift to Qatar that set a timebomb ticking | Owen Gibson"},{"date": "2015-08-10T12:12:53Z", "content": "A Jewish activist group dedicated to the controversial project of building a Third Temple in Jerusalem has launched a crowdfunding appeal to scientifically breed the \u201cperfect red heifer\u201d.The creation of a Third Temple as a permanent house in which God will reside was prophesied by Ezekiel, and most orthodox Jewish authorities regard it as something that will be a miraculous event. A minority, however, believe that humans can build the temple.An obstacle for the latter group is the belief that because the world is impure, individuals wishing to ascend to the Temple must be cleansed with water mixed with the ashes of a pure red heifer that has been ritually sacrificed.For decades Jews subscribing to this belief have been engaged in a painstaking and unsuccessful search for the miraculous red cow, known in Hebrew as the para aduma. The most recent candidate was suggested and discounted last year.Now, however, the Jerusalem-based Temple Institute has announced it plans to breed its own red heifer using surrogacy techniques.The plans have sparked friction with local Israeli agricultural authorities and US-based investors in a business that imports red angus embryos to raise for meat, after the activists appeared to have attached themselves to the import business.The institute hopes to raise $125,000 (\u00a380,000) for the red heifer project to pay for embryo implantation, care and identification of candidates to breed the perfect red heifer in Israel.The Temple Institute was founded in 1987 by Rabbi Yisrael Ariel and has recreated artefacts for rituals required in a new temple of which the red heifer would be the most ambitious.Controversially it has been active in encouraging its supporters to visit the Temple Mount, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, causing friction at the site.

First, either the two-state solution will also take place within Jerusalem, or there will be no two-state solution at all. Second, any attempt to reach a permanent status agreement regarding Jerusalem that ignores the already existing, deeply rooted urban realities of this bi-national and divided city is doomed to failure.These truths were on display on 22 October 2013, when Jerusalem held mayoral elections. The incumbent mayor, Nir Barkat, an up-and-coming political star in Israel's ideological right, was re-elected. His victory was convincing: Barkat received 51.9% of the vote, in comparison with the 44.6% received by his closest rival.Barkat, along with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is a vocal champion of \"Jerusalem-the-eternal-capital-of-Israel-that-will-never-be-divided\". Conceding that there have long been major inequities in the level of services between East and West Jerusalem, Barkat proudly claims to have made progress in narrowing the gaps, asserting that his efforts have met with satisfaction from Palestinian residents. Citing this accomplishment, Barkat claims to represent all residents of his city, both Israeli and Palestinian, and has said: \"The vast majority of the Arabs in Jerusalem prefer to be on the Israeli side. They don't want the city divided.\"At first glance, the 2013 municipal election results appear to support such claims. The number of votes Barkat received from the Palestinian sector in this election was 90% higher than what he received in 2008, winning him 46.9% of votes cast by Palestinians of East Jerusalem. Receiving a percentage of the vote slightly below that which he received from the Israeli sector, Barkat was well ahead of his closest rival, who received only 19.7% of the Palestinian vote.A more careful look at the numbers, however, tells a very different story. There are approximately 157,382 eligible voters among the Palestinians of East Jerusalem. Of these, a total of 1,101 voted in the 2013 election \u2013 meaning a Palestinian voter turnout of only 0.7%. Barkat received 46.9% of these votes \u2013 a total of 516 votes, a mere 0.3% of the total vote of all eligible Palestinian voters. In short, Barkat's assertion that he \"represents\" all residents of Jerusalem is without basis in fact.Some will argue that Palestinian residents of Jerusalem were intimidated into boycotting the election. This assertion is baseless. All organs of Palestinian authority and political organising in East Jerusalem have been crushed by the government of Israel. There is simply no Palestinian capacity in East Jerusalem to organise a campaign of intimidation, or of anything else of consequence. The Palestinians didn't vote in this election, just as they have refrained from voting in previous municipal elections, because they were making a statement about their own identities: \"we are Palestinian, not Israeli\".The results in Israel's national elections for the Knesset, which took place on 22 January last year, are no less illuminating. In those elections, 28.4% of eligible Palestinian voters in East Jerusalem cast a ballot, a seemingly respectable number. A more careful look, once again, tells a different story \u2013 in this case a story of formal disenfranchisement.Out of the approximate 157,382 Palestinian residents of Jerusalem of voting age, only 10,431 actually have the right to vote in Israel's national elections (a number that is artificially high, since it includes thousands of Israeli Arab citizens who moved to Jerusalem from areas in pre-1967 Israel, rather than native Palestinian East Jerusalemites). This means that the number of East Jerusalemite Palestinians entitled to vote in national elections hovers at around 5% of the voting-age Palestinian population of the city. Only 2,965 of the East Jerusalem Palestinians \u2013 1.9% of the Palestinian population \u2013 voted in Israel's 2013 national elections, with another 95% denied the right to vote.This bizarre situation exists because most Palestinians in \"undivided Jerusalem\" are legally classified as \"permanent residents\", rather than citizens of Israel. As such, they do not enjoy the right to vote in national elections. An estimated 13,000 Palestinians of all ages, out of a total Palestinian population of 293,000 (37% of Jerusalem's total population), have received Israeli citizenship.By disenfranchising Palestinians of East Jerusalem from national elections, Israel has declared unequivocally that these residents of Israel's \"undivided capital\" are not, in fact, part of Israel's body politic. And by overwhelmingly refraining from voting in municipal elections, even when that right exists, Palestinians of East Jerusalem are emphatically agreeing.The results of these two recent elections reveal the fundamental political truth of contemporary Jerusalem: the only place where Jerusalem is \"the undivided capital of Israel\" is in the fertile imaginations of ideologues such as Netanyahu and Barkat. Nowhere else in the world is there a prime minister so utterly detached from the daily realities of a city that he claims to be his nation's \"exclusive\" capital; and nowhere else is there a mayor so utterly disconnected from \u2013 and in denial about \u2013 the realities of the flesh-and-blood city over which he purports to preside.Those engaged in the current negotiations can ignore these facts only at great peril. When Netanyahu says he supports the two-state outcome, but opposes anything less than an undivided Jerusalem under sole Israeli sovereignty, he is really saying: \"I reject the two-state solution\".The myth of \"undivided Jerusalem\" is collapsing under the weight of its own fictions. Should the Kerry initiative \u2013 the last, best hope for the two-state solution \u2013 end in failure, Jerusalem will degenerate into the epicentre of a festering conflict, the arena of recurrent rounds of convulsive violence. But should, against all odds, these talks end in agreement, a new Jerusalem, rooted in its genuine political and urban realities, will emerge: a politically divided, bi-national city, the respective capitals of Israel and Palestine \u2013 which is the sine qua non of any permanent status agreement.\u2022 Comments on this piece will be open for 24 hours from the launch time, and may close overnight", "tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories", "Binyamin Netanyahu", "John Kerry"], "title": "The myth of an undivided Jerusalem is collapsing under its own weight | Daniel Seidemann"},{"date": "2015-12-22T10:32:55Z", "content": "As the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino show, Islamic State has achieved a global reach. No longer satisfied with terrorising large swaths of the Middle East, it is inspiring, recruiting, training and supplying terrorists to carry out murderous acts around the world. Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world. Only a coalition led by Saudi Arabia can genuinely defeat Isis while also delegitimising the group in the eyes of the wider Muslim world. If the nations of the world hope to completely defeat Isis, they should stop falsely accusing the Saudis of creating the group and instead join them in defeating it.\u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2015 and again on 24 December 2015 to clarify Nawaf Obaid\u2019s role as a former communications adviser to the Saudi government.

The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world. Only a coalition led by Saudi Arabia can genuinely defeat Isis while also delegitimising the group in the eyes of the wider Muslim world. If the nations of the world hope to completely defeat Isis, they should stop falsely accusing the Saudis of creating the group and instead join them in defeating it.\u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2015 and again on 24 December 2015 to clarify Nawaf Obaid\u2019s role as a former communications adviser to the Saudi government.

Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam.

Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world. Only a coalition led by Saudi Arabia can genuinely defeat Isis while also delegitimising the group in the eyes of the wider Muslim world. If the nations of the world hope to completely defeat Isis, they should stop falsely accusing the Saudis of creating the group and instead join them in defeating it.\u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2015 and again on 24 December 2015 to clarify Nawaf Obaid\u2019s role as a former communications adviser to the Saudi government.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites. The country\u2019s parliament has failed to elect a president, by law a Christian Maronite, more than 30 times, in sessions that often faileven to achieve quorum.The country\u2019s political dysfunction descended into farce last summer, when the government failed to negotiate a deal over new landfills, leaving rubbish piling up in the streets of Beirut, and prompting demonstrations protesting official corruption.", "tags": ["Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran", "Saudi Arabia"], "title": "Advantage Iran in Lebanese political proxy battle with Saudi Arabia"},{"date": "2015-12-22T10:32:55Z", "content": "As the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino show, Islamic State has achieved a global reach.

Paveway bombs are produced by Raytheon UK.British-made Tornado GR4 ground attack fighters and Typhoons have been playing a major role in Saudi bombing strikes on Yemen where it is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The soaring number of civilian casualties in the Saudi-led bombing campaign have provoked widespread criticism. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, said last month that 2,300 civilians had been killed so far.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites. The country\u2019s parliament has failed to elect a president, by law a Christian Maronite, more than 30 times, in sessions that often faileven to achieve quorum.The country\u2019s political dysfunction descended into farce last summer, when the government failed to negotiate a deal over new landfills, leaving rubbish piling up in the streets of Beirut, and prompting demonstrations protesting official corruption.", "tags": ["Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran", "Saudi Arabia"], "title": "Advantage Iran in Lebanese political proxy battle with Saudi Arabia"},{"date": "2016-01-07T17:58:26Z", "content": "Saudi Arabia is considering a stock market listing for its national oil group \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest energy company and probably the most valuable company on the planet. Saudi Aramco is a highly secretive organisation but is likely to be valued at well over $1tn (\u00a3685bn). Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country.Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time.\u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said.Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers. Some question whether this strategy could change in the run-up to any Aramco IPO.He was happy for the Economist to depict his planned new policies as Thatcherite, saying he was \u201cmost certainly\u201d wanting to follow the free market economic path the former UK prime minster had pioneered.Western oil companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil may be very interested in an opportunity to buy into Saudi Aramco \u2013 even when their own balance sheets are being stretched by a collapsing crude values.But other state-owned petroleum groups, from China and elsewhere, would also be keen to take a stake in a company that controls more than 260bn barrels of reserves.Saudi Aramco produces all of Saudi\u2019s 10.25m barrels a day, which is more than double that of Exxon and Rosneft in Russia.The Saudi prince, who is also the defence minister, said it was right of his country to suspend diplomatic relations with fellow Opec member and regional power rival Iran, but played down any prospects of physical conflict.He said: \u201cA war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is the beginning of a major catastrophe in the region ... For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201dThe mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices. Middle East tension usually raises oil trader fears that production or transport could be hit.But in recent days the direction of travel for prices has only been downwards as sentiment concentrated on increasing supplies and weakening demand.

No longer satisfied with terrorising large swaths of the Middle East, it is inspiring, recruiting, training and supplying terrorists to carry out murderous acts around the world. Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites. The country\u2019s parliament has failed to elect a president, by law a Christian Maronite, more than 30 times, in sessions that often faileven to achieve quorum.The country\u2019s political dysfunction descended into farce last summer, when the government failed to negotiate a deal over new landfills, leaving rubbish piling up in the streets of Beirut, and prompting demonstrations protesting official corruption.", "tags": ["Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran", "Saudi Arabia"], "title": "Advantage Iran in Lebanese political proxy battle with Saudi Arabia"},{"date": "2016-01-07T17:58:26Z", "content": "Saudi Arabia is considering a stock market listing for its national oil group \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest energy company and probably the most valuable company on the planet. Saudi Aramco is a highly secretive organisation but is likely to be valued at well over $1tn (\u00a3685bn). Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country.Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time.\u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said.Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers.

For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201dThe mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices. Middle East tension usually raises oil trader fears that production or transport could be hit.But in recent days the direction of travel for prices has only been downwards as sentiment concentrated on increasing supplies and weakening demand.

But it is irresponsible and dangerous to imply a general sameness between the two countries. Saudi Arabia has exported around the world an intolerant and violent ideology that inspires Islamic State and all similar groups. By contrast, the cultural export for which Iran is most well-known in the west is its thriving and poetic cinema. Iran has a long way to go at home and abroad, but let\u2019s keep things in perspective. Saudi Arabia is an ally of the west and the west\u00a0keeps closing its eyes and ears, selling it lethal\u00a0arms and denying the central role\u00a0this country plays in jihadi violence\u00a0in the name of Islam.Niloofar HaeriBaltimore, Maryland, USA\u2022 There is no reason for MPs to wait for\u00a0the formation of a committee to scrutinise arms exports (Report, 4 January). The foreign secretary told the\u00a0BBC on 11 November that we would stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis were found to have breached international law. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has said that they did just that by carrying out airstrikes on hospitals in Yemen in October and again\u00a0in December. Any MP who is interested can put down a question to the foreign secretary.Oliver MilesOxford\u2022 In his thoughtful commentary, Brian Whitaker (5 January) correctly highlights how Wahhabi Islam espoused by the Saudi kingdom since its inception in 1932 has had unimaginable repercussions. He omitted that Britain partly sired this savagery by plumping for the Sauds, instead of the Hashemites, whose legitimate legacy was diverted to Transjordan. Whitaker\u2019s chronology, however, is incorrect on the rise of Pakistani extremism, for it was Tehran that fomented sectarian agitation, especially in Karachi, forcing the hand of an insecure Zia-ul-Haq to encourage Sunni militancy to deflect attention from his discredited authority. The Saudi Shia are no worse off than Iranian Sunnis: Tehran, since the 1979 revolution, remains the largest metropolis in west Asia and the only Islamic capital without a Sunni mosque.Saeed Kamali Dehghan pointed out the plight of Iranian Sunnis who could not offer Eid prayers (31 August 2011). The Saudis will have to ride this out in the coming weeks, because the 40th day of bereavement is a high point of remembrance in Shia theology and martyrology.

No longer satisfied with terrorising large swaths of the Middle East, it is inspiring, recruiting, training and supplying terrorists to carry out murderous acts around the world. Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world. Only a coalition led by Saudi Arabia can genuinely defeat Isis while also delegitimising the group in the eyes of the wider Muslim world. If the nations of the world hope to completely defeat Isis, they should stop falsely accusing the Saudis of creating the group and instead join them in defeating it.\u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2015 and again on 24 December 2015 to clarify Nawaf Obaid\u2019s role as a former communications adviser to the Saudi government.

Paveway bombs are produced by Raytheon UK.British-made Tornado GR4 ground attack fighters and Typhoons have been playing a major role in Saudi bombing strikes on Yemen where it is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.

Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, said last month that 2,300 civilians had been killed so far. He said both sides in the conflict shared blame, but the Saudi-led air campaign was responsible for most of the deaths.In a report released on Wednesday, Amnesty International said the British government must urgently investigate whether weapons it supplied to the Saudi airforce had killed civilians.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites. The country\u2019s parliament has failed to elect a president, by law a Christian Maronite, more than 30 times, in sessions that often faileven to achieve quorum.The country\u2019s political dysfunction descended into farce last summer, when the government failed to negotiate a deal over new landfills, leaving rubbish piling up in the streets of Beirut, and prompting demonstrations protesting official corruption.", "tags": ["Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran", "Saudi Arabia"], "title": "Advantage Iran in Lebanese political proxy battle with Saudi Arabia"},{"date": "2016-01-07T17:58:26Z", "content": "Saudi Arabia is considering a stock market listing for its national oil group \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest energy company and probably the most valuable company on the planet. Saudi Aramco is a highly secretive organisation but is likely to be valued at well over $1tn (\u00a3685bn). Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country.Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time.\u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said.Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers. Some question whether this strategy could change in the run-up to any Aramco IPO.He was happy for the Economist to depict his planned new policies as Thatcherite, saying he was \u201cmost certainly\u201d wanting to follow the free market economic path the former UK prime minster had pioneered.Western oil companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil may be very interested in an opportunity to buy into Saudi Aramco \u2013 even when their own balance sheets are being stretched by a collapsing crude values.But other state-owned petroleum groups, from China and elsewhere, would also be keen to take a stake in a company that controls more than 260bn barrels of reserves.Saudi Aramco produces all of Saudi\u2019s 10.25m barrels a day, which is more than double that of Exxon and Rosneft in Russia.The Saudi prince, who is also the defence minister, said it was right of his country to suspend diplomatic relations with fellow Opec member and regional power rival Iran, but played down any prospects of physical conflict.He said: \u201cA war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is the beginning of a major catastrophe in the region ... For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201dThe mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices. Middle East tension usually raises oil trader fears that production or transport could be hit.But in recent days the direction of travel for prices has only been downwards as sentiment concentrated on increasing supplies and weakening demand.

By contrast, the cultural export for which Iran is most well-known in the west is its thriving and poetic cinema. Iran has a long way to go at home and abroad, but let\u2019s keep things in perspective.

The foreign secretary told the\u00a0BBC on 11 November that we would stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis were found to have breached international law.

Any MP who is interested can put down a question to the foreign secretary.Oliver MilesOxford\u2022 In his thoughtful commentary, Brian Whitaker (5 January) correctly highlights how Wahhabi Islam espoused by the Saudi kingdom since its inception in 1932 has had unimaginable repercussions. He omitted that Britain partly sired this savagery by plumping for the Sauds, instead of the Hashemites, whose legitimate legacy was diverted to Transjordan. Whitaker\u2019s chronology, however, is incorrect on the rise of Pakistani extremism, for it was Tehran that fomented sectarian agitation, especially in Karachi, forcing the hand of an insecure Zia-ul-Haq to encourage Sunni militancy to deflect attention from his discredited authority. The Saudi Shia are no worse off than Iranian Sunnis: Tehran, since the 1979 revolution, remains the largest metropolis in west Asia and the only Islamic capital without a Sunni mosque.Saeed Kamali Dehghan pointed out the plight of Iranian Sunnis who could not offer Eid prayers (31 August 2011). The Saudis will have to ride this out in the coming weeks, because the 40th day of bereavement is a high point of remembrance in Shia theology and martyrology.

No longer satisfied with terrorising large swaths of the Middle East, it is inspiring, recruiting, training and supplying terrorists to carry out murderous acts around the world. Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world. Only a coalition led by Saudi Arabia can genuinely defeat Isis while also delegitimising the group in the eyes of the wider Muslim world. If the nations of the world hope to completely defeat Isis, they should stop falsely accusing the Saudis of creating the group and instead join them in defeating it.\u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2015 and again on 24 December 2015 to clarify Nawaf Obaid\u2019s role as a former communications adviser to the Saudi government.

It has sold 72 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft to the country in a contract worth an estimated \u00a34.4bn, upgraded Saudi Tornado aircraft (part of the controversial \u00a340bn al-Yamamah contract signed by Margaret Thatcher) in a contract worth an estimated \u00a32.5bn, and upgraded 70 US F15 combat jets in the Saudi air force.The UK Ministry of Defence has gone out its way to help the Saudis by diverting 500 lb Paveway IV guided bombs originally earmarked for the RAF to Saudi Arabia to enable it to continue striking targets in Yemen and Syria. Paveway bombs are produced by Raytheon UK.British-made Tornado GR4 ground attack fighters and Typhoons have been playing a major role in Saudi bombing strikes on Yemen where it is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. The soaring number of civilian casualties in the Saudi-led bombing campaign have provoked widespread criticism. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, said last month that 2,300 civilians had been killed so far. He said both sides in the conflict shared blame, but the Saudi-led air campaign was responsible for most of the deaths.In a report released on Wednesday, Amnesty International said the British government must urgently investigate whether weapons it supplied to the Saudi airforce had killed civilians. Attacks on city of Sa\u2019da in north eastern Yemen this summer had killed 100 civilians, including 59 children, it said.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) said: \u201cThe humanitarian crisis in Yemen is getting worse, but the UK government is looking the other way and is continuing to work hand in glove with arms companies that are fuelling and profiting from the destruction taking place. \u201cThe Saudi authorities behead and crucify opponents, lock up bloggers and bombs civilians, what more would it take for the UK to finally stop its uncritical political and military support for this terrible regime?\u201dIn a revealing interview on Tuesday with Channel 4\u2019s Jon Snow David Cameron explained Britain\u2019s close relationship with Saudi Arabia. \u201cIt\u2019s because we receive from them important intelligence and security information that keeps us safe\u201d, said Cameron.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites. The country\u2019s parliament has failed to elect a president, by law a Christian Maronite, more than 30 times, in sessions that often faileven to achieve quorum.The country\u2019s political dysfunction descended into farce last summer, when the government failed to negotiate a deal over new landfills, leaving rubbish piling up in the streets of Beirut, and prompting demonstrations protesting official corruption.", "tags": ["Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran", "Saudi Arabia"], "title": "Advantage Iran in Lebanese political proxy battle with Saudi Arabia"},{"date": "2016-01-07T17:58:26Z", "content": "Saudi Arabia is considering a stock market listing for its national oil group \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest energy company and probably the most valuable company on the planet. Saudi Aramco is a highly secretive organisation but is likely to be valued at well over $1tn (\u00a3685bn). Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country.Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time.\u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said.Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers. Some question whether this strategy could change in the run-up to any Aramco IPO.He was happy for the Economist to depict his planned new policies as Thatcherite, saying he was \u201cmost certainly\u201d wanting to follow the free market economic path the former UK prime minster had pioneered.Western oil companies including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil may be very interested in an opportunity to buy into Saudi Aramco \u2013 even when their own balance sheets are being stretched by a collapsing crude values.But other state-owned petroleum groups, from China and elsewhere, would also be keen to take a stake in a company that controls more than 260bn barrels of reserves.Saudi Aramco produces all of Saudi\u2019s 10.25m barrels a day, which is more than double that of Exxon and Rosneft in Russia.The Saudi prince, who is also the defence minister, said it was right of his country to suspend diplomatic relations with fellow Opec member and regional power rival Iran, but played down any prospects of physical conflict.He said: \u201cA war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is the beginning of a major catastrophe in the region ... For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201dThe mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices. Middle East tension usually raises oil trader fears that production or transport could be hit.But in recent days the direction of travel for prices has only been downwards as sentiment concentrated on increasing supplies and weakening demand.

But it is irresponsible and dangerous to imply a general sameness between the two countries. Saudi Arabia has exported around the world an intolerant and violent ideology that inspires Islamic State and all similar groups. By contrast, the cultural export for which Iran is most well-known in the west is its thriving and poetic cinema. Iran has a long way to go at home and abroad, but let\u2019s keep things in perspective. Saudi Arabia is an ally of the west and the west\u00a0keeps closing its eyes and ears, selling it lethal\u00a0arms and denying the central role\u00a0this country plays in jihadi violence\u00a0in the name of Islam.Niloofar HaeriBaltimore, Maryland, USA\u2022 There is no reason for MPs to wait for\u00a0the formation of a committee to scrutinise arms exports (Report, 4 January). The foreign secretary told the\u00a0BBC on 11 November that we would stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis were found to have breached international law. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has said that they did just that by carrying out airstrikes on hospitals in Yemen in October and again\u00a0in December. Any MP who is interested can put down a question to the foreign secretary.Oliver MilesOxford\u2022 In his thoughtful commentary, Brian Whitaker (5 January) correctly highlights how Wahhabi Islam espoused by the Saudi kingdom since its inception in 1932 has had unimaginable repercussions. He omitted that Britain partly sired this savagery by plumping for the Sauds, instead of the Hashemites, whose legitimate legacy was diverted to Transjordan. Whitaker\u2019s chronology, however, is incorrect on the rise of Pakistani extremism, for it was Tehran that fomented sectarian agitation, especially in Karachi, forcing the hand of an insecure Zia-ul-Haq to encourage Sunni militancy to deflect attention from his discredited authority. The Saudi Shia are no worse off than Iranian Sunnis: Tehran, since the 1979 revolution, remains the largest metropolis in west Asia and the only Islamic capital without a Sunni mosque.Saeed Kamali Dehghan pointed out the plight of Iranian Sunnis who could not offer Eid prayers (31 August 2011). The Saudis will have to ride this out in the coming weeks, because the 40th day of bereavement is a high point of remembrance in Shia theology and martyrology.

The beheading of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr triggered demonstrations and an arson attack at the Saudi embassy in Tehran.\u201cFollowing the signing of the interim nuclear deal in November 2013, Saudi Arabia began devoting its resources to defeating the deal, driven by fear that its contrived Iranophobia was crumbling,\u201d Zarif wrote in the American newspaper. \u201cToday, some in Riyadh not only continue to impede normalisation but are determined to drag the entire region into confrontation.\u201d Related: Rouhani races to implement nuclear deal with eye on Iran elections bounce The final nuclear deal between Iran, the US and other world powers was signed last July and could be implemented as soon as this month. In an unusually candid broadside, Zarif argued that Saudi Arabia fears a normalisation of relations between Iran and the west could leave it exposed.\u201cSaudi Arabia seems to fear that the removal of the smoke screen of the nuclear issue will expose the real global threat: its active sponsorship of violent extremism,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe barbarism is clear. At home, state executioners sever heads with swords, as in the recent execution of 47 prisoners in one day, including Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a respected religious scholar who devoted his life to promoting nonviolence and civil rights. Abroad, masked men sever heads with knives.\u201cThe Saudi strategy to derail the nuclear agreement and perpetuate \u2013 and even exacerbate \u2013 tension in the region has three components: pressuring the West; promoting regional instability through waging war in Yemen and sponsoring extremism; and directly provoking Iran.\u201dZarif added: \u201cLet us not forget that the perpetrators of many acts of terror \u2026 as well as nearly all members of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front, have been either Saudi nationals or brainwashed by petrodollar-financed demagogues who have promoted anti-Islamic messages of hatred and sectarianism for decades.\u201dOther Arab countries followed their Sunni ally in cutting or reducing diplomatic ties with predominantly Shia Iran. Officials in the US came under pressure to choose sides and found it awkward to go further than expressing \u201cconcern\u201d over the mass execution carried out by Saudi Arabia, a staunch regional ally.On the leader page of America\u2019s most prestigious newspaper, Zarif noted that Iran condemned the violence at the Saudi embassy on 2 January and an investigation is under way. \u201cWe took immediate measures to help restore order \u2026 We also took disciplinary action against those who failed to protect the embassy.\u201dSafar Ali Baratlou, a senior security official, and General Hassan Arabsorkhi, head of police special forces in Tehran, lost their jobs over the failure to stop the embassy ransacking, according to officials.Zarif also said Iran showed restraint after events such as last year\u2019s hajj in Saudi Arabia, where 464 Iranians were among more than 2,000 pilgrims killed in a stampede, and had not cut or reduced its diplomatic relations with the kingdom.\u201cWe have until now responded with restraint; but unilateral prudence is not sustainable,\u201d Zarif wrote. \u201cThis has fallen on deaf ears in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi leadership must now make a choice: They can continue supporting extremists and promoting sectarian hatred; or they can opt to play a constructive role in promoting regional stability.\u201dThe nuclear deal is set to be implement as soon as Iran meets all conditions, resulting in the lifting of some sanctions worth billions of dollars. But the White House is also considering imposing new and separate sanctions after Iran conducted two ballistic missiles tests in contravention of a UN security council resolution.Asked to comment on the Zarif\u2019s column, the Saudi embassy in Washington listed examples of what it called \u201cIran\u2019s negative policies and aggressive interferences\u201d.\u201cIt is clear from Minister Zarif\u2019s statements and those of the foreign ministry that they are out of the loop and out of touch with reality and the centers of power in Iran and are left to defend the reckless behavior of the regime\u201d, the embassy press office wrote in an email.Chris Coons, a US senator, said on Monday: \u201cWhen it comes to taking additional actions in response to the ballistic missile launches \u2013 absolutely, I think we should do so.

He admitted that, even if implemented, he is not confident it will survive the next two years. \u201cIran continues to engage in bad behaviour like the ballistic missile launches, like support for regional terrorism groups that makes me very wary of any rapprochement or realliance with Iran.\u201cThere is huge anxiety in the region by our core allies about our future intentions and there is a lot of concern. There is a lot of misreading of what the agreement with Iran means. In my view, it does not mean that the United States has suddenly decided to return to a pre-1979 alignment where Iran is one of our principal allies in the region. Far from it.

No longer satisfied with terrorising large swaths of the Middle East, it is inspiring, recruiting, training and supplying terrorists to carry out murderous acts around the world. Related: Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism alliance: a political message sketchy on details Given this new international agenda, analysts are struggling to assess the source of the group in an attempt to improve their understanding of how to stop it. In terms of its source, most point to Saudi Arabia; in terms of stopping it, most point to the United States. However, a closer look at Isis reveals that it is engaged in an entrenched theological war with the Saudi religious establishment to determine who justifiably espouses the purest tenets of Sunni Islam. As the custodian of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina and the host of the world\u2019s Muslims for the pilgrimage, Saudi Arabia leads one and a half billion Muslims in fighting Isis. The kingdom\u2019s leadership of the recently announced Muslim coalition to fight terrorism in all its forms confirms that Saudi Arabia is not only not the source of Isis but it is the terrorist group\u2019s central opponent and the only nation that can fully and legitimately defeat it once and for all. More than 34 countries have joined the coalition.Three factors clarify Saudi Arabia\u2019s intrinsic and total war on Isis. First, many people claim that Saudi Arabia is the source of Isis because both practise a version of Islam called Salafism (erroneously known in the west as Wahhabism). Salafism is rooted in the word salaf, or \u201cforefathers\u201d, and refers to the way the prophet Muhammad\u2019s followers in the religion\u2019s first three generations practised Islam. And while it is true that the kingdom espouses Salafism, Isis\u2019s claim that it is Salafi has no theological basis, because the group is in fact a continuation of a crude sect known as the Kharijites, or the ones who \u201cdefected\u201d from the Muslim community (ummah) during the reign of the fourth caliph Ali (whom the Kharijites assassinated). The Kharijites, like Isis, believe that whoever disagreed with them should be murdered as infidels (takfir), rationalised mass killings against civilians including women and children (isti\u2019rad), and practised an extreme form of inquisition to test their opponents\u2019 faith (imtihan).Isis\u2019s adherence to the Kharijite ideology is not the only reason it is not a true Salafi movement; it has also committed an act of disobedience that effectively nullifies its Salafi pretenses. In original Islamic scriptures and practice, the highest authority is the \u201cguardian\u201d of the ummah, (wali al amr). All religious, political and military powers are concentrated under this authority, which Saudi Arabia\u2019s system best exemplifies in the modern world. In other words, King Salman\u2019s legitimacy to rule is contingent on him being first and foremost the wali al amr of the people, and in return the people show their acceptance of his rule by proclaiming him as their ruler. This proclamation (bay\u2019ah) is a contract between the ruler and the ruled in which the first swears to promote Islam and the welfare of the second, and the second swears to obey (ta\u2019ah) the tenets of Islam and follow the first\u2019s leadership. Should the first deviate from Islam, the second is obliged to replace him. The joint bay\u2019ah of the ummah to the ruler is fundamental to Salafism and anyone that breaks the bay\u2019ah \u2013 as Isis has done \u2013 can never again be considered a true Salafi.Given the importance of the wali al amr to Sunni Islam, Isis and Saudi Arabia are locked in a theological struggle from which only one can emerge victorious.The second reason Saudi Arabia and Isis are in complete opposition is that the core mission of Isis is to restore the caliphate, an Islamic empire led by a supreme leader. Given that the kingdom is the epicentre of Islam, Isis\u2019s road to the caliphate lies through the kingdom and the Saudi people. Isis has conducted a series of terrorist attacks in the kingdom in the past year. In response Saudi Arabia has put the group on its list of terrorist sponsors, declared that belonging to or funding Isis is a crime punishable by death and arrested countless Isis supporters, operatives and financiers.The final reason why Saudi Arabia is Isis\u2019s strategic enemy is financial. As an organisation with expanding ambitions, Isis requires ever-expanding resources. Therefore, just like al-Qaida, Isis covets the kingdom\u2019s enormous oil fields and monetary wealth.When Isis first appeared in Syria in 2011, Saudi Arabia tried to galvanise support for the moderate Syrian opposition. But the world failed to listen. Now Isis is a threat not only to the Middle East but also to the entire world. Only a coalition led by Saudi Arabia can genuinely defeat Isis while also delegitimising the group in the eyes of the wider Muslim world. If the nations of the world hope to completely defeat Isis, they should stop falsely accusing the Saudis of creating the group and instead join them in defeating it.\u2022 This article was amended on 22 December 2015 and again on 24 December 2015 to clarify Nawaf Obaid\u2019s role as a former communications adviser to the Saudi government.

The Saudi-backed \u201cMarch 14\u201d bloc, which accounts for most of the country\u2019s Sunnis, and which is strongly supported by Riyadh, remained bitterly opposed to the deal until it was announced by both men on Monday night, and Geagea may face difficulties convincing them to back Aoun.Aoun has enthusiastically supported Iran\u2019s role in the region and his election would mark an extension of Tehran\u2019s influence at a time when an ongoing tussle for power and influence saw Saudi Arabia sever diplomatic relations in the lead-up to the nuclear deal.This flare-up in tensions was precipitated by an attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran, which had followed the execution of a senior Saudi Shia cleric. However, it underscores a much broader standoff that has festered particularly since the start of the Syrian civil war and the war in Yemen, both of which have sectarian dimensions.Saudi Arabia has largely projected its power through Lebanon\u2019s exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri. Late last year, he put forward a compromise candidate, Suleiman Franjieh, who is closely linked to the Syrian regime, in an attempt to break a deadlock which had crippled basic services and destabilised the country.The move worked, but not with the result Hariri had wanted. Aoun and Geagea have been enemies since both were generals in rival Christian camps during the Lebanese civil war between 1975 and 1990, but the one person they dislike more than each other was Franjieh.If Aoun is elected leader, as is increasingly expected, it would likely damage the March 14 bloc\u2019s status within Lebanon, and possibly be seen as another blow to Sunni standing in the region.Saudi officials fear Iran will use some of the windfall from the lifting of international sanctions in the wake of its nuclear deal to prop up its regional proxies, including Hezbollah, which has been directly backed by Tehran since it was founded more than three decades ago.Saudi concerns also extend to Baghdad and Damascus. Iranian-backed Shia militias have grown more powerful and influential than the national Iraqi army, and have until recently taken the lead in the fight against Islamic State, while Iran has forcefully intervened to rescue the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad.In Yemen, Saudi Arabia launched a military campaign after accusing Iran of backing rebels who overthrew the Riyadh-backed government.Lebanon has long been paralysed by the divided loyalties of its political elites. The country\u2019s parliament has failed to elect a president, by law a Christian Maronite, more than 30 times, in sessions that often faileven to achieve quorum.The country\u2019s political dysfunction descended into farce last summer, when the government failed to negotiate a deal over new landfills, leaving rubbish piling up in the streets of Beirut, and prompting demonstrations protesting official corruption.", "tags": ["Lebanon", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iran", "Saudi Arabia"], "title": "Advantage Iran in Lebanese political proxy battle with Saudi Arabia"},{"date": "2016-01-07T17:58:26Z", "content": "Saudi Arabia is considering a stock market listing for its national oil group \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest energy company and probably the most valuable company on the planet.

Any public share listing would be viewed as a potent symbol of the financial pain being wreaked by low prices on the world\u2019s biggest crude exporting country.Prince Muhammad bin Salman, the country\u2019s highly influential deputy crown prince, confirmed in an interview on Monday with the Economist magazine that a decision would be taken within months whether to raise cash in this way, even as oil company shares are depressed at this time.\u201cPersonally I am enthusiastic about this step,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe it is in the interest of the Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if any, that may be circling around.\u201d The sale via an initial public offering (IPO) of any part of Saudi Aramco would be a major change in direction for a country, which has jealously guarded its enormous \u2013 and cheaply produced \u2013 oil reserves. Aramco\u2019s reserves are 10 times greater than those of Exxon, which is the largest publicly listed oil company. The prince, considered the power behind the throne of his father King Salman, is keen to modernise the largely oil-based Saudi economy by privatisation or other means but it also needs to find money.The country is under pressure, with oil prices plunging to their lowest levels in 11 years and more than 70% below where they were in June 2014. This has put huge strain on Saudi public spending plans, which were drawn up when prices were much higher and pushed the public accounts into deficit.Prince Muhammed, however, denied that the country was facing an economic crisis: \u201cWe\u2019re too far from it. We are further than the 80s and the 90s. We have the third-largest reserve in the world. We were able to increase our non-oil revenues this year alone by 29%,\u201d he said.Industry experts point out that the Saudis have partly been the architects of the low oil price environment as they refuse to cut back output in a fight a turf war with their rival US shale producers.

For sure, we will not allow any such thing.\u201dThe mounting war of words between Riyadh and Tehran could have been expected to put upward pressure on crude prices.

The foreign secretary told the\u00a0BBC on 11 November that we would stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia if the Saudis were found to have breached international law.

He omitted that Britain partly sired this savagery by plumping for the Sauds, instead of the Hashemites, whose legitimate legacy was diverted to Transjordan. Whitaker\u2019s chronology, however, is incorrect on the rise of Pakistani extremism, for it was Tehran that fomented sectarian agitation, especially in Karachi, forcing the hand of an insecure Zia-ul-Haq to encourage Sunni militancy to deflect attention from his discredited authority. The Saudi Shia are no worse off than Iranian Sunnis: Tehran, since the 1979 revolution, remains the largest metropolis in west Asia and the only Islamic capital without a Sunni mosque.Saeed Kamali Dehghan pointed out the plight of Iranian Sunnis who could not offer Eid prayers (31 August 2011). The Saudis will have to ride this out in the coming weeks, because the 40th day of bereavement is a high point of remembrance in Shia theology and martyrology.

The beheading of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr triggered demonstrations and an arson attack at the Saudi embassy in Tehran.\u201cFollowing the signing of the interim nuclear deal in November 2013, Saudi Arabia began devoting its resources to defeating the deal, driven by fear that its contrived Iranophobia was crumbling,\u201d Zarif wrote in the American newspaper. \u201cToday, some in Riyadh not only continue to impede normalisation but are determined to drag the entire region into confrontation.\u201d Related: Rouhani races to implement nuclear deal with eye on Iran elections bounce The final nuclear deal between Iran, the US and other world powers was signed last July and could be implemented as soon as this month. In an unusually candid broadside, Zarif argued that Saudi Arabia fears a normalisation of relations between Iran and the west could leave it exposed.\u201cSaudi Arabia seems to fear that the removal of the smoke screen of the nuclear issue will expose the real global threat: its active sponsorship of violent extremism,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe barbarism is clear. At home, state executioners sever heads with swords, as in the recent execution of 47 prisoners in one day, including Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a respected religious scholar who devoted his life to promoting nonviolence and civil rights. Abroad, masked men sever heads with knives.\u201cThe Saudi strategy to derail the nuclear agreement and perpetuate \u2013 and even exacerbate \u2013 tension in the region has three components: pressuring the West; promoting regional instability through waging war in Yemen and sponsoring extremism; and directly provoking Iran.\u201dZarif added: \u201cLet us not forget that the perpetrators of many acts of terror \u2026 as well as nearly all members of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front, have been either Saudi nationals or brainwashed by petrodollar-financed demagogues who have promoted anti-Islamic messages of hatred and sectarianism for decades.\u201dOther Arab countries followed their Sunni ally in cutting or reducing diplomatic ties with predominantly Shia Iran. Officials in the US came under pressure to choose sides and found it awkward to go further than expressing \u201cconcern\u201d over the mass execution carried out by Saudi Arabia, a staunch regional ally.On the leader page of America\u2019s most prestigious newspaper, Zarif noted that Iran condemned the violence at the Saudi embassy on 2 January and an investigation is under way. \u201cWe took immediate measures to help restore order \u2026 We also took disciplinary action against those who failed to protect the embassy.\u201dSafar Ali Baratlou, a senior security official, and General Hassan Arabsorkhi, head of police special forces in Tehran, lost their jobs over the failure to stop the embassy ransacking, according to officials.Zarif also said Iran showed restraint after events such as last year\u2019s hajj in Saudi Arabia, where 464 Iranians were among more than 2,000 pilgrims killed in a stampede, and had not cut or reduced its diplomatic relations with the kingdom.\u201cWe have until now responded with restraint; but unilateral prudence is not sustainable,\u201d Zarif wrote. \u201cThis has fallen on deaf ears in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi leadership must now make a choice: They can continue supporting extremists and promoting sectarian hatred; or they can opt to play a constructive role in promoting regional stability.\u201dThe nuclear deal is set to be implement as soon as Iran meets all conditions, resulting in the lifting of some sanctions worth billions of dollars. But the White House is also considering imposing new and separate sanctions after Iran conducted two ballistic missiles tests in contravention of a UN security council resolution.Asked to comment on the Zarif\u2019s column, the Saudi embassy in Washington listed examples of what it called \u201cIran\u2019s negative policies and aggressive interferences\u201d.\u201cIt is clear from Minister Zarif\u2019s statements and those of the foreign ministry that they are out of the loop and out of touch with reality and the centers of power in Iran and are left to defend the reckless behavior of the regime\u201d, the embassy press office wrote in an email.Chris Coons, a US senator, said on Monday: \u201cWhen it comes to taking additional actions in response to the ballistic missile launches \u2013 absolutely, I think we should do so.

He admitted that, even if implemented, he is not confident it will survive the next two years. \u201cIran continues to engage in bad behaviour like the ballistic missile launches, like support for regional terrorism groups that makes me very wary of any rapprochement or realliance with Iran.\u201cThere is huge anxiety in the region by our core allies about our future intentions and there is a lot of concern. There is a lot of misreading of what the agreement with Iran means. In my view, it does not mean that the United States has suddenly decided to return to a pre-1979 alignment where Iran is one of our principal allies in the region. Far from it.

But the familiar act, now considered merely hooliganism, is coming back to bite the hands of the very people who endorsed it in the first place. In the latest episode, thanks to Iranian hardliners who set ablaze the Saudi embassy in Tehran and attacked its consular offices in the eastern city of Mashhad, the focus is now being shifted from the Saudi execution of 47 people in a single day to an ensuing diplomatic crisis involving Tehran. This was the moment when Iran could have argued that Saudis were to blame for the growing sectarianism in the region, but instead it scored an own goal.The focus is now less on the execution of the Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a serious critic of the Saudi monarchy, than it is on Saudi Arabia and its allies severing diplomatic ties with Tehran. Whether more countries will follow suit remains to be seen.Attacking a foreign diplomatic mission has a precedent in Iran. After the 1979 Islamic revolution, students \u2013 angry about US support for the despotic Shah \u2013 stormed the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days, sparking a crisis whose reverberations are still heard today. In 2011, another group attacked the British embassy in Tehran, ransacking offices and diplomatic residences, which resulted in Britain expelling all Iranian diplomats from London.  Related: From hostage crisis to nuclear deal: prisoner and captor look back at the Iran-US cold war Although the hostage crisis was originally started by revolutionary students without official consent, it was soon endorsed by the then supreme leader, Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini, who praised the perpetrators and labelled the embassy \u201ca den of spies\u201d. That incident has been a national day in the Persian calendar for more than three decades, celebrated annually to keep its memory alive. In 2011, however, when a mob attacked the British embassy in Tehran, Iran\u2019s current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, took the unusual step of criticising it and saying that it was not right for the students to carry out the attack, even though, he said, their sentiments were justified.As the Islamic republic tries to reintegrate itself into the international community, it finds itself hampered by the \u201cdeath to this, death to that\u201d chants at Friday prayers and the burning of enemies\u2019 flags, which have become familiar pictures that unfairly dominate the world\u2019s view of Iran. Iranian hardliners have refrained from setting fire to the Saudi flag because of the script written on it, which is an Islamic creed or Shahada, in praise of the prophet Muhammad. Since the storming of the Saudi embassy at the weekend, Iranian officials have gone to great lengths to distance themselves from the attack. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, whose administration is highly embarrassed by such attacks, strongly condemned it as \u201ctotally unjustifiable\u201d, ordering the police to identify and arrest the perpetrators.  \u201cThe actions last night by a group of radicals in Tehran and Mashhad leading to damage at the Saudi embassy and consulate are totally unjustifiable, as the buildings should be legally and religiously protected in the Islamic Republic of Iran,\u201d the Iranian president was quoted as saying, according to AFP. \u201cI call on the interior minister to identify the perpetrators of this attack with firm determination and introduce them to the judiciary \u2026 so that there will be an end to such appalling actions once and for all.\u201dBut as the Persian proverb says, the antidote has come too late.

Attempts to accuse the Egyptian authorities, in the absence of evidence, are counter-productive. It is surprising that such unfounded assumptions could emanate from academics, who should be the first to adhere to standards of impartiality, rigour and professionalism.The statements made in the letter regarding arbitrary arrests, torture and disappearances completely distorted the situation on the ground, and constitute generalisations based on hearsay and intentional distortions by those striving to regain a foothold in Egypt after being rejected by the people. The National Council for Human Rights has stated in a series of reports that the majority of purported cases of disappearances have been unfounded after investigation and that authorities are fully cooperating with the NCHR to review any alleged cases.Egypt\u2019s leadership, at its highest level, has publicly committed to holding individual perpetrators of torture to account, and the current period is witnessing a number of important prosecutions of such cases. Egypt does not accept leniency for cases of torture, which remain isolated incidents that are being firmly confronted. In fact, Egypt\u2019s constitution establishes it as a crime with no statute of limitations.I extend my condolences to Mr Regeni\u2019s family and loved ones and assure them that what happened to Mr Regeni is as unacceptable to the people of Egypt as it is to all those who knew and loved him.

It is the highest figure for Egypt since the CPJ began recording the number of journalists jailed and as recently as 2012 the country did not imprison any. Turkey also dramatically increased the number of journalists it locked up during the year, doubling those in prison to 14. In September, Egypt pardoned two al-Jazeera journalists, Mohammed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, having arrested them in 2013 along with Australian colleague Peter Greste, who was deported last year. However, Egypt introduced a law in August making \u201cfalse\u201d reporting of terror attacks illegal and the CPJ said that \u201cperhaps nowhere has the climate for the press deteriorated more rapidly than in Egypt\u201d. Related: Egypt imposes anti-terror law that punishes 'false' reporting of attacks Prior to 2014, Turkey had been the world\u2019s worst jailer of journalists, but last year released dozens. However, the country has launched a renewed clampdown on foreign reporting and locally based media as its battle with Syrian Islamic groups and Kurdish rebels has intensified. Turkish authorities continue to hold Vice journalist Mohammed Rasool, following his arrest in October along with UK-based colleagues Jake Hanrahan and Philip Pendlebury, who were released in early September.China remains the worst country for locking up journalists for their activities, with 49 in jail \u2013 accounting for a quarter of the total tracked by the CPJ. A crackdown on corruption has made financial reporting especially difficult, said the report. The CPJ also highlighted the case of Shohret Hoshur, an Uighur journalist for US government-funded Radio Free Asia, who says his three brothers have been locked up in retaliation for his reporting.Overall, the total number of journalists in prison fell from 212 to 199 during the year, due partly to a fall in those under arrest in Iran, Vietnam, and Ethiopia. However, the CPJ said that a \u201cclimate of fear persists\u201d in all three countries, with many of those released subject to ongoing legal action and harsh restrictions including exile. Of those journalists in prison on 1 December, 109 worked online, and 83 in print.Of the 28 countries listed on the report, 10 were locking up just one journalist in what the CPJ said is an indication that \u201conly a handful of countries engage in systematic imprisonment of journalists\u201d.More than half the charges against journalists are for anti-state violations, but the CPJ said the proportion held under \u201ctrumped up\u201d accusations such as drugs or weapons possession, embezzlement, or assault had reached a five year high of 25%. The report only covers journalists held by governments, and the CPJ estimates there are at least 40 journalists missing in the Middle East and Africa, many thought to be in the hands of Islamic State.", "tags": ["Press freedom", "Journalist safety", "Media", "Newspapers & magazines", "Egypt", "World news"], "title": "Egypt jails record number of journalists"},{"date": "2016-02-20T19:45:01Z", "content": "The Egyptian author Ahmed Naji has been given a two-year prison sentence for \u201cviolating public modesty\u201d after publishing a book with references to sex and drugs.Ramy Yaacoub, a political analyst and friend of the defendant, tweeted a picture of Naji bowing his head in the darkened courtroom as his case was fought. The ruling was initially overturned in January, but after an appeal by the prosecution the case returned to court and Naji was given the maximum possible sentence on Saturday. An Egyptian citizen brought charges against the author after an except of his novel The Guide for Using Life was published in the magazine Akhbar al-Adab. The editor of the magazine, Tarek El Taher, was also given a fine equivalent to \u00a3885.The plaintiff claimed that reading the sexually explicit material, which also mentions smoking hashish, caused him to become ill after his blood pressure dropped and his heartbeat fluctuated. Naji had previously said that The Guide for Using Life had been approved by the Egyptian censorship board. \u201cThey didn\u2019t consider the constitution at all, which says you can\u2019t jail artists,\u201d said Naji\u2019s lawyer Mahmoud Othman. \u201cArticle 67 of the constitution states this, and the constitution trumps all.\u201dNaji was detained in court and remained in custody as the preparations began for his appeal.

Hossam Bahgat \u2013 a contributor to the independent news website Mada Masr and founder of human rights group the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) \u2013 was arrested on Sunday. Mada Masr said the 37-year-old had been charged with \u201cpublishing false news that harms national interests and disseminating information that disturbs public peace\u201d. He is to be held for four days.News of the arrest came just days after protests during the visit to London by President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, who has overseen the widespread curtailing of the Egyptian press since former president Mohamed Morsi was overthrown in 2013. Objections to Sisi\u2019s red-carpet reception focused on mass killings, the imprisonment of Muslim Brotherhood supporters and human rights abuses.\u201cThis is a bellwether moment for Egypt,\u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cContinuing to hold Hossam Bahgat or putting him on trial would be a definitive signal that al-Sisi and his government have no interest in rolling back the repression of the past two years.\u201dNegad al-Borai, a lawyer requested by Bahgat, said the arrest was related to an article he wrote in October about the trial of military officers accused of a coup attempt. His detention order can be renewed indefinitely and more charges can be issued. Mahmoud Abou Zeid, another journalist, has been in pre-trial detention for over two years.\u201cIt is unknown where Bahgat is currently being detained or where his four-day detention will be, and \u2026 his family is trying to find out to deliver his medications,\u201d lawyer Hassan El-Azhary told Ahram Online on Monday morning. Bahgat received a summons at his home in Alexandria on Thursday. He arrived at military intelligence headquarters on Sunday morning. In accordance with standard procedure, he was not allowed to enter with his phone, or be accompanied by a lawyer. In another development, Egyptian media reported the arrest on Sunday of businessman Salah Diab, the founder of al-Masry al-Youm newspaper, and his son, two days after prosecutors froze their assets along with other co-founders. Al-Ahram cited an anonymous security source as saying they were facing corruption charges.Bahgat\u2019s arrest has echoes of the case of three al-Jazeera journalists who were tried for helping a banned terrorist organisation. They were eventually given a presidential pardon and released in a case that focused international attention on Sisi\u2019s crackdown.Amnesty International described Bahgat\u2019s arrest as part of a \u201cferocious onslaught against independent journalism and civil society\u201d in Egypt. The move was also condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which called for Bahgat\u2019s immediate release.The journalist investigated many of the court cases dealing with corruption in the family of former president Hosni Mubarak, the release of jihadis by the Egyptian military following Mubarak\u2019s ousting, and the trials of militant cells. \u201cOne of his strengths is the ability to depend on solid sources: that\u2019s what his reporting was based on,\u201d said Lina Attalah, the editor of Mada Masr. \u201cIf he\u2019s being charged with publishing false information that seems to be the antithesis of his practice.\u201dBahgat writes a daily press review for Mada Masr as well as investigative pieces. On Friday and Saturday, he was critical of Egyptian outlets for what he described as their unquestioning reliance on government narratives over the Russian plane crash in Sinai on 31 October. There has been growing suspicion elsewhere that the Metrojet plane was brought down by a bomb planted at Sharm el-Sheikh airportBahgat founded EIPR in 2002 and remained its executive director until 2013. In August 2011, Human Rights Watch (HRW) honoured him \u201cfor upholding the personal freedoms of all Egyptians,\u201d when he won HRW\u2019S Alison Des Forges Award.\u201cThe Egyptian military has already indicated its contempt for the role of an independent media with a series of arrests of journalists. This latest detention is a clear attempt to stifle reporting,\u201d the CPJ\u2019s Middle East and North Africa programme coordinator, Sherif Mansour, said. \u201cThe Egyptian authorities should release Hossam Bahgat immediately. The fact that he was questioned for so long without his lawyers present only heightens the outrage.\u201d", "tags": ["Egypt", "Abdel Fatah al-Sisi", "Journalist safety", "Press freedom", "Africa", "Media", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "title": "Anger as Egypt detains campaigning journalist"},
