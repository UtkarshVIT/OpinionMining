Around 28% of workers registering in 2007 have settled in those two regions. Wales and Northern Ireland have had the fewest registrations.The Home Office said in its report releasing the figures that the migrants were \"contributing to the success of the UK economy, while making few demands on our welfare system\".This year's arrivals included 2,015 bus, lorry and coach drivers, 4,325 care workers, 815 teachers, researchers and classroom assistants, 110 dental practitioners and 1,035 doctors and nurses, the report said.Three quarters of the 12,000 requests made by immigrants this year for income support and jobseeker's allowance were rejected.In separate numbers released today, the government said that asylum applications were 19% higher between last October and December than in the winter of 2006. There were 6,910 applications in the last quarter of 2007, though the number of applications across the year was about the same as in 2006.The number of principal asylum applicants deported fell by 25% to 2,765.The proportion of applicants receiving an initial decision within two months fell to less than half, continuing a steady decline from 76% in the first three months of 2006.", "tags": ["Politics", "Society", "Immigration and asylum", "UK news"], "title": "750,000 eastern Europeans have come to UK since 2004, figures show"},{"date": "2008-02-22T16:35:55Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The European commission today rebuked Poland and Romania for their late responses to requests to clarify their role in the US extraordinary rendition programme.The EU justice and home affairs commissioner, Franco Frattini, wrote to Warsaw and Bucharest last July urging them to conduct in-depth inquiries into the findings by the European parliament indicating their complicity in extraordinary rendition \u2013 the controversial practice of transporting terror suspects to secret locations where they risk being tortured.

The European parliament and the council of Europe, a human rights watchdog, have accused at least 14 European states of colluding with US intelligence on the Bush administration's extraordinary rendition programme.Britain yesterday admitted that US rendition flights carrying terror suspects twice landed on British soil. David Miliband, the foreign secretary, was forced to apologise to MPs that contrary to previous US assurances, two flights did in fact land at Diego Garcia, the British Indian Ocean territory where the US has a large air base.Lib Dem MP Sarah Ludford said after Britain's admission \"we might be pushing into a slightly more open door. They've used us and abused us.\" She said the UK government had \"turned a blind eye\" to the renditions.Human rights groups have demanded a full accounting of the CIA's rendition programme. \"It's high time the agency is held accountable,\" said Julia Hall of Human Rights Watch. She also sought an investigation into the British role in the programme.\"The US flew hundreds of flights across Europe so the only way to have full accountability is for [Britain] to launch a thorough, national investigation.\"Britain appears to have accepted the \"administrative error\" explanation given by the Bush administration, but it has said it wants to review logs related to US operations at Diego Garcia.Following Miliband's apology, a senior MEP called on the European parliament to reopen its inquiry into secret CIA transfers of terrorism suspects in Europe.Claudio Fava, who wrote a highly critical report on CIA secret flights and prisons last year, said a follow-up was necessary.\"Yesterday's revelations confirm that the European parliament has a moral duty to continue its inquiry,\" Fava told Reuters in Rome. \"We still don't know everything that we have the right to know about this issue.\"Last February the EU approved Fava's report accusing European governments and services of accepting and concealing secret US flights of terrorism suspects.Italy has one of the best documented cases of what prosecutors believe was CIA rendition. Twenty six Americans - nearly all believed to be CIA agents - are being tried in absentia in Milan on charges of kidnapping a terrorism suspect in 2003 and secretly flying him to Egypt, where he says he was tortured.", "tags": ["Rendition", "Poland", "European Union", "US news", "World news", "Romania", "CIA", "US politics", "Europe"], "title": "EU rebukes Poland and Romania over rendition role"},{"date": "2008-01-11T23:47:46Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Kislyak, went to Warsaw to warn the Polish foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, of the \"strategic dangers\" posed by the project, bitterly opposed by the Kremlin which is threatening a new arms race if the US goes ahead.

But unless it markedly improves its defences, the Polish government also believes hosting the shield will diminish, rather than enhance national security in the face of a strengthening Russia.On Monday in Brussels, the Polish defence minister, Bogdan Klich, said Warsaw needed the kind of military aid from the US that Washington supplies to Pakistan or Egypt, indicating that the cost to America could run to billions. The Bush administration, meanwhile, could yet turn its back on Poland and shift to deploying the interceptor rockets either at sea or in Britain, say senior Nato officials in Brussels.", "tags": ["Poland", "US news", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Poland stalls Bush's 'lame duck' deal on missile shield"},{"date": "2008-08-21T13:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Surveys show Polish public opinion has rapidly shifted from wariness about hosting the US missile shield to outright enthusiasm. The reason is simple. Russia conducted a devastating counterattack against Georgia this month, and Poles are convinced the time for treading softly around the Russian bear has passed.Every Polish family has a compelling story about its role in history: stories of war, rebellion and defiance. By comparison to the average Brit, the average Pole is obsessed with the past and how it shapes the present. The first wave of Polish immigration to the UK took place at the end of the second world war, when an estimated 200,000 Poles were given British citizenship, one way or another, because of Kremlin foreign policy.Many had been deported by Russian troops from eastern Poland to Siberian concentration camps when the Nazis and Soviets were allied with each other at the start of the war. When the Soviets changed sides and allied with the British, the Poles were released and formed the \"Anders army\", which trekked from Siberia to Iran to join the British army for the north Africa and Italy campaigns. These Polish war veterans couldn't return to their country at the end of the war, because it had been taken by Stalin at Yalta. Those naive enough to return faced imprisonment or death. The rest formed the Polish communities in Hammersmith, Ealing and elsewhere, that have given hope to Polish migrants ever since.So most Polish people, especially members of the Polish British community, relate to the subjects of history and international relations in a deeply personal way. My grandfather served in the Polish army that defeated the Soviet invasion of Europe 1920. My father lived through the 1944 Warsaw uprising, in which the Red Army stood by and watched Nazis massacre the inhabitants of the city. I have childhood memories of Poland in the 1970s and 1980s. We would talk subversively in the home, but knew not to breathe a word of it on the telephone or on the street, all because of the Kremlin's might.This said, neither I nor most people with Polish roots, including those whose families were deported to Siberia, have any dislike of Russian people. Quite the contrary, Poles love the Russian language, literature and music. Poles have sympathy for the Russian nation, because historically their leaders, from Ivan the Terrible to Josef Stalin have treated them even worse than they have treated the people of Poland.Until the Georgia crisis, Poles didn't want the US missile shield. It was seen as another demonstration of Bush lunacy: a piece of kit that didn't work; a $100bn subsidy of American aerospace; a defence against an Iran that would use a terror cell with a dirty bomb before an ICBM; and a middle finger to a Kremlin that will take any pretext to whip up Russian nationalism to distract from its own failings. But now, the 10 interceptor missiles headed for Poland have real power \u2013 and that power is symbolic rather than tactical. With American boots and hardware on the ground in their country, Poles feel that they cannot be let down in the way they have been so many times before.

The reason is simple. Russia conducted a devastating counterattack against Georgia this month, and Poles are convinced the time for treading softly around the Russian bear has passed.Every Polish family has a compelling story about its role in history: stories of war, rebellion and defiance. By comparison to the average Brit, the average Pole is obsessed with the past and how it shapes the present. The first wave of Polish immigration to the UK took place at the end of the second world war, when an estimated 200,000 Poles were given British citizenship, one way or another, because of Kremlin foreign policy.Many had been deported by Russian troops from eastern Poland to Siberian concentration camps when the Nazis and Soviets were allied with each other at the start of the war. When the Soviets changed sides and allied with the British, the Poles were released and formed the \"Anders army\", which trekked from Siberia to Iran to join the British army for the north Africa and Italy campaigns. These Polish war veterans couldn't return to their country at the end of the war, because it had been taken by Stalin at Yalta. Those naive enough to return faced imprisonment or death. The rest formed the Polish communities in Hammersmith, Ealing and elsewhere, that have given hope to Polish migrants ever since.So most Polish people, especially members of the Polish British community, relate to the subjects of history and international relations in a deeply personal way. My grandfather served in the Polish army that defeated the Soviet invasion of Europe 1920. My father lived through the 1944 Warsaw uprising, in which the Red Army stood by and watched Nazis massacre the inhabitants of the city. I have childhood memories of Poland in the 1970s and 1980s. We would talk subversively in the home, but knew not to breathe a word of it on the telephone or on the street, all because of the Kremlin's might.This said, neither I nor most people with Polish roots, including those whose families were deported to Siberia, have any dislike of Russian people. Quite the contrary, Poles love the Russian language, literature and music. Poles have sympathy for the Russian nation, because historically their leaders, from Ivan the Terrible to Josef Stalin have treated them even worse than they have treated the people of Poland.Until the Georgia crisis, Poles didn't want the US missile shield. It was seen as another demonstration of Bush lunacy: a piece of kit that didn't work; a $100bn subsidy of American aerospace; a defence against an Iran that would use a terror cell with a dirty bomb before an ICBM; and a middle finger to a Kremlin that will take any pretext to whip up Russian nationalism to distract from its own failings. But now, the 10 interceptor missiles headed for Poland have real power \u2013 and that power is symbolic rather than tactical. With American boots and hardware on the ground in their country, Poles feel that they cannot be let down in the way they have been so many times before.

The reason is simple. Russia conducted a devastating counterattack against Georgia this month, and Poles are convinced the time for treading softly around the Russian bear has passed.Every Polish family has a compelling story about its role in history: stories of war, rebellion and defiance. By comparison to the average Brit, the average Pole is obsessed with the past and how it shapes the present. The first wave of Polish immigration to the UK took place at the end of the second world war, when an estimated 200,000 Poles were given British citizenship, one way or another, because of Kremlin foreign policy.Many had been deported by Russian troops from eastern Poland to Siberian concentration camps when the Nazis and Soviets were allied with each other at the start of the war. When the Soviets changed sides and allied with the British, the Poles were released and formed the \"Anders army\", which trekked from Siberia to Iran to join the British army for the north Africa and Italy campaigns. These Polish war veterans couldn't return to their country at the end of the war, because it had been taken by Stalin at Yalta. Those naive enough to return faced imprisonment or death. The rest formed the Polish communities in Hammersmith, Ealing and elsewhere, that have given hope to Polish migrants ever since.So most Polish people, especially members of the Polish British community, relate to the subjects of history and international relations in a deeply personal way. My grandfather served in the Polish army that defeated the Soviet invasion of Europe 1920. My father lived through the 1944 Warsaw uprising, in which the Red Army stood by and watched Nazis massacre the inhabitants of the city. I have childhood memories of Poland in the 1970s and 1980s. We would talk subversively in the home, but knew not to breathe a word of it on the telephone or on the street, all because of the Kremlin's might.This said, neither I nor most people with Polish roots, including those whose families were deported to Siberia, have any dislike of Russian people. Quite the contrary, Poles love the Russian language, literature and music. Poles have sympathy for the Russian nation, because historically their leaders, from Ivan the Terrible to Josef Stalin have treated them even worse than they have treated the people of Poland.Until the Georgia crisis, Poles didn't want the US missile shield. It was seen as another demonstration of Bush lunacy: a piece of kit that didn't work; a $100bn subsidy of American aerospace; a defence against an Iran that would use a terror cell with a dirty bomb before an ICBM; and a middle finger to a Kremlin that will take any pretext to whip up Russian nationalism to distract from its own failings. But now, the 10 interceptor missiles headed for Poland have real power \u2013 and that power is symbolic rather than tactical. With American boots and hardware on the ground in their country, Poles feel that they cannot be let down in the way they have been so many times before. The Kremlin's recent behavior, and long memories in this part of the world, makes Poles want that certainty.", "tags": ["Poland", "US news", "Russia", "World news", "Military", "Nato", "Europe"], "title": "Kamil Tchorek: Georgia has reawakened Poles' fear of Russian aggression"},{"date": "2008-08-20T11:08:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The US and Poland today signed a deal to site a US missile defence base in Poland, further straining Russia's relations with the west following the conflict in Georgia.The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, and the Polish foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, completed the formal agreement after 18 months of talks.Russia, angered by the deal, warned that Poland was making itself vulnerable to attack, including the possibility of a nuclear strike.\"The negotiations were very tough but friendly,\" said the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk. \"We have achieved our main goals, which means that our country and the United States will be more secure.\"The US has strongly denied Moscow's claims that the defence system is a threat to Russia. Speaking before the signing, Rice said: \"This is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone. \"This is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site ... that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st-century of a long-range missile threat from countries like Iran or from North Korea.\"However, a day after Warsaw and Washington reached initial agreement last week, a Russian general delivered a stark warning. \"Poland, by deploying [the system] is exposing itself to a strike \u2014 100%,\" said General Anatoly Nogovitsyn said, adding that Russian military doctrine permitted the use of nuclear weapons in such a situation.Russia keeps weapons and troops stationed in Kaliningrad, which is between Poland and Lithuania. Surveys show a majority of Poles - who initially rejected the idea of their country hosting the site - now believe it offers a form of protection beyond Nato after Russia's invasion of Georgia. At an emergency meeting in Brussels yesterday, the Nato secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, denounced Russian threats of a strike on Poland. \"It is pathetic rhetoric,\" he said. \"It is unhelpful and it leads nowhere.\" The deal will see 10 US interceptor missiles sited 115 miles from Russia's western frontier.During a year and a half of negotiations, talks stalled on Poland's demands for the US to bolster Polish security with Patriot missiles in exchange for hosting the base. Washington agreed to do so last week as Poland used the Georgia conflict to strengthen its case.The Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, said nobody \"who has good intentions towards us and towards the western world\" should be afraid of the defence system.", "tags": ["Poland", "US news", "Russia", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Poland and US sign missile defence deal"},{"date": "2008-08-15T23:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The risk of a new era of east-west confrontation triggered by Russia's invasion of Georgia heightened yesterday when Moscow reserved the right to launch a nuclear attack on Poland because it agreed to host US rockets as part of the Pentagon's missile shield.As Washington accused Russia of \"bullying and intimidation\" in Georgia and demanded an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from the small Black Sea neighbour, Russia's deputy chief of staff turned on Warsaw and said it was vulnerable to a Russian rocket attack because of Thursday's pact with the US on the missile defence project.\"By deploying, Poland is exposing itself to a strike - 100%,\" warned Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn. He added that Russia's security doctrine allowed it to use nuclear weapons against an active ally of a nuclear power such as America.The warning worsened the already dismal mood in relations between Moscow and the west caused by the shock of post-Soviet Russia's first invasion of a foreign country.There were scant signs of military activity on the ground in Georgia, but nor were there any signs of the Russian withdrawal pledged on Tuesday under ceasefire terms mediated by the European Union.Instead, the focus was on a flurry of diplomatic activity that exposed acute differences on how Washington and Berlin see the crisis in the Caucasus.Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, went to Tbilisi to bolster Georgia against the Russians as President George Bush denounced Russian \"bullying and intimidation\" as \"unacceptable\".Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, met Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev on the Black Sea close to Georgia's borders and sent quite a different message, offering a mild rebuke of Moscow.\"Some of Russia's actions were not proportionate,\" she said.Unlike the Americans and some European states who are saying the Russians should face \"consequences\" for their invasion, Merkel said negotiations with Moscow on a whole range of issues would continue as before and spread the blame for the conflict. \"It is rare that all the blame is on one side. In fact, both sides are probably to blame. That is very important to understand,\" she said.In Tbilisi, Rice was much more forthright, saying that the invasion had \"profound implications for Russia ... This calls into question what role Russia really plans to play in international politics.\"You can't be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours.\"The Russians have been refusing to pull back their forces in Georgia until President Mikheil Saakashvili signed the six-point ceasefire plan arranged by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France earlier this week, although the Russians had refused to sign it themselves.Saakashvili signed yesterday, while accusing the Russians of being \"evil\" and \"21st century barbarians\". Rice said Medvedev had also signed it.\"Russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west. It's going to replicate what happened in Georgia elsewhere,\" said Saakashvili. \"We are looking evil directly in the eye. Today this evil is very strong, and very dangerous for everybody, not just for us.\"Rice's show of solidarity with Georgia's beleaguered president was theatrically undermined when Russia dispatched a column of armoured personnel carriers towards the Georgian capital.As the talks were taking place, 10 armoured personnel carriers laden with Russian troops set off from Gori, penetrating to within 20 miles of Tbilisi.\"Georgia has been attacked. Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once,\" said Rice. The withdrawal \"must take place, and take place now ... This is no longer 1968,\" she added in reference to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago next week.The ceasefire terms favour the Russians who routed the Georgians. But the secretary of state argued the plan would not affect negotiations over the central territorial dispute between Georgia and the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The deal allows Russian troops to remain in the two provinces and to mount patrols and \"take additional security measures\" on Georgian territory beyond the two enclaves.Senior Russians continued to insist yesterday that Russian troops had not stepped outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia despite the fact they have been deep inside Georgian territory in several places all week.\"Our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone,\" said Sergei Ivanov, the deputy prime minister.Moscow also indicated it would resist possible European attempts to deploy international peacekeepers in the contested territories.\"We are not against international peacekeepers,\" the Russian president said. \"But the problem is that the Abkhazians and the Ossetians do not trust anyone except Russian peacekeepers.\" He also attacked the agreement between Washington and Warsaw on the missile shield and said claims that the shield was aimed at Iran were \"fairy tales\"\"This clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti-missile forces in Europe has as its aim the Russian Federation,\" said Medvedev. \"The moment has been well chosen.\"The timing of Thursday's agreement on missile defence means that tensions are soaring on Russia's southern and western borders.Polish armed forces yesterday paraded in Warsaw to mark a rare defeat of the Russians 88 years ago and President Lech Kaczynski hailed the accord on the Pentagon project as a boost for Poland's security.In return for hosting 10 interceptor rockets said to be intended to destroy any eventual ballistic missile attacks from Iran, Poland is to receive a battery of US Patriot missiles for its air defences and has won a mutual security pact with Washington.\u00b7 This article was amended on Monday August 18 2008.

Earlier this year, NATO endorsed the US plan to expand its global missile defence shield with the planned site in Poland and a linked radar tracking base in the Czech Republic.\"Only evil people should be afraid of our agreement,\" Sikorski told reporters after Rood and his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Kremer, initialed the agreement at the Foreign Ministry.The US has also reached an agreement with the Czech government to place the radar component of the shield in that country.

He is to travel to Dublin and Prague to try to cajole the Irish into staging a second vote on the EU's stalled reform blueprint and to push for a speedier Czech approval of the plan, as well as intervening with President Lech Kaczynski of Poland, who yesterday announced he was suspending ratification of the treaty until Ireland decided what to do.\"For the time being the question of the treaty is pointless,\" Kaczynski told the Warsaw newspaper Dziennik in a surprise announcement timed to coincide with the first day of the Sarkozy EU presidency.The Franco-German strategy for dealing with the Irish rebuff is to get the other 26 EU countries to ratify the treaty as quickly as possible and to isolate the Irish. Of the 26, 19 have already ratified.But the Polish and Czech resistance indicates that Sarkozy's strategy of quarantining the Irish is unravelling and that the Irish contagion is spreading. The bombshell from Warsaw will test Sarkozy's fabled talent for striking deals and complicate his ambitious EU agenda.The Polish parliament has ratified the treaty, but Kaczynski, who signed the treaty in Lisbon last December, still has to endorse that ratification.Sarkozy told journalists in the Elys\u00e9e Palace that a main aim over the next six months was to rescue the Lisbon treaty - \"to solve the institutional crisis, to find a solution despite the deadlock we're currently facing\".A senior Elys\u00e9e source described Kaczynski as difficult. \"He has never been a particularly easy partner to work with in building and shaping Europe,\" he said. \"I can't imagine how the [Polish] president can go against the will of the parliament. It's odd.\"The French are telling the central Europeans, who are keen advocates of EU enlargement in the Balkans and into the former Soviet Union, that no new countries will join the EU unless the Lisbon treaty is adopted. \"I will fight to ensure that EU membership does not exceed 27,\" said the Elys\u00e9e source.The Germans, who masterminded the treaty last year as a response to the failed European constitution, are also desperate to salvage the package, which streamlines the way the EU functions, takes decisions, reduces the European commission and creates new posts of a European president and foreign minister.\"The Czechs will be persuaded in the end. Otherwise there can be no more enlargement,\" said Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister. \"If [the Czechs] dig in their heels, they will start their presidency [in January] in great isolation,\" said the Elys\u00e9e source.But the central Europeans are furious at what they perceive to be bullying from the French and the Germans. President Vaclav Klaus in Prague, the EU's biggest Eurosceptic, has described the treaty as dead and the Czech upper house has parked the treaty in the country's supreme court.\"We're not blocking anything,\" said Alexandr Vondra, the Czech deputy prime minister, calling for an end to the mudslinging that has followed the Irish rejection earlier this month.Despite the mounting problems, Sarkozy is planning a political fix in the hope that the Irish can be cajoled into running a second referendum.The senior French source said the aim was to \"have an escape hatch\" prepared by an EU summit in October and to sway the Irish by offering them \"political commitments\" which would probably focus on guaranteeing the Irish a permanent seat in the European commission.

The first wave of Polish immigration to the UK took place at the end of the second world war, when an estimated 200,000 Poles were given British citizenship, one way or another, because of Kremlin foreign policy.Many had been deported by Russian troops from eastern Poland to Siberian concentration camps when the Nazis and Soviets were allied with each other at the start of the war. When the Soviets changed sides and allied with the British, the Poles were released and formed the \"Anders army\", which trekked from Siberia to Iran to join the British army for the north Africa and Italy campaigns. These Polish war veterans couldn't return to their country at the end of the war, because it had been taken by Stalin at Yalta. Those naive enough to return faced imprisonment or death. The rest formed the Polish communities in Hammersmith, Ealing and elsewhere, that have given hope to Polish migrants ever since.So most Polish people, especially members of the Polish British community, relate to the subjects of history and international relations in a deeply personal way. My grandfather served in the Polish army that defeated the Soviet invasion of Europe 1920. My father lived through the 1944 Warsaw uprising, in which the Red Army stood by and watched Nazis massacre the inhabitants of the city. I have childhood memories of Poland in the 1970s and 1980s. We would talk subversively in the home, but knew not to breathe a word of it on the telephone or on the street, all because of the Kremlin's might.This said, neither I nor most people with Polish roots, including those whose families were deported to Siberia, have any dislike of Russian people. Quite the contrary, Poles love the Russian language, literature and music. Poles have sympathy for the Russian nation, because historically their leaders, from Ivan the Terrible to Josef Stalin have treated them even worse than they have treated the people of Poland.Until the Georgia crisis, Poles didn't want the US missile shield. It was seen as another demonstration of Bush lunacy: a piece of kit that didn't work; a $100bn subsidy of American aerospace; a defence against an Iran that would use a terror cell with a dirty bomb before an ICBM; and a middle finger to a Kremlin that will take any pretext to whip up Russian nationalism to distract from its own failings. But now, the 10 interceptor missiles headed for Poland have real power \u2013 and that power is symbolic rather than tactical. With American boots and hardware on the ground in their country, Poles feel that they cannot be let down in the way they have been so many times before. The Kremlin's recent behavior, and long memories in this part of the world, makes Poles want that certainty.", "tags": ["Poland", "US news", "Russia", "World news", "Military", "Nato", "Europe"], "title": "Kamil Tchorek: Georgia has reawakened Poles' fear of Russian aggression"},{"date": "2008-08-20T11:08:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The US and Poland today signed a deal to site a US missile defence base in Poland, further straining Russia's relations with the west following the conflict in Georgia.The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, and the Polish foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, completed the formal agreement after 18 months of talks.Russia, angered by the deal, warned that Poland was making itself vulnerable to attack, including the possibility of a nuclear strike.\"The negotiations were very tough but friendly,\" said the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk. \"We have achieved our main goals, which means that our country and the United States will be more secure.\"The US has strongly denied Moscow's claims that the defence system is a threat to Russia. Speaking before the signing, Rice said: \"This is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone. \"This is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site ... that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st-century of a long-range missile threat from countries like Iran or from North Korea.\"However, a day after Warsaw and Washington reached initial agreement last week, a Russian general delivered a stark warning. \"Poland, by deploying [the system] is exposing itself to a strike \u2014 100%,\" said General Anatoly Nogovitsyn said, adding that Russian military doctrine permitted the use of nuclear weapons in such a situation.Russia keeps weapons and troops stationed in Kaliningrad, which is between Poland and Lithuania. Surveys show a majority of Poles - who initially rejected the idea of their country hosting the site - now believe it offers a form of protection beyond Nato after Russia's invasion of Georgia. At an emergency meeting in Brussels yesterday, the Nato secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, denounced Russian threats of a strike on Poland. \"It is pathetic rhetoric,\" he said. \"It is unhelpful and it leads nowhere.\" The deal will see 10 US interceptor missiles sited 115 miles from Russia's western frontier.During a year and a half of negotiations, talks stalled on Poland's demands for the US to bolster Polish security with Patriot missiles in exchange for hosting the base. Washington agreed to do so last week as Poland used the Georgia conflict to strengthen its case.The Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, said nobody \"who has good intentions towards us and towards the western world\" should be afraid of the defence system.", "tags": ["Poland", "US news", "Russia", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Poland and US sign missile defence deal"},{"date": "2008-08-15T23:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The risk of a new era of east-west confrontation triggered by Russia's invasion of Georgia heightened yesterday when Moscow reserved the right to launch a nuclear attack on Poland because it agreed to host US rockets as part of the Pentagon's missile shield.As Washington accused Russia of \"bullying and intimidation\" in Georgia and demanded an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from the small Black Sea neighbour, Russia's deputy chief of staff turned on Warsaw and said it was vulnerable to a Russian rocket attack because of Thursday's pact with the US on the missile defence project.\"By deploying, Poland is exposing itself to a strike - 100%,\" warned Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn. He added that Russia's security doctrine allowed it to use nuclear weapons against an active ally of a nuclear power such as America.The warning worsened the already dismal mood in relations between Moscow and the west caused by the shock of post-Soviet Russia's first invasion of a foreign country.There were scant signs of military activity on the ground in Georgia, but nor were there any signs of the Russian withdrawal pledged on Tuesday under ceasefire terms mediated by the European Union.Instead, the focus was on a flurry of diplomatic activity that exposed acute differences on how Washington and Berlin see the crisis in the Caucasus.Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, went to Tbilisi to bolster Georgia against the Russians as President George Bush denounced Russian \"bullying and intimidation\" as \"unacceptable\".Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, met Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev on the Black Sea close to Georgia's borders and sent quite a different message, offering a mild rebuke of Moscow.\"Some of Russia's actions were not proportionate,\" she said.Unlike the Americans and some European states who are saying the Russians should face \"consequences\" for their invasion, Merkel said negotiations with Moscow on a whole range of issues would continue as before and spread the blame for the conflict. \"It is rare that all the blame is on one side. In fact, both sides are probably to blame. That is very important to understand,\" she said.In Tbilisi, Rice was much more forthright, saying that the invasion had \"profound implications for Russia ... This calls into question what role Russia really plans to play in international politics.\"You can't be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours.\"The Russians have been refusing to pull back their forces in Georgia until President Mikheil Saakashvili signed the six-point ceasefire plan arranged by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France earlier this week, although the Russians had refused to sign it themselves.Saakashvili signed yesterday, while accusing the Russians of being \"evil\" and \"21st century barbarians\". Rice said Medvedev had also signed it.\"Russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west. It's going to replicate what happened in Georgia elsewhere,\" said Saakashvili. \"We are looking evil directly in the eye. Today this evil is very strong, and very dangerous for everybody, not just for us.\"Rice's show of solidarity with Georgia's beleaguered president was theatrically undermined when Russia dispatched a column of armoured personnel carriers towards the Georgian capital.As the talks were taking place, 10 armoured personnel carriers laden with Russian troops set off from Gori, penetrating to within 20 miles of Tbilisi.\"Georgia has been attacked. Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once,\" said Rice. The withdrawal \"must take place, and take place now ... This is no longer 1968,\" she added in reference to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago next week.The ceasefire terms favour the Russians who routed the Georgians. But the secretary of state argued the plan would not affect negotiations over the central territorial dispute between Georgia and the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The deal allows Russian troops to remain in the two provinces and to mount patrols and \"take additional security measures\" on Georgian territory beyond the two enclaves.Senior Russians continued to insist yesterday that Russian troops had not stepped outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia despite the fact they have been deep inside Georgian territory in several places all week.\"Our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone,\" said Sergei Ivanov, the deputy prime minister.Moscow also indicated it would resist possible European attempts to deploy international peacekeepers in the contested territories.\"We are not against international peacekeepers,\" the Russian president said. \"But the problem is that the Abkhazians and the Ossetians do not trust anyone except Russian peacekeepers.\" He also attacked the agreement between Washington and Warsaw on the missile shield and said claims that the shield was aimed at Iran were \"fairy tales\"\"This clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti-missile forces in Europe has as its aim the Russian Federation,\" said Medvedev. \"The moment has been well chosen.\"The timing of Thursday's agreement on missile defence means that tensions are soaring on Russia's southern and western borders.Polish armed forces yesterday paraded in Warsaw to mark a rare defeat of the Russians 88 years ago and President Lech Kaczynski hailed the accord on the Pentagon project as a boost for Poland's security.In return for hosting 10 interceptor rockets said to be intended to destroy any eventual ballistic missile attacks from Iran, Poland is to receive a battery of US Patriot missiles for its air defences and has won a mutual security pact with Washington.\u00b7 This article was amended on Monday August 18 2008.

He is to travel to Dublin and Prague to try to cajole the Irish into staging a second vote on the EU's stalled reform blueprint and to push for a speedier Czech approval of the plan, as well as intervening with President Lech Kaczynski of Poland, who yesterday announced he was suspending ratification of the treaty until Ireland decided what to do.\"For the time being the question of the treaty is pointless,\" Kaczynski told the Warsaw newspaper Dziennik in a surprise announcement timed to coincide with the first day of the Sarkozy EU presidency.The Franco-German strategy for dealing with the Irish rebuff is to get the other 26 EU countries to ratify the treaty as quickly as possible and to isolate the Irish. Of the 26, 19 have already ratified.But the Polish and Czech resistance indicates that Sarkozy's strategy of quarantining the Irish is unravelling and that the Irish contagion is spreading. The bombshell from Warsaw will test Sarkozy's fabled talent for striking deals and complicate his ambitious EU agenda.The Polish parliament has ratified the treaty, but Kaczynski, who signed the treaty in Lisbon last December, still has to endorse that ratification.Sarkozy told journalists in the Elys\u00e9e Palace that a main aim over the next six months was to rescue the Lisbon treaty - \"to solve the institutional crisis, to find a solution despite the deadlock we're currently facing\".A senior Elys\u00e9e source described Kaczynski as difficult. \"He has never been a particularly easy partner to work with in building and shaping Europe,\" he said. \"I can't imagine how the [Polish] president can go against the will of the parliament. It's odd.\"The French are telling the central Europeans, who are keen advocates of EU enlargement in the Balkans and into the former Soviet Union, that no new countries will join the EU unless the Lisbon treaty is adopted. \"I will fight to ensure that EU membership does not exceed 27,\" said the Elys\u00e9e source.The Germans, who masterminded the treaty last year as a response to the failed European constitution, are also desperate to salvage the package, which streamlines the way the EU functions, takes decisions, reduces the European commission and creates new posts of a European president and foreign minister.\"The Czechs will be persuaded in the end. Otherwise there can be no more enlargement,\" said Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister. \"If [the Czechs] dig in their heels, they will start their presidency [in January] in great isolation,\" said the Elys\u00e9e source.But the central Europeans are furious at what they perceive to be bullying from the French and the Germans. President Vaclav Klaus in Prague, the EU's biggest Eurosceptic, has described the treaty as dead and the Czech upper house has parked the treaty in the country's supreme court.\"We're not blocking anything,\" said Alexandr Vondra, the Czech deputy prime minister, calling for an end to the mudslinging that has followed the Irish rejection earlier this month.Despite the mounting problems, Sarkozy is planning a political fix in the hope that the Irish can be cajoled into running a second referendum.The senior French source said the aim was to \"have an escape hatch\" prepared by an EU summit in October and to sway the Irish by offering them \"political commitments\" which would probably focus on guaranteeing the Irish a permanent seat in the European commission.

For decades, it was home to the poorest of Warsaw's poor, and the derelict streets were ruled by the criminal underworld.But in recent years, those who have ventured across the Vistula River have found that Praga is blossoming into one of new Europe's creative capitals. Today, renovated pre-war factories and warehouses are the favourite haunts of the artistic, as bars, clubs, galleries and restaurants have transformed the historic back alleys. The scene couldn't be more different from polished downtown Warsaw, where the almost total devastation of the second world war has ensured that everything \u2013 including the \"Old Town\" \u2013 is brand new. Praga is both genuinely antique and genuinely decrepit. The beautiful old buildings are crumbling, rusting iron bars jut out from walls pitted by wartime bullets and the delicate art nouveau facades are thick with grime. But the streets themselves burst with life. This is a neighbourhood of small shops and street markets, where children play unattended in the alleys and every courtyard shelters an icon of the Virgin Mary. After dark, Praga really shines. Its nightlife, weaving between the cutting-edge and the downright surreal, pulls in revellers from every corner of the city. The walls may be cracking, the furniture rarely matches and there's a good chance the bartender is a volunteer, but for many, Praga's bars and clubs fill a void left by Warsaw's headlong race toward westernisation. \"This is the real city. Here you feel a pulse,\" said local artist Marta Wojcicka. \"I think that in 20 years it will be like Tribeca or Soho, but right now Praga is still the wild district of Warsaw.\"Several years ago composer and producer Wojciech Trzcinski started a trend when he transformed this turn-of-the-century marmalade factory into the epicentre of Praga's culture scene, including a restaurant, club and gallery.

Micky.\" I felt the same. I spent time in prison back then. There where two kinds of communists on our side of the iron curtain: those who shot and those who were shot at. For us, the reds, brought up at state universities, Solidarity was first of all the workers movement. In a country ruled by the Polish United Workers party, we saw for the first time in our lives workers speaking, attending rallies, arguing and voting, electing their representatives. Factory striking committees sent delegates to umbrella committees and from there on to the national striking committee. This was a workers' democracy that resembled that of the Soviets in the early days of the Bolshevik revolution. For 16 months this strange sociopolitical movement based on strikes co-governed a huge state that was part of the Soviet bloc. We called it \"The Carnival\".Jaruzelski put tanks on the streets, justifying his actions with the slogan: \"We are going to defend socialism, just as we do the independence of the country\". But it was completely wrong. OK, he had a difficult choice. If he didn't shoot at Polish workers he would supposedly have had to shoot at Russian tanks. But though our independence might have been in danger, socialism, which was under the workers' control, wasn't. At the end of the day it was the former Communist party apparatchiks who most were the most eager purveyors of barbaric capitalism in Poland. And the transition went so smoothly because Jaruzelski had done the dirty work of crushing Solidarity, the only force which could have saved socialism or even created a new, democratic form of it.Now, the great hope is over. It is not exciting to be Polish any more. The opposition and communist elites made a deal over people's heads. They traded free lunches at factory canteens for everyone for brunches at the Marriott hotel for those who betrayed their comrades (in the case of Solidarity) and their ideology (in the case of party members). Balcerowicz's neoliberal shock therapy took more lives than martial law. The rate of suicides due to unemployment, poverty and evictions has risen dramatically. Ironically, Jaruzelski is responsible for both martial law and capitalism. He paved the way for Balcerowicz, who also happened to be a former politburo lecturer. And now those who have made Poles work more hours than any other European nation, who have made 25% of Polish children go hungry (according to the latest EU report) are judging an old man who gave them a helping hand.I spoke to Jaruzelski in the early 1990s. It was a nice long chat between the former dictator and his political prisoner. He was indignant about his former party colleagues' behaviour, for example the draconian eviction law passed by the post-communist (Democratic Left Alliance) government. Most Poles have forgiven him and the vast majority perceive Jaruzelski as a national hero who saved us from a Soviet invasion.For me he is a dramatic figure. The world order created by Yalta taught Poles to pursue the lesser evil. Jaruzelski's choice was wrong but well-intentioned. Politicians, especially rightwing politicians, and especially President Kaczynski, want to rewrite history. They call it \"historical policy\". I hate it. They can't supply flats, healthcare, good jobs, pensions, decent wages. Instead they'll throw Jaruzelski to the mob. But nobody is buying it. Two million have already emigrated.

Speaking before the signing, Rice said: \"This is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone. \"This is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site ... that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st-century of a long-range missile threat from countries like Iran or from North Korea.\"However, a day after Warsaw and Washington reached initial agreement last week, a Russian general delivered a stark warning. \"Poland, by deploying [the system] is exposing itself to a strike \u2014 100%,\" said General Anatoly Nogovitsyn said, adding that Russian military doctrine permitted the use of nuclear weapons in such a situation.Russia keeps weapons and troops stationed in Kaliningrad, which is between Poland and Lithuania. Surveys show a majority of Poles - who initially rejected the idea of their country hosting the site - now believe it offers a form of protection beyond Nato after Russia's invasion of Georgia. At an emergency meeting in Brussels yesterday, the Nato secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, denounced Russian threats of a strike on Poland. \"It is pathetic rhetoric,\" he said. \"It is unhelpful and it leads nowhere.\" The deal will see 10 US interceptor missiles sited 115 miles from Russia's western frontier.During a year and a half of negotiations, talks stalled on Poland's demands for the US to bolster Polish security with Patriot missiles in exchange for hosting the base. Washington agreed to do so last week as Poland used the Georgia conflict to strengthen its case.The Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, said nobody \"who has good intentions towards us and towards the western world\" should be afraid of the defence system.", "tags": ["Poland", "US news", "Russia", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Poland and US sign missile defence deal"},{"date": "2008-08-15T23:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The risk of a new era of east-west confrontation triggered by Russia's invasion of Georgia heightened yesterday when Moscow reserved the right to launch a nuclear attack on Poland because it agreed to host US rockets as part of the Pentagon's missile shield.As Washington accused Russia of \"bullying and intimidation\" in Georgia and demanded an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from the small Black Sea neighbour, Russia's deputy chief of staff turned on Warsaw and said it was vulnerable to a Russian rocket attack because of Thursday's pact with the US on the missile defence project.\"By deploying, Poland is exposing itself to a strike - 100%,\" warned Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn. He added that Russia's security doctrine allowed it to use nuclear weapons against an active ally of a nuclear power such as America.The warning worsened the already dismal mood in relations between Moscow and the west caused by the shock of post-Soviet Russia's first invasion of a foreign country.There were scant signs of military activity on the ground in Georgia, but nor were there any signs of the Russian withdrawal pledged on Tuesday under ceasefire terms mediated by the European Union.Instead, the focus was on a flurry of diplomatic activity that exposed acute differences on how Washington and Berlin see the crisis in the Caucasus.Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, went to Tbilisi to bolster Georgia against the Russians as President George Bush denounced Russian \"bullying and intimidation\" as \"unacceptable\".Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, met Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev on the Black Sea close to Georgia's borders and sent quite a different message, offering a mild rebuke of Moscow.\"Some of Russia's actions were not proportionate,\" she said.Unlike the Americans and some European states who are saying the Russians should face \"consequences\" for their invasion, Merkel said negotiations with Moscow on a whole range of issues would continue as before and spread the blame for the conflict. \"It is rare that all the blame is on one side. In fact, both sides are probably to blame. That is very important to understand,\" she said.In Tbilisi, Rice was much more forthright, saying that the invasion had \"profound implications for Russia ... This calls into question what role Russia really plans to play in international politics.\"You can't be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours.\"The Russians have been refusing to pull back their forces in Georgia until President Mikheil Saakashvili signed the six-point ceasefire plan arranged by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France earlier this week, although the Russians had refused to sign it themselves.Saakashvili signed yesterday, while accusing the Russians of being \"evil\" and \"21st century barbarians\". Rice said Medvedev had also signed it.\"Russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west. It's going to replicate what happened in Georgia elsewhere,\" said Saakashvili. \"We are looking evil directly in the eye. Today this evil is very strong, and very dangerous for everybody, not just for us.\"Rice's show of solidarity with Georgia's beleaguered president was theatrically undermined when Russia dispatched a column of armoured personnel carriers towards the Georgian capital.As the talks were taking place, 10 armoured personnel carriers laden with Russian troops set off from Gori, penetrating to within 20 miles of Tbilisi.\"Georgia has been attacked. Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once,\" said Rice. The withdrawal \"must take place, and take place now ... This is no longer 1968,\" she added in reference to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago next week.The ceasefire terms favour the Russians who routed the Georgians. But the secretary of state argued the plan would not affect negotiations over the central territorial dispute between Georgia and the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The deal allows Russian troops to remain in the two provinces and to mount patrols and \"take additional security measures\" on Georgian territory beyond the two enclaves.Senior Russians continued to insist yesterday that Russian troops had not stepped outside South Ossetia and Abkhazia despite the fact they have been deep inside Georgian territory in several places all week.\"Our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone,\" said Sergei Ivanov, the deputy prime minister.Moscow also indicated it would resist possible European attempts to deploy international peacekeepers in the contested territories.\"We are not against international peacekeepers,\" the Russian president said. \"But the problem is that the Abkhazians and the Ossetians do not trust anyone except Russian peacekeepers.\" He also attacked the agreement between Washington and Warsaw on the missile shield and said claims that the shield was aimed at Iran were \"fairy tales\"\"This clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti-missile forces in Europe has as its aim the Russian Federation,\" said Medvedev. \"The moment has been well chosen.\"The timing of Thursday's agreement on missile defence means that tensions are soaring on Russia's southern and western borders.Polish armed forces yesterday paraded in Warsaw to mark a rare defeat of the Russians 88 years ago and President Lech Kaczynski hailed the accord on the Pentagon project as a boost for Poland's security.In return for hosting 10 interceptor rockets said to be intended to destroy any eventual ballistic missile attacks from Iran, Poland is to receive a battery of US Patriot missiles for its air defences and has won a mutual security pact with Washington.\u00b7 This article was amended on Monday August 18 2008.

He is to travel to Dublin and Prague to try to cajole the Irish into staging a second vote on the EU's stalled reform blueprint and to push for a speedier Czech approval of the plan, as well as intervening with President Lech Kaczynski of Poland, who yesterday announced he was suspending ratification of the treaty until Ireland decided what to do.\"For the time being the question of the treaty is pointless,\" Kaczynski told the Warsaw newspaper Dziennik in a surprise announcement timed to coincide with the first day of the Sarkozy EU presidency.The Franco-German strategy for dealing with the Irish rebuff is to get the other 26 EU countries to ratify the treaty as quickly as possible and to isolate the Irish. Of the 26, 19 have already ratified.But the Polish and Czech resistance indicates that Sarkozy's strategy of quarantining the Irish is unravelling and that the Irish contagion is spreading. The bombshell from Warsaw will test Sarkozy's fabled talent for striking deals and complicate his ambitious EU agenda.The Polish parliament has ratified the treaty, but Kaczynski, who signed the treaty in Lisbon last December, still has to endorse that ratification.Sarkozy told journalists in the Elys\u00e9e Palace that a main aim over the next six months was to rescue the Lisbon treaty - \"to solve the institutional crisis, to find a solution despite the deadlock we're currently facing\".A senior Elys\u00e9e source described Kaczynski as difficult. \"He has never been a particularly easy partner to work with in building and shaping Europe,\" he said. \"I can't imagine how the [Polish] president can go against the will of the parliament. It's odd.\"The French are telling the central Europeans, who are keen advocates of EU enlargement in the Balkans and into the former Soviet Union, that no new countries will join the EU unless the Lisbon treaty is adopted. \"I will fight to ensure that EU membership does not exceed 27,\" said the Elys\u00e9e source.The Germans, who masterminded the treaty last year as a response to the failed European constitution, are also desperate to salvage the package, which streamlines the way the EU functions, takes decisions, reduces the European commission and creates new posts of a European president and foreign minister.\"The Czechs will be persuaded in the end. Otherwise there can be no more enlargement,\" said Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister. \"If [the Czechs] dig in their heels, they will start their presidency [in January] in great isolation,\" said the Elys\u00e9e source.But the central Europeans are furious at what they perceive to be bullying from the French and the Germans. President Vaclav Klaus in Prague, the EU's biggest Eurosceptic, has described the treaty as dead and the Czech upper house has parked the treaty in the country's supreme court.\"We're not blocking anything,\" said Alexandr Vondra, the Czech deputy prime minister, calling for an end to the mudslinging that has followed the Irish rejection earlier this month.Despite the mounting problems, Sarkozy is planning a political fix in the hope that the Irish can be cajoled into running a second referendum.The senior French source said the aim was to \"have an escape hatch\" prepared by an EU summit in October and to sway the Irish by offering them \"political commitments\" which would probably focus on guaranteeing the Irish a permanent seat in the European commission.

For decades, it was home to the poorest of Warsaw's poor, and the derelict streets were ruled by the criminal underworld.But in recent years, those who have ventured across the Vistula River have found that Praga is blossoming into one of new Europe's creative capitals. Today, renovated pre-war factories and warehouses are the favourite haunts of the artistic, as bars, clubs, galleries and restaurants have transformed the historic back alleys. The scene couldn't be more different from polished downtown Warsaw, where the almost total devastation of the second world war has ensured that everything \u2013 including the \"Old Town\" \u2013 is brand new. Praga is both genuinely antique and genuinely decrepit. The beautiful old buildings are crumbling, rusting iron bars jut out from walls pitted by wartime bullets and the delicate art nouveau facades are thick with grime. But the streets themselves burst with life. This is a neighbourhood of small shops and street markets, where children play unattended in the alleys and every courtyard shelters an icon of the Virgin Mary. After dark, Praga really shines. Its nightlife, weaving between the cutting-edge and the downright surreal, pulls in revellers from every corner of the city. The walls may be cracking, the furniture rarely matches and there's a good chance the bartender is a volunteer, but for many, Praga's bars and clubs fill a void left by Warsaw's headlong race toward westernisation. \"This is the real city. Here you feel a pulse,\" said local artist Marta Wojcicka. \"I think that in 20 years it will be like Tribeca or Soho, but right now Praga is still the wild district of Warsaw.\"Several years ago composer and producer Wojciech Trzcinski started a trend when he transformed this turn-of-the-century marmalade factory into the epicentre of Praga's culture scene, including a restaurant, club and gallery.

Micky.\" I felt the same. I spent time in prison back then. There where two kinds of communists on our side of the iron curtain: those who shot and those who were shot at. For us, the reds, brought up at state universities, Solidarity was first of all the workers movement. In a country ruled by the Polish United Workers party, we saw for the first time in our lives workers speaking, attending rallies, arguing and voting, electing their representatives. Factory striking committees sent delegates to umbrella committees and from there on to the national striking committee. This was a workers' democracy that resembled that of the Soviets in the early days of the Bolshevik revolution. For 16 months this strange sociopolitical movement based on strikes co-governed a huge state that was part of the Soviet bloc. We called it \"The Carnival\".Jaruzelski put tanks on the streets, justifying his actions with the slogan: \"We are going to defend socialism, just as we do the independence of the country\". But it was completely wrong. OK, he had a difficult choice. If he didn't shoot at Polish workers he would supposedly have had to shoot at Russian tanks. But though our independence might have been in danger, socialism, which was under the workers' control, wasn't. At the end of the day it was the former Communist party apparatchiks who most were the most eager purveyors of barbaric capitalism in Poland. And the transition went so smoothly because Jaruzelski had done the dirty work of crushing Solidarity, the only force which could have saved socialism or even created a new, democratic form of it.Now, the great hope is over. It is not exciting to be Polish any more. The opposition and communist elites made a deal over people's heads. They traded free lunches at factory canteens for everyone for brunches at the Marriott hotel for those who betrayed their comrades (in the case of Solidarity) and their ideology (in the case of party members). Balcerowicz's neoliberal shock therapy took more lives than martial law. The rate of suicides due to unemployment, poverty and evictions has risen dramatically. Ironically, Jaruzelski is responsible for both martial law and capitalism. He paved the way for Balcerowicz, who also happened to be a former politburo lecturer. And now those who have made Poles work more hours than any other European nation, who have made 25% of Polish children go hungry (according to the latest EU report) are judging an old man who gave them a helping hand.I spoke to Jaruzelski in the early 1990s. It was a nice long chat between the former dictator and his political prisoner. He was indignant about his former party colleagues' behaviour, for example the draconian eviction law passed by the post-communist (Democratic Left Alliance) government. Most Poles have forgiven him and the vast majority perceive Jaruzelski as a national hero who saved us from a Soviet invasion.For me he is a dramatic figure. The world order created by Yalta taught Poles to pursue the lesser evil. Jaruzelski's choice was wrong but well-intentioned. Politicians, especially rightwing politicians, and especially President Kaczynski, want to rewrite history. They call it \"historical policy\". I hate it. They can't supply flats, healthcare, good jobs, pensions, decent wages. Instead they'll throw Jaruzelski to the mob. But nobody is buying it. Two million have already emigrated.

It has 50,000 workers in this country, among them many doctors, nurses and construction workers whose skills are now in high demand at home.Jinga said a number of factors including the high cost of renting homes in the UK and the falling value of the pound had to be weighed against the benefits of higher salaries in the UK. 'Salaries are not everything,' he said. 'It is brilliant to work and live in England, but there are important incentives for returning.' He added: 'We cannot afford to lose our best brains.' Although Jinga insists he is working closely with the British government, the Romanians' action will be seen by many as a counter-attack against the UK in response to special 'transition' rules that London imposed on Romania and Bulgaria when the countries joined the EU in January 2007.Because of concerns about the level of immigration at the time, Tony Blair's government imposed a seven-year programme of restrictions under which Romanian and Bulgarian citizens had to apply for jobs in specific sectors in order to work in this country. Previously people from new EU entrant countries had been allowed in without any restrictions.Romania and Bulgaria felt victimised. Although they are still working for the restrictions to be lifted - and for better conditions for those working here - their main thrust is now to make sure as many skilled people as possible remain in their homeland.Already there is evidence that British industry is suffering as eastern Europeans begin to return home. A recent report by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that 540,000 of the adult migrants who have come from the EU's new member states have already returned.A spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses said: 'It will be worrying for many companies if there is a wholesale movement back home.'

(Indeed, Poznan itself, as the fourth largest industrial centre in Poland, is home to many of the industrial lobbyists who have helped to fuel such concerns.)The meeting in Brussels is arguably the more important of the two events. Europe has contributed more to the global climate problem than any other party represented at the negotiations, so the world will be watching very carefully. A weak deal there could have a much greater impact on next year's all-important UN summit in Copenhagen than the detailed discussions going on in Poznan.Poland's unhelpful position is not hard to understand. Reliant on coal for 95% of its energy, the nation's carbon footprint is substantial.

Charged with producing a plan for cutting carbon emissions, governments have so far produced copious amounts of hot air and little else, with ministers recycling vague promises of future action.They doubtless go to bed at night muttering a variant of St Augustine's prayer: \"Oh Lord make us chaste - but not just yet.\" Unfortunately, this is one of those now or never moments. The conference marks the halfway point on the road map for negotiating a new UN climate convention. It is supposed to prepare the ground for a global grand bargain aimed at tackling the greatest challenge that humanity has faced.Put starkly, Poznan must head off a collision between the energy systems that drive our economies, and the Earth's biosphere. Ambitious targets must be at the heart of any agreement. But we also need a new institutional architecture for cooperation between rich and poor countries.If we are to have any chance of keeping global temperature increases below a 2C tipping point, greenhouse gas emissions will have to fall by over 50% by 2050. On current trends, they will rise by 50% by 2030. Such an outcome would lead to unprecedented reversals in human development in our lifetime followed in short order by ecological catastrophe for future generations. Economies can recover from a financial crisis. But there is no antidote or rewind button for global warming.At Poznan, rich countries should be taking the lead. They need to signal a binding commitment to reducing their carbon footprint by at least 80%. More than that, they need to signal serious intent. Above all, that means closing the gap between climate change targets and energy policies.The British government's carbon budget targets are ambitious. They are also inconsistent with current policies on renewable energy, the commissioning of coal-fired power stations, and another runway at Heathrow. The EU may have set carbon quota ceilings, but these are way above the targets set for cutting emissions. President-elect Obama is inheriting a climate change policy bereft of credible targets or strategies.Rich countries have the financial resources and technological capacity to make a rapid low-carbon transition: by putting a higher price on carbon emissions through taxation, quotas, and tougher regulatory standards, and developing and commercialising new technologies. Carbon capture and storage is a priority, yet neither the US nor the EU has gone beyond small-scale pilot projects.Rich countries also need to lay the foundations for a new global compact with developing countries. It is not just that these countries are home to the populations most vulnerable to climate change. They also account for the bulk of the projected increase in CO2 emissions to 2030, with coal-fired economic growth in China and India the main driver. Governments in Poznan need to put in place three foundations for a global deal. First, we need a plan of action on adaptation backed by increased aid. For millions of vulnerable people in drought-prone areas of Africa, flood zones in South Asia, and elsewhere, dangerous climate change is is happening now.Second, developed countries need to reduce deforestation. Investments of $17-30bn annually could halve deforestation levels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 10%.Third, the world needs a Marshall Plan for low-carbon financing and technology transfer. Scaling-up emissions trading must be part of that plan, alongside wider multilateral mechanisms. Covering the incremental costs of low carbon technologies for coal-fired power generation and renewable energy would give developing countries an incentive to join a global deal - and to decarbonise their energy systems.The world cannot afford the type of shambolic display on show in Poznan. Over the past few months, rich governments have moved financial mountains to protect the integrity of their banking systems. What price the ecological integrity of our planet, the wellbeing of future generations, and our commitments to the world's poor?\u2022 Kevin Watkins is senior research fellow at Oxford University's global economic governance programme geg@univ.ox.ac.uk", "tags": ["Poznan climate change conference", "Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Global climate talks"], "title": "Kevin Watkins: Climate change negotiations in Poland are heading nowhere fast"},{"date": "2008-10-07T18:41:12Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The environmental group 350.org, spearheaded by American green activist Bill McKibben, has issued a canny challenge to John McCain and Barack Obama: come to the UN's next round of talks on global carbon emissions reductions, to be held this December in Poznan, Poland.McCain and Obama have both proclaimed themselves supportive of a global agreement to combat climate change during next year's Copenhagen conference, to which the Poznan talks serve as a prelude of sorts.

In the middle of a global shipbuilding boom, the two yards made a loss on every ship they built.Under the new scheme Poland will have to sell off assets, at market prices, so it will not be saddled with any liabilities. Kroes said that the yards could carry on building ships but the government could not insist that the new owners retained the current workforce of 10,000.", "tags": ["Poland", "Business", "World news", "Water transport", "Europe"], "title": "EU force Poland to sell off shipyards and pay back \u20ac2.3bn in subsidies"},{"date": "2008-12-06T00:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The crucial climate change negotiations in Poznan, Poland, are heading nowhere fast. Charged with producing a plan for cutting carbon emissions, governments have so far produced copious amounts of hot air and little else, with ministers recycling vague promises of future action.They doubtless go to bed at night muttering a variant of St Augustine's prayer: \"Oh Lord make us chaste - but not just yet.\" Unfortunately, this is one of those now or never moments. The conference marks the halfway point on the road map for negotiating a new UN climate convention. It is supposed to prepare the ground for a global grand bargain aimed at tackling the greatest challenge that humanity has faced.Put starkly, Poznan must head off a collision between the energy systems that drive our economies, and the Earth's biosphere. Ambitious targets must be at the heart of any agreement. But we also need a new institutional architecture for cooperation between rich and poor countries.If we are to have any chance of keeping global temperature increases below a 2C tipping point, greenhouse gas emissions will have to fall by over 50% by 2050. On current trends, they will rise by 50% by 2030. Such an outcome would lead to unprecedented reversals in human development in our lifetime followed in short order by ecological catastrophe for future generations. Economies can recover from a financial crisis. But there is no antidote or rewind button for global warming.At Poznan, rich countries should be taking the lead. They need to signal a binding commitment to reducing their carbon footprint by at least 80%. More than that, they need to signal serious intent. Above all, that means closing the gap between climate change targets and energy policies.The British government's carbon budget targets are ambitious. They are also inconsistent with current policies on renewable energy, the commissioning of coal-fired power stations, and another runway at Heathrow. The EU may have set carbon quota ceilings, but these are way above the targets set for cutting emissions. President-elect Obama is inheriting a climate change policy bereft of credible targets or strategies.Rich countries have the financial resources and technological capacity to make a rapid low-carbon transition: by putting a higher price on carbon emissions through taxation, quotas, and tougher regulatory standards, and developing and commercialising new technologies. Carbon capture and storage is a priority, yet neither the US nor the EU has gone beyond small-scale pilot projects.Rich countries also need to lay the foundations for a new global compact with developing countries. It is not just that these countries are home to the populations most vulnerable to climate change. They also account for the bulk of the projected increase in CO2 emissions to 2030, with coal-fired economic growth in China and India the main driver. Governments in Poznan need to put in place three foundations for a global deal. First, we need a plan of action on adaptation backed by increased aid. For millions of vulnerable people in drought-prone areas of Africa, flood zones in South Asia, and elsewhere, dangerous climate change is is happening now.Second, developed countries need to reduce deforestation. Investments of $17-30bn annually could halve deforestation levels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 10%.Third, the world needs a Marshall Plan for low-carbon financing and technology transfer. Scaling-up emissions trading must be part of that plan, alongside wider multilateral mechanisms. Covering the incremental costs of low carbon technologies for coal-fired power generation and renewable energy would give developing countries an incentive to join a global deal - and to decarbonise their energy systems.The world cannot afford the type of shambolic display on show in Poznan. Over the past few months, rich governments have moved financial mountains to protect the integrity of their banking systems.

(Indeed, Poznan itself, as the fourth largest industrial centre in Poland, is home to many of the industrial lobbyists who have helped to fuel such concerns.)The meeting in Brussels is arguably the more important of the two events. Europe has contributed more to the global climate problem than any other party represented at the negotiations, so the world will be watching very carefully. A weak deal there could have a much greater impact on next year's all-important UN summit in Copenhagen than the detailed discussions going on in Poznan.Poland's unhelpful position is not hard to understand. Reliant on coal for 95% of its energy, the nation's carbon footprint is substantial. And as a result of acceding to the European Union in 2004, the country is now officially treated as a developed country and so has emissions targets to meet.However, there is no evidence that Poland has suffered any negative effects from being subject to targets \u2013 nor any evidence that it need suffer in the future. Europe's main climate change policy \u2013 the emissions trading scheme (ETS), which covers half of the region's emissions \u2013 delivered Poland a generous amount of money in its first phase. Polish companies were allocated around 90m tonnes' worth of carbon dioxide permits over and above what they actually needed. Roughly half of these were sold to other members of the EU \u2013 principally the UK, Spain and Italy \u2013 raising around \u20ac200m in income. It is likely that the same thing will happen in the current phase, which lasts until 2012, though until Poland's national allocation plan is approved or published, we won't know for sure.In the negotiations about the future of the ETS the EU has already included important concessions that remove permits from richer European states and donate them to the accession countries. But Poland is insisting on more \u2013 despite the fact that, according to a recent news report, the country is seeking to sell up to \u20ac1bn worth of permits to other countries unable to meet their own targets.Instead of embracing the trading schemes that it has profited from, Poland appears to be set on weakening them, and this is threatening to undermine the position of the EU internationally. Paradoxically, though, if the country is successful and emissions trading fails, civil society will almost certainly begin calling for it to be scrapped and replaced with more robust and (for Poland) much less profitable alternatives. The problem lies in the fact that Poland's government, like those of many other countries, believes its role is to defend and preserve the status quo rather than manage a process of change. If global emissions are to peak and decline within a decade \u2013 as the scientists say they must \u2013 then a massive investment in a new energy infrastructure is necessary. This investment will generate jobs and economic growth but it will flow to non-traditional energy technologies and solutions; those profiting from the existing system will be required to adapt and governments need to help them to change. Fortunately, the ETS provides a way of raising huge sums of money to pay for that change: the auctioning of permits. This will push up energy prices but if the money raised is invested in solutions then it insulates against future high costs.If only Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, could take a leaf out of Barack Obama's book and adopt a positive attitude to change, he might then see why backing a strong ETS makes sense: a robust scheme will give a higher price of carbon and result in more money flowing into his economy from the West. Trading schemes offer the least painful way possible for Poland to leapfrog into a clean energy system, delivering numerous co-benefits in terms of health, air quality and job creation. He should be backing them all the way, both in Poznan and in Brussels. If he did this, Poland could be an example to the rest of the world \u2013 a less rich nation which is party to an international emissions reduction scheme that is actually benefiting its economy. This would be a hugely valuable contribution towards securing the global deal that the world so badly needs.\u2022 Bryony Worthington is the founder of the website Sandbag, a not-for-profit website that allows its members to buy up carbon emissions trading permits", "tags": ["Emissions trading", "Climate change", "Environment", "Poznan climate change conference", "Copenhagen climate change conference 2009", "Global climate talks"], "title": "Bryony Worthington on why Poland should sign up to a strong emissions trading scheme"},{"date": "2008-11-07T00:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The EU yesterday ordered the Polish government to repay \u20ac2.3bn (\u00a31.9bn) of illegal state aid to two shipyards, Gdynia and Szczecin, at the heart of the union-led revolt against communism in the 1980s.The European commission gave the government to the end of May to sell the yards' assets to recoup aid spent over the past four years.

As editor of the Polish weekly Polytika, from 1958 to 1981 - and a member of the Polish Communist party's central committee from 1964 until its dissolution in 1990 - Rakowski established himself as a reformist communist who successfully challenged censorship to produce the most outspoken publication to appear regularly behind the iron curtain.But, as deputy prime minister under General Jaruzelski during the tumultuous weeks leading to the declaration of martial law (December 13 1981 to July 22 1983) - in Polish stan wojenny, \"the state of war\" - during which the military government usurped for itself powers reserved for wartime and thousands of people were arrested without charge and as many as 100 were killed, Rakowski's reputation suffered a reversal from which it never fully recovered. Opponents of the Jaruzelski regime, including much of Poland's intelligentsia, who had counted Rakowski as one of their own during his editorship of Polityka, could not forgive him for his role during the martial law period or readmit him to their circles.Rakowski, however, put himself in the forefront of those who believed that the general had acted as a true Polish patriot. It embittered him that his efforts as government negotiator to achieve a compromise with Lech Walesa, the co-founder of Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union, after the Gdansk strikes of 1980 ended in failure, and only led to more strikes and deeper divisions. Although mutual dislike and distrust were self-evident, he always dismissed the allegation that personal friction had any bearing on the decision to declare martial law.In later years he consistently asserted that Soviet pressure and the threat of a Warsaw Pact invasion were so intense that Jaruzelski had no other option but to detain Walesa, together with hundreds of other Solidarity activists and their allies among the intelligentsia, and to impose the \"state of war\". During a brief but decisive period as prime minister in 1988-1989, Rakowski presided over the round table negotiations where agreement was reached on the legalisation of Solidarity, and which led to the dissolution of the Polish Communist party in 1990 and Poland's return to a pluralist democracy.After his retirement from political life, Rakowski became editor of a monthly political journal, Dzis (Today), which owed its existence to Jerzy Urban, Jaruzelski's former spokesman, who had transformed himself into a media tycoon eager to apply some of his new-won profits to a respected academic publication. Rakowski, with the twin aims of restoring his reputation and of throwing more light on the true character of the communist era in Poland, also edited and published, in successive volumes, the daily diaries that he had kept for more than 40 years. He was also the author of several other books.A fluent German speaker, Rakowski maintained close links with Germany's Social Democrats and forged strong friendships with many leading figures - which survived the martial law period - including both Willy Brandt and Marion D\u00f6nhoff, the publisher of Die Zeit. His English was also good, and during a visit to London soon after Poland's martial law had been ended, Rakowski astonished the Guardian's editorial staff with an off-the-record briefing that was remarkable for its openness and frankness about the Polish regime's actions and its links with Moscow. He made plain that he recognised the need for a multiparty democracy in Poland.His relations with the Soviet Union were always fraught: as a journalist not afraid to step out of line, he was viewed by the Kremlin as a revisionist. Later, when Rakowski had become a senior party figure in Poland, Moscow considered him a negative influence on Jaruzelski.Western journalists visiting Poland during the 1970s were frequently taken to meet the editor of Polityka. The Polish authorities did this by way of trying to demonstrate that freedom of expression, including the occasional barb at the Soviet Union, was possible even in the one-party communist state.Western diplomats also regularly sought him out. There were, of course, limits then to what Rakowski was prepared to say by way of analysing Poland's restive social scene and creaking economy. But he certainly went far beyond the communist jargon that had to be endured from the regime's other spokesmen, and those who came to know him better sometimes found themselves invited to small private gatherings where the conversation was much franker.On a memorable day in 1979 at the close of the newly elected Pope John Paul II's first triumphal tour of his native country, Rakowski, together with other journalists, was in the courtyard of the Archbishop of Cracow's residence. Millions of Poles had turned out in venue after venue to greet the Pope and confirm their religious beliefs and allegiance to the Church. They had not followed the atheist communist script. Now the Pope emerged on the balcony above us to pronounce a blessing for the media that had covered his journey.Rakowski sought no blessing. But he realised that \"Poland will never be the same again\". The Pope had mobilised the masses. The genie was out of the communist bottle. But this only reinforced Rakowski's fear of Soviet intervention in Poland: he never wavered in his feeling that the Soviet Union would invade the country rather than allow it to choose its own course.Rakowski was no ideologue and he accepted long before most of his party colleagues that the Communist party could not retain its grip on the Polish nation without major concessions to pluralism. But until Mikhail Gorbachev arrived on the scene, Rakowski also believed that Poland had little room for manoeuvre, and that the Soviet Union had demonstrated on more than one occasion that it was prepared to intervene militarily if the Polish leadership itself failed to halt anti-regime demonstrations and to stifle organised opposition. Because of its geography - as a lifeline to the German Democratic Republic - the Kremlin would consider Poland an even more important asset to the communist bloc than Czechoslovakia.Rakowski came from a poor peasant background. He was born in Kowalewko, in the Bydgoszcz district, and his father was executed by the Nazis. During the Nazi occupation Rakowski worked in Poznan, in west central Poland, at a factory where trains were repaired. In 1946 he joined the Polish Workers' Party, a forerunner of the Communist Party (PZPR), and studied at the party's social studies institute. He earned a doctorate in history and, in 1949, became an instructor in the press and publishing department of the Communist party's central committee.This was his launch pad to become a co-founder of Polityka. In 1957 he became deputy editor, and from 1958 until 1982 he was editor-in-chief. He became a member of the Sejm (parliament) in 1972, and from 1964 he was also a member of the Polish Communist party's central committee. In 1981, as vice-premier for labour relations, culture and science, he took a leading role in the Gdansk negotiations at the Lenin shipyard with Walesa and his comrades.He was prime minister from September 1988 to July 1989 when, after the first multiparty elections, he had to give way to Professor Tadeusz Mazowiecki. At the same time Jaruzelski resigned as Communist party leader. Rakowski succeeded him and remained just long enough to preside in 1990 over the party's last congress, and to initiate its transformation into a leftwing social democratic party.From his first marriage Rakowski had two sons, one of whom broke with his father to leave communist Poland and become a banker. They were later reconciled. His second wife, Elzbieta Kepinska, is an actor who was boycotted for a long time by the theatrical establishment in protest against her husband's association with martial law. After 1989 she was able to resume her career.\u2022 Mieczyslaw Franciszek Rakowski, journalist and politician, born December 1 1926; died November 7 2008\u2022 This article was amended on November 12 2008.

And it is attracting former emigres home in droves.\"We really welcome these people home who have been working in Britain and Ireland,\" Aleksander Grad, the country's treasury minister, told the Guardian. \"In many cases these people who left were educated to degree level, often by the state at no cost, and it was a loss to the Polish economy.\"It has been estimated that of Poland's 38 million people, one million have made their way to Britain and Ireland in the past five years. About 6% of the workforce left in a very short space of time \u2013 and they were generally young, motivated and well educated.\"We have suffered labour shortages because of this,\" said Grad. \"But now they are helping stabilise the labour market. We had seen wages rising very fast.\"It was no surprise that young people who left Poland for a few years would come back once they had made some money. But the decision to return has been helped by the downturn in the British economy and the relative robustness of the Polish economy.The fall in the pound this year was also an important factor. \"The appreciation of the zloty certainly changed the calculation also,\" said Grad.He added that Dell's recent announcement that it would move 2,000 jobs from Limerick to Poland was a \"very good sign\" for the Polish economy, although it was ironic because plenty of Poles were already working at Dell in Ireland.Polish growth is slowing but it still managed about 5.5% expansion in 2008, much stronger than in Britain. The government is still forecasting growth of more than 3% in 2009. Britain's economy is set to contract by up to 3%.\"We don't want to be compared to other countries in our region who had to borrow from the International Monetary Fund,\" said Ludwik Sobolewski, head of the Warsaw stock exchange. \"We are more integrated with countries such as Germany.\"Banking laws were written conservatively when Poland passed from communism into a market-based economy, meaning the banks were forbidden from investing in credit derivatives and sub-prime mortgages and so are in much better shape than rivals around the world.\"International investors make a mistake if they lump us all into one \u00adbasket.

The system would also include a radar base in the Czech Republic, which borders Poland.But US officials have said the entire project must be reviewed. Obama's top officials have said the new administration supports missile defence in principle, but the system must be cost-effective and technologically proven, and must not drain resources from more pressing concerns.Since Obama took office in January the US has sought to improve relations with Russia, which vehemently objects to US military installations being built so close to its own territory. In response, Moscow had threatened to station Iskander missiles in its exclave of Kaliningrad, near the Polish border.Poland agreed to host the missile defence base and strongly lobbied to get the Patriot missiles hoping that closer military ties with the US would bolster its security in the face of a resurgent Russia.Poland's anxieties deepened last summer when Russia fought a brief war with Georgia.

The temporary terraces are nearly ready in the centre of Krakow and Kylie Minogue is on her way. Poland is getting ready to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the events that set the nation and much of eastern and central Europe on the road to freedom.But Piotr Karwowoski, a recently retired trade union official and factory worker, will not be celebrating. When he travels the 100 miles across the green, flat plains to Warsaw from his home town of Swidnik next week, he will instead be heading to a three-day administrative meeting of his union's industrial wing.Karwowoski played a key role in the years of struggle, strikes and demonstrations that finally culminated in \"semi-free\" elections on 4 June 1989. But the 65-year-old, despite his impeccable revolutionary credentials, is not in the mood for nostalgia.\"Twenty years ago I was euphoric at the prospect of change, especially after all we had done,\" Karwowoski told the Observer last week. \"But the Poland that resulted was different than I expected. I don't really want to celebrate.\"Two decades after the triumphant defeat of the communist regime that took its orders from Moscow, there is no doubting the Polish transformation that is visible in the streets. Pictures from Warsaw even in the final years of communist rule look like images from another age, not another generation. The rows of inefficient, clunky local cars that once clogged the capital's Constitution Square have been replaced by Fiats, Toyotas and BMWs. Under a flat, grey, rainy sky last week, the trams and the 1950s Stalinist architecture hinted at what once had been. But the Green Coffee cafe with its ciabatta sandwiches, fresh orange juice and black T-shirted waitresses symbolise the present and the future. One poster for a rival coffee chain features pretty girls saying, \"chocolate, man, coffee ... some things are better rich\". \"What is the difference between Warsaw and England? The side of the road on which we drive?\" asked veteran film-maker Marek Drazewski. \"There are the same films, the same McDonald's. Warsaw is a standard European capital and when I go to the US now I feel at home. The biggest difference is that I am allowed to smoke.\" Satellite television and the internet are bringing change to far-flung rural areas, too, as is the new confidence and openness of those hundreds of thousands of Poles who travelled from small rural towns to work in the UK and Ireland and who are now returning home. Yet all across Poland last week, people voiced the same disenchantment with the public festivities. Major newspapers are planning huge coverage and special supplements. Political personalities such as the former Czech president and playwright V\u00e1clav Havel are being flown in. There is the free concert starring Kylie Minogue and numerous worthy conferences will take place. No one can doubt the desire of the authorities to whip up a storm of enthusiasm. But very few Poles are so far joining in. One poll found that only 41% of the 38 million population actually knew what the celebrations were for.No one regrets the passing of the communists, of course. \"Even on the left many, many welcomed the end of the regime with joy and happiness,\" said Ryszard Kalisz, a former interior minister and senior leader of the leftwing SLD party. Many are intensely proud of the role that Poland played in pioneering resistance to the Moscow-backed regimes, and are resentful that the fall of the Berlin wall has become the symbolic event signifying the swift collapse of communism. But when it comes to the present, many Poles believe that Poland lacks \"moral and political order\" and that the poor \"have been betrayed\", as Karwowoski, the retired union official, puts it. Many more are put off by what they say is the poor quality of their leaders. \"The political class is exceptionally mediocre,\" said Jaroslaw Kurski, deputy editor of the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, which published its first issue just four days after the 4 June 1989 elections that saw the Solidarity union sweep into effective power. Maciej Stryjecki, a former ministerial private secretary and leftwing activist, agreed: \"I have observed many governments close up. Each new one is worse than the last. Competent, honest, experienced people are very, very rare.\"The disenchantment is especially strong among younger Poles. For Robert Kulik, a 28-year-old legal adviser in the southern town of Lublin who recently returned from a year in the UK, \"solidarity is a not just a slogan or the name of an organisation. It can only be something that exists between people. There isn't any real solidarity in Poland any more\".Certainly the Solidarity that won so much admiration in the west is no more. From being founded as a trade union, Solidarity became a mass movement in the 1980s before becoming a political party in the 1990s. Now it has returned to being a union, with a membership a fraction of that of two decades ago. The modern Solidarity is a close ally of the controversial hard-right Law and Justice party whose leaders, twin brothers Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, have repeatedly shocked local and international audiences with their nationalist, borderline xenophobic rhetoric and alliances with extreme-right groups.Cezary Kowanda, an analyst at Polityka magazine, says that the alliance of Solidarity with the hard right is natural. \"Trade unionism in Poland and Solidarity has always been very closely linked to the church and to a conservative set of social values,\" he told the Observer. \"The real anniversary for a lot of Poles is not the 4 June elections of 1989 but 2 June 1979 when Pope John Paul II made his first pilgrimage to his homeland.\"The 4 June festivities were initially planned for Gdansk, birthplace of Solidarity and scene of the showdowns at the famous docks where workers led by electrician Lech Walesa defied the communist regime. But in the Baltic port city the mood is one of anger rather than nostalgia. The docks are being shut on the orders of the European Union, which Poland officially joined in 2004, and the government feared rioting would mar the anniversary. So while opposition groups including Solidarity and the Law and Justice party celebrate there, the main official festivities, led by the centre-right ruling party of Civic Platform, have been moved to Krakow. A third set of events will take place in the capital.Even the presence of Walesa at the forefront of celebrations is controversial. The former president has been forced to repeatedly deny accusations from right-wingers that he was a communist spy. This month he threatened to boycott all celebrations for the anniversary of the events that eventually saw him made president in 1990.In Swidnik, where the first serious demonstrations against the communist regime in Poland broke out in July 1980 before spreading to Gdansk a month later, they are not celebrating anything at all. The town is a long way from Warsaw and its traffic jams, expensive restaurants and \"yuppie\" flats. The grim tenement blocks and shopping centres of the town of 40,000 do not share the new European buzz of nearby Lublin where students from three universities and young Poles back from the UK or Ireland form their own cafe society.Swidnik is poor, religious, conservative and has one of the highest unemployment rates in Poland. Its mayor is Waldemar Jackson, from the Law and Justice party. \"[The party] supports traditional values like the family ... and is a victim of the dominant political correctness which says that people have no right to value Christianity, the church, to not like homosexuality,\" Jackson said.\"In western European countries you wouldn't understand that, because Islam is much more popular there than Christianity. There are more mosques built in Germany than churches. But Christianity underlies European values.\"Law and Justice won power in 2005, ruling for two years in coalition with extreme-right parties before being defeated two years later by the Civic Platform, who mix neo-liberal economics with moderate conservatism to appeal to Poland's newly wealthy and newly Europeanised classes. Law and Justice's Lech Kasczynski remains president and retains his popularity in the countryside. Civic Platform is popular among the young, in the big cities, among the elite.According to Professor Lena Kolarska-Bobinska, a sociologist, \"there are many Polands\". Jackson, the Swidnik mayor, jokes that where you find two Poles you will find four opinions. Sitting in a Lublin cafe, Kulik too talks of how historically, once there is no common enemy, Poles fight among themselves. Amid the anniversary rows and the rivalries between countryside and city, the sense of division can be overdone. Drazewski, who documented the early protests in Gdansk, says that Poland is now \"stable and rich\". Though the wealth is unequally shared and relative - GDP per capita is around a third of that in the UK - Poles are considerably wealthier than 20 years ago. The Civic Platform government is strong and relatively secure and few contest the basics of the political system. \"No one argues about election results,\" said leftwing leader Kalisz. Poland is even resisting the global economic crisis relatively well, recording a steady 6% year-on-year growth rate until last year. In fact, the importance of rows, often stirred up artificially, over values, identity or the historical record may owe much to the broad ideological consensus. \"There is no real left and the entire political spectrum and debate is situated on the right,\" said Kowanda. The predominant mood is pragmatic and, after the epoch-changing dramas of the late 1980s, most Poles are happy to live in relatively low-key times. Last week 94% of people asked by pollsters to describe the biggest change the events of 1989 had brought spoke of \"the range of goods in the shops\".

A quarter of the population attended his outdoor masses. His visit was the beginning of the end for the communist regime.The Gdansk StrikesIn Gdansk, at the then \"Lenin Shipyards\", the sacking of outspoken workers, including electrician Lech Walesa, resulted in a strike led by Walesa which began on 14 August 1980. The Gdansk Agreement is eventually signed, giving the legal right to organised trade unions and more freedom for the Catholic church. On 17 September, Solidarnosc (Solidarity), the first independent labour union in the Soviet Bloc, is born.Martial lawOn 13 December 1981, General Wojciech Jaruzelski declares martial law: 5,000 Solidarity members, including Lech Walesa, are arrested in the night. Hundreds of strikes taking place throughout the country are put down by riot police. In October 1982, Solidarity was declared an illegal organisation and duly banned.The Coming of GorbachevOn 5 October 1983, Lech Walesa is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize but prevented from leaving the country to accept it. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev assumes control of the Soviet Union. Three years later, as dissent grows in Soviet satellite countries, he will tell a Communist party conference: \"The imposition of a social system, a way of life or policies from outside by any means, let alone military force, are dangerous trappings of the past.\"Solidarity triumphsIn 1988, a new wave of strikes sweeps the country after food costs are increased by 40%. The government announces it is ready to negotiate with SolidarityThe union is again legalised on 17 April 1989, and allowed to field candidates in the June election.

While British voters appear to have used the elections to convey messages to the three main parties, Poles chose to confirm their support for the ruling party and to distance themselves from extremist groups.Polish voters seemed to want to make good use of their presence in the European parliament to defend Polish interests and to improve Poland's standing. This has been confirmed by preliminary suggestions that the four parties that will be represented may co-operate rather than ally themselves with their European counterparts. This unity may serve the Poles well \u2013 they are increasingly hopeful that Poland's ex-prime minister Jerzy Buzek will succeed as leader of the European parliament.To win the support of the centre-right grouping, Buzek has to defeat Mario Mauro, whose candidacy is supported by the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. The brashness and forcefulness of the Mauro-Berlusconi campaign has alienated many European deputies. It may well turn out that the much-respected Buzek \u2013 and the general perception that Poles have shown themselves reluctant to support marginal and nationalist groupings \u2013 will swing the vote in his favour. To Poles such a victory would be a confirmation of Poland's standing in Europe and a return to European politics. Poland's earlier co-operation with President Bush had alienated both the French and the Germans. A time has come to put that into the past.The 2004 elections to the European parliament resulted in a motley crowd of populists and nationalists representing Poland. Ten members of the Catholic League of Polish Families and six deputies from the Samoobrona peasant movement went to Brussels determined to challenge the assembly and to demand that it should espouse Christian values. The spectacle of Poles demanding a Catholic chapel and haranguing the deputies by claiming they were controlled by homosexuals did little to dispel the negative stereotype of a state still dominated by extreme ideas. It is therefore surprising that during the present elections, at a time of increasing economic insecurity, Poles appear to have decided to support the ruling party by confirming its major role in the European parliament. Platforma Obywatelska secured 44% of votes, and the opposition Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 27%. Surprisingly, the leftwing vote, which has decreased dramatically in other European countries, remained stable at 12%. The fourth of the Polish parties that will send representative to Brussels is the Peasant Alliance.One of the intriguing questions generated by the elections is why Poles have lost their appetite for parties based on Christian and nationalist principles. Neither Samoobrona nor LRP will be sending their representatives to Brussels. Nothing could save the anti-European Libertas party from an ignominious defeat. Funded by the Irishman Declan Ganley and endorsed by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, the party secured less than 1% of the vote. Moreover, in a country where personalities still play an important role in politics, the results were surprising. Marian Krzaklewski, a Solidarity firebrand from the past, failed to secure a seat.The picture generated by the results of the elections is not only that of a stable political system, but also that of a mature electorate \u2013 one that has rejected wild promises and unrealistic hopes in favour of parties that assured their respective electorates that they will endeavour to secure for Poland the best conditions possible while working on maintaining economic stability at home.", "tags": ["Poland", "European elections", "European Union", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Europe votes: Poland votes for stability | Anita Prazmowska"},{"date": "2009-05-30T23:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday 7 June 2009.Name checks: It's Waldemar Jakson, not Jackson and Lech Kaczynski, not KasczynskiThe stage is being prepared outside the famous Gdansk shipyards. The temporary terraces are nearly ready in the centre of Krakow and Kylie Minogue is on her way. Poland is getting ready to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the events that set the nation and much of eastern and central Europe on the road to freedom.But Piotr Karwowoski, a recently retired trade union official and factory worker, will not be celebrating. When he travels the 100 miles across the green, flat plains to Warsaw from his home town of Swidnik next week, he will instead be heading to a three-day administrative meeting of his union's industrial wing.Karwowoski played a key role in the years of struggle, strikes and demonstrations that finally culminated in \"semi-free\" elections on 4 June 1989. But the 65-year-old, despite his impeccable revolutionary credentials, is not in the mood for nostalgia.\"Twenty years ago I was euphoric at the prospect of change, especially after all we had done,\" Karwowoski told the Observer last week. \"But the Poland that resulted was different than I expected. I don't really want to celebrate.\"Two decades after the triumphant defeat of the communist regime that took its orders from Moscow, there is no doubting the Polish transformation that is visible in the streets. Pictures from Warsaw even in the final years of communist rule look like images from another age, not another generation. The rows of inefficient, clunky local cars that once clogged the capital's Constitution Square have been replaced by Fiats, Toyotas and BMWs. Under a flat, grey, rainy sky last week, the trams and the 1950s Stalinist architecture hinted at what once had been. But the Green Coffee cafe with its ciabatta sandwiches, fresh orange juice and black T-shirted waitresses symbolise the present and the future. One poster for a rival coffee chain features pretty girls saying, \"chocolate, man, coffee ... some things are better rich\". \"What is the difference between Warsaw and England? The side of the road on which we drive?\" asked veteran film-maker Marek Drazewski. \"There are the same films, the same McDonald's. Warsaw is a standard European capital and when I go to the US now I feel at home. The biggest difference is that I am allowed to smoke.\" Satellite television and the internet are bringing change to far-flung rural areas, too, as is the new confidence and openness of those hundreds of thousands of Poles who travelled from small rural towns to work in the UK and Ireland and who are now returning home. Yet all across Poland last week, people voiced the same disenchantment with the public festivities. Major newspapers are planning huge coverage and special supplements. Political personalities such as the former Czech president and playwright V\u00e1clav Havel are being flown in. There is the free concert starring Kylie Minogue and numerous worthy conferences will take place. No one can doubt the desire of the authorities to whip up a storm of enthusiasm. But very few Poles are so far joining in. One poll found that only 41% of the 38 million population actually knew what the celebrations were for.No one regrets the passing of the communists, of course. \"Even on the left many, many welcomed the end of the regime with joy and happiness,\" said Ryszard Kalisz, a former interior minister and senior leader of the leftwing SLD party. Many are intensely proud of the role that Poland played in pioneering resistance to the Moscow-backed regimes, and are resentful that the fall of the Berlin wall has become the symbolic event signifying the swift collapse of communism. But when it comes to the present, many Poles believe that Poland lacks \"moral and political order\" and that the poor \"have been betrayed\", as Karwowoski, the retired union official, puts it. Many more are put off by what they say is the poor quality of their leaders. \"The political class is exceptionally mediocre,\" said Jaroslaw Kurski, deputy editor of the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, which published its first issue just four days after the 4 June 1989 elections that saw the Solidarity union sweep into effective power. Maciej Stryjecki, a former ministerial private secretary and leftwing activist, agreed: \"I have observed many governments close up. Each new one is worse than the last. Competent, honest, experienced people are very, very rare.\"The disenchantment is especially strong among younger Poles. For Robert Kulik, a 28-year-old legal adviser in the southern town of Lublin who recently returned from a year in the UK, \"solidarity is a not just a slogan or the name of an organisation. It can only be something that exists between people. There isn't any real solidarity in Poland any more\".Certainly the Solidarity that won so much admiration in the west is no more. From being founded as a trade union, Solidarity became a mass movement in the 1980s before becoming a political party in the 1990s. Now it has returned to being a union, with a membership a fraction of that of two decades ago. The modern Solidarity is a close ally of the controversial hard-right Law and Justice party whose leaders, twin brothers Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, have repeatedly shocked local and international audiences with their nationalist, borderline xenophobic rhetoric and alliances with extreme-right groups.Cezary Kowanda, an analyst at Polityka magazine, says that the alliance of Solidarity with the hard right is natural. \"Trade unionism in Poland and Solidarity has always been very closely linked to the church and to a conservative set of social values,\" he told the Observer. \"The real anniversary for a lot of Poles is not the 4 June elections of 1989 but 2 June 1979 when Pope John Paul II made his first pilgrimage to his homeland.\"The 4 June festivities were initially planned for Gdansk, birthplace of Solidarity and scene of the showdowns at the famous docks where workers led by electrician Lech Walesa defied the communist regime. But in the Baltic port city the mood is one of anger rather than nostalgia. The docks are being shut on the orders of the European Union, which Poland officially joined in 2004, and the government feared rioting would mar the anniversary. So while opposition groups including Solidarity and the Law and Justice party celebrate there, the main official festivities, led by the centre-right ruling party of Civic Platform, have been moved to Krakow. A third set of events will take place in the capital.Even the presence of Walesa at the forefront of celebrations is controversial. The former president has been forced to repeatedly deny accusations from right-wingers that he was a communist spy. This month he threatened to boycott all celebrations for the anniversary of the events that eventually saw him made president in 1990.In Swidnik, where the first serious demonstrations against the communist regime in Poland broke out in July 1980 before spreading to Gdansk a month later, they are not celebrating anything at all. The town is a long way from Warsaw and its traffic jams, expensive restaurants and \"yuppie\" flats. The grim tenement blocks and shopping centres of the town of 40,000 do not share the new European buzz of nearby Lublin where students from three universities and young Poles back from the UK or Ireland form their own cafe society.Swidnik is poor, religious, conservative and has one of the highest unemployment rates in Poland. Its mayor is Waldemar Jackson, from the Law and Justice party. \"[The party] supports traditional values like the family ... and is a victim of the dominant political correctness which says that people have no right to value Christianity, the church, to not like homosexuality,\" Jackson said.\"In western European countries you wouldn't understand that, because Islam is much more popular there than Christianity. There are more mosques built in Germany than churches. But Christianity underlies European values.\"Law and Justice won power in 2005, ruling for two years in coalition with extreme-right parties before being defeated two years later by the Civic Platform, who mix neo-liberal economics with moderate conservatism to appeal to Poland's newly wealthy and newly Europeanised classes. Law and Justice's Lech Kasczynski remains president and retains his popularity in the countryside. Civic Platform is popular among the young, in the big cities, among the elite.According to Professor Lena Kolarska-Bobinska, a sociologist, \"there are many Polands\". Jackson, the Swidnik mayor, jokes that where you find two Poles you will find four opinions. Sitting in a Lublin cafe, Kulik too talks of how historically, once there is no common enemy, Poles fight among themselves. Amid the anniversary rows and the rivalries between countryside and city, the sense of division can be overdone. Drazewski, who documented the early protests in Gdansk, says that Poland is now \"stable and rich\". Though the wealth is unequally shared and relative - GDP per capita is around a third of that in the UK - Poles are considerably wealthier than 20 years ago. The Civic Platform government is strong and relatively secure and few contest the basics of the political system. \"No one argues about election results,\" said leftwing leader Kalisz. Poland is even resisting the global economic crisis relatively well, recording a steady 6% year-on-year growth rate until last year. In fact, the importance of rows, often stirred up artificially, over values, identity or the historical record may owe much to the broad ideological consensus. \"There is no real left and the entire political spectrum and debate is situated on the right,\" said Kowanda.

Even in a Swidnik soup kitchen, people are more into apathy than radicalism. \"I'm not interested in politics or history or celebrating anything particularly,\" said Wladyslaw, an unemployed council technician aged 57. \"I'm just interested in getting a job.\"In the gleaming new offices of the Gazeta Wyborcza, journalists were last week proudly reviewing the commemorative reprint of its first issue. The Gazeta has long been independent of the union. Times have changed, said deputy editor-in-chief Kurski.\"We are becoming a middle-class society, with bourgeois values and bourgeois tastes. We like going on holiday to sunny places, we are careful because of the crisis, but we like shopping anyway,\" he said.\"We are turning into a normal modern European state with all the advantages and disadvantages that that entails. And if that is boring, well, all the better.\"A Polish PopeOn 16 October 1978, the Polish cardinal Karol Wojtyla is elevated to the papacy.The Catholic church had become important in the resistance to communist rule and Pope John Paul II's homecoming tour galvanised the population; 500,000 heard him speak in Warsaw in June 1979. A quarter of the population attended his outdoor masses. His visit was the beginning of the end for the communist regime.The Gdansk StrikesIn Gdansk, at the then \"Lenin Shipyards\", the sacking of outspoken workers, including electrician Lech Walesa, resulted in a strike led by Walesa which began on 14 August 1980. The Gdansk Agreement is eventually signed, giving the legal right to organised trade unions and more freedom for the Catholic church. On 17 September, Solidarnosc (Solidarity), the first independent labour union in the Soviet Bloc, is born.Martial lawOn 13 December 1981, General Wojciech Jaruzelski declares martial law: 5,000 Solidarity members, including Lech Walesa, are arrested in the night. Hundreds of strikes taking place throughout the country are put down by riot police. In October 1982, Solidarity was declared an illegal organisation and duly banned.The Coming of GorbachevOn 5 October 1983, Lech Walesa is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize but prevented from leaving the country to accept it. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev assumes control of the Soviet Union. Three years later, as dissent grows in Soviet satellite countries, he will tell a Communist party conference: \"The imposition of a social system, a way of life or policies from outside by any means, let alone military force, are dangerous trappings of the past.\"Solidarity triumphsIn 1988, a new wave of strikes sweeps the country after food costs are increased by 40%. The government announces it is ready to negotiate with SolidarityThe union is again legalised on 17 April 1989, and allowed to field candidates in the June election. It wins all democratically available seats and forms a government under prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.

Wojnar thinks that paying attention to people with disrupted sleep patterns could help to reduce the toll.\"Identifying those at high risk of suicide is important for preventing it, and these findings indicate that insomnia may be a modifiable risk factor for suicide in the general population,\" Wojnar said.\"This has implications for public health, as the presence of sleep problems should alert doctors to assess such patients for a heightened risk of suicide, even if they don't have a psychiatric condition. Our findings also raise the possibility that addressing sleep problems could reduce the risk of suicidal behaviours.\"Scientists and doctors have known there is a link between sleep problems and suicide, but have not been sure which comes first \u2013 the mental health problem or the exhaustion that comes from sleepless nights.The study was carried out with the involvement of 5,692 American volunteers, a third of whom (35%) reported at least one of the three sleep problems during the previous year.The people most affected were those who woke up too early in the morning. They were twice as likely as those with no sleep problems to have had suicidal thoughts in the preceding 12 months, 2.1 times more likely to have planned suicide and 2.7 times more likely to have tried to kill themselves.Those who found it hard to fall asleep were more likely than those who slept well to think about killing themselves and to make plans. Those who kept waking in the night and took an hour or more to get back to sleep had a raised risk of thinking about suicide and attempting it.Scientists do not know why sleep deprivation increases suicide risk, but they think that it may cause the brain to work less well, leading to poorer judgment, less impulse control and increased feelings of hopelessness.", "tags": ["Mental health", "Health", "Society", "UK news"], "title": "Suicide risk higher for people who have trouble sleeping"},{"date": "2009-06-08T16:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland's contribution to the European parliament might turn out to be a source of stability during the coming years.

It may well turn out that the much-respected Buzek \u2013 and the general perception that Poles have shown themselves reluctant to support marginal and nationalist groupings \u2013 will swing the vote in his favour. To Poles such a victory would be a confirmation of Poland's standing in Europe and a return to European politics. Poland's earlier co-operation with President Bush had alienated both the French and the Germans. A time has come to put that into the past.The 2004 elections to the European parliament resulted in a motley crowd of populists and nationalists representing Poland. Ten members of the Catholic League of Polish Families and six deputies from the Samoobrona peasant movement went to Brussels determined to challenge the assembly and to demand that it should espouse Christian values. The spectacle of Poles demanding a Catholic chapel and haranguing the deputies by claiming they were controlled by homosexuals did little to dispel the negative stereotype of a state still dominated by extreme ideas. It is therefore surprising that during the present elections, at a time of increasing economic insecurity, Poles appear to have decided to support the ruling party by confirming its major role in the European parliament. Platforma Obywatelska secured 44% of votes, and the opposition Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 27%. Surprisingly, the leftwing vote, which has decreased dramatically in other European countries, remained stable at 12%. The fourth of the Polish parties that will send representative to Brussels is the Peasant Alliance.One of the intriguing questions generated by the elections is why Poles have lost their appetite for parties based on Christian and nationalist principles. Neither Samoobrona nor LRP will be sending their representatives to Brussels. Nothing could save the anti-European Libertas party from an ignominious defeat. Funded by the Irishman Declan Ganley and endorsed by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, the party secured less than 1% of the vote. Moreover, in a country where personalities still play an important role in politics, the results were surprising. Marian Krzaklewski, a Solidarity firebrand from the past, failed to secure a seat.The picture generated by the results of the elections is not only that of a stable political system, but also that of a mature electorate \u2013 one that has rejected wild promises and unrealistic hopes in favour of parties that assured their respective electorates that they will endeavour to secure for Poland the best conditions possible while working on maintaining economic stability at home.", "tags": ["Poland", "European elections", "European Union", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Europe votes: Poland votes for stability | Anita Prazmowska"},{"date": "2009-05-30T23:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday 7 June 2009.Name checks: It's Waldemar Jakson, not Jackson and Lech Kaczynski, not KasczynskiThe stage is being prepared outside the famous Gdansk shipyards. The temporary terraces are nearly ready in the centre of Krakow and Kylie Minogue is on her way. Poland is getting ready to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the events that set the nation and much of eastern and central Europe on the road to freedom.But Piotr Karwowoski, a recently retired trade union official and factory worker, will not be celebrating. When he travels the 100 miles across the green, flat plains to Warsaw from his home town of Swidnik next week, he will instead be heading to a three-day administrative meeting of his union's industrial wing.Karwowoski played a key role in the years of struggle, strikes and demonstrations that finally culminated in \"semi-free\" elections on 4 June 1989. But the 65-year-old, despite his impeccable revolutionary credentials, is not in the mood for nostalgia.\"Twenty years ago I was euphoric at the prospect of change, especially after all we had done,\" Karwowoski told the Observer last week. \"But the Poland that resulted was different than I expected. I don't really want to celebrate.\"Two decades after the triumphant defeat of the communist regime that took its orders from Moscow, there is no doubting the Polish transformation that is visible in the streets. Pictures from Warsaw even in the final years of communist rule look like images from another age, not another generation. The rows of inefficient, clunky local cars that once clogged the capital's Constitution Square have been replaced by Fiats, Toyotas and BMWs. Under a flat, grey, rainy sky last week, the trams and the 1950s Stalinist architecture hinted at what once had been. But the Green Coffee cafe with its ciabatta sandwiches, fresh orange juice and black T-shirted waitresses symbolise the present and the future. One poster for a rival coffee chain features pretty girls saying, \"chocolate, man, coffee ... some things are better rich\". \"What is the difference between Warsaw and England? The side of the road on which we drive?\" asked veteran film-maker Marek Drazewski. \"There are the same films, the same McDonald's. Warsaw is a standard European capital and when I go to the US now I feel at home. The biggest difference is that I am allowed to smoke.\" Satellite television and the internet are bringing change to far-flung rural areas, too, as is the new confidence and openness of those hundreds of thousands of Poles who travelled from small rural towns to work in the UK and Ireland and who are now returning home. Yet all across Poland last week, people voiced the same disenchantment with the public festivities. Major newspapers are planning huge coverage and special supplements. Political personalities such as the former Czech president and playwright V\u00e1clav Havel are being flown in. There is the free concert starring Kylie Minogue and numerous worthy conferences will take place. No one can doubt the desire of the authorities to whip up a storm of enthusiasm. But very few Poles are so far joining in. One poll found that only 41% of the 38 million population actually knew what the celebrations were for.No one regrets the passing of the communists, of course. \"Even on the left many, many welcomed the end of the regime with joy and happiness,\" said Ryszard Kalisz, a former interior minister and senior leader of the leftwing SLD party. Many are intensely proud of the role that Poland played in pioneering resistance to the Moscow-backed regimes, and are resentful that the fall of the Berlin wall has become the symbolic event signifying the swift collapse of communism. But when it comes to the present, many Poles believe that Poland lacks \"moral and political order\" and that the poor \"have been betrayed\", as Karwowoski, the retired union official, puts it. Many more are put off by what they say is the poor quality of their leaders. \"The political class is exceptionally mediocre,\" said Jaroslaw Kurski, deputy editor of the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, which published its first issue just four days after the 4 June 1989 elections that saw the Solidarity union sweep into effective power. Maciej Stryjecki, a former ministerial private secretary and leftwing activist, agreed: \"I have observed many governments close up. Each new one is worse than the last. Competent, honest, experienced people are very, very rare.\"The disenchantment is especially strong among younger Poles. For Robert Kulik, a 28-year-old legal adviser in the southern town of Lublin who recently returned from a year in the UK, \"solidarity is a not just a slogan or the name of an organisation. It can only be something that exists between people. There isn't any real solidarity in Poland any more\".Certainly the Solidarity that won so much admiration in the west is no more. From being founded as a trade union, Solidarity became a mass movement in the 1980s before becoming a political party in the 1990s. Now it has returned to being a union, with a membership a fraction of that of two decades ago. The modern Solidarity is a close ally of the controversial hard-right Law and Justice party whose leaders, twin brothers Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, have repeatedly shocked local and international audiences with their nationalist, borderline xenophobic rhetoric and alliances with extreme-right groups.Cezary Kowanda, an analyst at Polityka magazine, says that the alliance of Solidarity with the hard right is natural. \"Trade unionism in Poland and Solidarity has always been very closely linked to the church and to a conservative set of social values,\" he told the Observer. \"The real anniversary for a lot of Poles is not the 4 June elections of 1989 but 2 June 1979 when Pope John Paul II made his first pilgrimage to his homeland.\"The 4 June festivities were initially planned for Gdansk, birthplace of Solidarity and scene of the showdowns at the famous docks where workers led by electrician Lech Walesa defied the communist regime. But in the Baltic port city the mood is one of anger rather than nostalgia. The docks are being shut on the orders of the European Union, which Poland officially joined in 2004, and the government feared rioting would mar the anniversary. So while opposition groups including Solidarity and the Law and Justice party celebrate there, the main official festivities, led by the centre-right ruling party of Civic Platform, have been moved to Krakow. A third set of events will take place in the capital.Even the presence of Walesa at the forefront of celebrations is controversial. The former president has been forced to repeatedly deny accusations from right-wingers that he was a communist spy. This month he threatened to boycott all celebrations for the anniversary of the events that eventually saw him made president in 1990.In Swidnik, where the first serious demonstrations against the communist regime in Poland broke out in July 1980 before spreading to Gdansk a month later, they are not celebrating anything at all. The town is a long way from Warsaw and its traffic jams, expensive restaurants and \"yuppie\" flats. The grim tenement blocks and shopping centres of the town of 40,000 do not share the new European buzz of nearby Lublin where students from three universities and young Poles back from the UK or Ireland form their own cafe society.Swidnik is poor, religious, conservative and has one of the highest unemployment rates in Poland. Its mayor is Waldemar Jackson, from the Law and Justice party. \"[The party] supports traditional values like the family ... and is a victim of the dominant political correctness which says that people have no right to value Christianity, the church, to not like homosexuality,\" Jackson said.\"In western European countries you wouldn't understand that, because Islam is much more popular there than Christianity. There are more mosques built in Germany than churches. But Christianity underlies European values.\"Law and Justice won power in 2005, ruling for two years in coalition with extreme-right parties before being defeated two years later by the Civic Platform, who mix neo-liberal economics with moderate conservatism to appeal to Poland's newly wealthy and newly Europeanised classes. Law and Justice's Lech Kasczynski remains president and retains his popularity in the countryside. Civic Platform is popular among the young, in the big cities, among the elite.According to Professor Lena Kolarska-Bobinska, a sociologist, \"there are many Polands\". Jackson, the Swidnik mayor, jokes that where you find two Poles you will find four opinions. Sitting in a Lublin cafe, Kulik too talks of how historically, once there is no common enemy, Poles fight among themselves. Amid the anniversary rows and the rivalries between countryside and city, the sense of division can be overdone. Drazewski, who documented the early protests in Gdansk, says that Poland is now \"stable and rich\". Though the wealth is unequally shared and relative - GDP per capita is around a third of that in the UK - Poles are considerably wealthier than 20 years ago. The Civic Platform government is strong and relatively secure and few contest the basics of the political system. \"No one argues about election results,\" said leftwing leader Kalisz. Poland is even resisting the global economic crisis relatively well, recording a steady 6% year-on-year growth rate until last year. In fact, the importance of rows, often stirred up artificially, over values, identity or the historical record may owe much to the broad ideological consensus. \"There is no real left and the entire political spectrum and debate is situated on the right,\" said Kowanda. The predominant mood is pragmatic and, after the epoch-changing dramas of the late 1980s, most Poles are happy to live in relatively low-key times. Last week 94% of people asked by pollsters to describe the biggest change the events of 1989 had brought spoke of \"the range of goods in the shops\".

The collapse of communism in Poland was played out in full view of the world's media. The establishment of the Solidarity movement could well be treated as the starting point of this process. The alternative date could be that of the conclusion of the round table talks or even the first genuinely free elections. For Poland, 1989 was a time of change.I initiated a debate on this subject at this year's Hay festival. Timothy Garton Ash, well known to Guardian readers, and Slawomir Sierakowski, a young editor of a challenging leftwing publication in Poland, were asked to tell the audience when they thought the history of communist Poland had come to an end and the transformation in accordance with the liberal democratic model and free market principles began. Both speakers grappled with the problem created by the power of symbols, which tend to trap us in a timewarp and prevent us moving on to understanding the complexities of present day politics in Poland. The belief that the Polish pope destroyed the evil communist regime is a cliche beloved by the Conservatives as much as it is by the left, which was profoundly critical of the communists' lack of respect for human rights. It was my aim to lead the speakers away from such stereotypes.To an audience only too well aware of the way politics distort principles, as has been the case in British politics, any thoughts on Poland will be interesting. The present-day Polish political landscape looks unimpressive; parties defined by personalities rather than political programmes, an embarrassing president who seem to pride himself in not wanting to understand international politics, controversial intervention in the European parliament, all suggesting political immaturity and lack of a way forward. For Poland the last 20 years have not been easy. The process of party formation \u2013 dealing with the post-communist realities and finding a way of communicating with a constituency that demanded that solutions should be very different from those that the fallen communist regimes had followed \u2013 created problems and, by implications, new solutions.Garton Ash, a witness of the great defining moment in the birth of Solidarity, has suggested that Poles have been seeking and should continue to seek a Polish neo-liberal way forward, not neccessarily based on what happens in other developed European states. Sierakowski, who was too young to participate in the events that shaped Poland's present political institutions, presents a new road: that of Poland reclaiming the right to consider the full spectrum of political ideas, including leftwing ideas, unburdened by its communist one, which he calls the Third Way. His view is that Poles should get over their anxieties about the left and should once more look at social democracy as a way forward.The debate taking place in Poland and so interestingly reflected in the discussion at the Hay festival dispenses with the burden of symbols and history. Sierakowski reflected the young people's call to be allowed to speak about Poland as a modern state without the burden of nationalism and accompanying xenophobia. Their distrust of the clericalist and backward-looking agenda would be as much a challenge to west European admirers of recent Polish history as it would be to the older generation. This generational gap creates an antidote to the consensus that had dominated Polish political life since the round table talks, in which both the post-Solidarity and the post-communist parties agreed on a number of policies. This allowed for a relatively stress-free transition both in economic and political terms. As Sierakowski pointed out, the answer to why a progressive agenda was not introduced by the left wing was always that the time was not right. Thus time, rather than nationalism, was a convenient way of avoiding debates on principles that form the basis of western democratic social interaction: women's rights, respect for sexual diversity, removal of the church from the public sphere.While the older generation still subscribe to these principles, confining the debate to a few unclear solutions, younger people in Poland might break with the past to widen the choices as well as the alternatives from which answers to Poland's stagnant political landscape might be found. This certainly would be a refreshing development. And it could be the way forward. It would mean jettisoning the cherished symbols of the great days, namely Walesa, the Catholic church and the confrontations of the cold war period, which surely should fade into the past.", "tags": ["Hay festival", "Poland", "World news", "Guardian Hay festival 2009", "Europe"], "title": "Hay festival: Breaking with Poland's past | Anita Prazmowska"},{"date": "2009-06-08T16:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland's contribution to the European parliament might turn out to be a source of stability during the coming years.

One poster for a rival coffee chain features pretty girls saying, \"chocolate, man, coffee ... some things are better rich\". \"What is the difference between Warsaw and England?

The biggest difference is that I am allowed to smoke.\" Satellite television and the internet are bringing change to far-flung rural areas, too, as is the new confidence and openness of those hundreds of thousands of Poles who travelled from small rural towns to work in the UK and Ireland and who are now returning home. Yet all across Poland last week, people voiced the same disenchantment with the public festivities. Major newspapers are planning huge coverage and special supplements. Political personalities such as the former Czech president and playwright V\u00e1clav Havel are being flown in. There is the free concert starring Kylie Minogue and numerous worthy conferences will take place. No one can doubt the desire of the authorities to whip up a storm of enthusiasm. But very few Poles are so far joining in. One poll found that only 41% of the 38 million population actually knew what the celebrations were for.No one regrets the passing of the communists, of course. \"Even on the left many, many welcomed the end of the regime with joy and happiness,\" said Ryszard Kalisz, a former interior minister and senior leader of the leftwing SLD party. Many are intensely proud of the role that Poland played in pioneering resistance to the Moscow-backed regimes, and are resentful that the fall of the Berlin wall has become the symbolic event signifying the swift collapse of communism. But when it comes to the present, many Poles believe that Poland lacks \"moral and political order\" and that the poor \"have been betrayed\", as Karwowoski, the retired union official, puts it. Many more are put off by what they say is the poor quality of their leaders. \"The political class is exceptionally mediocre,\" said Jaroslaw Kurski, deputy editor of the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper, which published its first issue just four days after the 4 June 1989 elections that saw the Solidarity union sweep into effective power. Maciej Stryjecki, a former ministerial private secretary and leftwing activist, agreed: \"I have observed many governments close up. Each new one is worse than the last. Competent, honest, experienced people are very, very rare.\"The disenchantment is especially strong among younger Poles. For Robert Kulik, a 28-year-old legal adviser in the southern town of Lublin who recently returned from a year in the UK, \"solidarity is a not just a slogan or the name of an organisation. It can only be something that exists between people. There isn't any real solidarity in Poland any more\".Certainly the Solidarity that won so much admiration in the west is no more. From being founded as a trade union, Solidarity became a mass movement in the 1980s before becoming a political party in the 1990s. Now it has returned to being a union, with a membership a fraction of that of two decades ago. The modern Solidarity is a close ally of the controversial hard-right Law and Justice party whose leaders, twin brothers Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, have repeatedly shocked local and international audiences with their nationalist, borderline xenophobic rhetoric and alliances with extreme-right groups.Cezary Kowanda, an analyst at Polityka magazine, says that the alliance of Solidarity with the hard right is natural. \"Trade unionism in Poland and Solidarity has always been very closely linked to the church and to a conservative set of social values,\" he told the Observer. \"The real anniversary for a lot of Poles is not the 4 June elections of 1989 but 2 June 1979 when Pope John Paul II made his first pilgrimage to his homeland.\"The 4 June festivities were initially planned for Gdansk, birthplace of Solidarity and scene of the showdowns at the famous docks where workers led by electrician Lech Walesa defied the communist regime. But in the Baltic port city the mood is one of anger rather than nostalgia. The docks are being shut on the orders of the European Union, which Poland officially joined in 2004, and the government feared rioting would mar the anniversary. So while opposition groups including Solidarity and the Law and Justice party celebrate there, the main official festivities, led by the centre-right ruling party of Civic Platform, have been moved to Krakow. A third set of events will take place in the capital.Even the presence of Walesa at the forefront of celebrations is controversial. The former president has been forced to repeatedly deny accusations from right-wingers that he was a communist spy. This month he threatened to boycott all celebrations for the anniversary of the events that eventually saw him made president in 1990.In Swidnik, where the first serious demonstrations against the communist regime in Poland broke out in July 1980 before spreading to Gdansk a month later, they are not celebrating anything at all. The town is a long way from Warsaw and its traffic jams, expensive restaurants and \"yuppie\" flats. The grim tenement blocks and shopping centres of the town of 40,000 do not share the new European buzz of nearby Lublin where students from three universities and young Poles back from the UK or Ireland form their own cafe society.Swidnik is poor, religious, conservative and has one of the highest unemployment rates in Poland. Its mayor is Waldemar Jackson, from the Law and Justice party. \"[The party] supports traditional values like the family ... and is a victim of the dominant political correctness which says that people have no right to value Christianity, the church, to not like homosexuality,\" Jackson said.\"In western European countries you wouldn't understand that, because Islam is much more popular there than Christianity. There are more mosques built in Germany than churches. But Christianity underlies European values.\"Law and Justice won power in 2005, ruling for two years in coalition with extreme-right parties before being defeated two years later by the Civic Platform, who mix neo-liberal economics with moderate conservatism to appeal to Poland's newly wealthy and newly Europeanised classes. Law and Justice's Lech Kasczynski remains president and retains his popularity in the countryside. Civic Platform is popular among the young, in the big cities, among the elite.According to Professor Lena Kolarska-Bobinska, a sociologist, \"there are many Polands\". Jackson, the Swidnik mayor, jokes that where you find two Poles you will find four opinions. Sitting in a Lublin cafe, Kulik too talks of how historically, once there is no common enemy, Poles fight among themselves. Amid the anniversary rows and the rivalries between countryside and city, the sense of division can be overdone. Drazewski, who documented the early protests in Gdansk, says that Poland is now \"stable and rich\". Though the wealth is unequally shared and relative - GDP per capita is around a third of that in the UK - Poles are considerably wealthier than 20 years ago. The Civic Platform government is strong and relatively secure and few contest the basics of the political system. \"No one argues about election results,\" said leftwing leader Kalisz. Poland is even resisting the global economic crisis relatively well, recording a steady 6% year-on-year growth rate until last year. In fact, the importance of rows, often stirred up artificially, over values, identity or the historical record may owe much to the broad ideological consensus. \"There is no real left and the entire political spectrum and debate is situated on the right,\" said Kowanda. The predominant mood is pragmatic and, after the epoch-changing dramas of the late 1980s, most Poles are happy to live in relatively low-key times. Last week 94% of people asked by pollsters to describe the biggest change the events of 1989 had brought spoke of \"the range of goods in the shops\". Even in a Swidnik soup kitchen, people are more into apathy than radicalism. \"I'm not interested in politics or history or celebrating anything particularly,\" said Wladyslaw, an unemployed council technician aged 57. \"I'm just interested in getting a job.\"In the gleaming new offices of the Gazeta Wyborcza, journalists were last week proudly reviewing the commemorative reprint of its first issue. The Gazeta has long been independent of the union. Times have changed, said deputy editor-in-chief Kurski.\"We are becoming a middle-class society, with bourgeois values and bourgeois tastes. We like going on holiday to sunny places, we are careful because of the crisis, but we like shopping anyway,\" he said.\"We are turning into a normal modern European state with all the advantages and disadvantages that that entails. And if that is boring, well, all the better.\"A Polish PopeOn 16 October 1978, the Polish cardinal Karol Wojtyla is elevated to the papacy.The Catholic church had become important in the resistance to communist rule and Pope John Paul II's homecoming tour galvanised the population; 500,000 heard him speak in Warsaw in June 1979. A quarter of the population attended his outdoor masses. His visit was the beginning of the end for the communist regime.The Gdansk StrikesIn Gdansk, at the then \"Lenin Shipyards\", the sacking of outspoken workers, including electrician Lech Walesa, resulted in a strike led by Walesa which began on 14 August 1980. The Gdansk Agreement is eventually signed, giving the legal right to organised trade unions and more freedom for the Catholic church. On 17 September, Solidarnosc (Solidarity), the first independent labour union in the Soviet Bloc, is born.Martial lawOn 13 December 1981, General Wojciech Jaruzelski declares martial law: 5,000 Solidarity members, including Lech Walesa, are arrested in the night. Hundreds of strikes taking place throughout the country are put down by riot police. In October 1982, Solidarity was declared an illegal organisation and duly banned.The Coming of GorbachevOn 5 October 1983, Lech Walesa is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize but prevented from leaving the country to accept it. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev assumes control of the Soviet Union. Three years later, as dissent grows in Soviet satellite countries, he will tell a Communist party conference: \"The imposition of a social system, a way of life or policies from outside by any means, let alone military force, are dangerous trappings of the past.\"Solidarity triumphsIn 1988, a new wave of strikes sweeps the country after food costs are increased by 40%. The government announces it is ready to negotiate with SolidarityThe union is again legalised on 17 April 1989, and allowed to field candidates in the June election. It wins all democratically available seats and forms a government under prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. In December 1990 Lech Walesa is elected president of Poland.", "tags": ["Poland", "European Union", "Catholicism", "World news", "Religion", "Europe"], "title": "Divided Poland falls out over Solidarity"},{"date": "2009-05-29T23:05:24Z", "country": "poland", "content": "I have tried for five months to get a refund\u00ad for a Nokia mobile phone ordered from www.mobilephonesuk.net which never turned up.

Wojnar thinks that paying attention to people with disrupted sleep patterns could help to reduce the toll.\"Identifying those at high risk of suicide is important for preventing it, and these findings indicate that insomnia may be a modifiable risk factor for suicide in the general population,\" Wojnar said.\"This has implications for public health, as the presence of sleep problems should alert doctors to assess such patients for a heightened risk of suicide, even if they don't have a psychiatric condition. Our findings also raise the possibility that addressing sleep problems could reduce the risk of suicidal behaviours.\"Scientists and doctors have known there is a link between sleep problems and suicide, but have not been sure which comes first \u2013 the mental health problem or the exhaustion that comes from sleepless nights.The study was carried out with the involvement of 5,692 American volunteers, a third of whom (35%) reported at least one of the three sleep problems during the previous year.The people most affected were those who woke up too early in the morning. They were twice as likely as those with no sleep problems to have had suicidal thoughts in the preceding 12 months, 2.1 times more likely to have planned suicide and 2.7 times more likely to have tried to kill themselves.Those who found it hard to fall asleep were more likely than those who slept well to think about killing themselves and to make plans. Those who kept waking in the night and took an hour or more to get back to sleep had a raised risk of thinking about suicide and attempting it.Scientists do not know why sleep deprivation increases suicide risk, but they think that it may cause the brain to work less well, leading to poorer judgment, less impulse control and increased feelings of hopelessness.", "tags": ["Mental health", "Health", "Society", "UK news"], "title": "Suicide risk higher for people who have trouble sleeping"},{"date": "2009-05-26T07:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "All historic events seem to need a definition in terms of where they start and end. The collapse of communism in Poland was played out in full view of the world's media. The establishment of the Solidarity movement could well be treated as the starting point of this process. The alternative date could be that of the conclusion of the round table talks or even the first genuinely free elections. For Poland, 1989 was a time of change.I initiated a debate on this subject at this year's Hay festival. Timothy Garton Ash, well known to Guardian readers, and Slawomir Sierakowski, a young editor of a challenging leftwing publication in Poland, were asked to tell the audience when they thought the history of communist Poland had come to an end and the transformation in accordance with the liberal democratic model and free market principles began. Both speakers grappled with the problem created by the power of symbols, which tend to trap us in a timewarp and prevent us moving on to understanding the complexities of present day politics in Poland. The belief that the Polish pope destroyed the evil communist regime is a cliche beloved by the Conservatives as much as it is by the left, which was profoundly critical of the communists' lack of respect for human rights. It was my aim to lead the speakers away from such stereotypes.To an audience only too well aware of the way politics distort principles, as has been the case in British politics, any thoughts on Poland will be interesting. The present-day Polish political landscape looks unimpressive; parties defined by personalities rather than political programmes, an embarrassing president who seem to pride himself in not wanting to understand international politics, controversial intervention in the European parliament, all suggesting political immaturity and lack of a way forward. For Poland the last 20 years have not been easy. The process of party formation \u2013 dealing with the post-communist realities and finding a way of communicating with a constituency that demanded that solutions should be very different from those that the fallen communist regimes had followed \u2013 created problems and, by implications, new solutions.Garton Ash, a witness of the great defining moment in the birth of Solidarity, has suggested that Poles have been seeking and should continue to seek a Polish neo-liberal way forward, not neccessarily based on what happens in other developed European states. Sierakowski, who was too young to participate in the events that shaped Poland's present political institutions, presents a new road: that of Poland reclaiming the right to consider the full spectrum of political ideas, including leftwing ideas, unburdened by its communist one, which he calls the Third Way. His view is that Poles should get over their anxieties about the left and should once more look at social democracy as a way forward.The debate taking place in Poland and so interestingly reflected in the discussion at the Hay festival dispenses with the burden of symbols and history. Sierakowski reflected the young people's call to be allowed to speak about Poland as a modern state without the burden of nationalism and accompanying xenophobia. Their distrust of the clericalist and backward-looking agenda would be as much a challenge to west European admirers of recent Polish history as it would be to the older generation. This generational gap creates an antidote to the consensus that had dominated Polish political life since the round table talks, in which both the post-Solidarity and the post-communist parties agreed on a number of policies. This allowed for a relatively stress-free transition both in economic and political terms. As Sierakowski pointed out, the answer to why a progressive agenda was not introduced by the left wing was always that the time was not right. Thus time, rather than nationalism, was a convenient way of avoiding debates on principles that form the basis of western democratic social interaction: women's rights, respect for sexual diversity, removal of the church from the public sphere.While the older generation still subscribe to these principles, confining the debate to a few unclear solutions, younger people in Poland might break with the past to widen the choices as well as the alternatives from which answers to Poland's stagnant political landscape might be found. This certainly would be a refreshing development. And it could be the way forward. It would mean jettisoning the cherished symbols of the great days, namely Walesa, the Catholic church and the confrontations of the cold war period, which surely should fade into the past.", "tags": ["Hay festival", "Poland", "World news", "Guardian Hay festival 2009", "Europe"], "title": "Hay festival: Breaking with Poland's past | Anita Prazmowska"},{"date": "2009-05-05T19:40:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A lawyer for alleged Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk said today that he is asking the US Supreme Court to halt the deportation of the 89-year-old to Germany, where he faces 29,000 counts of accessory to murder.John Broadley said he sent the motion from Florida and expects it to be filed with the court Wednesday morning. Demjanjuk's family argues he is too sick and frail to be deported.Broadley said he will ask for a reprieve of at least 90 days so he can argue that a federal appeals court in Ohio erred last week when it denied the Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk a stay of deportation.The Justice Department says Demjanjuk and his lawyers have used court filings as a delay tactic.

While British voters appear to have used the elections to convey messages to the three main parties, Poles chose to confirm their support for the ruling party and to distance themselves from extremist groups.Polish voters seemed to want to make good use of their presence in the European parliament to defend Polish interests and to improve Poland's standing. This has been confirmed by preliminary suggestions that the four parties that will be represented may co-operate rather than ally themselves with their European counterparts. This unity may serve the Poles well \u2013 they are increasingly hopeful that Poland's ex-prime minister Jerzy Buzek will succeed as leader of the European parliament.To win the support of the centre-right grouping, Buzek has to defeat Mario Mauro, whose candidacy is supported by the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. The brashness and forcefulness of the Mauro-Berlusconi campaign has alienated many European deputies. It may well turn out that the much-respected Buzek \u2013 and the general perception that Poles have shown themselves reluctant to support marginal and nationalist groupings \u2013 will swing the vote in his favour. To Poles such a victory would be a confirmation of Poland's standing in Europe and a return to European politics. Poland's earlier co-operation with President Bush had alienated both the French and the Germans. A time has come to put that into the past.The 2004 elections to the European parliament resulted in a motley crowd of populists and nationalists representing Poland. Ten members of the Catholic League of Polish Families and six deputies from the Samoobrona peasant movement went to Brussels determined to challenge the assembly and to demand that it should espouse Christian values. The spectacle of Poles demanding a Catholic chapel and haranguing the deputies by claiming they were controlled by homosexuals did little to dispel the negative stereotype of a state still dominated by extreme ideas. It is therefore surprising that during the present elections, at a time of increasing economic insecurity, Poles appear to have decided to support the ruling party by confirming its major role in the European parliament.

A third set of events will take place in the capital.Even the presence of Walesa at the forefront of celebrations is controversial. The former president has been forced to repeatedly deny accusations from right-wingers that he was a communist spy. This month he threatened to boycott all celebrations for the anniversary of the events that eventually saw him made president in 1990.In Swidnik, where the first serious demonstrations against the communist regime in Poland broke out in July 1980 before spreading to Gdansk a month later, they are not celebrating anything at all. The town is a long way from Warsaw and its traffic jams, expensive restaurants and \"yuppie\" flats. The grim tenement blocks and shopping centres of the town of 40,000 do not share the new European buzz of nearby Lublin where students from three universities and young Poles back from the UK or Ireland form their own cafe society.Swidnik is poor, religious, conservative and has one of the highest unemployment rates in Poland. Its mayor is Waldemar Jackson, from the Law and Justice party. \"[The party] supports traditional values like the family ... and is a victim of the dominant political correctness which says that people have no right to value Christianity, the church, to not like homosexuality,\" Jackson said.\"In western European countries you wouldn't understand that, because Islam is much more popular there than Christianity. There are more mosques built in Germany than churches. But Christianity underlies European values.\"Law and Justice won power in 2005, ruling for two years in coalition with extreme-right parties before being defeated two years later by the Civic Platform, who mix neo-liberal economics with moderate conservatism to appeal to Poland's newly wealthy and newly Europeanised classes. Law and Justice's Lech Kasczynski remains president and retains his popularity in the countryside. Civic Platform is popular among the young, in the big cities, among the elite.According to Professor Lena Kolarska-Bobinska, a sociologist, \"there are many Polands\". Jackson, the Swidnik mayor, jokes that where you find two Poles you will find four opinions. Sitting in a Lublin cafe, Kulik too talks of how historically, once there is no common enemy, Poles fight among themselves. Amid the anniversary rows and the rivalries between countryside and city, the sense of division can be overdone. Drazewski, who documented the early protests in Gdansk, says that Poland is now \"stable and rich\". Though the wealth is unequally shared and relative - GDP per capita is around a third of that in the UK - Poles are considerably wealthier than 20 years ago. The Civic Platform government is strong and relatively secure and few contest the basics of the political system. \"No one argues about election results,\" said leftwing leader Kalisz. Poland is even resisting the global economic crisis relatively well, recording a steady 6% year-on-year growth rate until last year. In fact, the importance of rows, often stirred up artificially, over values, identity or the historical record may owe much to the broad ideological consensus. \"There is no real left and the entire political spectrum and debate is situated on the right,\" said Kowanda. The predominant mood is pragmatic and, after the epoch-changing dramas of the late 1980s, most Poles are happy to live in relatively low-key times. Last week 94% of people asked by pollsters to describe the biggest change the events of 1989 had brought spoke of \"the range of goods in the shops\". Even in a Swidnik soup kitchen, people are more into apathy than radicalism. \"I'm not interested in politics or history or celebrating anything particularly,\" said Wladyslaw, an unemployed council technician aged 57. \"I'm just interested in getting a job.\"In the gleaming new offices of the Gazeta Wyborcza, journalists were last week proudly reviewing the commemorative reprint of its first issue. The Gazeta has long been independent of the union. Times have changed, said deputy editor-in-chief Kurski.\"We are becoming a middle-class society, with bourgeois values and bourgeois tastes. We like going on holiday to sunny places, we are careful because of the crisis, but we like shopping anyway,\" he said.\"We are turning into a normal modern European state with all the advantages and disadvantages that that entails. And if that is boring, well, all the better.\"A Polish PopeOn 16 October 1978, the Polish cardinal Karol Wojtyla is elevated to the papacy.The Catholic church had become important in the resistance to communist rule and Pope John Paul II's homecoming tour galvanised the population; 500,000 heard him speak in Warsaw in June 1979. A quarter of the population attended his outdoor masses. His visit was the beginning of the end for the communist regime.The Gdansk StrikesIn Gdansk, at the then \"Lenin Shipyards\", the sacking of outspoken workers, including electrician Lech Walesa, resulted in a strike led by Walesa which began on 14 August 1980. The Gdansk Agreement is eventually signed, giving the legal right to organised trade unions and more freedom for the Catholic church. On 17 September, Solidarnosc (Solidarity), the first independent labour union in the Soviet Bloc, is born.Martial lawOn 13 December 1981, General Wojciech Jaruzelski declares martial law: 5,000 Solidarity members, including Lech Walesa, are arrested in the night. Hundreds of strikes taking place throughout the country are put down by riot police. In October 1982, Solidarity was declared an illegal organisation and duly banned.The Coming of GorbachevOn 5 October 1983, Lech Walesa is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize but prevented from leaving the country to accept it. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev assumes control of the Soviet Union. Three years later, as dissent grows in Soviet satellite countries, he will tell a Communist party conference: \"The imposition of a social system, a way of life or policies from outside by any means, let alone military force, are dangerous trappings of the past.\"Solidarity triumphsIn 1988, a new wave of strikes sweeps the country after food costs are increased by 40%. The government announces it is ready to negotiate with SolidarityThe union is again legalised on 17 April 1989, and allowed to field candidates in the June election. It wins all democratically available seats and forms a government under prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. In December 1990 Lech Walesa is elected president of Poland.", "tags": ["Poland", "European Union", "Catholicism", "World news", "Religion", "Europe"], "title": "Divided Poland falls out over Solidarity"},{"date": "2009-05-29T23:05:24Z", "country": "poland", "content": "I have tried for five months to get a refund\u00ad for a Nokia mobile phone ordered from www.mobilephonesuk.net which never turned up.

Wojnar thinks that paying attention to people with disrupted sleep patterns could help to reduce the toll.\"Identifying those at high risk of suicide is important for preventing it, and these findings indicate that insomnia may be a modifiable risk factor for suicide in the general population,\" Wojnar said.\"This has implications for public health, as the presence of sleep problems should alert doctors to assess such patients for a heightened risk of suicide, even if they don't have a psychiatric condition. Our findings also raise the possibility that addressing sleep problems could reduce the risk of suicidal behaviours.\"Scientists and doctors have known there is a link between sleep problems and suicide, but have not been sure which comes first \u2013 the mental health problem or the exhaustion that comes from sleepless nights.The study was carried out with the involvement of 5,692 American volunteers, a third of whom (35%) reported at least one of the three sleep problems during the previous year.The people most affected were those who woke up too early in the morning. They were twice as likely as those with no sleep problems to have had suicidal thoughts in the preceding 12 months, 2.1 times more likely to have planned suicide and 2.7 times more likely to have tried to kill themselves.Those who found it hard to fall asleep were more likely than those who slept well to think about killing themselves and to make plans. Those who kept waking in the night and took an hour or more to get back to sleep had a raised risk of thinking about suicide and attempting it.Scientists do not know why sleep deprivation increases suicide risk, but they think that it may cause the brain to work less well, leading to poorer judgment, less impulse control and increased feelings of hopelessness.", "tags": ["Mental health", "Health", "Society", "UK news"], "title": "Suicide risk higher for people who have trouble sleeping"},{"date": "2009-05-26T07:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "All historic events seem to need a definition in terms of where they start and end. The collapse of communism in Poland was played out in full view of the world's media. The establishment of the Solidarity movement could well be treated as the starting point of this process. The alternative date could be that of the conclusion of the round table talks or even the first genuinely free elections. For Poland, 1989 was a time of change.I initiated a debate on this subject at this year's Hay festival. Timothy Garton Ash, well known to Guardian readers, and Slawomir Sierakowski, a young editor of a challenging leftwing publication in Poland, were asked to tell the audience when they thought the history of communist Poland had come to an end and the transformation in accordance with the liberal democratic model and free market principles began. Both speakers grappled with the problem created by the power of symbols, which tend to trap us in a timewarp and prevent us moving on to understanding the complexities of present day politics in Poland. The belief that the Polish pope destroyed the evil communist regime is a cliche beloved by the Conservatives as much as it is by the left, which was profoundly critical of the communists' lack of respect for human rights. It was my aim to lead the speakers away from such stereotypes.To an audience only too well aware of the way politics distort principles, as has been the case in British politics, any thoughts on Poland will be interesting. The present-day Polish political landscape looks unimpressive; parties defined by personalities rather than political programmes, an embarrassing president who seem to pride himself in not wanting to understand international politics, controversial intervention in the European parliament, all suggesting political immaturity and lack of a way forward. For Poland the last 20 years have not been easy. The process of party formation \u2013 dealing with the post-communist realities and finding a way of communicating with a constituency that demanded that solutions should be very different from those that the fallen communist regimes had followed \u2013 created problems and, by implications, new solutions.Garton Ash, a witness of the great defining moment in the birth of Solidarity, has suggested that Poles have been seeking and should continue to seek a Polish neo-liberal way forward, not neccessarily based on what happens in other developed European states. Sierakowski, who was too young to participate in the events that shaped Poland's present political institutions, presents a new road: that of Poland reclaiming the right to consider the full spectrum of political ideas, including leftwing ideas, unburdened by its communist one, which he calls the Third Way. His view is that Poles should get over their anxieties about the left and should once more look at social democracy as a way forward.The debate taking place in Poland and so interestingly reflected in the discussion at the Hay festival dispenses with the burden of symbols and history. Sierakowski reflected the young people's call to be allowed to speak about Poland as a modern state without the burden of nationalism and accompanying xenophobia. Their distrust of the clericalist and backward-looking agenda would be as much a challenge to west European admirers of recent Polish history as it would be to the older generation. This generational gap creates an antidote to the consensus that had dominated Polish political life since the round table talks, in which both the post-Solidarity and the post-communist parties agreed on a number of policies. This allowed for a relatively stress-free transition both in economic and political terms. As Sierakowski pointed out, the answer to why a progressive agenda was not introduced by the left wing was always that the time was not right. Thus time, rather than nationalism, was a convenient way of avoiding debates on principles that form the basis of western democratic social interaction: women's rights, respect for sexual diversity, removal of the church from the public sphere.While the older generation still subscribe to these principles, confining the debate to a few unclear solutions, younger people in Poland might break with the past to widen the choices as well as the alternatives from which answers to Poland's stagnant political landscape might be found. This certainly would be a refreshing development. And it could be the way forward. It would mean jettisoning the cherished symbols of the great days, namely Walesa, the Catholic church and the confrontations of the cold war period, which surely should fade into the past.", "tags": ["Hay festival", "Poland", "World news", "Guardian Hay festival 2009", "Europe"], "title": "Hay festival: Breaking with Poland's past | Anita Prazmowska"},{"date": "2009-05-05T19:40:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A lawyer for alleged Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk said today that he is asking the US Supreme Court to halt the deportation of the 89-year-old to Germany, where he faces 29,000 counts of accessory to murder.John Broadley said he sent the motion from Florida and expects it to be filed with the court Wednesday morning.

He has a home; he travels there; he works there,\" he said.\"His presence there is well-known, as it is through much of Europe, so this came kind of as a shock, given the fact that he was invited to Zurich to receive a lifetime achievement award.\"Polanski, the director of Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby, had travelled to Switzerland to accept an award at the Zurich film festival.

That is where we draw the line. If someone wants to have a new ideological confrontation with Europe, then historical revisionism and attempts to turn history into a practical political instrument is a direct path toward this confrontation.\"Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, flatly rejected that version of history, while paying tributes to the tens of thousands of Russian troops who died in Poland. \"They gave their lives for liberation, but they didn't bring us freedom. But we honour them too, and care for their graves.\"Tusk and Putin sought to defuse the row, with the Russian leader also paying tribute to Polish bravery against the Germans. But there were no apologies from the Russians.At the core of the row are two events \u2013 the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the Katyn massacre.Under the pact \u2013 a week before the war started \u2013 Stalin and Hitler secretly agreed to carve up Poland between them. Stalin also annexed the three Baltic states and a slice of Romania.Hitler obtained carte blanche to start the war without fear of Russian retaliation and Stalin bought time to prepare for the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union two years later.At Katyn, within months of occupying eastern Poland, the Russians massacred much of the Polish officer and cultural elite, up to 26,000, in one of the first acts of mass murder of the war. Moscow then denied the crime for 59 years, blaming it on the Germans.\"This was revenge,\" said the Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, today as Putin looked on. \"This was chauvinism.\"Putin today condemned the Nazi-Soviet pact, but equated Stalin's actions with those of western leaders at the time. \"All attempts to appease the Nazis between 1934 and 1939 through various agreements and pacts were morally unacceptable,\" Putin said. \"We must admit these mistakes. Our country has done this.\"Adam Rotfeld, a former Polish foreign minister, described the Russian campaign in the run-up to today as \"disgusting\". The Polish tabloid press has been screaming with indignation. \"Russia!

Glory to the heroes of those days, glory to the heroes of Westerplatte, glory to all of the soldiers who fought in world war two against German Nazism, and against Bolshevik totalitarianism.\"The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, warned of the dangers of forgetting the war's lessons.\"We meet here to remember who started the war, who the culprit was, who the executioner in the war was, and who was the victim of this aggression,\" Tusk said.\"We meet here to remember this, because we Poles know that without this memory, honest memory about the truth, about the sources of world war two, Poland, Europe and the world will not be safe. We remember because we know well that he who forgets, or he who falsifies history, and has power or will assume power, will bring unhappiness again, like 70 years ago.\"Later in the day, around 20 European leaders and officials including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, his French counterpart, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, and the British foreign secretary, David Miliband, will take part in a larger service on Westerplatte.Today's meeting takes place amid swirling tensions over who \u2013 apart from Hitler \u2013 was responsible for starting the second world war. Over the summer the Baltic states, led by Lithuania, blamed Hitler and Stalin equally for the conflict. The claim provoked a furious reaction from Moscow, with the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, on Sunday dismissing it as \"quite frankly, a flat-out lie\".Russia is today releasing documents from the secret archive of its foreign SVR intelligence service which are likely to blame Poland. The Kremlin says that Poland was a Nazi ally and a willing accomplice to Hitler's partition of Czechoslovakia in 1938.In a letter to Poles published in the Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza yesterday, Putin struck a conciliatory tone. He described as \"immoral\" the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939, which saw Hitler and Stalin carve up eastern Europe under a secret deal.\"Without doubt the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact can be fully condemned,\" Putin wrote. But he also pointed the finger at France and Britain for signing the Munich agreement in 1938, making a Nazi attack eastwards on Russia more likely.While Poland's relations with Russia remain tense, Putin called for \"joint grief and forgiveness\" in the hope that \"Russian-Polish relations will sooner or later reach such a high level of true partnership\" as Russian-German ties.Angela Merkel welcomed her invitation to the events, pointing to it as a \"signal of reconciliation\" between Germany and Poland. She called 1 September \"a day of mourning for the suffering\" that Nazi Germany brought on Europe and of \"remembrance of the guilt Germany brought upon itself\" by starting the war.Writing on his Foreign Office blog, David Miliband said: \"We have a duty to remember the sacrifices, including of Poles fighting in and alongside British forces, and to learn the right lessons \u2013 about confronting racism and xenophobia, about standing up against tyranny, and about building international co-operation.\"This will be a poignant return to Poland for me, as my mother survived the war in hiding in Poland before coming to the UK in 1946.\"Poland alone lost some 6 million citizens in the war, 3 million of whom were Jews.", "tags": ["Second world war", "Poland", "Germany", "Russia", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Poland marks second world war anniversary"},{"date": "2009-09-28T14:32:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A diplomatic war was brewing today over the arrest of the filmmaker Roman Polanski, who was detained in Switzerland on a decades-old warrant relating to the rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977.France and Poland urged Switzerland to free the 76-year-old director on bail and said they would be lobbying the US government all the way up to the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand, the French culture minister, said the arrest was proof of the \"frightening\" side of America.\"In the same way as there is a generous America which we love, there is also a certain kind of America which is frightening, and it is this America which has now shown us its face,\" he said.Reports this afternoon said the director had refused to voluntarily go to the US to face charges, raising the prospect of a long and drawn-out legal saga.Despite being held in Swiss custody for two nights, Polanski remains \"totally combative and determined to defend himself\", one of his French lawyers said.Herv\u00e9 Temime told France Info radio a request for bail would be made today and that he would be \"surprised and disappointed\" if permission was not granted.\"We are going to start by requesting he be let out of detention, which should in theory happen today,\" said Temime. \"There is no reason ... to keep Roman Polanski in prison.\"I hope we can very quickly bring to an end this situation which seems to me to be totally grotesque.\"Polanski is in good spirits, his agent said today. \"His voice is strong ... he's very anxious to get this resolved and go home,\" Jeff Berg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Berg said the film director's arrest on a 1978 US warrant as he arrived in Switzerland from France was a surprise because he has had a house in the country for more than a decade.\"It is surprising because Roman, for the last 12, 15 years, has lived in Switzerland. He has a home; he travels there; he works there,\" he said.\"His presence there is well-known, as it is through much of Europe, so this came kind of as a shock, given the fact that he was invited to Zurich to receive a lifetime achievement award.\"Polanski, the director of Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby, had travelled to Switzerland to accept an award at the Zurich film festival. The event's organisers expressed \"great consternation and shock\" at his detention.He has hired the Swiss lawyer Lorenz Erni, of the Eschmann & Erni firm, to fight any extradition charges.The Oscar-winning director Andrzej Wajda and other Polish filmmakers have appealed to the US, Swiss and Polish authorities for the Paris-born Polanski to be freed.Jacek Bromski, head of the Polish Filmmakers Association, said Polanski had spent all of August at his house in the German-speaking village of Gstaad, south-west Switzerland, working on his latest movie, The Ghost.\"Nothing happened\" to him during that time, Bromski said, adding that in the eyes of the public, Polanski has already \"atoned for the sins of his young years\".Polanski has strong links with Poland, having moved to the country with his Jewish family as a child shortly before the second world war.His mother died in a Nazi concentration camp but he avoided capture and spent his youth in Poland before moving to the west.The director has held French citizenship for many years and is married to the French singer and actor Emmanuelle Seigner.He has spent much of his life in France since fleeing the US in 1978 but regularly visits countries that do not have extradition treaties with the US.The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, wants to see the director reunited swiftly with his family, Mitterrand said.Polanski pleaded guilty to the assault in 1977 but jumped bail and fled the US the following year to avoid a lengthy prison sentence.He has spent more than three decades in exile in Paris, refusing to return to the US even when he won an Oscar for The Pianist in 2003.Zurich police said he had been detained in the city on Saturday night at the request of the US justice department and was in custody awaiting extradition.\"There was a valid arrest request and we knew when he was coming,\" Guido Balmer, of the Swiss justice ministry, said. \"That's why he was taken into custody.\"Polanski was 44 and already a twice Oscar-nominated director when he had sex with Samantha Gailey, a 13-year-old model he had hired for a photoshoot, at Jack Nicholson's home in Los Angeles in 1977.He claimed the sex was consensual, saying the girl was \"not unresponsive\", but Gailey said he drugged her with painkillers and champagne before carrying out a \"very scary\" assault.In recent months, Polanski's lawyers have been seeking, through the US courts, to have the rape charges against him dropped after saying new evidence had emerged in a documentary to show he was the victim of \"judicial misconduct\" at his original trial.The documentary showed a former Los Angeles deputy district attorney admitting discussing the case with the trial judge while it was ongoing.", "tags": ["Roman Polanski", "Film", "Switzerland", "France", "Poland", "US news", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Free Roman Polanski now, demand France and Poland"},{"date": "2009-09-01T19:12:44Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Russia today released secret documents from the archives of its foreign intelligence service that it said showed how Poland sided with the Nazis before the second world war and tried to destroy the Soviet Union.Russia published 400 pages of documents gathered by undercover Soviet agents between 1935 and 1945, including telegrams, letters and reports intercepted from Polish missions abroad. Their release coincided with the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of war.The declassified files from Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service allegedly show that Poland was plotting against the Soviet Union in the years preceding the war, which began when Hitler invaded western Poland on 1 September 1939.Seventeen days later, the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland. But according to the SVR, Poland was not simply a victim of Soviet aggression, but had been actively pursuing an anti-Soviet foreign policy from the mid-1930s. This included supporting anti-Soviet national groups in Ukraine, the Caucasus and central Asia.Lev Sotskov, a retired KGB major general who compiled the documents, said there was evidence Poland signed a secret protocol with Germany in 1934. Citing a report written by an unidentified Soviet agent, he said Poland had agreed to remain neutral if Germany attacked the Soviet Union.His claims provoked uproar at a press conference in Moscow, with Polish journalists jumping to their feet and denouncing the document as a fake. There were also heated exchanges over the role played by Jozef Beck, Poland's foreign minister in 1939, amid unsubstantiated claims he was a German agent.The \"protocol\" goes much further than the 1934 non-aggression pact between Poland and Nazi Germany, under which both sides agreed not to attack each other. Sotskov denied that the release of the protocol was a provocative gesture. \"We should be glad these things are coming into the open,\" he said.Tonight, Polish historians said there was no evidence to suggest such a protocol ever existed. \"This is absolute rubbish,\" said Mariusz Wolos, of Poland's Academy of Sciences. \"Nothing similar has ever turned up in archives in Germany. Just because some agent wrote it doesn't mean it's true. There isn't much new here. The documents [released by the SVR] simply confirm what British, German and Russian historians already know.\" What would be interesting would be to find out the identities of the Soviet Union's agents in Poland. But they aren't telling us.\"Asked why Russia had decided to release such contentious material now, he said: \"It's part of the struggle for historical memory. Russia is keen to show that it isn't just Hitler and the Soviet Union who were responsible for the war.\"The documents show that a group of Polish spies based in Paris took part in a secret operation called Prometheism to incite an uprising in Ukraine, Georgia and other Soviet territories. \"We know all about that. It's already written about,\" Wolos said.Other documents declassified include a letter from Hermann G\u00f6ring following a visit to Warsaw in 1937. G\u00f6ring passed on an assurance from Hitler that Germany wouldn't attack Poland, warning that the real danger to Poland came from Moscow \u2013 \"not just from Bolshevism but from Russia\".The publication follows the release two weeks ago of documents on the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, signed by the Soviet Union and Germany on the eve of war. Sotskov today repeated his claim that the deal, under which Hitler and Stalin agreed to carve up eastern Europe, \"gave the Red Army two years to prepare for the war\".", "tags": ["Second world war", "Poland", "Russia", "Germany", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Fury as Russia presents 'evidence' Poland sided with Nazis before war"},{"date": "2009-09-01T19:36:58Z", "country": "poland", "content": "European presidents and prime ministers gathered today on Poland's Baltic coast to mark 70 years since the first shots were fired in the second world war with Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland.But as direct memory of the war recedes, the ceremonies in Gdansk were clouded by bitter recrimination over Russia and Stalinism in central and eastern Europe, feeding current tensions between Moscow and several of its former client states in the region.While the Poles and the Baltic states demanded apologies from the Kremlin for their communist \"enslavement\" as a result of the war, the Russians bridled at what they see as western belittling of their finest 20th century moment, the Red Army's defeat of Nazi Germany.Leaders of Poland, Germany, Russia, France, Britain and a dozen other countries met in bright sunshine alongside Polish flags and brass bands to issue pledges of never again and celebrate the unification of old enemies in an expanding European Union over the past 20 years.For the first time in decades of solemn commemoration of the second world war, however, the focus fell not on Germany and what its leader, Chancellor Angela Merkel, said, but on Moscow and how Prime Minister Vladimir Putin dealt with weeks of verbal sparring with the east Europeans over Russia's wartime and postwar role in the region.Putin has spent the past decade seeking to restore Russian greatness, partly through rehabilitating Josef Stalin and encouraging a heroic, nationalist narrative at home.Today he was told bluntly that the Russians did not bring freedom to central Europe, that they stabbed Poland in the back in 1939 following the Nazi invasion, and that the Kremlin's imperial ambitions remain a danger today, as shown by last year's war against Georgia.The runup to today's events in Gdansk, where a German battleship opened fire on Polish fortifications in the early hours of 1 September 1939, starting a six-year war that left 50 million dead and wiped out much of the Jewish population of Europe, was dominated by furious fighting over European history between Russia and its former satellites in the Soviet empire.Poland, partitioned in 1939 by the twin tyrannies of Hitler and Stalin, and where the Nazi Holocaust mass murder of Jews largely took place, has been the main target of a concerted Russian propaganda campaign in recent weeks.The Kremlin and its spin doctors have accused Poland of plotting with the Nazis to invade Russia and of gleefully joining in Germany's carve-up of Czechoslovakia.Moscow's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warned today of a new showdown between Russia and Europe over the rewriting of history, highlighting the deep gulf in perceptions of the causes and effects of the war 70 years later.\"Freedom came from the east,\" said Lavrov. \"Russia, once again, fulfilled its historic mission to save Europe from forced unification and its own madness.\"Victory was achieved at too great a price for us to simply let it be taken away from us. That is where we draw the line. If someone wants to have a new ideological confrontation with Europe, then historical revisionism and attempts to turn history into a practical political instrument is a direct path toward this confrontation.\"Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, flatly rejected that version of history, while paying tributes to the tens of thousands of Russian troops who died in Poland. \"They gave their lives for liberation, but they didn't bring us freedom. But we honour them too, and care for their graves.\"Tusk and Putin sought to defuse the row, with the Russian leader also paying tribute to Polish bravery against the Germans. But there were no apologies from the Russians.At the core of the row are two events \u2013 the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the Katyn massacre.Under the pact \u2013 a week before the war started \u2013 Stalin and Hitler secretly agreed to carve up Poland between them. Stalin also annexed the three Baltic states and a slice of Romania.Hitler obtained carte blanche to start the war without fear of Russian retaliation and Stalin bought time to prepare for the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union two years later.At Katyn, within months of occupying eastern Poland, the Russians massacred much of the Polish officer and cultural elite, up to 26,000, in one of the first acts of mass murder of the war. Moscow then denied the crime for 59 years, blaming it on the Germans.\"This was revenge,\" said the Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, today as Putin looked on. \"This was chauvinism.\"Putin today condemned the Nazi-Soviet pact, but equated Stalin's actions with those of western leaders at the time. \"All attempts to appease the Nazis between 1934 and 1939 through various agreements and pacts were morally unacceptable,\" Putin said. \"We must admit these mistakes. Our country has done this.\"Adam Rotfeld, a former Polish foreign minister, described the Russian campaign in the run-up to today as \"disgusting\". The Polish tabloid press has been screaming with indignation. \"Russia! Apologise for your crimes!\" said the banner headline in the Super Express. \"Apologise for attacking Poland, for the Katyn genocide, for murdering our heroes, for sending Poles to Siberia.\"The Russians are particularly outraged over what they see as western attempts to equate Stalin with Hitler. \"Those who falsify history forget the things they gained as the result of the Red Army's liberation campaign,\" said Lavrov.But \"liberation\" ushered in 45 years of repressive Soviet communism in Poland and the Baltic.

He said it would focus on the threat posed by Iran's short- and medium-range missiles, rather than its intercontinental nuclear capabilities.Obama announced the reversal officially at a news conference today. \"This new approach will provide capabilities sooner, build on proven systems to offer greater defences to the threat of attack than the 2007 European missile defence programme,\" he said.He phoned the leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic last night to tell them he had dropped plans to site missile interceptors and a radar station in their respective countries. Russia had furiously opposed the project, claiming it targeted Moscow's nuclear arsenal.The change of tack had been prompted by advances in missile technology and new intelligence about Iran's existing missile capabilities, Obama said.The US president said \"updated intelligence\" on Iran's existing short- and medium-range missiles showed they were \"capable of reaching Europe\". He added that the US would continue its efforts to end Iranian attempts to develop an \"illicit nuclear programme\".He said: \"To put it simply our new missile defence architecture in Europe will provide stronger, smarter, swifter defences of American forces and America's allies.\"During a visit to Moscow in July Obama indicated he was ordering a 60-day review of the scheme. According to today's Wall Street Journal, the findings, to be released next week, conclude that Iran's long-range missile programme is progressing more slowly than previously thought. Citing US officials, the paper said the White House believes Iran's short to medium-range programme poses a more potent and immediate danger.In his press conference today, Obama made a point of rejecting Russia's objections to the missile defence shield. \"Its concerns about our previous missile defence programmes were entirely unfounded,\" he said.The Russian response suggested Obama's decision would not be met by any swift or generous concessions. A foreign ministry spokesman, Andrei Nesterenko, described the move as \"obviously a positive sign for us\" but made clear the decision had been a unilateral one taken by Washington alone. He suggested there had been no deals with Moscow on Iran or other issues. \"That would disagree with our policy of resolution of any problems in relations with any countries, no matter how difficult or sensitive they may be.\"The US decision will cheer many in government in western Europe who believed the scheme was an unnecessary provocation to the Russians. But today the Czech Republic and Poland expressed disappointment at the White House's decision to reverse track after six years of difficult negotiations. Senior sources in Warsaw and Prague said they would insist on the Americans honouring pledges they made to the Nato allies in return for agreeing last year to the plan for missile defence deployments.Alexandr Vondra, a former Czech deputy prime minister and ambassador to Washington intimately involved in the negotiations with the Americans, said he was surprised. \"This is a U-turn in US policy,\" he said. \"But first we expect the US to honour its commitments. If they don't they may have problems generating support for Afghanistan and on other things.\"Under the Bush administration the Pentagon spent years planning and negotiating to place 10 silos with interceptor rockets in northern Poland and to build a large radar station south of Prague to defend against a perceived ballistic missile threat from Iran.The central European countries were keen to acquire the US installations and other military hardware as partial security guarantees against a resurgent Russia. Moscow claimed the project was aimed against Russia and threatened to deploy short-range nuclear weapons in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, which sits inside the European Union.Obama's climbdown is likely to be seen by Russia as a victory for its uncompromising stance.Today, however, analysts pointed out the decision would help Obama secure Moscow's co-operation on a possible new sanctions package against Iran and would further his desire to \"reset\" relations with Moscow following a dismal period under the Bush administration.It would significantly boost the chances of a new treaty on strategic nuclear arms reduction between Washington and Moscow, they said. Both the US and Russia have agreed to come up with a successor treaty to Start 1 by December, when the current agreement expires.\"Hardliners in Russia don't want an agreement on Start. It will be very difficult now for Russia to avoid an agreement,\" said Ruben Sergeyev, a defence analyst in Moscow. \"It [the decision to drop the US shield] creates a very positive ambience, despite the fact it was really an artificial thing.\"The decision strengthens Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian president, who is due to make his first presidential trip to the US next week for the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh. The Obama administration has been keen to boost Medvedev's standing and authority at home, seeing him as a more moderate and less hostile interlocutor than Putin.Today the Nato secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said Obama's decision was \"a positive step\". Rasmussen said he had been briefed by the US envoy to Nato about it.But the timing of the announcement is regarded as disastrous by the Poles. Eugeniusz Smolar, a former chief of Warsaw's Centre for International Relations, said: \"We are disappointed.\" But he added that the Polish government had been assured by the Americans that promises of training with Patriot missile batteries and help in modernising the Polish military remained valid.A few weeks ago, in a cri de coeur to Washington, several senior eastern European officials and public figures wrote a public letter to Obama complaining that their security interests were being ignored by the west to improve relations with Moscow.Rasmussen, in his first big speech, is to call tomorrow for a new relationship between the western military alliance and Russia, taking more account of Moscow's security and strategic interests.Russian experts said Obama's decision could only be seen as an unambiguous concession to Moscow, adding that it would severely disappoint the new Nato countries of eastern Europe. Yevgeny Miasnikov, a senior research scientist at Moscow's Centre for Arms Control, said the US administration would now consider ways of assuaging the Poles and Czechs, which might include providing Poland with Patriot interceptors capable of shooting down short- and medium-range missiles.\"Obama has taken a step in the direction of improving US-Russian relations. This will definitely help build a partnership,\" Miasnikov said. \"Russia will also now make some concessions, maybe on strategic talks over nuclear arms reduction or maybe over Iran.\"Moscow will try to catalyse the process of improving US-Iranian relations and will facilitate dialogue between the two sides. I don't think threatening Iran is the way to solve this problem.\"", "tags": ["Obama administration", "Nuclear weapons", "US news", "Russia", "Poland", "Iran", "Czech Republic", "World news", "US politics", "Europe"], "title": "Obama abandons missile defence shield in Europe"},{"date": "2009-11-04T09:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Five years ago, I administered CPR to an old gent who had collapsed on a train with a heart attack. Later, I learned that he was an Auschwitz survivor named Antoni Kolodziejczyk; the number 138048 was tattooed on his left forearm. When he recovered, he spoke to me of wartime memories that he had rarely shared before, even with his own family. That experience meant a lot to me, and so did the words of the chief rabbi of Poland last week.Who could Rabbi Michael Schudrich, a smart and feisty New Yorker, have been talking about when he protested against the \"grotesque distortion\" of his words for political gain in the UK? Why did he feel the need to intervene and say it is wrong to play on a false stereotype of Poles as antisemites? Did he have in mind certain Labour politicians, and journalists at the New Statesman and the Guardian?Of course, he did. The chief rabbi identified an element of the British left that has propagated a smear campaign accusing a Tory ally, Polish MEP Michal Kaminski, of antisemitism. By association, it has been implied that Kaminski's Law and Justice party and its voters are extremist, far-right or even neo-Nazi. None of these labels fit: that party can only be described as staunchly conservative, or nationalist conservative at worst.I have never voted for the Tories and Michal Kaminski is not a friend of mine. His party is far too suspicious of market economics and is also far too Eurosceptic, for my liking. I disagree with its views on lifestyle and social policy. So I have no reason to exonerate Kaminski whatsoever. But I do know this charge of antisemitism against Kaminski came after preparation in the UK for a negative PR operation against Law and Justice. On my desk is a copy of the 15-page plan of attack against the Tories' Polish allies that circulated Whitehall this summer. I've been asked not to publish it, and source anonymity should be protected. But I am convinced its content is as vacuous as the \"dodgy dossier\", the cooked-up intelligence that took us into Iraq.Some on the British left have made one-sided assertions about the history of eastern Europe, and have cast Polish or Tory attempts to reveal the whole truth with all its nuances as hair-splitting about the Holocaust. And journalists have amplified rather than scrutinised the demagoguery of David Miliband.All this manipulation, I have been told, is justifiable because it is a way of attacking the Tories. I beg to differ. There is no excuse for demonising an entire ethnic group, in this case the Poles, because it might save a few Labour MPs their jobs at the next election.Some commentators have said this has been a Labour ploy to win over the British Jewish vote, by stirring up fear of Polish antisemitism. But people who really care about gentile-Jewish relations know there is a tremendous Jewish revival underway in Poland, and the country is clearly identifying and denouncing crimes against Jews.Poland is also investigating alleged Jewish collaboration with the Soviets, a notion many British people seem to assume must be an antisemitic conspiracy theory on a par with the blood libel. Certainly, the stereotype of Jewish Bolshevism has been used in an attempt to justify race hate. But if dealt with fairly and accurately, this subject needn't be any more taboo than the culpability of Polish gentiles in the Soviet-backed regime and at the pogroms of Jedwabne, Kielce and others.When Stalin and Hitler divided Poland in 1939, the Soviets took more territory than the Nazis did. At first, Polish Jews in the Soviet partition were naturally relieved and grateful that they would not be under Nazi oppression. By contrast, many Polish gentiles immediately viewed the Soviets as invading enemies. This is when the seam between Polish Jews and Polish gentiles was sundered. The Soviets conducted a policy of social engineering, sometimes offering poor Jews among others the positions that established Polish gentiles had once had before they were deported to the Gulags. Some Polish Jews betrayed their country and served the Soviets, as some Polish gentiles also did. There were unforgivable gentile reprisals against Jews punished because of guilt by association. When discussing this volatile subject, it is wrong to stereotype Polish Jews as pro-Soviet, but it is equally wrong to say questions about Polish-Jewish collaboration with the Soviets are necessarily antisemitic.While antisemitism exists in Poland, as it does in the UK, more and more Jews are discovering their Polish roots, while many Polish gentiles are discovering their Jewish roots too. Moreover, ever more research is showing us that Poland's pre-war gentile and Jewish communities were far more united than popular myth has led people to believe.Some 120,000 Polish Jews served in the Polish army at the start of the second world war, and defended their country against the joint Soviet-Nazi invasion of 1939. At the Katyn forest massacre of the Polish elite, the Soviets executed at least 600 Jews who were Polish army officers. Among them, the chief rabbi of the Polish army, Major Baruch Steinberg, was shot in the back of the head by a Soviet bullet. His body was slung in a mass grave next to the bodies of his Polish gentile countrymen. The motivations were different, but it is quite possible that as many Polish Jews were murdered at the massacre at Katyn as were murdered at the massacre at Jedwabne.Ignoring these facts prompts the slightly confusing thesis that the Jedwabne pogrom can be compared to what the Nazis did in the Holocaust. But Stalin's crimes cannot be compared to Hitler's. In case anyone has forgotten, Nazi Germany killed up to 3 million Polish citizens who were gentiles, 3 million Polish citizens who were Jews, and 3 million Jews from outside Poland. Some Polish gentiles saved Jewish lives; some Polish gentiles betrayed Jews. A far greater proportion of the Polish Jewish community was wiped out than the Polish gentile community.During the war, the Polish government in exile, which included Jews in its cabinet, passed a Polish intelligence report to their British allies. In it, the Poles informed the British about the Nazi German gas chambers, and requested an RAF air strike on the train lines. Churchill ignored the Polish request to save tens of thousands of Jews from death at Auschwitz. One wonders whether David Miliband will ever see fit to apologise for that on behalf of Britain, and whether it would be antisemitic of him to oppose the apology.One of the main charges against Kaminski, of course, is that he opposed Poland's 2001 apology for the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, in which a mob of around 40 Polish gentiles, in the presence of German police, murdered at least 300 Polish Jews. Kaminski said that asking for an apology would be as wrong as asking Polish Jews to apologise for their collaboration with the Soviets and their crimes against Polish gentiles.In my view, Kaminski was wrong to oppose that apology, which was intended as an act of reconciliation rather than a suggestion that the entire Polish nation had participated in the Holocaust. The point is, many Poles view Jedwabne a criminal act against fellow Polish citizens carried out by a small but vicious rabble who betrayed the core Polish value of anti-Nazism. Those 40 pogromists have always been viewed as traitors in Poland.Kaminski was wrong to oppose the apology, and his analogy was offensive. But according to the chief rabbi, Kaminski has put his teenage extremism behind him and he is not an antisemite.Polish people, including the million-strong Polish community in Britain, are deeply proud that Poland never produced a collaborationist regime, nor home-grown SS units, as happened elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe. Poland also resisted the savagery of the Soviet Union long before the Western allies did. So, for many Poles, there has never been a choice between fascism and communism \u2013 their country is characterised by its defiance against totalitarianism in all its forms.Today, even as Poles challenge the stereotype of Polish antisemitism, many have the courage to depict incidents of Polish wrongdoing against Jews with total clarity; and they show how strongly they object to cowardly anti-Polish slurs. Slowly but surely, Poles are defining themselves not by the suffering of the forefathers, but by their courage.Both Miliband and Kaminski are political opportunists, and their simplistic comments get in the way of genuine understanding. We should be very cautious of them both.", "tags": ["Michal Kaminski", "Poland", "Race issues", "Religion", "Judaism", "The far right", "UK news", "David Miliband", "Europe"], "title": "Poland: prejudice and pride | Kamil Tchorek"},{"date": "2009-11-04T09:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Five years ago, I administered CPR to an old gent who had collapsed on a train with a heart attack.

That experience meant a lot to me, and so did the words of the chief rabbi of Poland last week.Who could Rabbi Michael Schudrich, a smart and feisty New Yorker, have been talking about when he protested against the \"grotesque distortion\" of his words for political gain in the UK? Why did he feel the need to intervene and say it is wrong to play on a false stereotype of Poles as antisemites? Did he have in mind certain Labour politicians, and journalists at the New Statesman and the Guardian?Of course, he did. The chief rabbi identified an element of the British left that has propagated a smear campaign accusing a Tory ally, Polish MEP Michal Kaminski, of antisemitism. By association, it has been implied that Kaminski's Law and Justice party and its voters are extremist, far-right or even neo-Nazi. None of these labels fit: that party can only be described as staunchly conservative, or nationalist conservative at worst.I have never voted for the Tories and Michal Kaminski is not a friend of mine. His party is far too suspicious of market economics and is also far too Eurosceptic, for my liking. I disagree with its views on lifestyle and social policy. So I have no reason to exonerate Kaminski whatsoever. But I do know this charge of antisemitism against Kaminski came after preparation in the UK for a negative PR operation against Law and Justice. On my desk is a copy of the 15-page plan of attack against the Tories' Polish allies that circulated Whitehall this summer. I've been asked not to publish it, and source anonymity should be protected. But I am convinced its content is as vacuous as the \"dodgy dossier\", the cooked-up intelligence that took us into Iraq.Some on the British left have made one-sided assertions about the history of eastern Europe, and have cast Polish or Tory attempts to reveal the whole truth with all its nuances as hair-splitting about the Holocaust. And journalists have amplified rather than scrutinised the demagoguery of David Miliband.All this manipulation, I have been told, is justifiable because it is a way of attacking the Tories. I beg to differ. There is no excuse for demonising an entire ethnic group, in this case the Poles, because it might save a few Labour MPs their jobs at the next election.Some commentators have said this has been a Labour ploy to win over the British Jewish vote, by stirring up fear of Polish antisemitism. But people who really care about gentile-Jewish relations know there is a tremendous Jewish revival underway in Poland, and the country is clearly identifying and denouncing crimes against Jews.Poland is also investigating alleged Jewish collaboration with the Soviets, a notion many British people seem to assume must be an antisemitic conspiracy theory on a par with the blood libel. Certainly, the stereotype of Jewish Bolshevism has been used in an attempt to justify race hate. But if dealt with fairly and accurately, this subject needn't be any more taboo than the culpability of Polish gentiles in the Soviet-backed regime and at the pogroms of Jedwabne, Kielce and others.When Stalin and Hitler divided Poland in 1939, the Soviets took more territory than the Nazis did. At first, Polish Jews in the Soviet partition were naturally relieved and grateful that they would not be under Nazi oppression. By contrast, many Polish gentiles immediately viewed the Soviets as invading enemies. This is when the seam between Polish Jews and Polish gentiles was sundered. The Soviets conducted a policy of social engineering, sometimes offering poor Jews among others the positions that established Polish gentiles had once had before they were deported to the Gulags. Some Polish Jews betrayed their country and served the Soviets, as some Polish gentiles also did. There were unforgivable gentile reprisals against Jews punished because of guilt by association. When discussing this volatile subject, it is wrong to stereotype Polish Jews as pro-Soviet, but it is equally wrong to say questions about Polish-Jewish collaboration with the Soviets are necessarily antisemitic.While antisemitism exists in Poland, as it does in the UK, more and more Jews are discovering their Polish roots, while many Polish gentiles are discovering their Jewish roots too. Moreover, ever more research is showing us that Poland's pre-war gentile and Jewish communities were far more united than popular myth has led people to believe.Some 120,000 Polish Jews served in the Polish army at the start of the second world war, and defended their country against the joint Soviet-Nazi invasion of 1939. At the Katyn forest massacre of the Polish elite, the Soviets executed at least 600 Jews who were Polish army officers. Among them, the chief rabbi of the Polish army, Major Baruch Steinberg, was shot in the back of the head by a Soviet bullet. His body was slung in a mass grave next to the bodies of his Polish gentile countrymen. The motivations were different, but it is quite possible that as many Polish Jews were murdered at the massacre at Katyn as were murdered at the massacre at Jedwabne.Ignoring these facts prompts the slightly confusing thesis that the Jedwabne pogrom can be compared to what the Nazis did in the Holocaust. But Stalin's crimes cannot be compared to Hitler's. In case anyone has forgotten, Nazi Germany killed up to 3 million Polish citizens who were gentiles, 3 million Polish citizens who were Jews, and 3 million Jews from outside Poland. Some Polish gentiles saved Jewish lives; some Polish gentiles betrayed Jews. A far greater proportion of the Polish Jewish community was wiped out than the Polish gentile community.During the war, the Polish government in exile, which included Jews in its cabinet, passed a Polish intelligence report to their British allies. In it, the Poles informed the British about the Nazi German gas chambers, and requested an RAF air strike on the train lines. Churchill ignored the Polish request to save tens of thousands of Jews from death at Auschwitz. One wonders whether David Miliband will ever see fit to apologise for that on behalf of Britain, and whether it would be antisemitic of him to oppose the apology.One of the main charges against Kaminski, of course, is that he opposed Poland's 2001 apology for the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, in which a mob of around 40 Polish gentiles, in the presence of German police, murdered at least 300 Polish Jews. Kaminski said that asking for an apology would be as wrong as asking Polish Jews to apologise for their collaboration with the Soviets and their crimes against Polish gentiles.In my view, Kaminski was wrong to oppose that apology, which was intended as an act of reconciliation rather than a suggestion that the entire Polish nation had participated in the Holocaust. The point is, many Poles view Jedwabne a criminal act against fellow Polish citizens carried out by a small but vicious rabble who betrayed the core Polish value of anti-Nazism. Those 40 pogromists have always been viewed as traitors in Poland.Kaminski was wrong to oppose the apology, and his analogy was offensive. But according to the chief rabbi, Kaminski has put his teenage extremism behind him and he is not an antisemite.Polish people, including the million-strong Polish community in Britain, are deeply proud that Poland never produced a collaborationist regime, nor home-grown SS units, as happened elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe. Poland also resisted the savagery of the Soviet Union long before the Western allies did. So, for many Poles, there has never been a choice between fascism and communism \u2013 their country is characterised by its defiance against totalitarianism in all its forms.Today, even as Poles challenge the stereotype of Polish antisemitism, many have the courage to depict incidents of Polish wrongdoing against Jews with total clarity; and they show how strongly they object to cowardly anti-Polish slurs. Slowly but surely, Poles are defining themselves not by the suffering of the forefathers, but by their courage.Both Miliband and Kaminski are political opportunists, and their simplistic comments get in the way of genuine understanding. We should be very cautious of them both.", "tags": ["Michal Kaminski", "Poland", "Race issues", "Religion", "Judaism", "The far right", "UK news", "David Miliband", "Europe"], "title": "Poland: prejudice and pride | Kamil Tchorek"},{"date": "2009-11-09T22:35:34Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Sitting with her daughter and granddaughter in one of Warsaw's poshest coffee shops, Tereza Sawerska dwells on Poland's 20th century. In the 1940s as a child she trudged the country lanes with her father in search of a bit of bread, stealing carrots from the fields as the Nazi occupation and slaughter engulfed Poland. In the 60s, as a young mother, she tramped miles across Warsaw through teargas and barricades to fetch her daughter from kindergarten as the hated riot police dealt with rebel students. In the 80s, the retired tax administrator kept her head down to survive communist martial law.\"People left home and did not return. We didn't know what happened to them,\" the 76-year-old recalled. \"If you said something random, you were in big trouble. Get beaten or sent to jail.\"Marta, her 24-year-old granddaughter, sighs impatiently. She's heard it all before. \"I've never known a Poland like this. It's all just history. I'm just happy I don't need to live in a world like that.\"Then Tereza summons a long-suppressed memory from the early 50s. She had a boyfriend at school. He took part in a protest against the Russians, then imposing Stalinism in Warsaw. The teenage boy vanished. \"They were arrested very quickly, taken to a terrible prison. He wrote me letters. But they were censored, bits blacked out.\"Monika and Marta, Tereza's daughter and granddaughter, turn damp-eyed at a little bit of family history they have never heard before.One country and one family. Three women, three generations, three Polands, exemplifying the change and social mobility wrought by the revolution symbolised by the fall of the wall.In recent years, Marta has been in Bangkok and Berlin, Cairo and Canada, London and Paris. She has her own firm teaching foreigners Polish and helping them set up some of the 1.7m businesses that have transformed Poland into one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing places in Europe, the only EU state not to dip into recession this year.Her grandmother's life spans Poland's authoritarian inter-war republic, 45 years of Soviet communism, and 20 years of independent democracy. Between the two of them, Monika, a 48-year-old divorced bank worker, says the communist years now seem like a distant bad dream. You couldn't buy toilet paper. There were ration cards, queues for bad sausage. If a delivery of new shoes appeared in a shop window, you just bought a pair whether they were the right size or not.She laughs: \"Everything was grey and ugly. When I think about my youth, it was all about trying to make things a bit more pretty and colourful.\"It's incredible how people lived. They were bugging the phones, you couldn't talk to people, you never knew who was listening to you or would use something against you. But nowadays we've forgotten all that. It's like history, not part of your life any more.\"There is still, of course, plenty of greyness and ugliness in Poland. But 20 years after the fall of the wall, a revolution set in train in Warsaw 10 months earlier in 1989, Marta and her generation are too pushy, too busy, and too absorbed in their successful young lives and careers to sit around pondering politics or wondering how they got here.\"I know that Poland has changed incredibly. But for me it's been more to do with technology, mobile phones and the internet. Solidarity? I don't even know how the change in the political situation came.\"It came in February 1989, via the \"round table\", the historic compromise struck by dissidents and ruling communists that ushered in a bloodless revolution and set the template for the liberation of the rest of Soviet Europe, a unique and triumphant dismantling of dictatorship peacefully that climaxed at the wall on a cold and damp Thursday evening 20 years ago this week.The result two decades on, according to Adam Michnik, a giant of the revolution and one of the architects of the round table pact, is the most successful Poland in 300 years. The same might be said about the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, all in Nato, all in the European Union, and all in the throes of a huge catch-up exercise in modernisation driven by the transfers of tens of billions of euros from western to eastern Europe.\"You have a curious combination of external security and internal democratic order with a modest but successful economic system,\" says Andrzej Rychard, director of Warsaw's centre for social sciences. \"That hasn't happened that often in the history of this country.\"The change has been wrenching, its speed dizzying. Andrzej, who did not want his surname disclosed, is another whose life chances have been transformed. His father was a farmer from the rural east who came to Warsaw to work on the building sites. Andrzej is 41, a successful and wealthy tax consultant employing 20 people and advising \"high-value clients\". His 13-year-old son is privately educated and has all the latest gadgets and toys. Despite his success, Andrzej is less than satisfied.\"We're the lucky generation. From my perspective, things look good,\" he says. \"But there's not too much positive in what has happened. The whole history of privatisation has been an exercise in robbery. The old system was a nightmare, but this is not a democracy.\"The grumbling is echoed in opinion polls across the region. A survey of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians last week from Warsaw's Institute of Public Affairs found a solid majority, except among the eternally gloomy Hungarians, satisfied with the \"transformation\" of the past two decades, but a sizeable minority frustrated.While between 53% and 68% of Slovaks, Poles and Czechs believed life had improved, 65% of Hungarians thought things were no better or worse.\"It's surprising how many are not so enthusiastic about democracy,\" said Malgorzata Falkowska-Warska, a researcher at the institute.The social scientists also conducted a focus group of young people and were even more surprised to find a strong degree of cynicism about the drama of the past two decades. \"We were shocked that the young were very ambivalent about the advantages of freedom and democracy. We expected them to be much more idealistic,\" says Falkowska-Warska.One of the big benefits of the relatively new-found liberties, repeatedly mentioned, has been the freedom to travel. But the wanderlust, paradoxically, is also one of the most disturbing factors. The freedom to travel has prompted the most extraordinary exodus of modern times.Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, some 2.3 million young Poles have left, not all at the same time, some coming and going, but with the vast majority staying away. They are overwhelmingly from the depressed small towns and villages of eastern and southern Poland. As soon as they could, they voted with their feet. Most have not returned and are putting down roots in Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Germany and elsewhere. Analysts have been shocked by its scale.\"No one expected the emigration to be so huge because there's no need to escape from this country any more. They weren't persecuted. They left a free country,\" says Krystyna Iglicka, one of Poland's leading demographers.Statistics show that around one in five of the post-1989 generation in the active and productive age group of 21-35 have moved abroad. \"This might be a win-win situation for the UK and Ireland, filling the needs of the low-skilled labour market but it is not for us,\" Iglicka adds. \"We thought the migration would be circular, people coming back \u2026 I call this a lost generation.\"Andrzej, the wealthy tax adviser, is angry at the exodus. \"These young people feel that going to the UK is the biggest achievement they can imagine. But that's not success. Why don't they stay and do something in Poland?\"He is also anxious that being part of a united Europe is not necessarily good. \"The EU influences the style of life here, promoting certain values such as homosexuality that are not natural in Poland.\"Luke Pelletier shrugs at such prejudice. \"I love Warsaw, it's a very, very easy place to live,\" says the Parisian gay man who has lived in Poland for 14 years and is happy with the decent living he makes as a drag queen. Pelletier is in a civil partnership with Trevor, a black South African who grew up in London. Despite Poland's occasional reputation for homophobia, neither have any big complaints.Marta, the young businesswoman, says she would not dream of living anywhere but Warsaw. When the wall came down and the world opened up, Marta, her mother, Monika, and her grandmother, Tereza, went to Canada to visit relatives. It was their first trip to the west. \"It was amazing, so thrilling. They had everything in Canada we didn't have. If I could have stayed, I would have,\" says Monika.It is one fundamental measure of the changes that such notions now seem bizarre. She has been back and forth to Canada ever since and two months ago the 48-year-old remarried.Her new husband is a Canadian who is giving up his job to move to Warsaw. \"Now I wouldn't like to live in Canada,\" says Monika. \"Every time I go there, I don't even think about it.\"\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 10 November.

If I could have stayed, I would have,\" says Monika.It is one fundamental measure of the changes that such notions now seem bizarre. She has been back and forth to Canada ever since and two months ago the 48-year-old remarried.Her new husband is a Canadian who is giving up his job to move to Warsaw. \"Now I wouldn't like to live in Canada,\" says Monika. \"Every time I go there, I don't even think about it.\"\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 10 November.

The Tories were furious about the remarks and the party leader, David Cameron, demanded Miliband retract his comments, which he has refused to do.Speaking about Kaminski, Schudrich said: \"I certainly see him as a man that today, today, is against antisemitism\", adding that Law and Justice was not a \"fringe right party\".The row broke out when the New Statesman headlined a story \"Jewish leaders turn on Tories\" in which Schudrich was quoted in an email saying: \"It is clear that Mr Kaminski was a member of the NOP [National Revival of Poland], a group that is openly far-right and neo-Nazi.\"Schudrich later complained he had been misrepresented so the magazine changed the article's headline online but noted that the chief rabbi had not retracted his comments.Schudrich told BBC Radio 4's Today programme today that Kaminski was a \"complicated person\" who he acknowledged had been a member of the NOP as a teenager, but he now regarded Kaminski as a \"serious ally to the state of Israel\". Explaining why the politician now enjoyed his confidence, Schudrich said: \"He has become a strong ally of the state of Israel and on other occasions has condemned antisemitism.\"So what we have here is a complicated person, and we need to be able to understand him in a fuller context, not taking on things he said but taking a look at what he has said over the past 20 years.\"However, Schudrich refused to condone Kaminski's membership of the NOP, which he described as \"problematic\", and said he completely disagreed with Kaminski's opposition to a state apology for the massacre of hundreds of Jews in German-occupied Jedwabne in 1941.Miliband is still refusing to modify his analysis.

Later, I learned that he was an Auschwitz survivor named Antoni Kolodziejczyk; the number 138048 was tattooed on his left forearm. When he recovered, he spoke to me of wartime memories that he had rarely shared before, even with his own family. That experience meant a lot to me, and so did the words of the chief rabbi of Poland last week.Who could Rabbi Michael Schudrich, a smart and feisty New Yorker, have been talking about when he protested against the \"grotesque distortion\" of his words for political gain in the UK? Why did he feel the need to intervene and say it is wrong to play on a false stereotype of Poles as antisemites? Did he have in mind certain Labour politicians, and journalists at the New Statesman and the Guardian?Of course, he did. The chief rabbi identified an element of the British left that has propagated a smear campaign accusing a Tory ally, Polish MEP Michal Kaminski, of antisemitism. By association, it has been implied that Kaminski's Law and Justice party and its voters are extremist, far-right or even neo-Nazi. None of these labels fit: that party can only be described as staunchly conservative, or nationalist conservative at worst.I have never voted for the Tories and Michal Kaminski is not a friend of mine. His party is far too suspicious of market economics and is also far too Eurosceptic, for my liking. I disagree with its views on lifestyle and social policy. So I have no reason to exonerate Kaminski whatsoever. But I do know this charge of antisemitism against Kaminski came after preparation in the UK for a negative PR operation against Law and Justice. On my desk is a copy of the 15-page plan of attack against the Tories' Polish allies that circulated Whitehall this summer. I've been asked not to publish it, and source anonymity should be protected. But I am convinced its content is as vacuous as the \"dodgy dossier\", the cooked-up intelligence that took us into Iraq.Some on the British left have made one-sided assertions about the history of eastern Europe, and have cast Polish or Tory attempts to reveal the whole truth with all its nuances as hair-splitting about the Holocaust. And journalists have amplified rather than scrutinised the demagoguery of David Miliband.All this manipulation, I have been told, is justifiable because it is a way of attacking the Tories. I beg to differ. There is no excuse for demonising an entire ethnic group, in this case the Poles, because it might save a few Labour MPs their jobs at the next election.Some commentators have said this has been a Labour ploy to win over the British Jewish vote, by stirring up fear of Polish antisemitism. But people who really care about gentile-Jewish relations know there is a tremendous Jewish revival underway in Poland, and the country is clearly identifying and denouncing crimes against Jews.Poland is also investigating alleged Jewish collaboration with the Soviets, a notion many British people seem to assume must be an antisemitic conspiracy theory on a par with the blood libel. Certainly, the stereotype of Jewish Bolshevism has been used in an attempt to justify race hate. But if dealt with fairly and accurately, this subject needn't be any more taboo than the culpability of Polish gentiles in the Soviet-backed regime and at the pogroms of Jedwabne, Kielce and others.When Stalin and Hitler divided Poland in 1939, the Soviets took more territory than the Nazis did. At first, Polish Jews in the Soviet partition were naturally relieved and grateful that they would not be under Nazi oppression. By contrast, many Polish gentiles immediately viewed the Soviets as invading enemies. This is when the seam between Polish Jews and Polish gentiles was sundered. The Soviets conducted a policy of social engineering, sometimes offering poor Jews among others the positions that established Polish gentiles had once had before they were deported to the Gulags. Some Polish Jews betrayed their country and served the Soviets, as some Polish gentiles also did. There were unforgivable gentile reprisals against Jews punished because of guilt by association. When discussing this volatile subject, it is wrong to stereotype Polish Jews as pro-Soviet, but it is equally wrong to say questions about Polish-Jewish collaboration with the Soviets are necessarily antisemitic.While antisemitism exists in Poland, as it does in the UK, more and more Jews are discovering their Polish roots, while many Polish gentiles are discovering their Jewish roots too. Moreover, ever more research is showing us that Poland's pre-war gentile and Jewish communities were far more united than popular myth has led people to believe.Some 120,000 Polish Jews served in the Polish army at the start of the second world war, and defended their country against the joint Soviet-Nazi invasion of 1939. At the Katyn forest massacre of the Polish elite, the Soviets executed at least 600 Jews who were Polish army officers. Among them, the chief rabbi of the Polish army, Major Baruch Steinberg, was shot in the back of the head by a Soviet bullet. His body was slung in a mass grave next to the bodies of his Polish gentile countrymen. The motivations were different, but it is quite possible that as many Polish Jews were murdered at the massacre at Katyn as were murdered at the massacre at Jedwabne.Ignoring these facts prompts the slightly confusing thesis that the Jedwabne pogrom can be compared to what the Nazis did in the Holocaust. But Stalin's crimes cannot be compared to Hitler's. In case anyone has forgotten, Nazi Germany killed up to 3 million Polish citizens who were gentiles, 3 million Polish citizens who were Jews, and 3 million Jews from outside Poland. Some Polish gentiles saved Jewish lives; some Polish gentiles betrayed Jews. A far greater proportion of the Polish Jewish community was wiped out than the Polish gentile community.During the war, the Polish government in exile, which included Jews in its cabinet, passed a Polish intelligence report to their British allies. In it, the Poles informed the British about the Nazi German gas chambers, and requested an RAF air strike on the train lines. Churchill ignored the Polish request to save tens of thousands of Jews from death at Auschwitz. One wonders whether David Miliband will ever see fit to apologise for that on behalf of Britain, and whether it would be antisemitic of him to oppose the apology.One of the main charges against Kaminski, of course, is that he opposed Poland's 2001 apology for the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, in which a mob of around 40 Polish gentiles, in the presence of German police, murdered at least 300 Polish Jews. Kaminski said that asking for an apology would be as wrong as asking Polish Jews to apologise for their collaboration with the Soviets and their crimes against Polish gentiles.In my view, Kaminski was wrong to oppose that apology, which was intended as an act of reconciliation rather than a suggestion that the entire Polish nation had participated in the Holocaust. The point is, many Poles view Jedwabne a criminal act against fellow Polish citizens carried out by a small but vicious rabble who betrayed the core Polish value of anti-Nazism. Those 40 pogromists have always been viewed as traitors in Poland.Kaminski was wrong to oppose the apology, and his analogy was offensive. But according to the chief rabbi, Kaminski has put his teenage extremism behind him and he is not an antisemite.Polish people, including the million-strong Polish community in Britain, are deeply proud that Poland never produced a collaborationist regime, nor home-grown SS units, as happened elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe. Poland also resisted the savagery of the Soviet Union long before the Western allies did. So, for many Poles, there has never been a choice between fascism and communism \u2013 their country is characterised by its defiance against totalitarianism in all its forms.Today, even as Poles challenge the stereotype of Polish antisemitism, many have the courage to depict incidents of Polish wrongdoing against Jews with total clarity; and they show how strongly they object to cowardly anti-Polish slurs. Slowly but surely, Poles are defining themselves not by the suffering of the forefathers, but by their courage.Both Miliband and Kaminski are political opportunists, and their simplistic comments get in the way of genuine understanding. We should be very cautious of them both.", "tags": ["Michal Kaminski", "Poland", "Race issues", "Religion", "Judaism", "The far right", "UK news", "David Miliband", "Europe"], "title": "Poland: prejudice and pride | Kamil Tchorek"},{"date": "2009-11-09T22:35:34Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Sitting with her daughter and granddaughter in one of Warsaw's poshest coffee shops, Tereza Sawerska dwells on Poland's 20th century. In the 1940s as a child she trudged the country lanes with her father in search of a bit of bread, stealing carrots from the fields as the Nazi occupation and slaughter engulfed Poland. In the 60s, as a young mother, she tramped miles across Warsaw through teargas and barricades to fetch her daughter from kindergarten as the hated riot police dealt with rebel students. In the 80s, the retired tax administrator kept her head down to survive communist martial law.\"People left home and did not return. We didn't know what happened to them,\" the 76-year-old recalled. \"If you said something random, you were in big trouble. Get beaten or sent to jail.\"Marta, her 24-year-old granddaughter, sighs impatiently. She's heard it all before. \"I've never known a Poland like this. It's all just history. I'm just happy I don't need to live in a world like that.\"Then Tereza summons a long-suppressed memory from the early 50s. She had a boyfriend at school. He took part in a protest against the Russians, then imposing Stalinism in Warsaw. The teenage boy vanished. \"They were arrested very quickly, taken to a terrible prison. He wrote me letters. But they were censored, bits blacked out.\"Monika and Marta, Tereza's daughter and granddaughter, turn damp-eyed at a little bit of family history they have never heard before.One country and one family. Three women, three generations, three Polands, exemplifying the change and social mobility wrought by the revolution symbolised by the fall of the wall.In recent years, Marta has been in Bangkok and Berlin, Cairo and Canada, London and Paris. She has her own firm teaching foreigners Polish and helping them set up some of the 1.7m businesses that have transformed Poland into one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing places in Europe, the only EU state not to dip into recession this year.Her grandmother's life spans Poland's authoritarian inter-war republic, 45 years of Soviet communism, and 20 years of independent democracy. Between the two of them, Monika, a 48-year-old divorced bank worker, says the communist years now seem like a distant bad dream. You couldn't buy toilet paper. There were ration cards, queues for bad sausage. If a delivery of new shoes appeared in a shop window, you just bought a pair whether they were the right size or not.She laughs: \"Everything was grey and ugly. When I think about my youth, it was all about trying to make things a bit more pretty and colourful.\"It's incredible how people lived. They were bugging the phones, you couldn't talk to people, you never knew who was listening to you or would use something against you. But nowadays we've forgotten all that. It's like history, not part of your life any more.\"There is still, of course, plenty of greyness and ugliness in Poland. But 20 years after the fall of the wall, a revolution set in train in Warsaw 10 months earlier in 1989, Marta and her generation are too pushy, too busy, and too absorbed in their successful young lives and careers to sit around pondering politics or wondering how they got here.\"I know that Poland has changed incredibly. But for me it's been more to do with technology, mobile phones and the internet. Solidarity? I don't even know how the change in the political situation came.\"It came in February 1989, via the \"round table\", the historic compromise struck by dissidents and ruling communists that ushered in a bloodless revolution and set the template for the liberation of the rest of Soviet Europe, a unique and triumphant dismantling of dictatorship peacefully that climaxed at the wall on a cold and damp Thursday evening 20 years ago this week.The result two decades on, according to Adam Michnik, a giant of the revolution and one of the architects of the round table pact, is the most successful Poland in 300 years. The same might be said about the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, all in Nato, all in the European Union, and all in the throes of a huge catch-up exercise in modernisation driven by the transfers of tens of billions of euros from western to eastern Europe.\"You have a curious combination of external security and internal democratic order with a modest but successful economic system,\" says Andrzej Rychard, director of Warsaw's centre for social sciences. \"That hasn't happened that often in the history of this country.\"The change has been wrenching, its speed dizzying. Andrzej, who did not want his surname disclosed, is another whose life chances have been transformed. His father was a farmer from the rural east who came to Warsaw to work on the building sites. Andrzej is 41, a successful and wealthy tax consultant employing 20 people and advising \"high-value clients\". His 13-year-old son is privately educated and has all the latest gadgets and toys. Despite his success, Andrzej is less than satisfied.\"We're the lucky generation. From my perspective, things look good,\" he says. \"But there's not too much positive in what has happened. The whole history of privatisation has been an exercise in robbery. The old system was a nightmare, but this is not a democracy.\"The grumbling is echoed in opinion polls across the region. A survey of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians last week from Warsaw's Institute of Public Affairs found a solid majority, except among the eternally gloomy Hungarians, satisfied with the \"transformation\" of the past two decades, but a sizeable minority frustrated.While between 53% and 68% of Slovaks, Poles and Czechs believed life had improved, 65% of Hungarians thought things were no better or worse.\"It's surprising how many are not so enthusiastic about democracy,\" said Malgorzata Falkowska-Warska, a researcher at the institute.The social scientists also conducted a focus group of young people and were even more surprised to find a strong degree of cynicism about the drama of the past two decades. \"We were shocked that the young were very ambivalent about the advantages of freedom and democracy. We expected them to be much more idealistic,\" says Falkowska-Warska.One of the big benefits of the relatively new-found liberties, repeatedly mentioned, has been the freedom to travel. But the wanderlust, paradoxically, is also one of the most disturbing factors. The freedom to travel has prompted the most extraordinary exodus of modern times.Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, some 2.3 million young Poles have left, not all at the same time, some coming and going, but with the vast majority staying away. They are overwhelmingly from the depressed small towns and villages of eastern and southern Poland. As soon as they could, they voted with their feet. Most have not returned and are putting down roots in Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Germany and elsewhere. Analysts have been shocked by its scale.\"No one expected the emigration to be so huge because there's no need to escape from this country any more. They weren't persecuted. They left a free country,\" says Krystyna Iglicka, one of Poland's leading demographers.Statistics show that around one in five of the post-1989 generation in the active and productive age group of 21-35 have moved abroad. \"This might be a win-win situation for the UK and Ireland, filling the needs of the low-skilled labour market but it is not for us,\" Iglicka adds. \"We thought the migration would be circular, people coming back \u2026 I call this a lost generation.\"Andrzej, the wealthy tax adviser, is angry at the exodus. \"These young people feel that going to the UK is the biggest achievement they can imagine. But that's not success. Why don't they stay and do something in Poland?\"He is also anxious that being part of a united Europe is not necessarily good. \"The EU influences the style of life here, promoting certain values such as homosexuality that are not natural in Poland.\"Luke Pelletier shrugs at such prejudice. \"I love Warsaw, it's a very, very easy place to live,\" says the Parisian gay man who has lived in Poland for 14 years and is happy with the decent living he makes as a drag queen. Pelletier is in a civil partnership with Trevor, a black South African who grew up in London. Despite Poland's occasional reputation for homophobia, neither have any big complaints.Marta, the young businesswoman, says she would not dream of living anywhere but Warsaw. When the wall came down and the world opened up, Marta, her mother, Monika, and her grandmother, Tereza, went to Canada to visit relatives. It was their first trip to the west. \"It was amazing, so thrilling. They had everything in Canada we didn't have. If I could have stayed, I would have,\" says Monika.It is one fundamental measure of the changes that such notions now seem bizarre.

In the 1940s as a child she trudged the country lanes with her father in search of a bit of bread, stealing carrots from the fields as the Nazi occupation and slaughter engulfed Poland. In the 60s, as a young mother, she tramped miles across Warsaw through teargas and barricades to fetch her daughter from kindergarten as the hated riot police dealt with rebel students. In the 80s, the retired tax administrator kept her head down to survive communist martial law.\"People left home and did not return. We didn't know what happened to them,\" the 76-year-old recalled. \"If you said something random, you were in big trouble.

I'm just happy I don't need to live in a world like that.\"Then Tereza summons a long-suppressed memory from the early 50s. She had a boyfriend at school. He took part in a protest against the Russians, then imposing Stalinism in Warsaw. The teenage boy vanished. \"They were arrested very quickly, taken to a terrible prison. He wrote me letters. But they were censored, bits blacked out.\"Monika and Marta, Tereza's daughter and granddaughter, turn damp-eyed at a little bit of family history they have never heard before.One country and one family. Three women, three generations, three Polands, exemplifying the change and social mobility wrought by the revolution symbolised by the fall of the wall.In recent years, Marta has been in Bangkok and Berlin, Cairo and Canada, London and Paris. She has her own firm teaching foreigners Polish and helping them set up some of the 1.7m businesses that have transformed Poland into one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing places in Europe, the only EU state not to dip into recession this year.Her grandmother's life spans Poland's authoritarian inter-war republic, 45 years of Soviet communism, and 20 years of independent democracy. Between the two of them, Monika, a 48-year-old divorced bank worker, says the communist years now seem like a distant bad dream. You couldn't buy toilet paper. There were ration cards, queues for bad sausage. If a delivery of new shoes appeared in a shop window, you just bought a pair whether they were the right size or not.She laughs: \"Everything was grey and ugly. When I think about my youth, it was all about trying to make things a bit more pretty and colourful.\"It's incredible how people lived. They were bugging the phones, you couldn't talk to people, you never knew who was listening to you or would use something against you. But nowadays we've forgotten all that. It's like history, not part of your life any more.\"There is still, of course, plenty of greyness and ugliness in Poland. But 20 years after the fall of the wall, a revolution set in train in Warsaw 10 months earlier in 1989, Marta and her generation are too pushy, too busy, and too absorbed in their successful young lives and careers to sit around pondering politics or wondering how they got here.\"I know that Poland has changed incredibly. But for me it's been more to do with technology, mobile phones and the internet. Solidarity? I don't even know how the change in the political situation came.\"It came in February 1989, via the \"round table\", the historic compromise struck by dissidents and ruling communists that ushered in a bloodless revolution and set the template for the liberation of the rest of Soviet Europe, a unique and triumphant dismantling of dictatorship peacefully that climaxed at the wall on a cold and damp Thursday evening 20 years ago this week.The result two decades on, according to Adam Michnik, a giant of the revolution and one of the architects of the round table pact, is the most successful Poland in 300 years. The same might be said about the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, all in Nato, all in the European Union, and all in the throes of a huge catch-up exercise in modernisation driven by the transfers of tens of billions of euros from western to eastern Europe.\"You have a curious combination of external security and internal democratic order with a modest but successful economic system,\" says Andrzej Rychard, director of Warsaw's centre for social sciences. \"That hasn't happened that often in the history of this country.\"The change has been wrenching, its speed dizzying. Andrzej, who did not want his surname disclosed, is another whose life chances have been transformed. His father was a farmer from the rural east who came to Warsaw to work on the building sites. Andrzej is 41, a successful and wealthy tax consultant employing 20 people and advising \"high-value clients\". His 13-year-old son is privately educated and has all the latest gadgets and toys. Despite his success, Andrzej is less than satisfied.\"We're the lucky generation. From my perspective, things look good,\" he says. \"But there's not too much positive in what has happened. The whole history of privatisation has been an exercise in robbery. The old system was a nightmare, but this is not a democracy.\"The grumbling is echoed in opinion polls across the region. A survey of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians last week from Warsaw's Institute of Public Affairs found a solid majority, except among the eternally gloomy Hungarians, satisfied with the \"transformation\" of the past two decades, but a sizeable minority frustrated.While between 53% and 68% of Slovaks, Poles and Czechs believed life had improved, 65% of Hungarians thought things were no better or worse.\"It's surprising how many are not so enthusiastic about democracy,\" said Malgorzata Falkowska-Warska, a researcher at the institute.The social scientists also conducted a focus group of young people and were even more surprised to find a strong degree of cynicism about the drama of the past two decades. \"We were shocked that the young were very ambivalent about the advantages of freedom and democracy. We expected them to be much more idealistic,\" says Falkowska-Warska.One of the big benefits of the relatively new-found liberties, repeatedly mentioned, has been the freedom to travel. But the wanderlust, paradoxically, is also one of the most disturbing factors. The freedom to travel has prompted the most extraordinary exodus of modern times.Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, some 2.3 million young Poles have left, not all at the same time, some coming and going, but with the vast majority staying away. They are overwhelmingly from the depressed small towns and villages of eastern and southern Poland. As soon as they could, they voted with their feet. Most have not returned and are putting down roots in Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Germany and elsewhere. Analysts have been shocked by its scale.\"No one expected the emigration to be so huge because there's no need to escape from this country any more. They weren't persecuted. They left a free country,\" says Krystyna Iglicka, one of Poland's leading demographers.Statistics show that around one in five of the post-1989 generation in the active and productive age group of 21-35 have moved abroad. \"This might be a win-win situation for the UK and Ireland, filling the needs of the low-skilled labour market but it is not for us,\" Iglicka adds. \"We thought the migration would be circular, people coming back \u2026 I call this a lost generation.\"Andrzej, the wealthy tax adviser, is angry at the exodus. \"These young people feel that going to the UK is the biggest achievement they can imagine. But that's not success. Why don't they stay and do something in Poland?\"He is also anxious that being part of a united Europe is not necessarily good. \"The EU influences the style of life here, promoting certain values such as homosexuality that are not natural in Poland.\"Luke Pelletier shrugs at such prejudice. \"I love Warsaw, it's a very, very easy place to live,\" says the Parisian gay man who has lived in Poland for 14 years and is happy with the decent living he makes as a drag queen. Pelletier is in a civil partnership with Trevor, a black South African who grew up in London. Despite Poland's occasional reputation for homophobia, neither have any big complaints.Marta, the young businesswoman, says she would not dream of living anywhere but Warsaw. When the wall came down and the world opened up, Marta, her mother, Monika, and her grandmother, Tereza, went to Canada to visit relatives. It was their first trip to the west. \"It was amazing, so thrilling. They had everything in Canada we didn't have. If I could have stayed, I would have,\" says Monika.It is one fundamental measure of the changes that such notions now seem bizarre. She has been back and forth to Canada ever since and two months ago the 48-year-old remarried.Her new husband is a Canadian who is giving up his job to move to Warsaw. \"Now I wouldn't like to live in Canada,\" says Monika. \"Every time I go there, I don't even think about it.\"\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 10 November.

The Tories were furious about the remarks and the party leader, David Cameron, demanded Miliband retract his comments, which he has refused to do.Speaking about Kaminski, Schudrich said: \"I certainly see him as a man that today, today, is against antisemitism\", adding that Law and Justice was not a \"fringe right party\".The row broke out when the New Statesman headlined a story \"Jewish leaders turn on Tories\" in which Schudrich was quoted in an email saying: \"It is clear that Mr Kaminski was a member of the NOP [National Revival of Poland], a group that is openly far-right and neo-Nazi.\"Schudrich later complained he had been misrepresented so the magazine changed the article's headline online but noted that the chief rabbi had not retracted his comments.Schudrich told BBC Radio 4's Today programme today that Kaminski was a \"complicated person\" who he acknowledged had been a member of the NOP as a teenager, but he now regarded Kaminski as a \"serious ally to the state of Israel\". Explaining why the politician now enjoyed his confidence, Schudrich said: \"He has become a strong ally of the state of Israel and on other occasions has condemned antisemitism.\"So what we have here is a complicated person, and we need to be able to understand him in a fuller context, not taking on things he said but taking a look at what he has said over the past 20 years.\"However, Schudrich refused to condone Kaminski's membership of the NOP, which he described as \"problematic\", and said he completely disagreed with Kaminski's opposition to a state apology for the massacre of hundreds of Jews in German-occupied Jedwabne in 1941.Miliband is still refusing to modify his analysis. Responding to Schudrich's decision to contest the article from which he was quoting when he attacked Kaminski at the party conference, he said Schudrich was only quibbling with the headline of the New

"poland", "content": " A state of emergency was announced in Poland today involving tightened border controls and random police checks as a nationwide hunt was launched for the infamous bronze sign to the former German Nazi death camp Auschwitz after it was stolen.The discovery this morning that the sign had been wrenched from the top of the entrance gate posts prompted international reactions of outrage from Washington to London and urgent calls for its return.The sign, cast by camp prisoners, which offered the cynical welcome to new inmates \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" (work sets you free) and stands as a potent symbol of the suffering millions endured at the camp, is believed to have been removed by a gang in what authorities called a meticulously planned robbery.Katarzyna Padlo, spokeswoman for police in O\u015bwi\u0119cim, (the Polish name for Auschwitz) in south-eastern Poland, said: \"We believe the sign was stolen between 3.30am and 5am when museum guards first noticed it was missing and called the police.\"Scores of Polish police were put on the case to investigate the whereabouts of the sign.Border patrol police were told to be on the lookout for the 5m-long heavy cast-iron plaque that had spanned the entrance gate, over fears that there might have been plans to take it out of the country.The news of the sign's disappearance triggered impassioned calls for its return.Shimon Peres, president of Israel, discussed the theft with Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, in Copenhagen today. \"The state of Israel and the Jewish people in their entirety ask that you take the necessary steps to catch the criminals and return the sign to its place,\" he told Tusk. \"The sign is of profound historical significance both for the Jewish people and the entire world.\"Avner Shalev, president of Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel, said: \"This is an attack on the remembrance of the Holocaust,\" referring to those responsible as \"certain elements who want to take us back to the dark days\".Jaroslaw Mensfeld, a historian and spokesman for Auschwitz, called the incident \"shameful\" and said it amounted to the \"desecration of a place in which more than a million people were murdered\".Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust in the UK, said she was disgusted by the robbery, which she called an \"appalling act of vandalism [that showed] gross disregard to all Holocaust survivors and the families of those who lost loved ones there.\"The Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau stands as a universal symbol of the Holocaust and for millions of victims the sign represented the cynical cruelty of Nazi rule.\"Poland's parliament said the recovery of the sign was being treated as a matter of urgency. \"This is regretful and embarrassing,\" said Bogdan Borusewicz, chairman of the second parliamentary chamber of the Polish senate. \"I just hope they don't destroy the plaque.\"Andrzej Przewoznik, minister with responsibility for the protection of historical monuments, said: \"This is an act of vandalism that knows no equal.\"There was widespread speculation over who might have been behind the robbery, with investigators looking into suggestions that it could have been anyone from scrap metal dealers to Holocaust deniers, from rightwing collectors of Nazi memorabilia to pre-Christmas pranksters.Tonight they were still no closer to solving the mystery.Police believe a gang was responsible for the robbery because it had apparently been carefully carried out with the perpetrators avoiding attracting the attention of nightwatchmen or being caught on CCTV cameras.They confirmed that the sign had been unscrewed on one side and pulled off with some force on the other. Sniffer dogs brought to the scene have led police to believe the sign was removed from the camp compound through a hole in the fence before being loaded into a van. After that any trail of the thieves has been lost.Authorities in the region announced a state of emergency as the hunt for the sign was launched and a nationwide appeal went out urging anyone with any information to contact police. A 5,000 zloty (\u00a31,000) reward was being offered to anyone with information that would lead to the criminals or the whereabouts of the sign. Police were today replaying hours of video footage from the CCTV cameras at the Auschwitz site, which is now a museum.The Polish ambassador to Israel, Agnieszka Magdziak-Miszewska, said that it was believed the robbery had been \"meticulously planned, because they were not caught on security cameras\". She added: \"Finding the metal sign has become a national priority.\"Approximately 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, died in Auschwitz which was built in Nazi-occupied Poland. About 500 acres of the former death camp was turned into a museum after the end of the war.The Arbeit Macht Frei sign was erected by prisoners with metalwork skills on Nazi orders in June 1940, and was a cynical take on the title of an 1873 work by the lexicographer, linguist and novelist Lorenz Diefenbach in which gamblers and fraudsters discover the path to virtue through hard work.Museum officials have placed a replica of the sign above the gates which was used several years ago while the original was being repaired.\u2022 This article was amended on Monday 21 December 2009 to correct the spelling of O\u015bwi\u0119cim.

Later, I learned that he was an Auschwitz survivor named Antoni Kolodziejczyk; the number 138048 was tattooed on his left forearm. When he recovered, he spoke to me of wartime memories that he had rarely shared before, even with his own family. That experience meant a lot to me, and so did the words of the chief rabbi of Poland last week.Who could Rabbi Michael Schudrich, a smart and feisty New Yorker, have been talking about when he protested against the \"grotesque distortion\" of his words for political gain in the UK? Why did he feel the need to intervene and say it is wrong to play on a false stereotype of Poles as antisemites? Did he have in mind certain Labour politicians, and journalists at the New Statesman and the Guardian?Of course, he did. The chief rabbi identified an element of the British left that has propagated a smear campaign accusing a Tory ally, Polish MEP Michal Kaminski, of antisemitism. By association, it has been implied that Kaminski's Law and Justice party and its voters are extremist, far-right or even neo-Nazi. None of these labels fit: that party can only be described as staunchly conservative, or nationalist conservative at worst.I have never voted for the Tories and Michal Kaminski is not a friend of mine. His party is far too suspicious of market economics and is also far too Eurosceptic, for my liking. I disagree with its views on lifestyle and social policy. So I have no reason to exonerate Kaminski whatsoever. But I do know this charge of antisemitism against Kaminski came after preparation in the UK for a negative PR operation against Law and Justice. On my desk is a copy of the 15-page plan of attack against the Tories' Polish allies that circulated Whitehall this summer. I've been asked not to publish it, and source anonymity should be protected. But I am convinced its content is as vacuous as the \"dodgy dossier\", the cooked-up intelligence that took us into Iraq.Some on the British left have made one-sided assertions about the history of eastern Europe, and have cast Polish or Tory attempts to reveal the whole truth with all its nuances as hair-splitting about the Holocaust. And journalists have amplified rather than scrutinised the demagoguery of David Miliband.All this manipulation, I have been told, is justifiable because it is a way of attacking the Tories. I beg to differ. There is no excuse for demonising an entire ethnic group, in this case the Poles, because it might save a few Labour MPs their jobs at the next election.Some commentators have said this has been a Labour ploy to win over the British Jewish vote, by stirring up fear of Polish antisemitism. But people who really care about gentile-Jewish relations know there is a tremendous Jewish revival underway in Poland, and the country is clearly identifying and denouncing crimes against Jews.Poland is also investigating alleged Jewish collaboration with the Soviets, a notion many British people seem to assume must be an antisemitic conspiracy theory on a par with the blood libel. Certainly, the stereotype of Jewish Bolshevism has been used in an attempt to justify race hate. But if dealt with fairly and accurately, this subject needn't be any more taboo than the culpability of Polish gentiles in the Soviet-backed regime and at the pogroms of Jedwabne, Kielce and others.When Stalin and Hitler divided Poland in 1939, the Soviets took more territory than the Nazis did. At first, Polish Jews in the Soviet partition were naturally relieved and grateful that they would not be under Nazi oppression. By contrast, many Polish gentiles immediately viewed the Soviets as invading enemies. This is when the seam between Polish Jews and Polish gentiles was sundered. The Soviets conducted a policy of social engineering, sometimes offering poor Jews among others the positions that established Polish gentiles had once had before they were deported to the Gulags. Some Polish Jews betrayed their country and served the Soviets, as some Polish gentiles also did. There were unforgivable gentile reprisals against Jews punished because of guilt by association. When discussing this volatile subject, it is wrong to stereotype Polish Jews as pro-Soviet, but it is equally wrong to say questions about Polish-Jewish collaboration with the Soviets are necessarily antisemitic.While antisemitism exists in Poland, as it does in the UK, more and more Jews are discovering their Polish roots, while many Polish gentiles are discovering their Jewish roots too. Moreover, ever more research is showing us that Poland's pre-war gentile and Jewish communities were far more united than popular myth has led people to believe.Some 120,000 Polish Jews served in the Polish army at the start of the second world war, and defended their country against the joint Soviet-Nazi invasion of 1939. At the Katyn forest massacre of the Polish elite, the Soviets executed at least 600 Jews who were Polish army officers. Among them, the chief rabbi of the Polish army, Major Baruch Steinberg, was shot in the back of the head by a Soviet bullet. His body was slung in a mass grave next to the bodies of his Polish gentile countrymen. The motivations were different, but it is quite possible that as many Polish Jews were murdered at the massacre at Katyn as were murdered at the massacre at Jedwabne.Ignoring these facts prompts the slightly confusing thesis that the Jedwabne pogrom can be compared to what the Nazis did in the Holocaust. But Stalin's crimes cannot be compared to Hitler's. In case anyone has forgotten, Nazi Germany killed up to 3 million Polish citizens who were gentiles, 3 million Polish citizens who were Jews, and 3 million Jews from outside Poland. Some Polish gentiles saved Jewish lives; some Polish gentiles betrayed Jews. A far greater proportion of the Polish Jewish community was wiped out than the Polish gentile community.During the war, the Polish government in exile, which included Jews in its cabinet, passed a Polish intelligence report to their British allies. In it, the Poles informed the British about the Nazi German gas chambers, and requested an RAF air strike on the train lines. Churchill ignored the Polish request to save tens of thousands of Jews from death at Auschwitz. One wonders whether David Miliband will ever see fit to apologise for that on behalf of Britain, and whether it would be antisemitic of him to oppose the apology.One of the main charges against Kaminski, of course, is that he opposed Poland's 2001 apology for the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, in which a mob of around 40 Polish gentiles, in the presence of German police, murdered at least 300 Polish Jews. Kaminski said that asking for an apology would be as wrong as asking Polish Jews to apologise for their collaboration with the Soviets and their crimes against Polish gentiles.In my view, Kaminski was wrong to oppose that apology, which was intended as an act of reconciliation rather than a suggestion that the entire Polish nation had participated in the Holocaust. The point is, many Poles view Jedwabne a criminal act against fellow Polish citizens carried out by a small but vicious rabble who betrayed the core Polish value of anti-Nazism. Those 40 pogromists have always been viewed as traitors in Poland.Kaminski was wrong to oppose the apology, and his analogy was offensive. But according to the chief rabbi, Kaminski has put his teenage extremism behind him and he is not an antisemite.Polish people, including the million-strong Polish community in Britain, are deeply proud that Poland never produced a collaborationist regime, nor home-grown SS units, as happened elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe. Poland also resisted the savagery of the Soviet Union long before the Western allies did. So, for many Poles, there has never been a choice between fascism and communism \u2013 their country is characterised by its defiance against totalitarianism in all its forms.Today, even as Poles challenge the stereotype of Polish antisemitism, many have the courage to depict incidents of Polish wrongdoing against Jews with total clarity; and they show how strongly they object to cowardly anti-Polish slurs.

We expected them to be much more idealistic,\" says Falkowska-Warska.One of the big benefits of the relatively new-found liberties, repeatedly mentioned, has been the freedom to travel. But the wanderlust, paradoxically, is also one of the most disturbing factors. The freedom to travel has prompted the most extraordinary exodus of modern times.Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, some 2.3 million young Poles have left, not all at the same time, some coming and going, but with the vast majority staying away. They are overwhelmingly from the depressed small towns and villages of eastern and southern Poland. As soon as they could, they voted with their feet. Most have not returned and are putting down roots in Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Germany and elsewhere. Analysts have been shocked by its scale.\"No one expected the emigration to be so huge because there's no need to escape from this country any more. They weren't persecuted. They left a free country,\" says Krystyna Iglicka, one of Poland's leading demographers.Statistics show that around one in five of the post-1989 generation in the active and productive age group of 21-35 have moved abroad. \"This might be a win-win situation for the UK and Ireland, filling the needs of the low-skilled labour market but it is not for us,\" Iglicka adds. \"We thought the migration would be circular, people coming back \u2026 I call this a lost generation.\"Andrzej, the wealthy tax adviser, is angry at the exodus. \"These young people feel that going to the UK is the biggest achievement they can imagine.

Pelletier is in a civil partnership with Trevor, a black South African who grew up in London. Despite Poland's occasional reputation for homophobia, neither have any big complaints.Marta, the young businesswoman, says she would not dream of living anywhere but Warsaw. When the wall came down and the world opened up, Marta, her mother, Monika, and her grandmother, Tereza, went to Canada to visit relatives. It was their first trip to the west. \"It was amazing, so thrilling. They had everything in Canada we didn't have. If I could have stayed, I would have,\" says Monika.It is one fundamental measure of the changes that such notions now seem bizarre. She has been back and forth to Canada ever since and two months ago the 48-year-old remarried.Her new husband is a Canadian who is giving up his job to move to Warsaw. \"Now I wouldn't like to live in Canada,\" says Monika. \"Every time I go there, I don't even think about it.\"\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 10 November.

The Tories were furious about the remarks and the party leader, David Cameron, demanded Miliband retract his comments, which he has refused to do.Speaking about Kaminski, Schudrich said: \"I certainly see him as a man that today, today, is against antisemitism\", adding that Law and Justice was not a \"fringe right party\".The row broke out when the New Statesman headlined a story \"Jewish leaders turn on Tories\" in which Schudrich was quoted in an email saying: \"It is clear that Mr Kaminski was a member of the NOP [National Revival of Poland], a group that is openly far-right and neo-Nazi.\"Schudrich later complained he had been misrepresented so the magazine changed the article's headline online but noted that the chief rabbi had not retracted his comments.Schudrich told BBC Radio 4's Today programme today that Kaminski was a \"complicated person\" who he acknowledged had been a member of the NOP as a teenager, but he now regarded Kaminski as a \"serious ally to the state of Israel\". Explaining why the politician now enjoyed his confidence, Schudrich said: \"He has become a strong ally of the state of Israel and on other occasions has condemned antisemitism.\"So what we have here is a complicated person, and we need to be able to understand him in a fuller context, not taking on things he said but taking a look at what he has said over the past 20 years.\"However, Schudrich refused to condone Kaminski's membership of the NOP, which he described as \"problematic\", and said he completely disagreed with Kaminski's opposition to a state apology for the massacre of hundreds of Jews in German-occupied Jedwabne in 1941.Miliband is still refusing to modify his analysis. Responding to Schudrich's decision to contest the article from which he was quoting when he attacked Kaminski at the party conference, he said Schudrich was only quibbling with the headline of the New

"poland", "content": " A state of emergency was announced in Poland today involving tightened border controls and random police checks as a nationwide hunt was launched for the infamous bronze sign to the former German Nazi death camp Auschwitz after it was stolen.The discovery this morning that the sign had been wrenched from the top of the entrance gate posts prompted international reactions of outrage from Washington to London and urgent calls for its return.The sign, cast by camp prisoners, which offered the cynical welcome to new inmates \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" (work sets you free) and stands as a potent symbol of the suffering millions endured at the camp, is believed to have been removed by a gang in what authorities called a meticulously planned robbery.Katarzyna Padlo, spokeswoman for police in O\u015bwi\u0119cim, (the Polish name for Auschwitz) in south-eastern Poland, said: \"We believe the sign was stolen between 3.30am and 5am when museum guards first noticed it was missing and called the police.\"Scores of Polish police were put on the case to investigate the whereabouts of the sign.Border patrol police were told to be on the lookout for the 5m-long heavy cast-iron plaque that had spanned the entrance gate, over fears that there might have been plans to take it out of the country.The news of the sign's disappearance triggered impassioned calls for its return.Shimon Peres, president of Israel, discussed the theft with Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, in Copenhagen today. \"The state of Israel and the Jewish people in their entirety ask that you take the necessary steps to catch the criminals and return the sign to its place,\" he told Tusk. \"The sign is of profound historical significance both for the Jewish people and the entire world.\"Avner Shalev, president of Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel, said: \"This is an attack on the remembrance of the Holocaust,\" referring to those responsible as \"certain elements who want to take us back to the dark days\".Jaroslaw Mensfeld, a historian and spokesman for Auschwitz, called the incident \"shameful\" and said it amounted to the \"desecration of a place in which more than a million people were murdered\".Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust in the UK, said she was disgusted by the robbery, which she called an \"appalling act of vandalism [that showed] gross disregard to all Holocaust survivors and the families of those who lost loved ones there.\"The Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau stands as a universal symbol of the Holocaust and for millions of victims the sign represented the cynical cruelty of Nazi rule.\"Poland's parliament said the recovery of the sign was being treated as a matter of urgency. \"This is regretful and embarrassing,\" said Bogdan Borusewicz, chairman of the second parliamentary chamber of the Polish senate. \"I just hope they don't destroy the plaque.\"Andrzej Przewoznik, minister with responsibility for the protection of historical monuments, said: \"This is an act of vandalism that knows no equal.\"There was widespread speculation over who might have been behind the robbery, with investigators looking into suggestions that it could have been anyone from scrap metal dealers to Holocaust deniers, from rightwing collectors of Nazi memorabilia to pre-Christmas pranksters.Tonight they were still no closer to solving the mystery.Police believe a gang was responsible for the robbery because it had apparently been carefully carried out with the perpetrators avoiding attracting the attention of nightwatchmen or being caught on CCTV cameras.They confirmed that the sign had been unscrewed on one side and pulled off with some force on the other. Sniffer dogs brought to the scene have led police to believe the sign was removed from the camp compound through a hole in the fence before being loaded into a van. After that any trail of the thieves has been lost.Authorities in the region announced a state of emergency as the hunt for the sign was launched and a nationwide appeal went out urging anyone with any information to contact police. A 5,000 zloty (\u00a31,000) reward was being offered to anyone with information that would lead to the criminals or the whereabouts of the sign. Police were today replaying hours of video footage from the CCTV cameras at the Auschwitz site, which is now a museum.The Polish ambassador to Israel, Agnieszka Magdziak-Miszewska, said that it was believed the robbery had been \"meticulously planned, because they were not caught on security cameras\". She added: \"Finding the metal sign has become a national priority.\"Approximately 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, died in Auschwitz which was built in Nazi-occupied Poland. About 500 acres of the former death camp was turned into a museum after the end of the war.The Arbeit Macht Frei sign was erected by prisoners with metalwork skills on Nazi orders in June 1940, and was a cynical take on the title of an 1873 work by the lexicographer, linguist and novelist Lorenz Diefenbach in which gamblers and fraudsters discover the path to virtue through hard work.Museum officials have placed a replica of the sign above the gates which was used several years ago while the original was being repaired.\u2022 This article was amended on Monday 21 December 2009 to correct the spelling of O\u015bwi\u0119cim.

A spokesman for the Auschwitz museum, Pawel Sawicki, called the theft a \"desecration\" and said it was shocking that the tragic history of the site did not stop the thieves. In Brussels, the European parliament president, Jerry Burzek, appealed for the sign to be returned \"out of respect for the suffering of over a million victims\".Another museum spokesman, Jaroslaw Mensfelt, said the thieves carried the sign 300 metres to an opening in a barbed-wire gap in a concrete wall. The opening had been left intentionally to preserve a poplar tree dating back to the time of the war.Fifty criminal investigators and a sniffer dog were sent to the grounds of the vast former death camp, where barracks, watchtowers and the ruins of gas chambers stand as testament to the atrocities inflicted by Nazi Germany on Jews, Gypsies and others.The sniffer dog led police to a spot outside the wall where the sign left an imprint in freshly fallen snow, then to a roadside where the sign appeared to have been loaded on to a getaway vehicle. A 5,000-zloty (\u00a31,000) reward has been offered to anyone who can help track down the perpetrators.Padlo said there were no suspects but police were pursuing several theories.Another police spokesman told TVP Info television: \"The whole area is under surveillance. There are many cameras there. We are now analysing the film. I hope we will find the trail.\"Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance centre in Jerusalem, told Reuters the theft was \"an attack on the memory of the Holocaust\". Noach Flug, president of the International Auschwitz Committee in Jerusalem, said it \"deeply unsettles the survivors\" and the sign \"has to be found\".Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said the thieves were guilty of desecrating a site of immense importance.\"If they are pranksters, they'd have to be sick pranksters, or someone with a political agenda. But whoever has done it has desecrated world memory,\" he said.\"Auschwitz has to stand intact because without it, we are without the world's greatest physical reminder of what we are capable of doing to each other.\"Sawicki said the museum authorities had already replaced the sign with a replica, which was used briefly a few years ago when the original was being repaired.The original sign was made in the summer of 1940 by non-Jewish Polish inmates of Auschwitz in an iron workshop at the camp. After occupying Poland in 1939, the Nazis established the Auschwitz I camp in the southern Polish city of Oswiecim and initially used it for German political prisoners and non-Jewish Polish prisoners.\"We believe that the perpetrators will be found soon and the inscription will be returned to its place,\" said Sawicki.The slogan \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" was used at the entrances to other Nazi camps, including Dachau and Sachsenhausen, but the long, curving sign at Auschwitz is perhaps the best known.More than a million people visit the Auschwitz site every year, but the barracks and other structures are in a state of disrepair and Polish authorities have been struggling to find the funds to carry out conservation work. This week, Germany pledged \u20ac60m to an endowment that will fund long-term preservation work \u2013 half the amount that Auschwitz memorial museum officials say is needed.", "tags": ["Poland", "Second world war", "Germany", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Arbeit Macht Frei sign stolen from Auschwitz"},{"date": "2009-11-04T09:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Five years ago, I administered CPR to an old gent who had collapsed on a train with a heart attack. Later, I learned that he was an Auschwitz survivor named Antoni Kolodziejczyk; the number 138048 was tattooed on his left forearm. When he recovered, he spoke to me of wartime memories that he had rarely shared before, even with his own family. That experience meant a lot to me, and so did the words of the chief rabbi of Poland last week.Who could Rabbi Michael Schudrich, a smart and feisty New Yorker, have been talking about when he protested against the \"grotesque distortion\" of his words for political gain in the UK? Why did he feel the need to intervene and say it is wrong to play on a false stereotype of Poles as antisemites? Did he have in mind certain Labour politicians, and journalists at the New Statesman and the Guardian?Of course, he did. The chief rabbi identified an element of the British left that has propagated a smear campaign accusing a Tory ally, Polish MEP Michal Kaminski, of antisemitism. By association, it has been implied that Kaminski's Law and Justice party and its voters are extremist, far-right or even neo-Nazi. None of these labels fit: that party can only be described as staunchly conservative, or nationalist conservative at worst.I have never voted for the Tories and Michal Kaminski is not a friend of mine. His party is far too suspicious of market economics and is also far too Eurosceptic, for my liking. I disagree with its views on lifestyle and social policy. So I have no reason to exonerate Kaminski whatsoever. But I do know this charge of antisemitism against Kaminski came after preparation in the UK for a negative PR operation against Law and Justice. On my desk is a copy of the 15-page plan of attack against the Tories' Polish allies that circulated Whitehall this summer. I've been asked not to publish it, and source anonymity should be protected. But I am convinced its content is as vacuous as the \"dodgy dossier\", the cooked-up intelligence that took us into Iraq.Some on the British left have made one-sided assertions about the history of eastern Europe, and have cast Polish or Tory attempts to reveal the whole truth with all its nuances as hair-splitting about the Holocaust. And journalists have amplified rather than scrutinised the demagoguery of David Miliband.All this manipulation, I have been told, is justifiable because it is a way of attacking the Tories. I beg to differ. There is no excuse for demonising an entire ethnic group, in this case the Poles, because it might save a few Labour MPs their jobs at the next election.Some commentators have said this has been a Labour ploy to win over the British Jewish vote, by stirring up fear of Polish antisemitism. But people who really care about gentile-Jewish relations know there is a tremendous Jewish revival underway in Poland, and the country is clearly identifying and denouncing crimes against Jews.Poland is also investigating alleged Jewish collaboration with the Soviets, a notion many British people seem to assume must be an antisemitic conspiracy theory on a par with the blood libel. Certainly, the stereotype of Jewish Bolshevism has been used in an attempt to justify race hate. But if dealt with fairly and accurately, this subject needn't be any more taboo than the culpability of Polish gentiles in the Soviet-backed regime and at the pogroms of Jedwabne, Kielce and others.When Stalin and Hitler divided Poland in 1939, the Soviets took more territory than the Nazis did. At first, Polish Jews in the Soviet partition were naturally relieved and grateful that they would not be under Nazi oppression. By contrast, many Polish gentiles immediately viewed the Soviets as invading enemies. This is when the seam between Polish Jews and Polish gentiles was sundered. The Soviets conducted a policy of social engineering, sometimes offering poor Jews among others the positions that established Polish gentiles had once had before they were deported to the Gulags. Some Polish Jews betrayed their country and served the Soviets, as some Polish gentiles also did. There were unforgivable gentile reprisals against Jews punished because of guilt by association. When discussing this volatile subject, it is wrong to stereotype Polish Jews as pro-Soviet, but it is equally wrong to say questions about Polish-Jewish collaboration with the Soviets are necessarily antisemitic.While antisemitism exists in Poland, as it does in the UK, more and more Jews are discovering their Polish roots, while many Polish gentiles are discovering their Jewish roots too. Moreover, ever more research is showing us that Poland's pre-war gentile and Jewish communities were far more united than popular myth has led people to believe.Some 120,000 Polish Jews served in the Polish army at the start of the second world war, and defended their country against the joint Soviet-Nazi invasion of 1939. At the Katyn forest massacre of the Polish elite, the Soviets executed at least 600 Jews who were Polish army officers. Among them, the chief rabbi of the Polish army, Major Baruch Steinberg, was shot in the back of the head by a Soviet bullet. His body was slung in a mass grave next to the bodies of his Polish gentile countrymen. The motivations were different, but it is quite possible that as many Polish Jews were murdered at the massacre at Katyn as were murdered at the massacre at Jedwabne.Ignoring these facts prompts the slightly confusing thesis that the Jedwabne pogrom can be compared to what the Nazis did in the Holocaust. But Stalin's crimes cannot be compared to Hitler's. In case anyone has forgotten, Nazi Germany killed up to 3 million Polish citizens who were gentiles, 3 million Polish citizens who were Jews, and 3 million Jews from outside Poland. Some Polish gentiles saved Jewish lives; some Polish gentiles betrayed Jews. A far greater proportion of the Polish Jewish community was wiped out than the Polish gentile community.During the war, the Polish government in exile, which included Jews in its cabinet, passed a Polish intelligence report to their British allies. In it, the Poles informed the British about the Nazi German gas chambers, and requested an RAF air strike on the train lines. Churchill ignored the Polish request to save tens of thousands of Jews from death at Auschwitz. One wonders whether David Miliband will ever see fit to apologise for that on behalf of Britain, and whether it would be antisemitic of him to oppose the apology.One of the main charges against Kaminski, of course, is that he opposed Poland's 2001 apology for the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, in which a mob of around 40 Polish gentiles, in the presence of German police, murdered at least 300 Polish Jews. Kaminski said that asking for an apology would be as wrong as asking Polish Jews to apologise for their collaboration with the Soviets and their crimes against Polish gentiles.In my view, Kaminski was wrong to oppose that apology, which was intended as an act of reconciliation rather than a suggestion that the entire Polish nation had participated in the Holocaust. The point is, many Poles view Jedwabne a criminal act against fellow Polish citizens carried out by a small but vicious rabble who betrayed the core Polish value of anti-Nazism. Those 40 pogromists have always been viewed as traitors in Poland.Kaminski was wrong to oppose the apology, and his analogy was offensive. But according to the chief rabbi, Kaminski has put his teenage extremism behind him and he is not an antisemite.Polish people, including the million-strong Polish community in Britain, are deeply proud that Poland never produced a collaborationist regime, nor home-grown SS units, as happened elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe. Poland also resisted the savagery of the Soviet Union long before the Western allies did. So, for many Poles, there has never been a choice between fascism and communism \u2013 their country is characterised by its defiance against totalitarianism in all its forms.Today, even as Poles challenge the stereotype of Polish antisemitism, many have the courage to depict incidents of Polish wrongdoing against Jews with total clarity; and they show how strongly they object to cowardly anti-Polish slurs. Slowly but surely, Poles are defining themselves not by the suffering of the forefathers, but by their courage.Both Miliband and Kaminski are political opportunists, and their simplistic comments get in the way of genuine understanding. We should be very cautious of them both.", "tags": ["Michal Kaminski", "Poland", "Race issues", "Religion", "Judaism", "The far right", "UK news", "David Miliband", "Europe"], "title": "Poland: prejudice and pride | Kamil Tchorek"},{"date": "2009-11-09T22:35:34Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Sitting with her daughter and granddaughter in one of Warsaw's poshest coffee shops, Tereza Sawerska dwells on Poland's 20th century. In the 1940s as a child she trudged the country lanes with her father in search of a bit of bread, stealing carrots from the fields as the Nazi occupation and slaughter engulfed Poland. In the 60s, as a young mother, she tramped miles across Warsaw through teargas and barricades to fetch her daughter from kindergarten as the hated riot police dealt with rebel students. In the 80s, the retired tax administrator kept her head down to survive communist martial law.\"People left home and did not return. We didn't know what happened to them,\" the 76-year-old recalled. \"If you said something random, you were in big trouble. Get beaten or sent to jail.\"Marta, her 24-year-old granddaughter, sighs impatiently. She's heard it all before. \"I've never known a Poland like this. It's all just history. I'm just happy I don't need to live in a world like that.\"Then Tereza summons a long-suppressed memory from the early 50s. She had a boyfriend at school. He took part in a protest against the Russians, then imposing Stalinism in Warsaw. The teenage boy vanished. \"They were arrested very quickly, taken to a terrible prison. He wrote me letters. But they were censored, bits blacked out.\"Monika and Marta, Tereza's daughter and granddaughter, turn damp-eyed at a little bit of family history they have never heard before.One country and one family. Three women, three generations, three Polands, exemplifying the change and social mobility wrought by the revolution symbolised by the fall of the wall.In recent years, Marta has been in Bangkok and Berlin, Cairo and Canada, London and Paris. She has her own firm teaching foreigners Polish and helping them set up some of the 1.7m businesses that have transformed Poland into one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing places in Europe, the only EU state not to dip into recession this year.Her grandmother's life spans Poland's authoritarian inter-war republic, 45 years of Soviet communism, and 20 years of independent democracy. Between the two of them, Monika, a 48-year-old divorced bank worker, says the communist years now seem like a distant bad dream. You couldn't buy toilet paper. There were ration cards, queues for bad sausage. If a delivery of new shoes appeared in a shop window, you just bought a pair whether they were the right size or not.She laughs: \"Everything was grey and ugly. When I think about my youth, it was all about trying to make things a bit more pretty and colourful.\"It's incredible how people lived. They were bugging the phones, you couldn't talk to people, you never knew who was listening to you or would use something against you. But nowadays we've forgotten all that. It's like history, not part of your life any more.\"There is still, of course, plenty of greyness and ugliness in Poland. But 20 years after the fall of the wall, a revolution set in train in Warsaw 10 months earlier in 1989, Marta and her generation are too pushy, too busy, and too absorbed in their successful young lives and careers to sit around pondering politics or wondering how they got here.\"I know that Poland has changed incredibly. But for me it's been more to do with technology, mobile phones and the internet. Solidarity? I don't even know how the change in the political situation came.\"It came in February 1989, via the \"round table\", the historic compromise struck by dissidents and ruling communists that ushered in a bloodless revolution and set the template for the liberation of the rest of Soviet Europe, a unique and triumphant dismantling of dictatorship peacefully that climaxed at the wall on a cold and damp Thursday evening 20 years ago this week.The result two decades on, according to Adam Michnik, a giant of the revolution and one of the architects of the round table pact, is the most successful Poland in 300 years. The same might be said about the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, all in Nato, all in the European Union, and all in the throes of a huge catch-up exercise in modernisation driven by the transfers of tens of billions of euros from western to eastern Europe.\"You have a curious combination of external security and internal democratic order with a modest but successful economic system,\" says Andrzej Rychard, director of Warsaw's centre for social sciences. \"That hasn't happened that often in the history of this country.\"The change has been wrenching, its speed dizzying. Andrzej, who did not want his surname disclosed, is another whose life chances have been transformed. His father was a farmer from the rural east who came to Warsaw to work on the building sites. Andrzej is 41, a successful and wealthy tax consultant employing 20 people and advising \"high-value clients\". His 13-year-old son is privately educated and has all the latest gadgets and toys. Despite his success, Andrzej is less than satisfied.\"We're the lucky generation. From my perspective, things look good,\" he says. \"But there's not too much positive in what has happened. The whole history of privatisation has been an exercise in robbery. The old system was a nightmare, but this is not a democracy.\"The grumbling is echoed in opinion polls across the region. A survey of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians last week from Warsaw's Institute of Public Affairs found a solid majority, except among the eternally gloomy Hungarians, satisfied with the \"transformation\" of the past two decades, but a sizeable minority frustrated.While between 53% and 68% of Slovaks, Poles and Czechs believed life had improved, 65% of Hungarians thought things were no better or worse.\"It's surprising how many are not so enthusiastic about democracy,\" said Malgorzata Falkowska-Warska, a researcher at the institute.The social scientists also conducted a focus group of young people and were even more surprised to find a strong degree of cynicism about the drama of the past two decades. \"We were shocked that the young were very ambivalent about the advantages of freedom and democracy.

The Tories were furious about the remarks and the party leader, David Cameron, demanded Miliband retract his comments, which he has refused to do.Speaking about Kaminski, Schudrich said: \"I certainly see him as a man that today, today, is against antisemitism\", adding that Law and Justice was not a \"fringe right party\".The row broke out when the New Statesman headlined a story \"Jewish leaders turn on Tories\" in which Schudrich was quoted in an email saying: \"It is clear that Mr Kaminski was a member of the NOP [National Revival of Poland], a group that is openly far-right and neo-Nazi.\"Schudrich later complained he had been misrepresented so the magazine changed the article's headline online but noted that the chief rabbi had not retracted his comments.Schudrich told BBC Radio 4's Today programme today that Kaminski was a \"complicated person\" who he acknowledged had been a member of the NOP as a teenager, but he now regarded Kaminski as a \"serious ally to the state of Israel\". Explaining why the politician now enjoyed his confidence, Schudrich said: \"He has become a strong ally of the state of Israel and on other occasions has condemned antisemitism.\"So what we have here is a complicated person, and we need to be able to understand him in a fuller context, not taking on things he said but taking a look at what he has said over the past 20 years.\"However, Schudrich refused to condone Kaminski's membership of the NOP, which he described as \"problematic\", and said he completely disagreed with Kaminski's opposition to a state apology for the massacre of hundreds of Jews in German-occupied Jedwabne in 1941.Miliband is still refusing to modify his analysis. Responding to Schudrich's decision to contest the article from which he was quoting when he attacked Kaminski at the party conference, he said Schudrich was only quibbling with the headline of the New

"poland", "content": " A state of emergency was announced in Poland today involving tightened border controls and random police checks as a nationwide hunt was launched for the infamous bronze sign to the former German Nazi death camp Auschwitz after it was stolen.The discovery this morning that the sign had been wrenched from the top of the entrance gate posts prompted international reactions of outrage from Washington to London and urgent calls for its return.The sign, cast by camp prisoners, which offered the cynical welcome to new inmates \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" (work sets you free) and stands as a potent symbol of the suffering millions endured at the camp, is believed to have been removed by a gang in what authorities called a meticulously planned robbery.Katarzyna Padlo, spokeswoman for police in O\u015bwi\u0119cim, (the Polish name for Auschwitz) in south-eastern Poland, said: \"We believe the sign was stolen between 3.30am and 5am when museum guards first noticed it was missing and called the police.\"Scores of Polish police were put on the case to investigate the whereabouts of the sign.Border patrol police were told to be on the lookout for the 5m-long heavy cast-iron plaque that had spanned the entrance gate, over fears that there might have been plans to take it out of the country.The news of the sign's disappearance triggered impassioned calls for its return.Shimon Peres, president of Israel, discussed the theft with Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, in Copenhagen today. \"The state of Israel and the Jewish people in their entirety ask that you take the necessary steps to catch the criminals and return the sign to its place,\" he told Tusk. \"The sign is of profound historical significance both for the Jewish people and the entire world.\"Avner Shalev, president of Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel, said: \"This is an attack on the remembrance of the Holocaust,\" referring to those responsible as \"certain elements who want to take us back to the dark days\".Jaroslaw Mensfeld, a historian and spokesman for Auschwitz, called the incident \"shameful\" and said it amounted to the \"desecration of a place in which more than a million people were murdered\".Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust in the UK, said she was disgusted by the robbery, which she called an \"appalling act of vandalism [that showed] gross disregard to all Holocaust survivors and the families of those who lost loved ones there.\"The Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau stands as a universal symbol of the Holocaust and for millions of victims the sign represented the cynical cruelty of Nazi rule.\"Poland's parliament said the recovery of the sign was being treated as a matter of urgency. \"This is regretful and embarrassing,\" said Bogdan Borusewicz, chairman of the second parliamentary chamber of the Polish senate. \"I just hope they don't destroy the plaque.\"Andrzej Przewoznik, minister with responsibility for the protection of historical monuments, said: \"This is an act of vandalism that knows no equal.\"There was widespread speculation over who might have been behind the robbery, with investigators looking into suggestions that it could have been anyone from scrap metal dealers to Holocaust deniers, from rightwing collectors of Nazi memorabilia to pre-Christmas pranksters.Tonight they were still no closer to solving the mystery.Police believe a gang was responsible for the robbery because it had apparently been carefully carried out with the perpetrators avoiding attracting the attention of nightwatchmen or being caught on CCTV cameras.They confirmed that the sign had been unscrewed on one side and pulled off with some force on the other. Sniffer dogs brought to the scene have led police to believe the sign was removed from the camp compound through a hole in the fence before being loaded into a van. After that any trail of the thieves has been lost.Authorities in the region announced a state of emergency as the hunt for the sign was launched and a nationwide appeal went out urging anyone with any information to contact police. A 5,000 zloty (\u00a31,000) reward was being offered to anyone with information that would lead to the criminals or the whereabouts of the sign. Police were today replaying hours of video footage from the CCTV cameras at the Auschwitz site, which is now a museum.The Polish ambassador to Israel, Agnieszka Magdziak-Miszewska, said that it was believed the robbery had been \"meticulously planned, because they were not caught on security cameras\". She added: \"Finding the metal sign has become a national priority.\"Approximately 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, died in Auschwitz which was built in Nazi-occupied Poland. About 500 acres of the former death camp was turned into a museum after the end of the war.The Arbeit Macht Frei sign was erected by prisoners with metalwork skills on Nazi orders in June 1940, and was a cynical take on the title of an 1873 work by the lexicographer, linguist and novelist Lorenz Diefenbach in which gamblers and fraudsters discover the path to virtue through hard work.Museum officials have placed a replica of the sign above the gates which was used several years ago while the original was being repaired.\u2022 This article was amended on Monday 21 December 2009 to correct the spelling of O\u015bwi\u0119cim.

A spokesman for the Auschwitz museum, Pawel Sawicki, called the theft a \"desecration\" and said it was shocking that the tragic history of the site did not stop the thieves. In Brussels, the European parliament president, Jerry Burzek, appealed for the sign to be returned \"out of respect for the suffering of over a million victims\".Another museum spokesman, Jaroslaw Mensfelt, said the thieves carried the sign 300 metres to an opening in a barbed-wire gap in a concrete wall. The opening had been left intentionally to preserve a poplar tree dating back to the time of the war.Fifty criminal investigators and a sniffer dog were sent to the grounds of the vast former death camp, where barracks, watchtowers and the ruins of gas chambers stand as testament to the atrocities inflicted by Nazi Germany on Jews, Gypsies and others.The sniffer dog led police to a spot outside the wall where the sign left an imprint in freshly fallen snow, then to a roadside where the sign appeared to have been loaded on to a getaway vehicle. A 5,000-zloty (\u00a31,000) reward has been offered to anyone who can help track down the perpetrators.Padlo said there were no suspects but police were pursuing several theories.Another police spokesman told TVP Info television: \"The whole area is under surveillance. There are many cameras there. We are now analysing the film. I hope we will find the trail.\"Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance centre in Jerusalem, told Reuters the theft was \"an attack on the memory of the Holocaust\".

But whoever has done it has desecrated world memory,\" he said.\"Auschwitz has to stand intact because without it, we are without the world's greatest physical reminder of what we are capable of doing to each other.\"Sawicki said the museum authorities had already replaced the sign with a replica, which was used briefly a few years ago when the original was being repaired.The original sign was made in the summer of 1940 by non-Jewish Polish inmates of Auschwitz in an iron workshop at the camp. After occupying Poland in 1939, the Nazis established the Auschwitz I camp in the southern Polish city of Oswiecim and initially used it for German political prisoners and non-Jewish Polish prisoners.\"We believe that the perpetrators will be found soon and the inscription will be returned to its place,\" said Sawicki.The slogan \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" was used at the entrances to other Nazi camps, including Dachau and Sachsenhausen, but the long, curving sign at Auschwitz is perhaps the best known.More than a million people visit the Auschwitz site every year, but the barracks and other structures are in a state of disrepair and Polish authorities have been struggling to find the funds to carry out conservation work.

Demjanjuk's lawyer, Ulrich Busch, said his client would exercise his right to remain silent.At one point, the judge, Ralph Alt, interrupted a lawyer when Demjanjuk was heard to mumble. \"Herr Demjanjuk wants to say something,\" he said.But the defendant's Ukrainian translator, who had been whispering translation of the proceedings into his left ear, replied: \"No, he's just praying\". Demjanjuk then appeared to cross himself.A 10-page charge sheet was read out by the state prosecutor, Hans Joachim Lutz.It described how people were transported to Sobibor in trainloads and \"could have been shot at at any time\" during the journey.He said Demjanjuk had \"mercilessly and callously\" helped other guards and SS soldiers to drive people into the gas chambers \"because he himself wanted their deaths, believing, too, in the racist ideology behind it.\"The slow-moving trial was again delayed following the repeat of a request from Busch that the case be thrown out.The lawyer called Demjanjuk's deportation from his adopted home in Cleveland, Ohio, to Germany in May \"illegal\", and asked why it had taken 30 years to bring the case to court if the evidence against him was so compelling.Demjanjuk tops the list of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's most wanted Nazis.He is believed to have been one of around 150 Soviet war prisoners recruited as camp guards at Sobibor between spring 1942 and October 1943, when 250,000 Jews were murdered.Most of the victims perished within an hour of arriving at the camp.Demjanjuk, who suffers from a low-risk form of a bone marrow illness and other ailments, has been deemed fit to stand trial by three doctors.Individual sessions are being limited to between 90 minutes and two hours in length.Efraim Zuroff, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, said he was concerned that the first day of the trial had been dominated by an assessment of Demjanjuk's state of health.\"We didn't hear anything about Sobibor, only about his ailments,\" he said.", "tags": ["Second world war", "Holocaust", "War crimes", "Germany", "Poland", "Europe"], "title": "Death camp survivors weep at trial of 89-year-old Nazi suspect"},{"date": "2009-11-04T09:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Five years ago, I administered CPR to an old gent who had collapsed on a train with a heart attack. Later, I learned that he was an Auschwitz survivor named Antoni Kolodziejczyk; the number 138048 was tattooed on his left forearm. When he recovered, he spoke to me of wartime memories that he had rarely shared before, even with his own family. That experience meant a lot to me, and so did the words of the chief rabbi of Poland last week.Who could Rabbi Michael Schudrich, a smart and feisty New Yorker, have been talking about when he protested against the \"grotesque distortion\" of his words for political gain in the UK? Why did he feel the need to intervene and say it is wrong to play on a false stereotype of Poles as antisemites? Did he have in mind certain Labour politicians, and journalists at the New Statesman and the Guardian?Of course, he did. The chief rabbi identified an element of the British left that has propagated a smear campaign accusing a Tory ally, Polish MEP Michal Kaminski, of antisemitism. By association, it has been implied that Kaminski's Law and Justice party and its voters are extremist, far-right or even neo-Nazi. None of these labels fit: that party can only be described as staunchly conservative, or nationalist conservative at worst.I have never voted for the Tories and Michal Kaminski is not a friend of mine. His party is far too suspicious of market economics and is also far too Eurosceptic, for my liking. I disagree with its views on lifestyle and social policy. So I have no reason to exonerate Kaminski whatsoever. But I do know this charge of antisemitism against Kaminski came after preparation in the UK for a negative PR operation against Law and Justice. On my desk is a copy of the 15-page plan of attack against the Tories' Polish allies that circulated Whitehall this summer. I've been asked not to publish it, and source anonymity should be protected. But I am convinced its content is as vacuous as the \"dodgy dossier\", the cooked-up intelligence that took us into Iraq.Some on the British left have made one-sided assertions about the history of eastern Europe, and have cast Polish or Tory attempts to reveal the whole truth with all its nuances as hair-splitting about the Holocaust. And journalists have amplified rather than scrutinised the demagoguery of David Miliband.All this manipulation, I have been told, is justifiable because it is a way of attacking the Tories. I beg to differ. There is no excuse for demonising an entire ethnic group, in this case the Poles, because it might save a few Labour MPs their jobs at the next election.Some commentators have said this has been a Labour ploy to win over the British Jewish vote, by stirring up fear of Polish antisemitism. But people who really care about gentile-Jewish relations know there is a tremendous Jewish revival underway in Poland, and the country is clearly identifying and denouncing crimes against Jews.Poland is also investigating alleged Jewish collaboration with the Soviets, a notion many British people seem to assume must be an antisemitic conspiracy theory on a par with the blood libel. Certainly, the stereotype of Jewish Bolshevism has been used in an attempt to justify race hate. But if dealt with fairly and accurately, this subject needn't be any more taboo than the culpability of Polish gentiles in the Soviet-backed regime and at the pogroms of Jedwabne, Kielce and others.When Stalin and Hitler divided Poland in 1939, the Soviets took more territory than the Nazis did. At first, Polish Jews in the Soviet partition were naturally relieved and grateful that they would not be under Nazi oppression. By contrast, many Polish gentiles immediately viewed the Soviets as invading enemies. This is when the seam between Polish Jews and Polish gentiles was sundered. The Soviets conducted a policy of social engineering, sometimes offering poor Jews among others the positions that established Polish gentiles had once had before they were deported to the Gulags. Some Polish Jews betrayed their country and served the Soviets, as some Polish gentiles also did. There were unforgivable gentile reprisals against Jews punished because of guilt by association. When discussing this volatile subject, it is wrong to stereotype Polish Jews as pro-Soviet, but it is equally wrong to say questions about Polish-Jewish collaboration with the Soviets are necessarily antisemitic.While antisemitism exists in Poland, as it does in the UK, more and more Jews are discovering their Polish roots, while many Polish gentiles are discovering their Jewish roots too. Moreover, ever more research is showing us that Poland's pre-war gentile and Jewish communities were far more united than popular myth has led people to believe.Some 120,000 Polish Jews served in the Polish army at the start of the second world war, and defended their country against the joint Soviet-Nazi invasion of 1939. At the Katyn forest massacre of the Polish elite, the Soviets executed at least 600 Jews who were Polish army officers. Among them, the chief rabbi of the Polish army, Major Baruch Steinberg, was shot in the back of the head by a Soviet bullet. His body was slung in a mass grave next to the bodies of his Polish gentile countrymen. The motivations were different, but it is quite possible that as many Polish Jews were murdered at the massacre at Katyn as were murdered at the massacre at Jedwabne.Ignoring these facts prompts the slightly confusing thesis that the Jedwabne pogrom can be compared to what the Nazis did in the Holocaust. But Stalin's crimes cannot be compared to Hitler's. In case anyone has forgotten, Nazi Germany killed up to 3 million Polish citizens who were gentiles, 3 million Polish citizens who were Jews, and 3 million Jews from outside Poland. Some Polish gentiles saved Jewish lives; some Polish gentiles betrayed Jews. A far greater proportion of the Polish Jewish community was wiped out than the Polish gentile community.During the war, the Polish government in exile, which included Jews in its cabinet, passed a Polish intelligence report to their British allies. In it, the Poles informed the British about the Nazi German gas chambers, and requested an RAF air strike on the train lines. Churchill ignored the Polish request to save tens of thousands of Jews from death at Auschwitz. One wonders whether David Miliband will ever see fit to apologise for that on behalf of Britain, and whether it would be antisemitic of him to oppose the apology.One of the main charges against Kaminski, of course, is that he opposed Poland's 2001 apology for the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, in which a mob of around 40 Polish gentiles, in the presence of German police, murdered at least 300 Polish Jews. Kaminski said that asking for an apology would be as wrong as asking Polish Jews to apologise for their collaboration with the Soviets and their crimes against Polish gentiles.In my view, Kaminski was wrong to oppose that apology, which was intended as an act of reconciliation rather than a suggestion that the entire Polish nation had participated in the Holocaust. The point is, many Poles view Jedwabne a criminal act against fellow Polish citizens carried out by a small but vicious rabble who betrayed the core Polish value of anti-Nazism. Those 40 pogromists have always been viewed as traitors in Poland.Kaminski was wrong to oppose the apology, and his analogy was offensive. But according to the chief rabbi, Kaminski has put his teenage extremism behind him and he is not an antisemite.Polish people, including the million-strong Polish community in Britain, are deeply proud that Poland never produced a collaborationist regime, nor home-grown SS units, as happened elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe. Poland also resisted the savagery of the Soviet Union long before the Western allies did. So, for many Poles, there has never been a choice between fascism and communism \u2013 their country is characterised by its defiance against totalitarianism in all its forms.Today, even as Poles challenge the stereotype of Polish antisemitism, many have the courage to depict incidents of Polish wrongdoing against Jews with total clarity; and they show how strongly they object to cowardly anti-Polish slurs. Slowly but surely, Poles are defining themselves not by the suffering of the forefathers, but by their courage.Both Miliband and Kaminski are political opportunists, and their simplistic comments get in the way of genuine understanding.

In the 1940s as a child she trudged the country lanes with her father in search of a bit of bread, stealing carrots from the fields as the Nazi occupation and slaughter engulfed Poland. In the 60s, as a young mother, she tramped miles across Warsaw through teargas and barricades to fetch her daughter from kindergarten as the hated riot police dealt with rebel students. In the 80s, the retired tax administrator kept her head down to survive communist martial law.\"People left home and did not return. We didn't know what happened to them,\" the 76-year-old recalled. \"If you said something random, you were in big trouble. Get beaten or sent to jail.\"Marta, her 24-year-old granddaughter, sighs impatiently. She's heard it all before. \"I've never known a Poland like this. It's all just history. I'm just happy I don't need to live in a world like that.\"Then Tereza summons a long-suppressed memory from the early 50s. She had a boyfriend at school. He took part in a protest against the Russians, then imposing Stalinism in Warsaw. The teenage boy vanished. \"They were arrested very quickly, taken to a terrible prison. He wrote me letters. But they were censored, bits blacked out.\"Monika and Marta, Tereza's daughter and granddaughter, turn damp-eyed at a little bit of family history they have never heard before.One country and one family. Three women, three generations, three Polands, exemplifying the change and social mobility wrought by the revolution symbolised by the fall of the wall.In recent years, Marta has been in Bangkok and Berlin, Cairo and Canada, London and Paris. She has her own firm teaching foreigners Polish and helping them set up some of the 1.7m businesses that have transformed Poland into one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing places in Europe, the only EU state not to dip into recession this year.Her grandmother's life spans Poland's authoritarian inter-war republic, 45 years of Soviet communism, and 20 years of independent democracy. Between the two of them, Monika, a 48-year-old divorced bank worker, says the communist years now seem like a distant bad dream. You couldn't buy toilet paper. There were ration cards, queues for bad sausage. If a delivery of new shoes appeared in a shop window, you just bought a pair whether they were the right size or not.She laughs: \"Everything was grey and ugly. When I think about my youth, it was all about trying to make things a bit more pretty and colourful.\"It's incredible how people lived. They were bugging the phones, you couldn't talk to people, you never knew who was listening to you or would use something against you. But nowadays we've forgotten all that. It's like history, not part of your life any more.\"There is still, of course, plenty of greyness and ugliness in Poland. But 20 years after the fall of the wall, a revolution set in train in Warsaw 10 months earlier in 1989, Marta and her generation are too pushy, too busy, and too absorbed in their successful young lives and careers to sit around pondering politics or wondering how they got here.\"I know that Poland has changed incredibly. But for me it's been more to do with technology, mobile phones and the internet. Solidarity? I don't even know how the change in the political situation came.\"It came in February 1989, via the \"round table\", the historic compromise struck by dissidents and ruling communists that ushered in a bloodless revolution and set the template for the liberation of the rest of Soviet Europe, a unique and triumphant dismantling of dictatorship peacefully that climaxed at the wall on a cold and damp Thursday evening 20 years ago this week.The result two decades on, according to Adam Michnik, a giant of the revolution and one of the architects of the round table pact, is the most successful Poland in 300 years. The same might be said about the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, all in Nato, all in the European Union, and all in the throes of a huge catch-up exercise in modernisation driven by the transfers of tens of billions of euros from western to eastern Europe.\"You have a curious combination of external security and internal democratic order with a modest but successful economic system,\" says Andrzej Rychard, director of Warsaw's centre for social sciences. \"That hasn't happened that often in the history of this country.\"The change has been wrenching, its speed dizzying. Andrzej, who did not want his surname disclosed, is another whose life chances have been transformed. His father was a farmer from the rural east who came to Warsaw to work on the building sites. Andrzej is 41, a successful and wealthy tax consultant employing 20 people and advising \"high-value clients\". His 13-year-old son is privately educated and has all the latest gadgets and toys. Despite his success, Andrzej is less than satisfied.\"We're the lucky generation. From my perspective, things look good,\" he says. \"But there's not too much positive in what has happened. The whole history of privatisation has been an exercise in robbery. The old system was a nightmare, but this is not a democracy.\"The grumbling is echoed in opinion polls across the region. A survey of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians last week from Warsaw's Institute of Public Affairs found a solid majority, except among the eternally gloomy Hungarians, satisfied with the \"transformation\" of the past two decades, but a sizeable minority frustrated.While between 53% and 68% of Slovaks, Poles and Czechs believed life had improved, 65% of Hungarians thought things were no better or worse.\"It's surprising how many are not so enthusiastic about democracy,\" said Malgorzata Falkowska-Warska, a researcher at the institute.The social scientists also conducted a focus group of young people and were even more surprised to find a strong degree of cynicism about the drama of the past two decades. \"We were shocked that the young were very ambivalent about the advantages of freedom and democracy. We expected them to be much more idealistic,\" says Falkowska-Warska.One of the big benefits of the relatively new-found liberties, repeatedly mentioned, has been the freedom to travel. But the wanderlust, paradoxically, is also one of the most disturbing factors. The freedom to travel has prompted the most extraordinary exodus of modern times.Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, some 2.3 million young Poles have left, not all at the same time, some coming and going, but with the vast majority staying away. They are overwhelmingly from the depressed small towns and villages of eastern and southern Poland. As soon as they could, they voted with their feet.

Analysts have been shocked by its scale.\"No one expected the emigration to be so huge because there's no need to escape from this country any more. They weren't persecuted. They left a free country,\" says Krystyna Iglicka, one of Poland's leading demographers.Statistics show that around one in five of the post-1989 generation in the active and productive age group of 21-35 have moved abroad. \"This might be a win-win situation for the UK and Ireland, filling the needs of the low-skilled labour market but it is not for us,\" Iglicka adds. \"We thought the migration would be circular, people coming back \u2026 I call this a lost generation.\"Andrzej, the wealthy tax adviser, is angry at the exodus. \"These young people feel that going to the UK is the biggest achievement they can imagine. But that's not success. Why don't they stay and do something in Poland?\"He is also anxious that being part of a united Europe is not necessarily good. \"The EU influences the style of life here, promoting certain values such as homosexuality that are not natural in Poland.\"Luke Pelletier shrugs at such prejudice. \"I love Warsaw, it's a very, very easy place to live,\" says the Parisian gay man who has lived in Poland for 14 years and is happy with the decent living he makes as a drag queen. Pelletier is in a civil partnership with Trevor, a black South African who grew up in London. Despite Poland's occasional reputation for homophobia, neither have any big complaints.Marta, the young businesswoman, says she would not dream of living anywhere but Warsaw. When the wall came down and the world opened up, Marta, her mother, Monika, and her grandmother, Tereza, went to Canada to visit relatives. It was their first trip to the west. \"It was amazing, so thrilling. They had everything in Canada we didn't have. If I could have stayed, I would have,\" says Monika.It is one fundamental measure of the changes that such notions now seem bizarre. She has been back and forth to Canada ever since and two months ago the 48-year-old remarried.Her new husband is a Canadian who is giving up his job to move to Warsaw. \"Now I wouldn't like to live in Canada,\" says Monika. \"Every time I go there, I don't even think about it.\"\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 10 November.

The Tories were furious about the remarks and the party leader, David Cameron, demanded Miliband retract his comments, which he has refused to do.Speaking about Kaminski, Schudrich said: \"I certainly see him as a man that today, today, is against antisemitism\", adding that Law and Justice was not a \"fringe right party\".The row broke out when the New Statesman headlined a story \"Jewish leaders turn on Tories\" in which Schudrich was quoted in an email saying: \"It is clear that Mr Kaminski was a member of the NOP [National Revival of Poland], a group that is openly far-right and neo-Nazi.\"Schudrich later complained he had been misrepresented so the magazine changed the article's headline online but noted that the chief rabbi had not retracted his comments.Schudrich told BBC Radio 4's Today programme today that Kaminski was a \"complicated person\" who he acknowledged had been a member of the NOP as a teenager, but he now regarded Kaminski as a \"serious ally to the state of Israel\". Explaining why the politician now enjoyed his confidence, Schudrich said: \"He has become a strong ally of the state of Israel and on other occasions has condemned antisemitism.\"So what we have here is a complicated person, and we need to be able to understand him in a fuller context, not taking on things he said but taking a look at what he has said over the past 20 years.\"However, Schudrich refused to condone Kaminski's membership of the NOP, which he described as \"problematic\", and said he completely disagreed with Kaminski's opposition to a state apology for the massacre of hundreds of Jews in German-occupied Jedwabne in 1941.Miliband is still refusing to modify his analysis. Responding to Schudrich's decision to contest the article from which he was quoting when he attacked Kaminski at the party conference, he said Schudrich was only quibbling with the headline of the New

the former German Nazi death camp Auschwitz after it was stolen.The discovery this morning that the sign had been wrenched from the top of the entrance gate posts prompted international reactions of outrage from Washington to London and urgent calls for its return.The sign, cast by camp prisoners, which offered the cynical welcome to new inmates \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" (work sets you free) and stands as a potent symbol of the suffering millions endured at the camp, is believed to have been removed by a gang in what authorities called a meticulously planned robbery.Katarzyna Padlo, spokeswoman for police in O\u015bwi\u0119cim, (the Polish name for Auschwitz) in south-eastern Poland, said: \"We believe the sign was stolen between 3.30am and 5am when museum guards first noticed it was missing and called the police.\"Scores of Polish police were put on the case to investigate the whereabouts of the sign.Border patrol police were told to be on the lookout for the 5m-long heavy cast-iron plaque that had spanned the entrance gate, over fears that there might have been plans to take it out of the country.The news of the sign's disappearance triggered impassioned calls for its return.Shimon Peres, president of Israel, discussed the theft with Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, in Copenhagen today. \"The state of Israel and the Jewish people in their entirety ask that you take the necessary steps to catch the criminals and return the sign to its place,\" he told Tusk. \"The sign is of profound historical significance both for the Jewish people and the entire world.\"Avner Shalev, president of Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel, said: \"This is an attack on the remembrance of the Holocaust,\" referring to those responsible as \"certain elements who want to take us back to the dark days\".Jaroslaw Mensfeld, a historian and spokesman for Auschwitz, called the incident \"shameful\" and said it amounted to the \"desecration of a place in which more than a million people were murdered\".Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust in the UK, said she was disgusted by the robbery, which she called an \"appalling act of vandalism [that showed] gross disregard to all Holocaust survivors and the families of those who lost loved ones there.\"The Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau stands as a universal symbol of the Holocaust and for millions of victims the sign represented the cynical cruelty of Nazi rule.\"Poland's parliament said the recovery of the sign was being treated as a matter of urgency. \"This is regretful and embarrassing,\" said Bogdan Borusewicz, chairman of the second parliamentary chamber of the Polish senate. \"I just hope they don't destroy the plaque.\"Andrzej Przewoznik, minister with responsibility for the protection of historical monuments, said: \"This is an act of vandalism that knows no equal.\"There was widespread speculation over who might have been behind the robbery, with investigators looking into suggestions that it could have been anyone from scrap metal dealers to Holocaust deniers, from rightwing collectors of Nazi memorabilia to pre-Christmas pranksters.Tonight they were still no closer to solving the mystery.Police believe a gang was responsible for the robbery because it had apparently been carefully carried out with the perpetrators avoiding attracting the attention of nightwatchmen or being caught on CCTV cameras.They confirmed that the sign had been unscrewed on one side and pulled off with some force on the other. Sniffer dogs brought to the scene have led police to believe the sign was removed from the camp compound through a hole in the fence before being loaded into a van. After that any trail of the thieves has been lost.Authorities in the region announced a state of emergency as the hunt for the sign was launched and a nationwide appeal went out urging anyone with any information to contact police. A 5,000 zloty (\u00a31,000) reward was being offered to anyone with information that would lead to the criminals or the whereabouts of the sign. Police were today replaying hours of video footage from the CCTV cameras at the Auschwitz site, which is now a museum.The Polish ambassador to Israel, Agnieszka Magdziak-Miszewska, said that it was believed the robbery had been \"meticulously planned, because they were not caught on security cameras\". She added: \"Finding the metal sign has become a national priority.\"Approximately 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, died in Auschwitz which was built in Nazi-occupied Poland. About 500 acres of the former death camp was turned into a museum after the end of the war.The Arbeit Macht Frei sign was erected by prisoners with metalwork skills on Nazi orders in June 1940, and was a cynical take on the title of an 1873 work by the lexicographer, linguist and novelist Lorenz Diefenbach in which gamblers and fraudsters discover the path to virtue through hard work.Museum officials have placed a replica of the sign above the gates which was used several years ago while the original was being repaired.\u2022 This article was amended on Monday 21 December 2009 to correct the spelling of O\u015bwi\u0119cim.

A spokesman for the Auschwitz museum, Pawel Sawicki, called the theft a \"desecration\" and said it was shocking that the tragic history of the site did not stop the thieves. In Brussels, the European parliament president, Jerry Burzek, appealed for the sign to be returned \"out of respect for the suffering of over a million victims\".Another museum spokesman, Jaroslaw Mensfelt, said the thieves carried the sign 300 metres to an opening in a barbed-wire gap in a concrete wall. The opening had been left intentionally to preserve a poplar tree dating back to the time of the war.Fifty criminal investigators and a sniffer dog were sent to the grounds of the vast former death camp, where barracks, watchtowers and the ruins of gas chambers stand as testament to the atrocities inflicted by Nazi Germany on Jews, Gypsies and others.The sniffer dog led police to a spot outside the wall where the sign left an imprint in freshly fallen snow, then to a roadside where the sign appeared to have been loaded on to a getaway vehicle. A 5,000-zloty (\u00a31,000) reward has been offered to anyone who can help track down the perpetrators.Padlo said there were no suspects but police were pursuing several theories.Another police spokesman told TVP Info television: \"The whole area is under surveillance. There are many cameras there. We are now analysing the film. I hope we will find the trail.\"Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance centre in Jerusalem, told Reuters the theft was \"an attack on the memory of the Holocaust\". Noach Flug, president of the International Auschwitz Committee in Jerusalem, said it \"deeply unsettles the survivors\" and the sign \"has to be found\".Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said the thieves were guilty of desecrating a site of immense importance.\"If they are pranksters, they'd have to be sick pranksters, or someone with a political agenda. But whoever has done it has desecrated world memory,\" he said.\"Auschwitz has to stand intact because without it, we are without the world's greatest physical reminder of what we are capable of doing to each other.\"Sawicki said the museum authorities had already replaced the sign with a replica, which was used briefly a few years ago when the original was being repaired.The original sign was made in the summer of 1940 by non-Jewish Polish inmates of Auschwitz in an iron workshop at the camp. After occupying Poland in 1939, the Nazis established the Auschwitz I camp in the southern Polish city of Oswiecim and initially used it for German political prisoners and non-Jewish Polish prisoners.\"We believe that the perpetrators will be found soon and the inscription will be returned to its place,\" said Sawicki.The slogan \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" was used at the entrances to other Nazi camps, including Dachau and Sachsenhausen, but the long, curving sign at Auschwitz is perhaps the best known.More than a million people visit the Auschwitz site every year, but the barracks and other structures are in a state of disrepair and Polish authorities have been struggling to find the funds to carry out conservation work.

Demjanjuk's lawyer, Ulrich Busch, said his client would exercise his right to remain silent.At one point, the judge, Ralph Alt, interrupted a lawyer when Demjanjuk was heard to mumble. \"Herr Demjanjuk wants to say something,\" he said.But the defendant's Ukrainian translator, who had been whispering translation of the proceedings into his left ear, replied: \"No, he's just praying\". Demjanjuk then appeared to cross himself.A 10-page charge sheet was read out by the state prosecutor, Hans Joachim Lutz.It described how people were transported to Sobibor in trainloads and \"could have been shot at at any time\" during the journey.He said Demjanjuk had \"mercilessly and callously\" helped other guards and SS soldiers to drive people into the gas chambers \"because he himself wanted their deaths, believing, too, in the racist ideology behind it.\"The slow-moving trial was again delayed following the repeat of a request from Busch that the case be thrown out.The lawyer called Demjanjuk's deportation from his adopted home in Cleveland, Ohio, to Germany in May \"illegal\", and asked why it had taken 30 years to bring the case to court if the evidence against him was so compelling.Demjanjuk tops the list of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's most wanted Nazis.He is believed to have been one of around 150 Soviet war prisoners recruited as camp guards at Sobibor between spring 1942 and October 1943, when 250,000 Jews were murdered.Most of the victims perished within an hour of arriving at the camp.Demjanjuk, who suffers from a low-risk form of a bone marrow illness and other ailments, has been deemed fit to stand trial by three doctors.Individual sessions are being limited to between 90 minutes and two hours in length.Efraim Zuroff, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, said he was concerned that the first day of the trial had been dominated by an assessment of Demjanjuk's state of health.\"We didn't hear anything about Sobibor, only about his ailments,\" he said.", "tags": ["Second world war", "Holocaust", "War crimes", "Germany", "Poland", "Europe"], "title": "Death camp survivors weep at trial of 89-year-old Nazi suspect"},{"date": "2009-12-19T10:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In 2008 Poznan's mayor invited me to prepare a public art project for the city. I decided to transform a disused industrial chimney in an area which reminded me of the Middle East into a minaret, a project which has taken on new significance in the light of the Swiss referendum this month.The chimney stands within the line of sight of a former synagogue \u2013 now a swimming baths belonging to the Jewish municipality \u2013 and the Catholic Basilica on Ostrow Tumski Island between the Warta and Cybina rivers.I chose the form of the minaret because I know it well from working in the West Bank town of Jenin in Palestine. I was able to replicate one of Jenin's minarets, using similar materials and copying the craftsmanship of its wrought-iron balustrades and detailed stone finish.My aim was to allow this run-down fragment of Poznan to become a mirage of the Middle East. I wanted to convey to the residents of Poznan, not just my own enchantment with Middle Eastern culture, but also to ask them a question: are you ready to accept a foreign element \u2013 of another religion, ethnicity and culture \u2013 in your midst?In that packed hall in Poznan, I came to understand that realising this project was essential. In the summer of 2009, my team, with the support of the Malta foundation, presented the minaret proposal to the public. The public response has sparked two ongoing campaigns of those vehemently for and against the project.The Muslim League of Poland rallied behind us, with leader Sheikh Mohamed Saleh explaining that \"Minaret' is just a building and has no religious meaning. But we support this project because Muslims live and study, heal the sick in hospitals, and run businesses here. We contribute a lot to Poland and yet still we are unseen. Maybe 'Minaret' will compensate for our invisibility.\"Nevertheless, local architects and councillors were opposed, arguing that the project was \"culturally foreign\", and due to its visibility within the line of sight of a cathedral and former Synagogue, it could be read as a \"religious provocation\".Heated debates ensued, reaching boiling point at times as Poland's right wing waded in voicing opinions such as \"'Minaret' is a symbol of a religion which has denied both our culture and basic human rights for 1400 years.\" I received personal threats, with some critics telling me, \"Don't you go bringing us Islam to Europe. We don't need this religion of hate here.\"According to a survey by the right-wing Fronda newspaper, 70% of Poznan's residents reject the minaret project. Comments on Fronda's website include, \"Lets not make the same mistakes as other European towns, and lets not make any concessions. We are resolutely opposed to minarets, mosques, terrorism, barbarianism as well as religious intolerance.\"Those supporting the project have been just as vocal. The Malta foundation protested that \"Project 'Minaret' is a symbolic gesture revealing the reality of Poland. Poznan is not a closed homogenous zone where anything different crossing its borders is 'a foreign cultural element' and therefore damaging and threatening.\"I paraphrase the analysis of the Polish edition of Le Monde Diplomatique which has campaigned for the project. It observed that we cannot separate the little war over the minaret in Poznan from the real wars Poland is waging in lands of minarets thousands of miles away. Perhaps the key to understanding the reaction to my project is the fact that it implicitly reminds us of our participation in occupations and military aggression against Muslim countries today.A society that continues to consider its self an unrecognised victim of historical defeats denies consciousness of the fact that for years it has been acting on the side of history's victors: torturers, occupiers and aggressors. The truth of our \"stablisation\" missions in Iraq and Afghanistan would be hard to accept had we not built ourselves a security wall out of ignorance and hate. The campaign to demolish the minaret before it has even been built is based on arguments designed to reinforce this wall of ignorance.", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "Religion", "Islam", "Europe"], "title": "Building my own 'minaret' | Joanna Rajkowska"},{"date": "2009-11-04T09:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Five years ago, I administered CPR to an old gent who had collapsed on a train with a heart attack. Later, I learned that he was an Auschwitz survivor named Antoni Kolodziejczyk; the number 138048 was tattooed on his left forearm. When he recovered, he spoke to me of wartime memories that he had rarely shared before, even with his own family. That experience meant a lot to me, and so did the words of the chief rabbi of Poland last week.Who could Rabbi Michael Schudrich, a smart and feisty New Yorker, have been talking about when he protested against the \"grotesque distortion\" of his words for political gain in the UK? Why did he feel the need to intervene and say it is wrong to play on a false stereotype of Poles as antisemites? Did he have in mind certain Labour politicians, and journalists at the New Statesman and the Guardian?Of course, he did. The chief rabbi identified an element of the British left that has propagated a smear campaign accusing a Tory ally, Polish MEP Michal Kaminski, of antisemitism. By association, it has been implied that Kaminski's Law and Justice party and its voters are extremist, far-right or even neo-Nazi. None of these labels fit: that party can only be described as staunchly conservative, or nationalist conservative at worst.I have never voted for the Tories and Michal Kaminski is not a friend of mine. His party is far too suspicious of market economics and is also far too Eurosceptic, for my liking. I disagree with its views on lifestyle and social policy. So I have no reason to exonerate Kaminski whatsoever. But I do know this charge of antisemitism against Kaminski came after preparation in the UK for a negative PR operation against Law and Justice. On my desk is a copy of the 15-page plan of attack against the Tories' Polish allies that circulated Whitehall this summer. I've been asked not to publish it, and source anonymity should be protected. But I am convinced its content is as vacuous as the \"dodgy dossier\", the cooked-up intelligence that took us into Iraq.Some on the British left have made one-sided assertions about the history of eastern Europe, and have cast Polish or Tory attempts to reveal the whole truth with all its nuances as hair-splitting about the Holocaust. And journalists have amplified rather than scrutinised the demagoguery of David Miliband.All this manipulation, I have been told, is justifiable because it is a way of attacking the Tories. I beg to differ. There is no excuse for demonising an entire ethnic group, in this case the Poles, because it might save a few Labour MPs their jobs at the next election.Some commentators have said this has been a Labour ploy to win over the British Jewish vote, by stirring up fear of Polish antisemitism. But people who really care about gentile-Jewish relations know there is a tremendous Jewish revival underway in Poland, and the country is clearly identifying and denouncing crimes against Jews.Poland is also investigating alleged Jewish collaboration with the Soviets, a notion many British people seem to assume must be an antisemitic conspiracy theory on a par with the blood libel. Certainly, the stereotype of Jewish Bolshevism has been used in an attempt to justify race hate. But if dealt with fairly and accurately, this subject needn't be any more taboo than the culpability of Polish gentiles in the Soviet-backed regime and at the pogroms of Jedwabne, Kielce and others.When Stalin and Hitler divided Poland in 1939, the Soviets took more territory than the Nazis did. At first, Polish Jews in the Soviet partition were naturally relieved and grateful that they would not be under Nazi oppression. By contrast, many Polish gentiles immediately viewed the Soviets as invading enemies. This is when the seam between Polish Jews and Polish gentiles was sundered. The Soviets conducted a policy of social engineering, sometimes offering poor Jews among others the positions that established Polish gentiles had once had before they were deported to the Gulags. Some Polish Jews betrayed their country and served the Soviets, as some Polish gentiles also did. There were unforgivable gentile reprisals against Jews punished because of guilt by association. When discussing this volatile subject, it is wrong to stereotype Polish Jews as pro-Soviet, but it is equally wrong to say questions about Polish-Jewish collaboration with the Soviets are necessarily antisemitic.While antisemitism exists in Poland, as it does in the UK, more and more Jews are discovering their Polish roots, while many Polish gentiles are discovering their Jewish roots too. Moreover, ever more research is showing us that Poland's pre-war gentile and Jewish communities were far more united than popular myth has led people to believe.Some 120,000 Polish Jews served in the Polish army at the start of the second world war, and defended their country against the joint Soviet-Nazi invasion of 1939. At the Katyn forest massacre of the Polish elite, the Soviets executed at least 600 Jews who were Polish army officers. Among them, the chief rabbi of the Polish army, Major Baruch Steinberg, was shot in the back of the head by a Soviet bullet. His body was slung in a mass grave next to the bodies of his Polish gentile countrymen. The motivations were different, but it is quite possible that as many Polish Jews were murdered at the massacre at Katyn as were murdered at the massacre at Jedwabne.Ignoring these facts prompts the slightly confusing thesis that the Jedwabne pogrom can be compared to what the Nazis did in the Holocaust. But Stalin's crimes cannot be compared to Hitler's. In case anyone has forgotten, Nazi Germany killed up to 3 million Polish citizens who were gentiles, 3 million Polish citizens who were Jews, and 3 million Jews from outside Poland. Some Polish gentiles saved Jewish lives; some Polish gentiles betrayed Jews. A far greater proportion of the Polish Jewish community was wiped out than the Polish gentile community.During the war, the Polish government in exile, which included Jews in its cabinet, passed a Polish intelligence report to their British allies. In it, the Poles informed the British about the Nazi German gas chambers, and requested an RAF air strike on the train lines. Churchill ignored the Polish request to save tens of thousands of Jews from death at Auschwitz. One wonders whether David Miliband will ever see fit to apologise for that on behalf of Britain, and whether it would be antisemitic of him to oppose the apology.One of the main charges against Kaminski, of course, is that he opposed Poland's 2001 apology for the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, in which a mob of around 40 Polish gentiles, in the presence of German police, murdered at least 300 Polish Jews. Kaminski said that asking for an apology would be as wrong as asking Polish Jews to apologise for their collaboration with the Soviets and their crimes against Polish gentiles.In my view, Kaminski was wrong to oppose that apology, which was intended as an act of reconciliation rather than a suggestion that the entire Polish nation had participated in the Holocaust. The point is, many Poles view Jedwabne a criminal act against fellow Polish citizens carried out by a small but vicious rabble who betrayed the core Polish value of anti-Nazism. Those 40 pogromists have always been viewed as traitors in Poland.Kaminski was wrong to oppose the apology, and his analogy was offensive. But according to the chief rabbi, Kaminski has put his teenage extremism behind him and he is not an antisemite.Polish people, including the million-strong Polish community in Britain, are deeply proud that Poland never produced a collaborationist regime, nor home-grown SS units, as happened elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe. Poland also resisted the savagery of the Soviet Union long before the Western allies did. So, for many Poles, there has never been a choice between fascism and communism \u2013 their country is characterised by its defiance against totalitarianism in all its forms.Today, even as Poles challenge the stereotype of Polish antisemitism, many have the courage to depict incidents of Polish wrongdoing against Jews with total clarity; and they show how strongly they object to cowardly anti-Polish slurs. Slowly but surely, Poles are defining themselves not by the suffering of the forefathers, but by their courage.Both Miliband and Kaminski are political opportunists, and their simplistic comments get in the way of genuine understanding.

If a delivery of new shoes appeared in a shop window, you just bought a pair whether they were the right size or not.She laughs: \"Everything was grey and ugly. When I think about my youth, it was all about trying to make things a bit more pretty and colourful.\"It's incredible how people lived. They were bugging the phones, you couldn't talk to people, you never knew who was listening to you or would use something against you. But nowadays we've forgotten all that. It's like history, not part of your life any more.\"There is still, of course, plenty of greyness and ugliness in Poland. But 20 years after the fall of the wall, a revolution set in train in Warsaw 10 months earlier in 1989, Marta and her generation are too pushy, too busy, and too absorbed in their successful young lives and careers to sit around pondering politics or wondering how they got here.\"I know that Poland has changed incredibly. But for me it's been more to do with technology, mobile phones and the internet. Solidarity? I don't even know how the change in the political situation came.\"It came in February 1989, via the \"round table\", the historic compromise struck by dissidents and ruling communists that ushered in a bloodless revolution and set the template for the liberation of the rest of Soviet Europe, a unique and triumphant dismantling of dictatorship peacefully that climaxed at the wall on a cold and damp Thursday evening 20 years ago this week.The result two decades on, according to Adam Michnik, a giant of the revolution and one of the architects of the round table pact, is the most successful Poland in 300 years. The same might be said about the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, all in Nato, all in the European Union, and all in the throes of a huge catch-up exercise in modernisation driven by the transfers of tens of billions of euros from western to eastern Europe.\"You have a curious combination of external security and internal democratic order with a modest but successful economic system,\" says Andrzej Rychard, director of Warsaw's centre for social sciences. \"That hasn't happened that often in the history of this country.\"The change has been wrenching, its speed dizzying. Andrzej, who did not want his surname disclosed, is another whose life chances have been transformed. His father was a farmer from the rural east who came to Warsaw to work on the building sites. Andrzej is 41, a successful and wealthy tax consultant employing 20 people and advising \"high-value clients\". His 13-year-old son is privately educated and has all the latest gadgets and toys. Despite his success, Andrzej is less than satisfied.\"We're the lucky generation. From my perspective, things look good,\" he says. \"But there's not too much positive in what has happened. The whole history of privatisation has been an exercise in robbery. The old system was a nightmare, but this is not a democracy.\"The grumbling is echoed in opinion polls across the region. A survey of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians last week from Warsaw's Institute of Public Affairs found a solid majority, except among the eternally gloomy Hungarians, satisfied with the \"transformation\" of the past two decades, but a sizeable minority frustrated.While between 53% and 68% of Slovaks, Poles and Czechs believed life had improved, 65% of Hungarians thought things were no better or worse.\"It's surprising how many are not so enthusiastic about democracy,\" said Malgorzata Falkowska-Warska, a researcher at the institute.The social scientists also conducted a focus group of young people and were even more surprised to find a strong degree of cynicism about the drama of the past two decades. \"We were shocked that the young were very ambivalent about the advantages of freedom and democracy. We expected them to be much more idealistic,\" says Falkowska-Warska.One of the big benefits of the relatively new-found liberties, repeatedly mentioned, has been the freedom to travel. But the wanderlust, paradoxically, is also one of the most disturbing factors. The freedom to travel has prompted the most extraordinary exodus of modern times.Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, some 2.3 million young Poles have left, not all at the same time, some coming and going, but with the vast majority staying away. They are overwhelmingly from the depressed small towns and villages of eastern and southern Poland. As soon as they could, they voted with their feet. Most have not returned and are putting down roots in Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Germany and elsewhere. Analysts have been shocked by its scale.\"No one expected the emigration to be so huge because there's no need to escape from this country any more. They weren't persecuted. They left a free country,\" says Krystyna Iglicka, one of Poland's leading demographers.Statistics show that around one in five of the post-1989 generation in the active and productive age group of 21-35 have moved abroad. \"This might be a win-win situation for the UK and Ireland, filling the needs of the low-skilled labour market but it is not for us,\" Iglicka adds. \"We thought the migration would be circular, people coming back \u2026 I call this a lost generation.\"Andrzej, the wealthy tax adviser, is angry at the exodus. \"These young people feel that going to the UK is the biggest achievement they can imagine. But that's not success. Why don't they stay and do something in Poland?\"He is also anxious that being part of a united Europe is not necessarily good. \"The EU influences the style of life here, promoting certain values such as homosexuality that are not natural in Poland.\"Luke Pelletier shrugs at such prejudice. \"I love Warsaw, it's a very, very easy place to live,\" says the Parisian gay man who has lived in Poland for 14 years and is happy with the decent living he makes as a drag queen. Pelletier is in a civil partnership with Trevor, a black South African who grew up in London. Despite Poland's occasional reputation for homophobia, neither have any big complaints.Marta, the young businesswoman, says she would not dream of living anywhere but Warsaw. When the wall came down and the world opened up, Marta, her mother, Monika, and her grandmother, Tereza, went to Canada to visit relatives. It was their first trip to the west. \"It was amazing, so thrilling. They had everything in Canada we didn't have. If I could have stayed, I would have,\" says Monika.It is one fundamental measure of the changes that such notions now seem bizarre. She has been back and forth to Canada ever since and two months ago the 48-year-old remarried.Her new husband is a Canadian who is giving up his job to move to Warsaw. \"Now I wouldn't like to live in Canada,\" says Monika. \"Every time I go there, I don't even think about it.\"\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 10 November.

The Tories were furious about the remarks and the party leader, David Cameron, demanded Miliband retract his comments, which he has refused to do.Speaking about Kaminski, Schudrich said: \"I certainly see him as a man that today, today, is against antisemitism\", adding that Law and Justice was not a \"fringe right party\".The row broke out when the New Statesman headlined a story \"Jewish leaders turn on Tories\" in which Schudrich was quoted in an email saying: \"It is clear that Mr Kaminski was a member of the NOP [National Revival of Poland], a group that is openly far-right and neo-Nazi.\"Schudrich later complained he had been misrepresented so the magazine changed the article's headline online but noted that the chief rabbi had not retracted his comments.Schudrich told BBC Radio 4's Today programme today that Kaminski was a \"complicated person\" who he acknowledged had been a member of the NOP as a teenager, but he now regarded Kaminski as a \"serious ally to the state of Israel\". Explaining why the politician now enjoyed his confidence, Schudrich said: \"He has become a strong ally of the state of Israel and on other occasions has condemned antisemitism.\"So what we have here is a complicated person, and we need to be able to understand him in a fuller context, not taking on things he said but taking a look at what he has said over the past 20 years.\"However, Schudrich refused to condone Kaminski's membership of the NOP, which he described as \"problematic\", and said he completely disagreed with Kaminski's opposition to a state apology for the massacre of hundreds of Jews in German-occupied Jedwabne in 1941.Miliband is still refusing to modify his analysis. Responding to Schudrich's decision to contest the article from which he was quoting when he attacked Kaminski at the party conference, he said Schudrich was only quibbling with the headline of the New

"poland", "content": " A state of emergency was announced in Poland today involving tightened border controls and random police checks as a nationwide hunt was launched for the infamous bronze sign to the former German Nazi death camp Auschwitz after it was stolen.The discovery this morning that the sign had been wrenched from the top of the entrance gate posts prompted international reactions of outrage from Washington to London and urgent calls for its return.The sign, cast by camp prisoners, which offered the cynical welcome to new inmates \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" (work sets you free) and stands as a potent symbol of the suffering millions endured at the camp, is believed to have been removed by a gang in what authorities called a meticulously planned robbery.Katarzyna Padlo, spokeswoman for police in O\u015bwi\u0119cim, (the Polish name for Auschwitz) in south-eastern Poland, said: \"We believe the sign was stolen between 3.30am and 5am when museum guards first noticed it was missing and called the police.\"Scores of Polish police were put on the case to investigate the whereabouts of the sign.Border patrol police were told to be on the lookout for the 5m-long heavy cast-iron plaque that had spanned the entrance gate, over fears that there might have been plans to take it out of the country.The news of the sign's disappearance triggered impassioned calls for its return.Shimon Peres, president of Israel, discussed the theft with Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, in Copenhagen today. \"The state of Israel and the Jewish people in their entirety ask that you take the necessary steps to catch the criminals and return the sign to its place,\" he told Tusk. \"The sign is of profound historical significance both for the Jewish people and the entire world.\"Avner Shalev, president of Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel, said: \"This is an attack on the remembrance of the Holocaust,\" referring to those responsible as \"certain elements who want to take us back to the dark days\".Jaroslaw Mensfeld, a historian and spokesman for Auschwitz, called the incident \"shameful\" and said it amounted to the \"desecration of a place in which more than a million people were murdered\".Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust in the UK, said she was disgusted by the robbery, which she called an \"appalling act of vandalism [that showed] gross disregard to all Holocaust survivors and the families of those who lost loved ones there.\"The Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau stands as a universal symbol of the Holocaust and for millions of victims the sign represented the cynical cruelty of Nazi rule.\"Poland's parliament said the recovery of the sign was being treated as a matter of urgency. \"This is regretful and embarrassing,\" said Bogdan Borusewicz, chairman of the second parliamentary chamber of the Polish senate. \"I just hope they don't destroy the plaque.\"Andrzej Przewoznik, minister with responsibility for the protection of historical monuments, said: \"This is an act of vandalism that knows no equal.\"There was widespread speculation over who might have been behind the robbery, with investigators looking into suggestions that it could have been anyone from scrap metal dealers to Holocaust deniers, from rightwing collectors of Nazi memorabilia to pre-Christmas pranksters.Tonight they were still no closer to solving the mystery.Police believe a gang was responsible for the robbery because it had apparently been carefully carried out with the perpetrators avoiding attracting the attention of nightwatchmen or being caught on CCTV cameras.They confirmed that the sign had been unscrewed on one side and pulled off with some force on the other. Sniffer dogs brought to the scene have led police to believe the sign was removed from the camp compound through a hole in the fence before being loaded into a van. After that any trail of the thieves has been lost.Authorities in the region announced a state of emergency as the hunt for the sign was launched and a nationwide appeal went out urging anyone with any information to contact police. A 5,000 zloty (\u00a31,000) reward was being offered to anyone with information that would lead to the criminals or the whereabouts of the sign. Police were today replaying hours of video footage from the CCTV cameras at the Auschwitz site, which is now a museum.The Polish ambassador to Israel, Agnieszka Magdziak-Miszewska, said that it was believed the robbery had been \"meticulously planned, because they were not caught on security cameras\". She added: \"Finding the metal sign has become a national priority.\"Approximately 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, died in Auschwitz which was built in Nazi-occupied Poland. About 500 acres of the former death camp was turned into a museum after the end of the war.The Arbeit Macht Frei sign was erected by prisoners with metalwork skills on Nazi orders in June 1940, and was a cynical take on the title of an 1873 work by the lexicographer, linguist and novelist Lorenz Diefenbach in which gamblers and fraudsters discover the path to virtue through hard work.Museum officials have placed a replica of the sign above the gates which was used several years ago while the original was being repaired.\u2022 This article was amended on Monday 21 December 2009 to correct the spelling of O\u015bwi\u0119cim.

A spokesman for the Auschwitz museum, Pawel Sawicki, called the theft a \"desecration\" and said it was shocking that the tragic history of the site did not stop the thieves. In Brussels, the European parliament president, Jerry Burzek, appealed for the sign to be returned \"out of respect for the suffering of over a million victims\".Another museum spokesman, Jaroslaw Mensfelt, said the thieves carried the sign 300 metres to an opening in a barbed-wire gap in a concrete wall. The opening had been left intentionally to preserve a poplar tree dating back to the time of the war.Fifty criminal investigators and a sniffer dog were sent to the grounds of the vast former death camp, where barracks, watchtowers and the ruins of gas chambers stand as testament to the atrocities inflicted by Nazi Germany on Jews, Gypsies and others.The sniffer dog led police to a spot outside the wall where the sign left an imprint in freshly fallen snow, then to a roadside where the sign appeared to have been loaded on to a getaway vehicle. A 5,000-zloty (\u00a31,000) reward has been offered to anyone who can help track down the perpetrators.Padlo said there were no suspects but police were pursuing several theories.Another police spokesman told TVP Info television: \"The whole area is under surveillance. There are many cameras there. We are now analysing the film. I hope we will find the trail.\"Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance centre in Jerusalem, told Reuters the theft was \"an attack on the memory of the Holocaust\". Noach Flug, president of the International Auschwitz Committee in Jerusalem, said it \"deeply unsettles the survivors\" and the sign \"has to be found\".Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said the thieves were guilty of desecrating a site of immense importance.\"If they are pranksters, they'd have to be sick pranksters, or someone with a political agenda. But whoever has done it has desecrated world memory,\" he said.\"Auschwitz has to stand intact because without it, we are without the world's greatest physical reminder of what we are capable of doing to each other.\"Sawicki said the museum authorities had already replaced the sign with a replica, which was used briefly a few years ago when the original was being repaired.The original sign was made in the summer of 1940 by non-Jewish Polish inmates of Auschwitz in an iron workshop at the camp. After occupying Poland in 1939, the Nazis established the Auschwitz I camp in the southern Polish city of Oswiecim and initially used it for German political prisoners and non-Jewish Polish prisoners.\"We believe that the perpetrators will be found soon and the inscription will be returned to its place,\" said Sawicki.The slogan \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" was used at the entrances to other Nazi camps, including Dachau and Sachsenhausen, but the long, curving sign at Auschwitz is perhaps the best known.More than a million people visit the Auschwitz site every year, but the barracks and other structures are in a state of disrepair and Polish authorities have been struggling to find the funds to carry out conservation work. This week, Germany pledged \u20ac60m to an endowment that will fund long-term preservation work \u2013 half the amount that Auschwitz memorial museum officials say is needed.", "tags": ["Poland", "Second world war", "Germany", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Arbeit Macht Frei sign stolen from Auschwitz"},{"date": "2009-12-01T14:16:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Survivors of the Sobibor death camp and relatives of the Jewish prisoners killed there wept in court today as the names of some of the victims were read out in the trial of the 89-year-old accused of being part of the Nazi murder machine.On the second day of the trial of John Demjanjuk, accused of being accessory to the murder of 27,900 Jews at Sobibor, in Nazi-occupied eastern Poland, several co-plaintiffs sat with their heads in their hands as the names and the dates of their transport to the camp by train were listed.Demjanjuk was wheeled into the Munich court on a hospital stretcher.Dressed in a leather jacket and a blue baseball cap, and lying on his side so his back was turned to the public gallery for most of the morning session, he refused to participate in the proceedings. Demjanjuk's lawyer, Ulrich Busch, said his client would exercise his right to remain silent.At one point, the judge, Ralph Alt, interrupted a lawyer when Demjanjuk was heard to mumble. \"Herr Demjanjuk wants to say something,\" he said.But the defendant's Ukrainian translator, who had been whispering translation of the proceedings into his left ear, replied: \"No, he's just praying\". Demjanjuk then appeared to cross himself.A 10-page charge sheet was read out by the state prosecutor, Hans Joachim Lutz.It described how people were transported to Sobibor in trainloads and \"could have been shot at at any time\" during the journey.He said Demjanjuk had \"mercilessly and callously\" helped other guards and SS soldiers to drive people into the gas chambers \"because he himself wanted their deaths, believing, too, in the racist ideology behind it.\"The slow-moving trial was again delayed following the repeat of a request from Busch that the case be thrown out.The lawyer called Demjanjuk's deportation from his adopted home in Cleveland, Ohio, to Germany in May \"illegal\", and asked why it had taken 30 years to bring the case to court if the evidence against him was so compelling.Demjanjuk tops the list of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's most wanted Nazis.He is believed to have been one of around 150 Soviet war prisoners recruited as camp guards at Sobibor between spring 1942 and October 1943, when 250,000 Jews were murdered.Most of the victims perished within an hour of arriving at the camp.Demjanjuk, who suffers from a low-risk form of a bone marrow illness and other ailments, has been deemed fit to stand trial by three doctors.Individual sessions are being limited to between 90 minutes and two hours in length.Efraim Zuroff, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, said he was concerned that the first day of the trial had been dominated by an assessment of Demjanjuk's state of health.\"We didn't hear anything about Sobibor, only about his ailments,\" he said.", "tags": ["Second world war", "Holocaust", "War crimes", "Germany", "Poland", "Europe"], "title": "Death camp survivors weep at trial of 89-year-old Nazi suspect"},{"date": "2009-12-19T10:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In 2008 Poznan's mayor invited me to prepare a public art project for the city. I decided to transform a disused industrial chimney in an area which reminded me of the Middle East into a minaret, a project which has taken on new significance in the light of the Swiss referendum this month.The chimney stands within the line of sight of a former synagogue \u2013 now a swimming baths belonging to the Jewish municipality \u2013 and the Catholic Basilica on Ostrow Tumski Island between the Warta and Cybina rivers.I chose the form of the minaret because I know it well from working in the West Bank town of Jenin in Palestine. I was able to replicate one of Jenin's minarets, using similar materials and copying the craftsmanship of its wrought-iron balustrades and detailed stone finish.My aim was to allow this run-down fragment of Poznan to become a mirage of the Middle East. I wanted to convey to the residents of Poznan, not just my own enchantment with Middle Eastern culture, but also to ask them a question: are you ready to accept a foreign element \u2013 of another religion, ethnicity and culture \u2013 in your midst?In that packed hall in Poznan, I came to understand that realising this project was essential. In the summer of 2009, my team, with the support of the Malta foundation, presented the minaret proposal to the public. The public response has sparked two ongoing campaigns of those vehemently for and against the project.The Muslim League of Poland rallied behind us, with leader Sheikh Mohamed Saleh explaining that \"Minaret' is just a building and has no religious meaning. But we support this project because Muslims live and study, heal the sick in hospitals, and run businesses here. We contribute a lot to Poland and yet still we are unseen. Maybe 'Minaret' will compensate for our invisibility.\"Nevertheless, local architects and councillors were opposed, arguing that the project was \"culturally foreign\", and due to its visibility within the line of sight of a cathedral and former Synagogue, it could be read as a \"religious provocation\".Heated debates ensued, reaching boiling point at times as Poland's right wing waded in voicing opinions such as \"'Minaret' is a symbol of a religion which has denied both our culture and basic human rights for 1400 years.\" I received personal threats, with some critics telling me, \"Don't you go bringing us Islam to Europe. We don't need this religion of hate here.\"According to a survey by the right-wing Fronda newspaper, 70% of Poznan's residents reject the minaret project. Comments on Fronda's website include, \"Lets not make the same mistakes as other European towns, and lets not make any concessions. We are resolutely opposed to minarets, mosques, terrorism, barbarianism as well as religious intolerance.\"Those supporting the project have been just as vocal. The Malta foundation protested that \"Project 'Minaret' is a symbolic gesture revealing the reality of Poland. Poznan is not a closed homogenous zone where anything different crossing its borders is 'a foreign cultural element' and therefore damaging and threatening.\"I paraphrase the analysis of the Polish edition of Le Monde Diplomatique which has campaigned for the project. It observed that we cannot separate the little war over the minaret in Poznan from the real wars Poland is waging in lands of minarets thousands of miles away. Perhaps the key to understanding the reaction to my project is the fact that it implicitly reminds us of our participation in occupations and military aggression against Muslim countries today.A society that continues to consider its self an unrecognised victim of historical defeats denies consciousness of the fact that for years it has been acting on the side of history's victors: torturers, occupiers and aggressors. The truth of our \"stablisation\" missions in Iraq and Afghanistan would be hard to accept had we not built ourselves a security wall out of ignorance and hate. The campaign to demolish the minaret before it has even been built is based on arguments designed to reinforce this wall of ignorance.", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "Religion", "Islam", "Europe"], "title": "Building my own 'minaret' | Joanna Rajkowska"},{"date": "2009-11-09T20:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "I belong to a generation that liked to repeat the words of the 19th-century Russian writer Pyotr Chaadaev. \"I didn't learn to love my nation blindfolded, gagged and with my head lowered. I believe that a man can only be useful to his country when he can look at it clearly.\"This was something we often said to ourselves when our rebellion against the dictatorship in Poland seemed hopeless. We thought we would not live to see it gone, but still we refused the blindfold and the gag. We carried on protesting, as writers and intellectuals; in student actions, workers' strikes and demonstrations during religious festivals; and by founding the first opposition organisations. They called us troublemakers and bandits. But it turned out we were doing the right thing.The Workers' Defence Committee started in 1976 \u2013 after a wave of workers' protests \u2013 with just a few hundred people, scattered across Poland. By August 1980, after the great strikes of the Baltic and Silesia, it had become Solidarity, a movement that numbered several million people from every social class, a national confederation pushing for a free, independent and just Poland. It was driven underground \u2013 but not destroyed. Solidarity survived further years of dictatorship until, in 1989, it became an open partner in the new administration.It was in Poland that the Berlin Wall began to crumble. As 1989 dawned, the Polish people, and the Czechs, Slovaks, Romanians, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Estonians and Ukrainians \u2013 and Russians themselves \u2013 were all praying for the same thing: the collapse of the Soviet Union. This event would help not just us, but our Russian friends as well.Early in the year negotiations between Poland's communist regime and the Solidarity opposition began. Talks culminated in elections \u2013 only semi-democratic \u2013 on 4 June 1989. But something genuinely historic took place. For the first time, elections in a communist state led to the crushing defeat of the Communists. The opposition's victory - supported by the Catholic Church and the authority of John Paul II - was complete.But it was not this victory that made the world's headlines the following day. Instead it was the massacre of students demanding democracy in Tiananmen Square, in Beijing.Thus on the same day the world saw the two faces of communism, its two possible reactions when threatened. One regime, in Beijing, used the language of tanks and executions; the other, in Poland, chose instead the language of the ballot box, opening up a road to democracy and change that would soon reach the other nations of eastern and central Europe.It was in Poland that the first stones of the Berlin Wall started to crumble. ItPoland had overcome the curse of its own history, a history marked by partitions, which wiped our country off the political map of Europe; of tragic insurrections doomed to failure, and hundreds of thousands of victims of hopeless battles for freedom.We know that nothing in history ever has just one cause. Poland's change was also a result of the changes in Russia; of sensible US politics; of Pope John Paul II and the Catholic church; of the Afghan people, who opposed the Soviet invasion. And there was also the deep economic crisis in the Soviet Union itself.But I will never forget that it was the Poles who created the model for compromise between ruler and ruled, for a peaceful dismantling of dictatorship, and for an equally peaceful transition of power into the hands of those who had won in parliamentary elections.How Poland has changed in two decades. It has become a democratically lawful country with a healthy economy. For Poland, the last two decades have been the best in the last 300 years. And yet so many Poles today are deeply dissatisfied. Why?The great Russian writer Anton Chekhov wrote of his homeland: \"Under the banners of education, art and free expression, a type of toad and crocodile will come to power more frightful than anything that ever came out of Spain's Inquisition \u2013 a narrow-minded, self-righteous, overbearingly ambitious type, totally lacking in conscience. Charlatans and wolves in sheeps' clothing will be able to lie and dissemble to their heart's content.\" The Russian genius foresaw what happens to a nation when it acquires freedom after years of slavery. This is what has happened in the new post-communist democracies.In Poland, it was the workers in the great factories who won change, their strikes forcing the authorities to give way. But those same factories were also the first victims of the ensuing transformation. Modernised to compete in the marketplace, they cut their workforces. Instead of a miracle of freedom, people found themselves staring redundancy in the face.The revolutions of 1989 had not mentioned mass privatisation or social inequalities; or sudden growth in crime, corruption and mafia activity; or, worst of all, permanent unemployment. This was the reality of the post-communist period offered up to the Poles and their neighbours. Political freedom, a free-market economy, the end of censorship and the opening of borders, had not been enough to effect a balance. The destruction of a despotic regime had led not just to liberal democratic values \u2013 it had also marked the start of a wild rush for wealth. A people enslaved for decades, unable to measure the worth of their own work, instead began to seek instant miracles and gratification by applying the exigencies of brute force, cynicism and bribes.Of course, there has been change. A new generation of politicians has been created. Those who had previously been excluded from legitimate political and economic activity are its leaders today. But at the same time we have had to deal with the growth of corruption on a massive scale, and with unfulfilled promises about social progress. The chasm dividing rich and poor has deepened \u2013 the only difference is that many of the richest people today were prominent activists.In some post-communist countries an aggressive ethnic nationalism is on the rise. In others, religion is being used by those in power as an anti-democratic ideology, an instrument of intolerance and exclusion. Post-communist transformation creates not just winners, but many losers: those who are unemployed, rejected, pushed into poverty. The often brutally greedy new elites are slow to learn democratic habits, respect for the law of the land, pluralism or tolerance.So our world is now one of open questions. We ask: what is the future for our democratic systems? And we are comforted to know that this same question is being asked throughout democratic Europe. Despite all the mistakes, blunders and scandals, Poland today \u2013 20 years on \u2013 is a normal, democratic European country. It's the kind of country I wanted my generation to bequeath to our children. Although, to tell the truth, I wish that it was a rather better one.", "tags": ["Berlin Wall", "Poland", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Solidarity under strain | Adam Michnik"},{"date": "2009-11-04T09:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Five years ago, I administered CPR to an old gent who had collapsed on a train with a heart attack. Later, I learned that he was an Auschwitz survivor named Antoni Kolodziejczyk; the number 138048 was tattooed on his left forearm. When he recovered, he spoke to me of wartime memories that he had rarely shared before, even with his own family. That experience meant a lot to me, and so did the words of the chief rabbi of Poland last week.Who could Rabbi Michael Schudrich, a smart and feisty New Yorker, have been talking about when he protested against the \"grotesque distortion\" of his words for political gain in the UK? Why did he feel the need to intervene and say it is wrong to play on a false stereotype of Poles as antisemites? Did he have in mind certain Labour politicians, and journalists at the New Statesman and the Guardian?Of course, he did. The chief rabbi identified an element of the British left that has propagated a smear campaign accusing a Tory ally, Polish MEP Michal Kaminski, of antisemitism. By association, it has been implied that Kaminski's Law and Justice party and its voters are extremist, far-right or even neo-Nazi. None of these labels fit: that party can only be described as staunchly conservative, or nationalist conservative at worst.I have never voted for the Tories and Michal Kaminski is not a friend of mine. His party is far too suspicious of market economics and is also far too Eurosceptic, for my liking. I disagree with its views on lifestyle and social policy. So I have no reason to exonerate Kaminski whatsoever. But I do know this charge of antisemitism against Kaminski came after preparation in the UK for a negative PR operation against Law and Justice. On my desk is a copy of the 15-page plan of attack against the Tories' Polish allies that circulated Whitehall this summer. I've been asked not to publish it, and source anonymity should be protected. But I am convinced its content is as vacuous as the \"dodgy dossier\", the cooked-up intelligence that took us into Iraq.Some on the British left have made one-sided assertions about the history of eastern Europe, and have cast Polish or Tory attempts to reveal the whole truth with all its nuances as hair-splitting about the Holocaust. And journalists have amplified rather than scrutinised the demagoguery of David Miliband.All this manipulation, I have been told, is justifiable because it is a way of attacking the Tories. I beg to differ. There is no excuse for demonising an entire ethnic group, in this case the Poles, because it might save a few Labour MPs their jobs at the next election.Some commentators have said this has been a Labour ploy to win over the British Jewish vote, by stirring up fear of Polish antisemitism. But people who really care about gentile-Jewish relations know there is a tremendous Jewish revival underway in Poland, and the country is clearly identifying and denouncing crimes against Jews.Poland is also investigating alleged Jewish collaboration with the Soviets, a notion many British people seem to assume must be an antisemitic conspiracy theory on a par with the blood libel. Certainly, the stereotype of Jewish Bolshevism has been used in an attempt to justify race hate. But if dealt with fairly and accurately, this subject needn't be any more taboo than the culpability of Polish gentiles in the Soviet-backed regime and at the pogroms of Jedwabne, Kielce and others.When Stalin and Hitler divided Poland in 1939, the Soviets took more territory than the Nazis did. At first, Polish Jews in the Soviet partition were naturally relieved and grateful that they would not be under Nazi oppression. By contrast, many Polish gentiles immediately viewed the Soviets as invading enemies. This is when the seam between Polish Jews and Polish gentiles was sundered. The Soviets conducted a policy of social engineering, sometimes offering poor Jews among others the positions that established Polish gentiles had once had before they were deported to the Gulags. Some Polish Jews betrayed their country and served the Soviets, as some Polish gentiles also did. There were unforgivable gentile reprisals against Jews punished because of guilt by association. When discussing this volatile subject, it is wrong to stereotype Polish Jews as pro-Soviet, but it is equally wrong to say questions about Polish-Jewish collaboration with the Soviets are necessarily antisemitic.While antisemitism exists in Poland, as it does in the UK, more and more Jews are discovering their Polish roots, while many Polish gentiles are discovering their Jewish roots too. Moreover, ever more research is showing us that Poland's pre-war gentile and Jewish communities were far more united than popular myth has led people to believe.Some 120,000 Polish Jews served in the Polish army at the start of the second world war, and defended their country against the joint Soviet-Nazi invasion of 1939. At the Katyn forest massacre of the Polish elite, the Soviets executed at least 600 Jews who were Polish army officers. Among them, the chief rabbi of the Polish army, Major Baruch Steinberg, was shot in the back of the head by a Soviet bullet. His body was slung in a mass grave next to the bodies of his Polish gentile countrymen. The motivations were different, but it is quite possible that as many Polish Jews were murdered at the massacre at Katyn as were murdered at the massacre at Jedwabne.Ignoring these facts prompts the slightly confusing thesis that the Jedwabne pogrom can be compared to what the Nazis did in the Holocaust. But Stalin's crimes cannot be compared to Hitler's. In case anyone has forgotten, Nazi Germany killed up to 3 million Polish citizens who were gentiles, 3 million Polish citizens who were Jews, and 3 million Jews from outside Poland. Some Polish gentiles saved Jewish lives; some Polish gentiles betrayed Jews. A far greater proportion of the Polish Jewish community was wiped out than the Polish gentile community.During the war, the Polish government in exile, which included Jews in its cabinet, passed a Polish intelligence report to their British allies. In it, the Poles informed the British about the Nazi German gas chambers, and requested an RAF air strike on the train lines. Churchill ignored the Polish request to save tens of thousands of Jews from death at Auschwitz. One wonders whether David Miliband will ever see fit to apologise for that on behalf of Britain, and whether it would be antisemitic of him to oppose the apology.One of the main charges against Kaminski, of course, is that he opposed Poland's 2001 apology for the 1941 Jedwabne pogrom, in which a mob of around 40 Polish gentiles, in the presence of German police, murdered at least 300 Polish Jews. Kaminski said that asking for an apology would be as wrong as asking Polish Jews to apologise for their collaboration with the Soviets and their crimes against Polish gentiles.In my view, Kaminski was wrong to oppose that apology, which was intended as an act of reconciliation rather than a suggestion that the entire Polish nation had participated in the Holocaust. The point is, many Poles view Jedwabne a criminal act against fellow Polish citizens carried out by a small but vicious rabble who betrayed the core Polish value of anti-Nazism. Those 40 pogromists have always been viewed as traitors in Poland.Kaminski was wrong to oppose the apology, and his analogy was offensive. But according to the chief rabbi, Kaminski has put his teenage extremism behind him and he is not an antisemite.Polish people, including the million-strong Polish community in Britain, are deeply proud that Poland never produced a collaborationist regime, nor home-grown SS units, as happened elsewhere in Nazi-occupied Europe. Poland also resisted the savagery of the Soviet Union long before the Western allies did. So, for many Poles, there has never been a choice between fascism and communism \u2013 their country is characterised by its defiance against totalitarianism in all its forms.Today, even as Poles challenge the stereotype of Polish antisemitism, many have the courage to depict incidents of Polish wrongdoing against Jews with total clarity; and they show how strongly they object to cowardly anti-Polish slurs. Slowly but surely, Poles are defining themselves not by the suffering of the forefathers, but by their courage.Both Miliband and Kaminski are political opportunists, and their simplistic comments get in the way of genuine understanding. We should be very cautious of them both.", "tags": ["Michal Kaminski", "Poland", "Race issues", "Religion", "Judaism", "The far right", "UK news", "David Miliband", "Europe"], "title": "Poland: prejudice and pride | Kamil Tchorek"},{"date": "2009-11-09T22:35:34Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Sitting with her daughter and granddaughter in one of Warsaw's poshest coffee shops, Tereza Sawerska dwells on Poland's 20th century. In the 1940s as a child she trudged the country lanes with her father in search of a bit of bread, stealing carrots from the fields as the Nazi occupation and slaughter engulfed Poland. In the 60s, as a young mother, she tramped miles across Warsaw through teargas and barricades to fetch her daughter from kindergarten as the hated riot police dealt with rebel students. In the 80s, the retired tax administrator kept her head down to survive communist martial law.\"People left home and did not return. We didn't know what happened to them,\" the 76-year-old recalled. \"If you said something random, you were in big trouble. Get beaten or sent to jail.\"Marta, her 24-year-old granddaughter, sighs impatiently. She's heard it all before. \"I've never known a Poland like this. It's all just history. I'm just happy I don't need to live in a world like that.\"Then Tereza summons a long-suppressed memory from the early 50s. She had a boyfriend at school. He took part in a protest against the Russians, then imposing Stalinism in Warsaw. The teenage boy vanished. \"They were arrested very quickly, taken to a terrible prison. He wrote me letters. But they were censored, bits blacked out.\"Monika and Marta, Tereza's daughter and granddaughter, turn damp-eyed at a little bit of family history they have never heard before.One country and one family. Three women, three generations, three Polands, exemplifying the change and social mobility wrought by the revolution symbolised by the fall of the wall.In recent years, Marta has been in Bangkok and Berlin, Cairo and Canada, London and Paris. She has her own firm teaching foreigners Polish and helping them set up some of the 1.7m businesses that have transformed Poland into one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing places in Europe, the only EU state not to dip into recession this year.Her grandmother's life spans Poland's authoritarian inter-war republic, 45 years of Soviet communism, and 20 years of independent democracy. Between the two of them, Monika, a 48-year-old divorced bank worker, says the communist years now seem like a distant bad dream. You couldn't buy toilet paper. There were ration cards, queues for bad sausage. If a delivery of new shoes appeared in a shop window, you just bought a pair whether they were the right size or not.She laughs: \"Everything was grey and ugly. When I think about my youth, it was all about trying to make things a bit more pretty and colourful.\"It's incredible how people lived. They were bugging the phones, you couldn't talk to people, you never knew who was listening to you or would use something against you. But nowadays we've forgotten all that. It's like history, not part of your life any more.\"There is still, of course, plenty of greyness and ugliness in Poland. But 20 years after the fall of the wall, a revolution set in train in Warsaw 10 months earlier in 1989, Marta and her generation are too pushy, too busy, and too absorbed in their successful young lives and careers to sit around pondering politics or wondering how they got here.\"I know that Poland has changed incredibly. But for me it's been more to do with technology, mobile phones and the internet. Solidarity? I don't even know how the change in the political situation came.\"It came in February 1989, via the \"round table\", the historic compromise struck by dissidents and ruling communists that ushered in a bloodless revolution and set the template for the liberation of the rest of Soviet Europe, a unique and triumphant dismantling of dictatorship peacefully that climaxed at the wall on a cold and damp Thursday evening 20 years ago this week.The result two decades on, according to Adam Michnik, a giant of the revolution and one of the architects of the round table pact, is the most successful Poland in 300 years. The same might be said about the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, all in Nato, all in the European Union, and all in the throes of a huge catch-up exercise in modernisation driven by the transfers of tens of billions of euros from western to eastern Europe.\"You have a curious combination of external security and internal democratic order with a modest but successful economic system,\" says Andrzej Rychard, director of Warsaw's centre for social sciences. \"That hasn't happened that often in the history of this country.\"The change has been wrenching, its speed dizzying. Andrzej, who did not want his surname disclosed, is another whose life chances have been transformed. His father was a farmer from the rural east who came to Warsaw to work on the building sites. Andrzej is 41, a successful and wealthy tax consultant employing 20 people and advising \"high-value clients\". His 13-year-old son is privately educated and has all the latest gadgets and toys. Despite his success, Andrzej is less than satisfied.\"We're the lucky generation. From my perspective, things look good,\" he says. \"But there's not too much positive in what has happened. The whole history of privatisation has been an exercise in robbery. The old system was a nightmare, but this is not a democracy.\"The grumbling is echoed in opinion polls across the region. A survey of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Hungarians last week from Warsaw's Institute of Public Affairs found a solid majority, except among the eternally gloomy Hungarians, satisfied with the \"transformation\" of the past two decades, but a sizeable minority frustrated.While between 53% and 68% of Slovaks, Poles and Czechs believed life had improved, 65% of Hungarians thought things were no better or worse.\"It's surprising how many are not so enthusiastic about democracy,\" said Malgorzata Falkowska-Warska, a researcher at the institute.The social scientists also conducted a focus group of young people and were even more surprised to find a strong degree of cynicism about the drama of the past two decades. \"We were shocked that the young were very ambivalent about the advantages of freedom and democracy. We expected them to be much more idealistic,\" says Falkowska-Warska.One of the big benefits of the relatively new-found liberties, repeatedly mentioned, has been the freedom to travel. But the wanderlust, paradoxically, is also one of the most disturbing factors. The freedom to travel has prompted the most extraordinary exodus of modern times.Since Poland joined the EU in 2004, some 2.3 million young Poles have left, not all at the same time, some coming and going, but with the vast majority staying away. They are overwhelmingly from the depressed small towns and villages of eastern and southern Poland. As soon as they could, they voted with their feet. Most have not returned and are putting down roots in Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Germany and elsewhere. Analysts have been shocked by its scale.\"No one expected the emigration to be so huge because there's no need to escape from this country any more. They weren't persecuted. They left a free country,\" says Krystyna Iglicka, one of Poland's leading demographers.Statistics show that around one in five of the post-1989 generation in the active and productive age group of 21-35 have moved abroad. \"This might be a win-win situation for the UK and Ireland, filling the needs of the low-skilled labour market but it is not for us,\" Iglicka adds. \"We thought the migration would be circular, people coming back \u2026 I call this a lost generation.\"Andrzej, the wealthy tax adviser, is angry at the exodus. \"These young people feel that going to the UK is the biggest achievement they can imagine. But that's not success. Why don't they stay and do something in Poland?\"He is also anxious that being part of a united Europe is not necessarily good. \"The EU influences the style of life here, promoting certain values such as homosexuality that are not natural in Poland.\"Luke Pelletier shrugs at such prejudice. \"I love Warsaw, it's a very, very easy place to live,\" says the Parisian gay man who has lived in Poland for 14 years and is happy with the decent living he makes as a drag queen. Pelletier is in a civil partnership with Trevor, a black South African who grew up in London. Despite Poland's occasional reputation for homophobia, neither have any big complaints.Marta, the young businesswoman, says she would not dream of living anywhere but Warsaw. When the wall came down and the world opened up, Marta, her mother, Monika, and her grandmother, Tereza, went to Canada to visit relatives. It was their first trip to the west. \"It was amazing, so thrilling. They had everything in Canada we didn't have. If I could have stayed, I would have,\" says Monika.It is one fundamental measure of the changes that such notions now seem bizarre. She has been back and forth to Canada ever since and two months ago the 48-year-old remarried.Her new husband is a Canadian who is giving up his job to move to Warsaw. \"Now I wouldn't like to live in Canada,\" says Monika. \"Every time I go there, I don't even think about it.\"\u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 10 November.

The Tories were furious about the remarks and the party leader, David Cameron, demanded Miliband retract his comments, which he has refused to do.Speaking about Kaminski, Schudrich said: \"I certainly see him as a man that today, today, is against antisemitism\", adding that Law and Justice was not a \"fringe right party\".The row broke out when the New Statesman headlined a story \"Jewish leaders turn on Tories\" in which Schudrich was quoted in an email saying: \"It is clear that Mr Kaminski was a member of the NOP [National Revival of Poland], a group that is openly far-right and neo-Nazi.\"Schudrich later complained he had been misrepresented so the magazine changed the article's headline online but noted that the chief rabbi had not retracted his comments.Schudrich told BBC Radio 4's Today programme today that Kaminski was a \"complicated person\" who he acknowledged had been a member of the NOP as a teenager, but he now regarded Kaminski as a \"serious ally to the state of Israel\". Explaining why the politician now enjoyed his confidence, Schudrich said: \"He has become a strong ally of the state of Israel and on other occasions has condemned antisemitism.\"So what we have here is a complicated person, and we need to be able to understand him in a fuller context, not taking on things he said but taking a look at what he has said over the past 20 years.\"However, Schudrich refused to condone Kaminski's membership of the NOP, which he described as \"problematic\", and said he completely disagreed with Kaminski's opposition to a state apology for the massacre of hundreds of Jews in German-occupied Jedwabne in 1941.Miliband is still refusing to modify his analysis.

"poland", "content": " A state of emergency was announced in Poland today involving tightened border controls and random police checks as a nationwide hunt was launched for the infamous bronze sign to the former German Nazi death camp Auschwitz after it was stolen.The discovery this morning that the sign had been wrenched from the top of the entrance gate posts prompted international reactions of outrage from Washington to London and urgent calls for its return.The sign, cast by camp prisoners, which offered the cynical welcome to new inmates \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" (work sets you free) and stands as a potent symbol of the suffering millions endured at the camp, is believed to have been removed by a gang in what authorities called a meticulously planned robbery.Katarzyna Padlo, spokeswoman for police in O\u015bwi\u0119cim, (the Polish name for Auschwitz) in south-eastern Poland, said: \"We believe the sign was stolen between 3.30am and 5am when museum guards first noticed it was missing and called the police.\"Scores of Polish police were put on the case to investigate the whereabouts of the sign.Border patrol police were told to be on the lookout for the 5m-long heavy cast-iron plaque that had spanned the entrance gate, over fears that there might have been plans to take it out of the country.The news of the sign's disappearance triggered impassioned calls for its return.Shimon Peres, president of Israel, discussed the theft with Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, in Copenhagen today. \"The state of Israel and the Jewish people in their entirety ask that you take the necessary steps to catch the criminals and return the sign to its place,\" he told Tusk. \"The sign is of profound historical significance both for the Jewish people and the entire world.\"Avner Shalev, president of Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel, said: \"This is an attack on the remembrance of the Holocaust,\" referring to those responsible as \"certain elements who want to take us back to the dark days\".Jaroslaw Mensfeld, a historian and spokesman for Auschwitz, called the incident \"shameful\" and said it amounted to the \"desecration of a place in which more than a million people were murdered\".Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust in the UK, said she was disgusted by the robbery, which she called an \"appalling act of vandalism [that showed] gross disregard to all Holocaust survivors and the families of those who lost loved ones there.\"The Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau stands as a universal symbol of the Holocaust and for millions of victims the sign represented the cynical cruelty of Nazi rule.\"Poland's parliament said the recovery of the sign was being treated as a matter of urgency. \"This is regretful and embarrassing,\" said Bogdan Borusewicz, chairman of the second parliamentary chamber of the Polish senate. \"I just hope they don't destroy the plaque.\"Andrzej Przewoznik, minister with responsibility for the protection of historical monuments, said: \"This is an act of vandalism that knows no equal.\"There was widespread speculation over who might have been behind the robbery, with investigators looking into suggestions that it could have been anyone from scrap metal dealers to Holocaust deniers, from rightwing collectors of Nazi memorabilia to pre-Christmas pranksters.Tonight they were still no closer to solving the mystery.Police believe a gang was responsible for the robbery because it had apparently been carefully carried out with the perpetrators avoiding attracting the attention of nightwatchmen or being caught on CCTV cameras.They confirmed that the sign had been unscrewed on one side and pulled off with some force on the other. Sniffer dogs brought to the scene have led police to believe the sign was removed from the camp compound through a hole in the fence before being loaded into a van. After that any trail of the thieves has been lost.Authorities in the region announced a state of emergency as the hunt for the sign was launched and a nationwide appeal went out urging anyone with any information to contact police. A 5,000 zloty (\u00a31,000) reward was being offered to anyone with information that would lead to the criminals or the whereabouts of the sign. Police were today replaying hours of video footage from the CCTV cameras at the Auschwitz site, which is now a museum.The Polish ambassador to Israel, Agnieszka Magdziak-Miszewska, said that it was believed the robbery had been \"meticulously planned, because they were not caught on security cameras\". She added: \"Finding the metal sign has become a national priority.\"Approximately 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, died in Auschwitz which was built in Nazi-occupied Poland. About 500 acres of the former death camp was turned into a museum after the end of the war.The Arbeit Macht Frei sign was erected by prisoners with metalwork skills on Nazi orders in June 1940, and was a cynical take on the title of an 1873 work by the lexicographer, linguist and novelist Lorenz Diefenbach in which gamblers and fraudsters discover the path to virtue through hard work.Museum officials have placed a replica of the sign above the gates which was used several years ago while the original was being repaired.\u2022 This article was amended on Monday 21 December 2009 to correct the spelling of O\u015bwi\u0119cim.

A spokesman for the Auschwitz museum, Pawel Sawicki, called the theft a \"desecration\" and said it was shocking that the tragic history of the site did not stop the thieves. In Brussels, the European parliament president, Jerry Burzek, appealed for the sign to be returned \"out of respect for the suffering of over a million victims\".Another museum spokesman, Jaroslaw Mensfelt, said the thieves carried the sign 300 metres to an opening in a barbed-wire gap in a concrete wall. The opening had been left intentionally to preserve a poplar tree dating back to the time of the war.Fifty criminal investigators and a sniffer dog were sent to the grounds of the vast former death camp, where barracks, watchtowers and the ruins of gas chambers stand as testament to the atrocities inflicted by Nazi Germany on Jews, Gypsies and others.The sniffer dog led police to a spot outside the wall where the sign left an imprint in freshly fallen snow, then to a roadside where the sign appeared to have been loaded on to a getaway vehicle. A 5,000-zloty (\u00a31,000) reward has been offered to anyone who can help track down the perpetrators.Padlo said there were no suspects but police were pursuing several theories.Another police spokesman told TVP Info television: \"The whole area is under surveillance.

But whoever has done it has desecrated world memory,\" he said.\"Auschwitz has to stand intact because without it, we are without the world's greatest physical reminder of what we are capable of doing to each other.\"Sawicki said the museum authorities had already replaced the sign with a replica, which was used briefly a few years ago when the original was being repaired.The original sign was made in the summer of 1940 by non-Jewish Polish inmates of Auschwitz in an iron workshop at the camp. After occupying Poland in 1939, the Nazis established the Auschwitz I camp in the southern Polish city of Oswiecim and initially used it for German political prisoners and non-Jewish Polish prisoners.\"We believe that the perpetrators will be found soon and the inscription will be returned to its place,\" said Sawicki.The slogan \"Arbeit Macht Frei\" was used at the entrances to other Nazi camps, including Dachau and Sachsenhausen, but the long, curving sign at Auschwitz is perhaps the best known.More than a million people visit the Auschwitz site every year, but the barracks and other structures are in a state of disrepair and Polish authorities have been struggling to find the funds to carry out conservation work.

Demjanjuk then appeared to cross himself.A 10-page charge sheet was read out by the state prosecutor, Hans Joachim Lutz.It described how people were transported to Sobibor in trainloads and \"could have been shot at at any time\" during the journey.He said Demjanjuk had \"mercilessly and callously\" helped other guards and SS soldiers to drive people into the gas chambers \"because he himself wanted their deaths, believing, too, in the racist ideology behind it.\"The slow-moving trial was again delayed following the repeat of a request from Busch that the case be thrown out.The lawyer called Demjanjuk's deportation from his adopted home in Cleveland, Ohio, to Germany in May \"illegal\", and asked why it had taken 30 years to bring the case to court if the evidence against him was so compelling.Demjanjuk tops the list of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre's most wanted Nazis.He is believed to have been one of around 150 Soviet war prisoners recruited as camp guards at Sobibor between spring 1942 and October 1943, when 250,000 Jews were murdered.Most of the victims perished within an hour of arriving at the camp.Demjanjuk, who suffers from a low-risk form of a bone marrow illness and other ailments, has been deemed fit to stand trial by three doctors.Individual sessions are being limited to between 90 minutes and two hours in length.Efraim Zuroff, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, said he was concerned that the first day of the trial had been dominated by an assessment of Demjanjuk's state of health.\"We didn't hear anything about Sobibor, only about his ailments,\" he said.", "tags": ["Second world war", "Holocaust", "War crimes", "Germany", "Poland", "Europe"], "title": "Death camp survivors weep at trial of 89-year-old Nazi suspect"},{"date": "2009-12-19T10:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In 2008 Poznan's mayor invited me to prepare a public art project for the city. I decided to transform a disused industrial chimney in an area which reminded me of the Middle East into a minaret, a project which has taken on new significance in the light of the Swiss referendum this month.The chimney stands within the line of sight of a former synagogue \u2013 now a swimming baths belonging to the Jewish municipality \u2013 and the Catholic Basilica on Ostrow Tumski Island between the Warta and Cybina rivers.I chose the form of the minaret because I know it well from working in the West Bank town of Jenin in Palestine. I was able to replicate one of Jenin's minarets, using similar materials and copying the craftsmanship of its wrought-iron balustrades and detailed stone finish.My aim was to allow this run-down fragment of Poznan to become a mirage of the Middle East. I wanted to convey to the residents of Poznan, not just my own enchantment with Middle Eastern culture, but also to ask them a question: are you ready to accept a foreign element \u2013 of another religion, ethnicity and culture \u2013 in your midst?In that packed hall in Poznan, I came to understand that realising this project was essential. In the summer of 2009, my team, with the support of the Malta foundation, presented the minaret proposal to the public. The public response has sparked two ongoing campaigns of those vehemently for and against the project.The Muslim League of Poland rallied behind us, with leader Sheikh Mohamed Saleh explaining that \"Minaret' is just a building and has no religious meaning. But we support this project because Muslims live and study, heal the sick in hospitals, and run businesses here. We contribute a lot to Poland and yet still we are unseen. Maybe 'Minaret' will compensate for our invisibility.\"Nevertheless, local architects and councillors were opposed, arguing that the project was \"culturally foreign\", and due to its visibility within the line of sight of a cathedral and former Synagogue, it could be read as a \"religious provocation\".Heated debates ensued, reaching boiling point at times as Poland's right wing waded in voicing opinions such as \"'Minaret' is a symbol of a religion which has denied both our culture and basic human rights for 1400 years.\" I received personal threats, with some critics telling me, \"Don't you go bringing us Islam to Europe. We don't need this religion of hate here.\"According to a survey by the right-wing Fronda newspaper, 70% of Poznan's residents reject the minaret project. Comments on Fronda's website include, \"Lets not make the same mistakes as other European towns, and lets not make any concessions. We are resolutely opposed to minarets, mosques, terrorism, barbarianism as well as religious intolerance.\"Those supporting the project have been just as vocal. The Malta foundation protested that \"Project 'Minaret' is a symbolic gesture revealing the reality of Poland. Poznan is not a closed homogenous zone where anything different crossing its borders is 'a foreign cultural element' and therefore damaging and threatening.\"I paraphrase the analysis of the Polish edition of Le Monde Diplomatique which has campaigned for the project. It observed that we cannot separate the little war over the minaret in Poznan from the real wars Poland is waging in lands of minarets thousands of miles away. Perhaps the key to understanding the reaction to my project is the fact that it implicitly reminds us of our participation in occupations and military aggression against Muslim countries today.A society that continues to consider its self an unrecognised victim of historical defeats denies consciousness of the fact that for years it has been acting on the side of history's victors: torturers, occupiers and aggressors. The truth of our \"stablisation\" missions in Iraq and Afghanistan would be hard to accept had we not built ourselves a security wall out of ignorance and hate. The campaign to demolish the minaret before it has even been built is based on arguments designed to reinforce this wall of ignorance.", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "Religion", "Islam", "Europe"], "title": "Building my own 'minaret' | Joanna Rajkowska"},{"date": "2009-11-09T20:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "I belong to a generation that liked to repeat the words of the 19th-century Russian writer Pyotr Chaadaev. \"I didn't learn to love my nation blindfolded, gagged and with my head lowered. I believe that a man can only be useful to his country when he can look at it clearly.\"This was something we often said to ourselves when our rebellion against the dictatorship in Poland seemed hopeless. We thought we would not live to see it gone, but still we refused the blindfold and the gag. We carried on protesting, as writers and intellectuals; in student actions, workers' strikes and demonstrations during religious festivals; and by founding the first opposition organisations. They called us troublemakers and bandits. But it turned out we were doing the right thing.The Workers' Defence Committee started in 1976 \u2013 after a wave of workers' protests \u2013 with just a few hundred people, scattered across Poland. By August 1980, after the great strikes of the Baltic and Silesia, it had become Solidarity, a movement that numbered several million people from every social class, a national confederation pushing for a free, independent and just Poland. It was driven underground \u2013 but not destroyed. Solidarity survived further years of dictatorship until, in 1989, it became an open partner in the new administration.It was in Poland that the Berlin Wall began to crumble. As 1989 dawned, the Polish people, and the Czechs, Slovaks, Romanians, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Estonians and Ukrainians \u2013 and Russians themselves \u2013 were all praying for the same thing: the collapse of the Soviet Union. This event would help not just us, but our Russian friends as well.Early in the year negotiations between Poland's communist regime and the Solidarity opposition began. Talks culminated in elections \u2013 only semi-democratic \u2013 on 4 June 1989. But something genuinely historic took place. For the first time, elections in a communist state led to the crushing defeat of the Communists. The opposition's victory - supported by the Catholic Church and the authority of John Paul II - was complete.But it was not this victory that made the world's headlines the following day. Instead it was the massacre of students demanding democracy in Tiananmen Square, in Beijing.Thus on the same day the world saw the two faces of communism, its two possible reactions when threatened. One regime, in Beijing, used the language of tanks and executions; the other, in Poland, chose instead the language of the ballot box, opening up a road to democracy and change that would soon reach the other nations of eastern and central Europe.It was in Poland that the first stones of the Berlin Wall started to crumble. ItPoland had overcome the curse of its own history, a history marked by partitions, which wiped our country off the political map of Europe; of tragic insurrections doomed to failure, and hundreds of thousands of victims of hopeless battles for freedom.We know that nothing in history ever has just one cause. Poland's change was also a result of the changes in Russia; of sensible US politics; of Pope John Paul II and the Catholic church; of the Afghan people, who opposed the Soviet invasion. And there was also the deep economic crisis in the Soviet Union itself.But I will never forget that it was the Poles who created the model for compromise between ruler and ruled, for a peaceful dismantling of dictatorship, and for an equally peaceful transition of power into the hands of those who had won in parliamentary elections.How Poland has changed in two decades. It has become a democratically lawful country with a healthy economy. For Poland, the last two decades have been the best in the last 300 years. And yet so many Poles today are deeply dissatisfied. Why?The great Russian writer Anton Chekhov wrote of his homeland: \"Under the banners of education, art and free expression, a type of toad and crocodile will come to power more frightful than anything that ever came out of Spain's Inquisition \u2013 a narrow-minded, self-righteous, overbearingly ambitious type, totally lacking in conscience. Charlatans and wolves in sheeps' clothing will be able to lie and dissemble to their heart's content.\" The Russian genius foresaw what happens to a nation when it acquires freedom after years of slavery. This is what has happened in the new post-communist democracies.In Poland, it was the workers in the great factories who won change, their strikes forcing the authorities to give way. But those same factories were also the first victims of the ensuing transformation. Modernised to compete in the marketplace, they cut their workforces. Instead of a miracle of freedom, people found themselves staring redundancy in the face.The revolutions of 1989 had not mentioned mass privatisation or social inequalities; or sudden growth in crime, corruption and mafia activity; or, worst of all, permanent unemployment. This was the reality of the post-communist period offered up to the Poles and their neighbours. Political freedom, a free-market economy, the end of censorship and the opening of borders, had not been enough to effect a balance. The destruction of a despotic regime had led not just to liberal democratic values \u2013 it had also marked the start of a wild rush for wealth. A people enslaved for decades, unable to measure the worth of their own work, instead began to seek instant miracles and gratification by applying the exigencies of brute force, cynicism and bribes.Of course, there has been change. A new generation of politicians has been created. Those who had previously been excluded from legitimate political and economic activity are its leaders today. But at the same time we have had to deal with the growth of corruption on a massive scale, and with unfulfilled promises about social progress. The chasm dividing rich and poor has deepened \u2013 the only difference is that many of the richest people today were prominent activists.In some post-communist countries an aggressive ethnic nationalism is on the rise. In others, religion is being used by those in power as an anti-democratic ideology, an instrument of intolerance and exclusion. Post-communist transformation creates not just winners, but many losers: those who are unemployed, rejected, pushed into poverty. The often brutally greedy new elites are slow to learn democratic habits, respect for the law of the land, pluralism or tolerance.So our world is now one of open questions. We ask: what is the future for our democratic systems? And we are comforted to know that this same question is being asked throughout democratic Europe. Despite all the mistakes, blunders and scandals, Poland today \u2013 20 years on \u2013 is a normal, democratic European country. It's the kind of country I wanted my generation to bequeath to our children. Although, to tell the truth, I wish that it was a rather better one.", "tags": ["Berlin Wall", "Poland", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Solidarity under strain | Adam Michnik"},{"date": "2009-11-17T07:23:30Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Twitter users will soon be able to tweet to each other via their TV sets while watching entertainment and sports shows, after Orange struck a deal to integrate the service into its mobile and television offerings.Orange, which is owned by the telecommunications giant France Telecom, runs TV services in France, Spain and Poland and mobile and internet services internationally, including in the UK.Under the deal, Orange is aiming to integrate Twitter into football coverage, news, entertainment shows and films.Twitter, which like Google is a brand that has been built with little or no traditional advertising, will also begin to appear in ad campaigns run by Orange.Orange said that Twitter services would be rolled out in the UK first, to be followed by France, Spain and Poland later this year. The service will be rolled out in other European markets next year.\"In countries where we have TV services we plan to enrich shows by allowing people to tweet while they watch their favourite programmes,\" said Stephanie Hospital, vice-president of marketing and development at Orange.In the UK, a market where Orange has investigated launching TV services, the company claimed that it will be the first telecoms operator to allow mobile users to upload and share photos on Twitter.Until now Twitter users have only been able to send and receive tweets from their online account or by text message.The key to the deal, said Orange, is that Twitter will become completely integrated with the suite of digital media services available via its mobile portal.In the UK, Orange's social media service, called Social Life, allows users easy access to a one-stop shop of social media websites including Facebook, MySpace and Bebo.Twitter fans will not have to go through a mobile application and then have to access their Twitter homepage every time they want to check an update.\"By integrating Twitter into our various mobile and internet services we are making it a greater part of people's every day lives,\" said Paul Francois Fournier, executive vice president at Orange.Orange said that paying for mobile Twitter use would come out of mobile phone customers' existing packages. In order to make sure that users with many \"followers\" do not exhaust their mobile package allowances rapidly controls have been put in place.Hospital said that mobile Twitter users will have to set a limit in advance on the number of tweets they want to receive each day and also the number of people they are \"following\" that they want to receive updates from.She added that while the new service would be available to all Orange customers, the company intended to push it more heavily to those with its Dolphin package, which is tailored towards multimedia phone users.\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

But Yobbo also has a certain garrulous way with words, a babbling stream of consciousness \u2013 and he's about to learn the words are not his own.The film plays on Polishness: not only in the language which, in the original (though not the somewhat clunky translation) is a highly inventive slang, but in Yobbo himself, who walks around in a white football jacket marked Polska (Poland). \"In the irony of the level of the language, we Poles can find ourselves, our sense of humour,\" \u017bu\u0142awski told me after the UK premiere. Yobbo is a dresiarz, which translates roughly as \"tracksuit guy\".

There is a hopelessness in Yobbo's having \"no future\" that, the film suggests, makes him a character or puppet: at the beck of outside forces, his life not under his own control.If Snow White is a kind of metafictional chav poem, Mall Girls is straight-up social realism, and harder to watch for it. The girls in question are a gang of bubble-popping 14-year-olds in pink plastic jackets and white knee-high boots who sell their bodies to older men in exchange for heart-shaped jewellery from the local equivalent of Accessorize.

Ala's tragic attempt to try to catch up sexually makes Katarzyna Ros\u0142aniec's film an affecting, occasionally agonising experience.Both films seem to suggest a generation gap has stranded young Poles. The mall girls don't know any better than to trade virginity for jeans because their elders never taught them otherwise. \"It seems that sex for clothes or other things is becoming the new kind of prostitution in Poland,\" says Ma\u0142gorzata Szwarocka, a sexologist in Warsaw. \"Without proper sexual education in schools, and the consumptional lifestyle, it is unfortunately a natural consequence.\" Poland is still a \"land of prudery\", she says, and the film has shocked the communist generation and started a national debate, similar to the ongoing one about enjo kosai (\"compensated dating\") in Japan \u2013 another country with a huge generation gap.This very shock is symptomatic of the problem, Ros\u0142aniec seems to suggest, of older Poles being vastly out of touch with their progeny. When a tearful Ala asks her father for advice, he tells her to go to sleep. From her philandering mother, Ala learns either of two things: a) cheating on your lover is fine, or b) nothing.

It seems as if there's a Polski sklep on every high street, but where the hell's a shop selling kie\u0142basa when you need one?But if most of us are unsure what it's like for Poles in Britain, we're utterly in the dark as to what it's like back in Poland. A pair of sensational (if not sensationalising) new Polish films could be just the spotlight needed: Mall Girls and Snow White, Russian Red, which were recently given their UK premieres at the Kinoteka Polish international film festival. Each is a glimpse of Poland's first post-communist generation, and shows a country beset by social ills: teenage prostitution, drug use, cheap consumerism, hooligans in ladies' furs terrorising fast-food employees. In other words, they seem to depict a country not far different from the UK.Poland's Trainspotting is the marketing hook most often Velcroed on to Snow White, Russian Red. The film is a flashy adaptation by Xawery \u017bu\u0142awski (son of cult director Andrzej) of the novel by Dorota Mas\u0142owska, who was all of 19 when her book stormed the Polish literary scene. Our hero is Yobbo, whose name says it all \u2013 unemployed, violent, directionless, with a taste for white powders and seeing red. And he's just been dumped. He attempts to cope via the twin expedients of amphetamines and incoherent political discussions with a motley crew of goth chicks, butch thuggettes and, for a hilarious few minutes, a dorky student whose interest he rewards by peeing on her budgie. But Yobbo also has a certain garrulous way with words, a babbling stream of consciousness \u2013 and he's about to learn the words are not his own.The film plays on Polishness: not only in the language which, in the original (though not the somewhat clunky translation) is a highly inventive slang, but in Yobbo himself, who walks around in a white football jacket marked Polska (Poland). \"In the irony of the level of the language, we Poles can find ourselves, our sense of humour,\" \u017bu\u0142awski told me after the UK premiere. Yobbo is a dresiarz, which translates roughly as \"tracksuit guy\". This is the Polish equivalent of the British hoodie, their tight jeans and leather jackets a typical sight in smaller Polish towns. \"He is representative of a state of mind of men in Poland nowadays, a kind of typically male consciousness,\" \u017bu\u0142awski says. For Yobbo, the game is rigged: the west is corrupt and a shadowy figure named Robert Sztorm calls all the shots at home. There is a hopelessness in Yobbo's having \"no future\" that, the film suggests, makes him a character or puppet: at the beck of outside forces, his life not under his own control.If Snow White is a kind of metafictional chav poem, Mall Girls is straight-up social realism, and harder to watch for it. The girls in question are a gang of bubble-popping 14-year-olds in pink plastic jackets and white knee-high boots who sell their bodies to older men in exchange for heart-shaped jewellery from the local equivalent of Accessorize. Ala is the \"good\" girl who gets swept up in the mall girls' world, half-seduced and half-belittled by Milena, who supposedly wants nothing more than to help Ala enjoy the \"high life\" \u2013 which to her means going back to a man's apartment rather than just sucking him off in the car. Ala's tragic attempt to try to catch up sexually makes Katarzyna Ros\u0142aniec's film an affecting, occasionally agonising experience.Both films seem to suggest a generation gap has stranded young Poles. The mall girls don't know any better than to trade virginity for jeans because their elders never taught them otherwise. \"It seems that sex for clothes or other things is becoming the new kind of prostitution in Poland,\" says Ma\u0142gorzata Szwarocka, a sexologist in Warsaw. \"Without proper sexual education in schools, and the consumptional lifestyle, it is unfortunately a natural consequence.\" Poland is still a \"land of prudery\", she says, and the film has shocked the communist generation and started a national debate, similar to the ongoing one about enjo kosai (\"compensated dating\") in Japan \u2013 another country with a huge generation gap.This very shock is symptomatic of the problem, Ros\u0142aniec seems to suggest, of older Poles being vastly out of touch with their progeny. When a tearful Ala asks her father for advice, he tells her to go to sleep. From her philandering mother, Ala learns either of two things: a) cheating on your lover is fine, or b) nothing. Her cynical teacher, meanwhile, strangles Ala's fledgling work ethic by announcing, \"I'll throw away the tests that are an embarrassment to us all,\" and simply passes the entire class. In Snow White, Yobbo's mother is conspicuously absent, and we glimpse the author Mas\u0142owska's own \"real\" life: drab, unhappy drudgery both at home and at school.Poverty also raises its squalid head: the financial promise of the EU is still a fairytale. Milena's friend Julia's desperate parents beat her, not because she's pregnant but because the young mothers' centre charges a fee. Julia's own financial goals have started so low, her friends have to lambast her before she demands her sexual \"patrons\" buy her what she wants \u2013 whereupon she finally scores that sparkling plastic ring she had her eye on. Ala's father can't afford tomato for his sandwiches, let alone a newer mobile phone to replace his daughter's brick. If her social status depends on it, then what's a girl to do?These two arresting films seem to suggest young Poles are being exposed to all the lures and temptations of western consumerism, but without the crucial protection of an older generation wise to its dangers. Capitalism can be nasty: those rhinestone nails may glitter, but they sure ain't gold. It seems as if parts of the new EU Poland really are becoming more like Britain every day.\u2022 The 8th Kinoteka Polish international film festiwal runs until 13 April at venues across London.

The looming marginalisation of the Kaczynskis on the Polish political scene could have grave consequences for the Tories' alliance of Eurosceptics as well.In 2007, after two years of governing shoulder to shoulder with far-right and populist parties,PiS was ousted from power by the centre-right Civic Platform (PO), ending Jaroslaw Kaczynski's premiership. All the same, his brother Lech has remained Poland's president, emerging as a rock-solid opposition to the new government. Now it appears that the president's days in office could be over quite soon.Last Saturday, the ruling centre-right chose its presidential candidate, parliament speaker Bronislaw Komorowski, who will run against Kaczynski this autumn. The latest polls indicate that in the first round voters would favour Komorowski over Kaczynski by 38-21%. Third-party candidates garner no more than 5% of the vote, therefore their endorsement of any of the candidates is of little importance. In the runoff, the result would be even more devastating for the current president, as over 60% of Poles would vote for Komorowski, while only 27% would back Kaczynski. The parallel 24% support for the president's Law and Justice party is enough in order to remain a muscular opposition, but it is no match to the Civic Platform's 50%.Lech Kaczynski's approaching presidential election defeat is crucial for the future of his and his brothers' party, and it might equally start a major reshuffle of Poland's political landscape. What exactly poses the danger to the Kaczynskis?First of all, an electoral slap would seriously undermine their leadership in the party. While voices of discontent have been rumbling since the lost parliamentary elections of 2007, positions within the president's chancellery have provided \"shelter\" for numerous party officials, silencing the frustrated. However, a second grim defeat is likely to deprive the increasingly impatient party ranks of illusions about a rapid return to power. And Law and Justice's younger politicians appear to be ready for virtually everything that could help overcome this hardly splendid isolation, including allying with former enemies on the left.\"We need to talk with the left. I'd like us to first get rid of a problem called the Civic Platform together, and then we can compete\", Law and Justice MP Adam Hoffman said in a recent interview. \"When I look at prime minister Donald Tusk, I see him wearing a sombrero, with a Mexican moustache and a donkey, heading an institutional revolutionary party which is both right and left-wing, red and blue.\"Not a long time ago, a similar remark would get any Polish right-wing politician kicked out of his party. This time, even though the Law and Justice leader immediately criticised his party subordinate, none of such happened. The Democratic Left Alliance, which has been in opposition since 2005 despite its meagre 12.5% result in last year's European parliament elections, does not seem eager to ally with the Kaczynski brothers, as it would discredit it in the eyes of many voters. However, given how devastating the polarised competition between PiS and prime minister Tusk's Civic Platform has been for the left, a scenario in which the latter would eventually ally with the Kaczynski brothers is not unthinkable.Certainly, such a barrier-breaking event would be hard to swallow for a number of rightwing politicians. Still, even if it does not happen, the bitterness of a second lost election could be enough to lead to a split within the Kaczynskis' party. And, in the long term, even to the fall of the Law and Justice party.This, in addition to the likely defeat of the Czech Republic's ruling Civic Democratic Party, another European ally of David Cameron's Conservatives, in the forthcoming May parliamentary elections, could be a serious challenge to the Tory-led group.

Ala is the \"good\" girl who gets swept up in the mall girls' world, half-seduced and half-belittled by Milena, who supposedly wants nothing more than to help Ala enjoy the \"high life\" \u2013 which to her means going back to a man's apartment rather than just sucking him off in the car. Ala's tragic attempt to try to catch up sexually makes Katarzyna Ros\u0142aniec's film an affecting, occasionally agonising experience.Both films seem to suggest a generation gap has stranded young Poles. The mall girls don't know any better than to trade virginity for jeans because their elders never taught them otherwise. \"It seems that sex for clothes or other things is becoming the new kind of prostitution in Poland,\" says Ma\u0142gorzata Szwarocka, a sexologist in Warsaw. \"Without proper sexual education in schools, and the consumptional lifestyle, it is unfortunately a natural consequence.\" Poland is still a \"land of prudery\", she says, and the film has shocked the communist generation and started a national debate, similar to the ongoing one about enjo kosai (\"compensated dating\") in Japan \u2013 another country with a huge generation gap.This very shock is symptomatic of the problem, Ros\u0142aniec seems to suggest, of older Poles being vastly out of touch with their progeny. When a tearful Ala asks her father for advice, he tells her to go to sleep. From her philandering mother, Ala learns either of two things: a) cheating on your lover is fine, or b) nothing. Her cynical teacher, meanwhile, strangles Ala's fledgling work ethic by announcing, \"I'll throw away the tests that are an embarrassment to us all,\" and simply passes the entire class. In Snow White, Yobbo's mother is conspicuously absent, and we glimpse the author Mas\u0142owska's own \"real\" life: drab, unhappy drudgery both at home and at school.Poverty also raises its squalid head: the financial promise of the EU is still a fairytale. Milena's friend Julia's desperate parents beat her, not because she's pregnant but because the young mothers' centre charges a fee. Julia's own financial goals have started so low, her friends have to lambast her before she demands her sexual \"patrons\" buy her what she wants \u2013 whereupon she finally scores that sparkling plastic ring she had her eye on. Ala's father can't afford tomato for his sandwiches, let alone a newer mobile phone to replace his daughter's brick. If her social status depends on it, then what's a girl to do?These two arresting films seem to suggest young Poles are being exposed to all the lures and temptations of western consumerism, but without the crucial protection of an older generation wise to its dangers. Capitalism can be nasty: those rhinestone nails may glitter, but they sure ain't gold.

The looming marginalisation of the Kaczynskis on the Polish political scene could have grave consequences for the Tories' alliance of Eurosceptics as well.In 2007, after two years of governing shoulder to shoulder with far-right and populist parties,PiS was ousted from power by the centre-right Civic Platform (PO), ending Jaroslaw Kaczynski's premiership. All the same, his brother Lech has remained Poland's president, emerging as a rock-solid opposition to the new government. Now it appears that the president's days in office could be over quite soon.Last Saturday, the ruling centre-right chose its presidential candidate, parliament speaker Bronislaw Komorowski, who will run against Kaczynski this autumn. The latest polls indicate that in the first round voters would favour Komorowski over Kaczynski by 38-21%. Third-party candidates garner no more than 5% of the vote, therefore their endorsement of any of the candidates is of little importance. In the runoff, the result would be even more devastating for the current president, as over 60% of Poles would vote for Komorowski, while only 27% would back Kaczynski. The parallel 24% support for the president's Law and Justice party is enough in order to remain a muscular opposition, but it is no match to the Civic Platform's 50%.Lech Kaczynski's approaching presidential election defeat is crucial for the future of his and his brothers' party, and it might equally start a major reshuffle of Poland's political landscape. What exactly poses the danger to the Kaczynskis?First of all, an electoral slap would seriously undermine their leadership in the party. While voices of discontent have been rumbling since the lost parliamentary elections of 2007, positions within the president's chancellery have provided \"shelter\" for numerous party officials, silencing the frustrated. However, a second grim defeat is likely to deprive the increasingly impatient party ranks of illusions about a rapid return to power. And Law and Justice's younger politicians appear to be ready for virtually everything that could help overcome this hardly splendid isolation, including allying with former enemies on the left.\"We need to talk with the left. I'd like us to first get rid of a problem called the Civic Platform together, and then we can compete\", Law and Justice MP Adam Hoffman said in a recent interview. \"When I look at prime minister Donald Tusk, I see him wearing a sombrero, with a Mexican moustache and a donkey, heading an institutional revolutionary party which is both right and left-wing, red and blue.\"Not a long time ago, a similar remark would get any Polish right-wing politician kicked out of his party. This time, even though the Law and Justice leader immediately criticised his party subordinate, none of such happened. The Democratic Left Alliance, which has been in opposition since 2005 despite its meagre 12.5% result in last year's European parliament elections, does not seem eager to ally with the Kaczynski brothers, as it would discredit it in the eyes of many voters. However, given how devastating the polarised competition between PiS and prime minister Tusk's Civic Platform has been for the left, a scenario in which the latter would eventually ally with the Kaczynski brothers is not unthinkable.Certainly, such a barrier-breaking event would be hard to swallow for a number of rightwing politicians. Still, even if it does not happen, the bitterness of a second lost election could be enough to lead to a split within the Kaczynskis' party. And, in the long term, even to the fall of the Law and Justice party.This, in addition to the likely defeat of the Czech Republic's ruling Civic Democratic Party, another European ally of David Cameron's Conservatives, in the forthcoming May parliamentary elections, could be a serious challenge to the Tory-led group. From an alliance of Conservatives and Reformists, it may turn into simply an alliance of the marginalised.", "tags": ["Poland", "David Cameron", "The far right", "European Union", "Czech Republic", "Politics", "Conservatives", "Europe"], "title": "The marginalisation of Cameron's allies | Jaroslaw Adamowski"},{"date": "2010-02-04T17:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Voting in the Ukrainian presidential election began last month, and although it is far from certain whether Victor Yanukovich (35.32%) or Yulia Tymoshenko (25.05%) will emerge victorious in the run-off on Sunday, President Viktor Yushchenko, the hero of Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution, is definitely out. He came fifth with only 5.45% of the vote.Most Europeans can be forgiven for not paying too much attention to the five years of unfinished reforms in Ukraine, the slow progress on economic ties with the EU, and the stalled bid for Nato membership that may never move beyond the very tentative statement issued at the Bucharest summit in 2008.What is surprising is that Europe's foreign policy elite seems just as ambivalent about Ukraine's fate as other citizens. Sure, policymakers were nudged awake by the 2009 Russia-Ukraine gas crisis and there is considerable concern about what shape Ukraine's relationship with Russia will take after the elections, but there is no consensus on how to approach its future relations with the EU or how to utilise available policy levers to pursue favourable outcomes. Worse still, a front-line state such as Poland, which should reasonably be expected to drive the European debate on Ukraine towards a workable consensus, seems utterly unprepared to do so at the moment.It is easy to forget that having 27 separate foreign ministries in the EU does have occasional benefits. Although it can often lead to gridlock and confusion, each state can also bring its own resources, expertise and relationships, which sometimes prove rather useful, especially in regional matters. The skilful and bloodless resolution of the electoral crisis that precipitated the Orange Revolution is a good example of such expertise at play. There, only six months after Poland's entry into the EU, then-president Alexander Kwa\u015bniewski used his knowledge of Ukraine's political scene and his personal relationship with the outgoing president Leonid Kuchma to help the EU broker an agreement that led to a replay of the fraudulent ballot. Both Kwa\u015bniewski and Valdas Adamkus (then president of Lithuania) played key roles in mediating the dispute, showing just how valuable regional diplomatic expertise can be.Sadly, it is doubtful that any Polish leader could play such a role today should another crisis arise. This is because the only Ukrainian politician with deep and significant ties to Poland, Yushchenko, is all but gone. Poland's apparent inability to conceptualise its future relations with Ukraine in his absence should be especially worrying considering the geopolitical and economic choices that will face the winner of this Sunday's election.To understand Poland's present attitude towards its eastern neighbour, it is necessary to understand just how deeply Polish political elites fell for Yushchenko. After the Orange Revolution, Poland aligned itself with the pro-EU, pro-Nato president and never looked back, choosing not to deal with Ukraine as it was, but as they wanted it to be. Rather than deepening ties and building relationships with Yanukovich or Tymoshenko (there was ample opportunity, since both have held the post of prime minister since 2005) Poland's elites looked exclusively to the president, with their common goals slowly losing their relevance as he lost his popularity.Rafa\u0142 Ziemkiewicz, an influential columnist for the right-of-centre daily, Rzeczpospolita, said it best when he scolded both the ruling Civic Platform government and the opposition Law and Justice Party (which ruled between 2005 and 2007, and which includes President Lech Kaczynski), for seeing the Ukraine that they wanted to see instead of the one that truly existed:Not long ago, Poland's 2011 European presidency was seen within the country as a perfect opportunity to cement Ukraine's turn towards the EU, either by pushing for outright accession talks or by strengthening the nascent Eastern Partnership (and, by some, as an opportunity to nudge Ukraine's stalled Nato membership bid back into the spotlight). But now, no one seems to know. \"We respect the wishes of the Ukrainian people, whatever they may be,\" said Poland's foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, who could only muster a standard diplomatic comment about the first round of Ukraine's election: \"Should the Ukrainian side wish that we continue to support its European or Atlantic aspirations, we will be glad to support them.\" And if not, what then? What can Poland and the EU do, what common ground can they find, if the Ukrainian side wishes for something else?", "tags": ["Ukraine", "Poland", "European Union", "Russia", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Will Ukraine turn towards Europe? | Kris Kotarski"},{"date": "2010-03-15T17:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "When it comes to the Poles in their midst, your average Brit's grip on the facts tends to be a little shaky. There are more than a million Poles in residence in the UK, aren't there? Or is the number closer to half that? Some say they're toughing out the recession; others declare they are being lured home in droves by repatriation campaigns. It seems as if there's a Polski sklep on every high street, but where the hell's a shop selling kie\u0142basa when you need one?But if most of us are unsure what it's like for Poles in Britain, we're utterly in the dark as to what it's like back in Poland. A pair of sensational (if not sensationalising) new Polish films could be just the spotlight needed: Mall Girls and Snow White, Russian Red, which were recently given their UK premieres at the Kinoteka Polish international film festival. Each is a glimpse of Poland's first post-communist generation, and shows a country beset by social ills: teenage prostitution, drug use, cheap consumerism, hooligans in ladies' furs terrorising fast-food employees. In other words, they seem to depict a country not far different from the UK.Poland's Trainspotting is the marketing hook most often Velcroed on to Snow White, Russian Red. The film is a flashy adaptation by Xawery \u017bu\u0142awski (son of cult director Andrzej) of the novel by Dorota Mas\u0142owska, who was all of 19 when her book stormed the Polish literary scene. Our hero is Yobbo, whose name says it all \u2013 unemployed, violent, directionless, with a taste for white powders and seeing red. And he's just been dumped. He attempts to cope via the twin expedients of amphetamines and incoherent political discussions with a motley crew of goth chicks, butch thuggettes and, for a hilarious few minutes, a dorky student whose interest he rewards by peeing on her budgie. But Yobbo also has a certain garrulous way with words, a babbling stream of consciousness \u2013 and he's about to learn the words are not his own.The film plays on Polishness: not only in the language which, in the original (though not the somewhat clunky translation) is a highly inventive slang, but in Yobbo himself, who walks around in a white football jacket marked Polska (Poland). \"In the irony of the level of the language, we Poles can find ourselves, our sense of humour,\" \u017bu\u0142awski told me after the UK premiere. Yobbo is a dresiarz, which translates roughly as \"tracksuit guy\". This is the Polish equivalent of the British hoodie, their tight jeans and leather jackets a typical sight in smaller Polish towns. \"He is representative of a state of mind of men in Poland nowadays, a kind of typically male consciousness,\" \u017bu\u0142awski says. For Yobbo, the game is rigged: the west is corrupt and a shadowy figure named Robert Sztorm calls all the shots at home. There is a hopelessness in Yobbo's having \"no future\" that, the film suggests, makes him a character or puppet: at the beck of outside forces, his life not under his own control.If Snow White is a kind of metafictional chav poem, Mall Girls is straight-up social realism, and harder to watch for it. The girls in question are a gang of bubble-popping 14-year-olds in pink plastic jackets and white knee-high boots who sell their bodies to older men in exchange for heart-shaped jewellery from the local equivalent of Accessorize.

And Law and Justice's younger politicians appear to be ready for virtually everything that could help overcome this hardly splendid isolation, including allying with former enemies on the left.\"We need to talk with the left. I'd like us to first get rid of a problem called the Civic Platform together, and then we can compete\", Law and Justice MP Adam Hoffman said in a recent interview. \"When I look at prime minister Donald Tusk, I see him wearing a sombrero, with a Mexican moustache and a donkey, heading an institutional revolutionary party which is both right and left-wing, red and blue.\"Not a long time ago, a similar remark would get any Polish right-wing politician kicked out of his party. This time, even though the Law and Justice leader immediately criticised his party subordinate, none of such happened. The Democratic Left Alliance, which has been in opposition since 2005 despite its meagre 12.5% result in last year's European parliament elections, does not seem eager to ally with the Kaczynski brothers, as it would discredit it in the eyes of many voters. However, given how devastating the polarised competition between PiS and prime minister Tusk's Civic Platform has been for the left, a scenario in which the latter would eventually ally with the Kaczynski brothers is not unthinkable.Certainly, such a barrier-breaking event would be hard to swallow for a number of rightwing politicians. Still, even if it does not happen, the bitterness of a second lost election could be enough to lead to a split within the Kaczynskis' party. And, in the long term, even to the fall of the Law and Justice party.This, in addition to the likely defeat of the Czech Republic's ruling Civic Democratic Party, another European ally of David Cameron's Conservatives, in the forthcoming May parliamentary elections, could be a serious challenge to the Tory-led group.

He came fifth with only 5.45% of the vote.Most Europeans can be forgiven for not paying too much attention to the five years of unfinished reforms in Ukraine, the slow progress on economic ties with the EU, and the stalled bid for Nato membership that may never move beyond the very tentative statement issued at the Bucharest summit in 2008.What is surprising is that Europe's foreign policy elite seems just as ambivalent about Ukraine's fate as other citizens. Sure, policymakers were nudged awake by the 2009 Russia-Ukraine gas crisis and there is considerable concern about what shape Ukraine's relationship with Russia will take after the elections, but there is no consensus on how to approach its future relations with the EU or how to utilise available policy levers to pursue favourable outcomes. Worse still, a front-line state such as Poland, which should reasonably be expected to drive the European debate on Ukraine towards a workable consensus, seems utterly unprepared to do so at the moment.It is easy to forget that having 27 separate foreign ministries in the EU does have occasional benefits. Although it can often lead to gridlock and confusion, each state can also bring its own resources, expertise and relationships, which sometimes prove rather useful, especially in regional matters. The skilful and bloodless resolution of the electoral crisis that precipitated the Orange Revolution is a good example of such expertise at play. There, only six months after Poland's entry into the EU, then-president Alexander Kwa\u015bniewski used his knowledge of Ukraine's political scene and his personal relationship with the outgoing president Leonid Kuchma to help the EU broker an agreement that led to a replay of the fraudulent ballot. Both Kwa\u015bniewski and Valdas Adamkus (then president of Lithuania) played key roles in mediating the dispute, showing just how valuable regional diplomatic expertise can be.Sadly, it is doubtful that any Polish leader could play such a role today should another crisis arise. This is because the only Ukrainian politician with deep and significant ties to Poland, Yushchenko, is all but gone. Poland's apparent inability to conceptualise its future relations with Ukraine in his absence should be especially worrying considering the geopolitical and economic choices that will face the winner of this Sunday's election.To understand Poland's present attitude towards its eastern neighbour, it is necessary to understand just how deeply Polish political elites fell for Yushchenko. After the Orange Revolution, Poland aligned itself with the pro-EU, pro-Nato president and never looked back, choosing not to deal with Ukraine as it was, but as they wanted it to be. Rather than deepening ties and building relationships with Yanukovich or Tymoshenko (there was ample opportunity, since both have held the post of prime minister since 2005) Poland's elites looked exclusively to the president, with their common goals slowly losing their relevance as he lost his popularity.Rafa\u0142 Ziemkiewicz, an influential columnist for the right-of-centre daily, Rzeczpospolita, said it best when he scolded both the ruling Civic Platform government and the opposition Law and Justice Party (which ruled between 2005 and 2007, and which includes President Lech Kaczynski), for seeing the Ukraine that they wanted to see instead of the one that truly existed:Not long ago, Poland's 2011 European presidency was seen within the country as a perfect opportunity to cement Ukraine's turn towards the EU, either by pushing for outright accession talks or by strengthening the nascent Eastern Partnership (and, by some, as an opportunity to nudge Ukraine's stalled Nato membership bid back into the spotlight). But now, no one seems to know. \"We respect the wishes of the Ukrainian people, whatever they may be,\" said Poland's foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, who could only muster a standard diplomatic comment about the first round of Ukraine's election: \"Should the Ukrainian side wish that we continue to support its European or Atlantic aspirations, we will be glad to support them.\" And if not, what then?

An established international law professor, and co-author of the first international law textbook used at the country's universities, he joined the government headed by Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a democratic opposition leader in communist times, in September that year. Immediately, Skubiszewski was confronted with the challenging task of conducting Poland's foreign relations in a new and volatile international environment.Relations with \"companion\" states were strained \u2013 the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and East Germany's Erich Honecker both called for a Warsaw Pact intervention in \"rebellious\" Poland, and thousands of Soviet troops were still stationed on its soil. \"In the beginning, I wasn't even sure if one day the whole government wouldn't be simply arrested and this experiment called off. But there were many far more important matters to worry about than this one particular problem,\" Skubiszewski told the daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza in his final interview, last November.Born in Poznan\u00b4, western Poland, he graduated in law from Poznan\u00b4 University, where he later taught international law. He undertook postgraduate studies at Harvard University, Massachusetts, and Nancy, in France. Despite his research achievements at home and lectures at universities in France, Britain and the US, Skubiszewski's professorial appointment at Poznan\u00b4 was obstructed for political reasons. In 1968 he publicly criticised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, as well as the antisemitic smear campaign launched by Poland's communist authorities. It was not until 1973 that he was finally made professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences, in Warsaw.Good relations with the Federal Republic of Germany were at the core of Skubiszewski's diplomatic efforts when he became foreign minister. While certain politicians from West Germany's ruling Christian Democratic party, the CDU, were openly questioning the existing Polish-German border, Skubiszewski was faced with a Gordian knot. He had to protect Poland's interests, seal the postwar reconciliation with Germany and, at the same time, not reopen the wounds left by history. Eventually he secured unequivocal recognition of the border, and his concern for bringing together Poles and Germans was the driving force behind one of his first decisions \u2013 to provide help for East German refugees who, in their desperation, had sought asylum in West Germany's embassy in Warsaw.The tearing down of the Berlin wall in November 1989 came as a shock to both east and west, but Skubiszewski had long been prepared for German reunification. Contrary to the then-widespread fear of a powerful Germany, he had concluded in his 1969 book on Poland's western frontier that Polish-German reconciliation could follow the French-German model of cooperation.Skubiszewski was not only the architect of Poland's pro-western foreign policy, oriented towards rapid integration with the EU and Nato. Before resigning, in 1993, when the post-communist left returned to power, he had also established the country's unique position as a bridge between western and eastern Europe. Perhaps the best measure of his achievement is the fact that almost all his successors \u2013 from across the political spectrum \u2013 have followed the path that he initiated.\"As a superior he was rigorous, but also fair. He did not expect his subordinates to work harder than he did, and he would work a dozen hours a day. You could always call him at midnight and ask for advice,\" recalled W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski, a former foreign minister and a friend of his. \"Diplomacy was his life.\"In 1993, Skubiszewsk was named a judge and, in February 1994, the president of the Iran-US claims tribunal in The Hague, as well as an ad hoc judge in the International Court of Justice there. He said that once he had fulfilled his duties at the tribunal, he would plunge into the foreign ministry archives and write his memoirs. But those duties continued until his final days.He is survived by his brother, Piotr.\u2022 Krzysztof Jan Skubiszewski, international law academic, politician, diplomat and judge, born 8 October 1926; died 8 February 2010", "tags": ["Poland", "Politics", "Europe"], "title": "Krzysztof Skubiszewski obituary"},{"date": "2010-03-15T17:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "When it comes to the Poles in their midst, your average Brit's grip on the facts tends to be a little shaky. There are more than a million Poles in residence in the UK, aren't there? Or is the number closer to half that? Some say they're toughing out the recession; others declare they are being lured home in droves by repatriation campaigns. It seems as if there's a Polski sklep on every high street, but where the hell's a shop selling kie\u0142basa when you need one?But if most of us are unsure what it's like for Poles in Britain, we're utterly in the dark as to what it's like back in Poland. A pair of sensational (if not sensationalising) new Polish films could be just the spotlight needed: Mall Girls and Snow White, Russian Red, which were recently given their UK premieres at the Kinoteka Polish international film festival. Each is a glimpse of Poland's first post-communist generation, and shows a country beset by social ills: teenage prostitution, drug use, cheap consumerism, hooligans in ladies' furs terrorising fast-food employees. In other words, they seem to depict a country not far different from the UK.Poland's Trainspotting is the marketing hook most often Velcroed on to Snow White, Russian Red. The film is a flashy adaptation by Xawery \u017bu\u0142awski (son of cult director Andrzej) of the novel by Dorota Mas\u0142owska, who was all of 19 when her book stormed the Polish literary scene. Our hero is Yobbo, whose name says it all \u2013 unemployed, violent, directionless, with a taste for white powders and seeing red. And he's just been dumped. He attempts to cope via the twin expedients of amphetamines and incoherent political discussions with a motley crew of goth chicks, butch thuggettes and, for a hilarious few minutes, a dorky student whose interest he rewards by peeing on her budgie. But Yobbo also has a certain garrulous way with words, a babbling stream of consciousness \u2013 and he's about to learn the words are not his own.The film plays on Polishness: not only in the language which, in the original (though not the somewhat clunky translation) is a highly inventive slang, but in Yobbo himself, who walks around in a white football jacket marked Polska (Poland). \"In the irony of the level of the language, we Poles can find ourselves, our sense of humour,\" \u017bu\u0142awski told me after the UK premiere. Yobbo is a dresiarz, which translates roughly as \"tracksuit guy\". This is the Polish equivalent of the British hoodie, their tight jeans and leather jackets a typical sight in smaller Polish towns. \"He is representative of a state of mind of men in Poland nowadays, a kind of typically male consciousness,\" \u017bu\u0142awski says. For Yobbo, the game is rigged: the west is corrupt and a shadowy figure named Robert Sztorm calls all the shots at home. There is a hopelessness in Yobbo's having \"no future\" that, the film suggests, makes him a character or puppet: at the beck of outside forces, his life not under his own control.If Snow White is a kind of metafictional chav poem, Mall Girls is straight-up social realism, and harder to watch for it. The girls in question are a gang of bubble-popping 14-year-olds in pink plastic jackets and white knee-high boots who sell their bodies to older men in exchange for heart-shaped jewellery from the local equivalent of Accessorize. Ala is the \"good\" girl who gets swept up in the mall girls' world, half-seduced and half-belittled by Milena, who supposedly wants nothing more than to help Ala enjoy the \"high life\" \u2013 which to her means going back to a man's apartment rather than just sucking him off in the car. Ala's tragic attempt to try to catch up sexually makes Katarzyna Ros\u0142aniec's film an affecting, occasionally agonising experience.Both films seem to suggest a generation gap has stranded young Poles. The mall girls don't know any better than to trade virginity for jeans because their elders never taught them otherwise. \"It seems that sex for clothes or other things is becoming the new kind of prostitution in Poland,\" says Ma\u0142gorzata Szwarocka, a sexologist in Warsaw. \"Without proper sexual education in schools, and the consumptional lifestyle, it is unfortunately a natural consequence.\" Poland is still a \"land of prudery\", she says, and the film has shocked the communist generation and started a national debate, similar to the ongoing one about enjo kosai (\"compensated dating\") in Japan \u2013 another country with a huge generation gap.This very shock is symptomatic of the problem, Ros\u0142aniec seems to suggest, of older Poles being vastly out of touch with their progeny. When a tearful Ala asks her father for advice, he tells her to go to sleep. From her philandering mother, Ala learns either of two things: a) cheating on your lover is fine, or b) nothing. Her cynical teacher, meanwhile, strangles Ala's fledgling work ethic by announcing, \"I'll throw away the tests that are an embarrassment to us all,\" and simply passes the entire class. In Snow White, Yobbo's mother is conspicuously absent, and we glimpse the author Mas\u0142owska's own \"real\" life: drab, unhappy drudgery both at home and at school.Poverty also raises its squalid head: the financial promise of the EU is still a fairytale. Milena's friend Julia's desperate parents beat her, not because she's pregnant but because the young mothers' centre charges a fee. Julia's own financial goals have started so low, her friends have to lambast her before she demands her sexual \"patrons\" buy her what she wants \u2013 whereupon she finally scores that sparkling plastic ring she had her eye on. Ala's father can't afford tomato for his sandwiches, let alone a newer mobile phone to replace his daughter's brick. If her social status depends on it, then what's a girl to do?These two arresting films seem to suggest young Poles are being exposed to all the lures and temptations of western consumerism, but without the crucial protection of an older generation wise to its dangers. Capitalism can be nasty: those rhinestone nails may glitter, but they sure ain't gold. It seems as if parts of the new EU Poland really are becoming more like Britain every day.\u2022 The 8th Kinoteka Polish international film festiwal runs until 13 April at venues across London.

It failed to provide any of these flight records to previous investigations,\" the campaigners said.Analysis of the flight logs also indicated an attempted joint coverup by the CIA and the Polish authorities, with the aviation authorities being told that several of the flights were destined not for Szymany but for Warsaw.\"The CIA filed 'dummy' and false flight plans, or no flight plans at all, for the incoming and outgoing flights of N379P,\" the campaigners added.\"[The Polish aviation authority] collaborated with the CIA by accepting the task of navigating these disguised flights into and out of Szymany airport without adhering to the requirements of international flight planning regulations.\"The most remarkable aspect is that the Polish government, which maintained for more than four years that no such records existed \u2013 or that, if they did, they were untraceable \u2013 has now provided an apparently comprehensive list of these landings, compiled and presented in an orderly and coherent fashion.\"", "tags": ["Rendition", "CIA", "Poland", "US news", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Poland admits role in CIA rendition programme"},{"date": "2010-03-08T17:37:21Z", "country": "poland", "content": "It was one of the most traumatic matches in England's football history, the one where that \"clown\" Jan Tomaszewski made save after save ensuring Poland went to the World Cup and \u2013 unthinkably \u2013 England didn't.

The maverick violinist, a passionate Aston Villa fan who moved to Krakow several years ago, will curate a weekend of events as the culmination of a year of cultural activities that have taken place under the banner Polska!His most eye-catching concert will be a screening of the 1973 England v Poland match, albeit without the Barry Davies commentary. Instead it will be accompanied by Kennedy and Polish jazz musicians, playing a semi-improvised score.Kennedy said the match perfectly represented \"what the whole festival is about, which is bringing Polish culture into England\".Those England fans who watched in disbelief 37 years ago might, of course, see it differently. If England failed to win the visitors went through to the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany. The papers were full of scorn for Poland, and Brian Clough was typically not shy in giving his opinion, calling the goalkeeper Tomaszewski \"a clown\".But it was the clown who effectively put Poland through with a string of impressive saves. The 1-1 draw meant England were out for the first time. The nation went to work the next day depressed and shocked. Sir Alf Ramsay was, humiliatingly, sacked as manager.Happy days, then. Kennedy said his decision to screen it was fuelled by his belief in the similarities between football and music. \"Football brings a lot of people together and music is obviously designed expressly for that purpose. They're also both shared things across all nations.\"The weekend will also see the British debut of Kennedy's Orchestra of Life, an ensemble of young Polish musicians brought together by the violinist who will perform a programme featuring music by Bach and Duke Ellington.Kennedy said of the orchestra: \"I love working with young people who are open-minded and flexible and who have a real energy and vivacity in their approach to music. These young cats show the discipline and spontaneity of Polish culture.\"Other highlights include a celebratory concert by \"Nigel Kennedy's Chopin Super Group\" featuring Janusz Olejniczak, who played the piano music in Roman Polanski's film The Pianist.Kennedy, the boy prodigy who became the brandy drinking diamond geezer, has lived in Poland for some time. \"I'm well into the Polish life,\" he said. \"Ranging from the music and football through to the brilliant beer and vodka. Poland has an incredibly rich environment for all music. I'm sure I've had a much better chance to develop as a musician because all of these live forms of music that are very prevalent in Polish music.\"I wanted to bring some Polish culture over to London and make the Southbank Centre into a miniature Poland for a while.\"Nigel Kennedy's FA Project: England v Poland 1973 will take place on the evening of Sunday 30 May.

The looming marginalisation of the Kaczynskis on the Polish political scene could have grave consequences for the Tories' alliance of Eurosceptics as well.In 2007, after two years of governing shoulder to shoulder with far-right and populist parties,PiS was ousted from power by the centre-right Civic Platform (PO), ending Jaroslaw Kaczynski's premiership. All the same, his brother Lech has remained Poland's president, emerging as a rock-solid opposition to the new government. Now it appears that the president's days in office could be over quite soon.Last Saturday, the ruling centre-right chose its presidential candidate, parliament speaker Bronislaw Komorowski, who will run against Kaczynski this autumn. The latest polls indicate that in the first round voters would favour Komorowski over Kaczynski by 38-21%. Third-party candidates garner no more than 5% of the vote, therefore their endorsement of any of the candidates is of little importance. In the runoff, the result would be even more devastating for the current president, as over 60% of Poles would vote for Komorowski, while only 27% would back Kaczynski. The parallel 24% support for the president's Law and Justice party is enough in order to remain a muscular opposition, but it is no match to the Civic Platform's 50%.Lech Kaczynski's approaching presidential election defeat is crucial for the future of his and his brothers' party, and it might equally start a major reshuffle of Poland's political landscape.

But there were many far more important matters to worry about than this one particular problem,\" Skubiszewski told the daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza in his final interview, last November.Born in Poznan\u00b4, western Poland, he graduated in law from Poznan\u00b4 University, where he later taught international law. He undertook postgraduate studies at Harvard University, Massachusetts, and Nancy, in France. Despite his research achievements at home and lectures at universities in France, Britain and the US, Skubiszewski's professorial appointment at Poznan\u00b4 was obstructed for political reasons. In 1968 he publicly criticised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, as well as the antisemitic smear campaign launched by Poland's communist authorities. It was not until 1973 that he was finally made professor at the Polish Academy of Sciences, in Warsaw.Good relations with the Federal Republic of Germany were at the core of Skubiszewski's diplomatic efforts when he became foreign minister. While certain politicians from West Germany's ruling Christian Democratic party, the CDU, were openly questioning the existing Polish-German border, Skubiszewski was faced with a Gordian knot. He had to protect Poland's interests, seal the postwar reconciliation with Germany and, at the same time, not reopen the wounds left by history. Eventually he secured unequivocal recognition of the border, and his concern for bringing together Poles and Germans was the driving force behind one of his first decisions \u2013 to provide help for East German refugees who, in their desperation, had sought asylum in West Germany's embassy in Warsaw.The tearing down of the Berlin wall in November 1989 came as a shock to both east and west, but Skubiszewski had long been prepared for German reunification. Contrary to the then-widespread fear of a powerful Germany, he had concluded in his 1969 book on Poland's western frontier that Polish-German reconciliation could follow the French-German model of cooperation.Skubiszewski was not only the architect of Poland's pro-western foreign policy, oriented towards rapid integration with the EU and Nato. Before resigning, in 1993, when the post-communist left returned to power, he had also established the country's unique position as a bridge between western and eastern Europe. Perhaps the best measure of his achievement is the fact that almost all his successors \u2013 from across the political spectrum \u2013 have followed the path that he initiated.\"As a superior he was rigorous, but also fair. He did not expect his subordinates to work harder than he did, and he would work a dozen hours a day. You could always call him at midnight and ask for advice,\" recalled W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski, a former foreign minister and a friend of his. \"Diplomacy was his life.\"In 1993, Skubiszewsk was named a judge and, in February 1994, the president of the Iran-US claims tribunal in The Hague, as well as an ad hoc judge in the International Court of Justice there. He said that once he had fulfilled his duties at the tribunal, he would plunge into the foreign ministry archives and write his memoirs. But those duties continued until his final days.He is survived by his brother, Piotr.\u2022 Krzysztof Jan Skubiszewski, international law academic, politician, diplomat and judge, born 8 October 1926; died 8 February 2010", "tags": ["Poland", "Politics", "Europe"], "title": "Krzysztof Skubiszewski obituary"},{"date": "2010-02-12T10:45:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The Kinoteka Polish Film Festiwal (sic) has chosen its eighth annual incarnation in the UK for a retrospective dedicated to the country's most famous, and controversial, film-maker, Roman Polanski.Timed to coincide with the release of his latest film, The Ghost Writer, Kinoteka will show a season of Polanski's short films, as well as early works in which he collaborated with the composer and jazz pianist Krzysztof Komeda. As Polanski is still under house arrest in Switzerland, the festival is facing the controversy head-on: it will lead the Polanski segment with a screening of Marina Zenovich's 2008 documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, which \"challenges many of the myths which have built up\" around the director's case. The films run in conjunction with an exhibition of rare Polanski film posters from across the globe.Other highlights of the festival include Borys Lankosz's Reverse, Poland's submission for the best foreign language film Oscar; and Snow White, Russian Red, adapted from the eponymous novel by Dorota Mas\u0142owska. A portrait of the drug-fuelled excesses of Poland's post-communist youth, this \"Trainspotting of Poland\" made Mas\u0142owska a literary star before the age of 21, so it will be interesting to see whether the film enjoys anything like the success of Danny Boyle's 1996 sensation.Multiple Oscar nominee Andrzej Wajda has thrown in his hat with Sweet Rush, about a middle-aged woman dating a much younger man. There are also archival documentaries by Krzysztof Kieslowski; a new film from animation pioneers the Quay Brothers based on Stanis\u0142aw Lem's short story The Mask; and a gala concert performance of Komeda's music led by jazz trumpeter Tomasz Stanko. And there is the 2010 Oscar-nominated Rabbit \u00e0 la Berlin, a short documentary on the wild bunnies that once thrived in the \"death zone\" between the inner and outer sections of the Berlin Wall. One imagines 1989 was to the rabbits as Homer Simpson was to the ant colony he smashed: \"Freedom! Horrible, horrible freedom!\"The festival runs from 4 March to 13 April in various locations around London.

The election will also determine how it reacts to the new debt crisis.Komorowski is a pro-EU, moderate member of the governing Civic Platform party who has pledged to work closely with the prime minister, Donald Tusk, to adopt the euro in about five years, end the unpopular military mission in Afghanistan and promote pro-market reforms.Kaczynski is a social conservative who has pledged to fight crime and corruption, scale back market reforms in order to preserve a strong welfare state and promote Roman Catholic values in public life. More sceptical about the EU and the euro, Kaczynski says it is too early to set a timetable for giving up the Polish currency, the zloty.Kaczynski, a former prime minister, is known for his nationalism and his combative tone. But he has struck a more moderate tone since his brother's death. Many Poles are unsure whether the change is permanent or a strategy to win over middle-of-the-road voters.Opinions were split in Warsaw early today. Komorowski's supporters stressed his calm and ties to the governmentk, while backers of Kaczynski called him trustworthy and said he truly cares for Poland's interests.Jan Rostafinski said he voted for Komorowski, whom he knows personally. \"He is the best among the candidates: he has rich experience, moderate views and a sense of humour, which the predecessor was lacking, or at least so it seemed. Komorowski will represent Poland well,\" Rostafinski said.But Ewa Stawinska said she would vote for Kaczynski because she thought it was better for the president and the prime minister to be from different parties.

Many of the prisoners, who were shot in the base of the skull by the NKVD, found their final resting place in the mass graves of Katyn Forest just outside Smolensk. Among the victims were professional army officers and reservists drawn from Poland's police forces and university-educated elites. One of them was Aleksander Wielebnowski, my great-grandfather.While it is impossible to overstate the significance of what is known as the Katyn massacre in Poland's collective memory, until 1989 this collective memory was officially suppressed and only maintained by thousands of families.Unlike national narratives that often form when the essence of shared experiences is captured by a writer, poet or statesman, the Katyn memory was formed through the fragmented suffering of the families of the victims, so unlike the public outpouring which has characterised the aftermath of the recent accident.My grandfather's story is not special \u2013 it is typical of the experiences of many in his generation. I wish to share it here not to evoke sympathy for him or for Poland, but to better explain why Kaczynski and a plane full of dignitaries and victim's families tried to touch down in the fog of Smolensk, and why recent Russian gestures, both before and after the plane accident, mean so much to the people of Poland and offer so much hope for reconciliation.My grandfather, Jerzy, grew up in Lutsk in what is today a large Ukrainian city. In September 1939, Jerzy was nine years old, and one day his father, a reserve officer, did not return home after he was arrested in his office at the local police headquarters.\"We first received a card letting us know that he was in an internment camp in January 1940,\" he recalls. \"He said that he was in Ostashkov, and that he was feeling well despite the cold winter. He tried to raise our spirits and he believed that he would come back.\"On 12 April 1940, Jerzy, his mother and his three siblings were woken up at 3am by an NKVD officer and two soldiers who stood at their door.\"The NKVD man told us that we would go to see our family,\" he recalls. \"This is what the Soviets would say back then. This was one of their ways of dealing with people.\"Instead, the family was sent east to a labour camp in Pavlodar, in modern Kazakhstan. Wielebnowski does not believe that they would have survived, but after the Soviet Union joined the war on the side of the allies, a friendly commissar's wife petitioned the NKVD for their release and they were evacuated, first to Tehran, and then to Lusaka where Jerzy spent the remainder of the war in an orphanage for Polish children.They returned in 1947, finding a Polish state dominated by the Soviet Union.\"My mother was 47 years old and still hoped to find my father, so we came back. But, just as we crossed the border she noticed that the secret police, questioning all the returnees, took away one of the men that we were travelling with. When she saw this, she said 'Kids, what have we done! We should not have returned'.\"Jerzy enrolled in school and, thanks to a high school principal who advised him on how to hide his background and a friend's father who worked in a city office and who falsely vouched for his working-class upbringing, he was able to attend university.\"At the time, the officials were trying to destroy young people with my background, but I managed to get by. In 1954 I finished my studies in architecture at the university in Gdansk. Could you imagine that? A policeman's son? If anyone found out what my family background was, I would have been thrown out, and probably ended up breaking boulders or mining uranium with a penal workcrew.\"The word \"Katyn\" remained painful when it was whispered in the post-war darkness when the truth was sacrificed on the altar of \"eternal friendship\" between the Polish and Soviet communist states. This is the reason why it was aggressively shouted after 1989 when the archive doors slowly began to open, reluctantly revealing what had happened to the victims.\"I only found out in 1990 what happened to my father. We always suspected what his fate was, but until we saw something final, like a list, we could never be certain. In 1990, Lech Walesa received the lists from Boris Yeltsin and those lists were given to families like ours looking for relatives. My father's name appears on 16 April 1940. He is listed 10th on a list of about 250 prisoners taken from Ostashkov to Tver, where he was executed in an NKVD building. That's when I finally knew what had happened to him.\"In 1992, Jerzy visited Ostashkov, Tver and Mednoje, where his father lies in a mass grave.In Ostashkov, he walked through the remains in the NKVD camp in an old island monastery, but found no signs of the prisoners. In Tver, he saw the room where the prisoners were executed, and in Mednoje he got angry.\"They built a summer recreational home for the NKVD on the site, and the latrines leaked into the mass grave. For me, as a son of someone who is laying there, I protest with every ounce of my being. This is unacceptable, and every time I speak about this, I choke up a little.\"In the aftermath of the crash, Poles are avoiding the \"second Katyn\" moniker that was used by Timothy Garton Ash, calling this the \"tragedy in Smolensk\" instead. This is apt, since this time the victims do not have to wait decades for information, and people both in Poland and abroad have publicly poured their hearts out while the Russian authorities are assisting the families at every turn.\"It is welcome and it is genuine,\" Jerzy said. \"And I hope that things will change.

Families of the victims flew to Moscow last night accompanied by psychologists to help in the identification process, much of which will be carried out through DNA testing.Accident investigators continue to investigate the cause of the crash. Pavel Plusnin, a Russian air traffic controller who was the last person to talk to the crew of the president's Tupolew 154 before it crashed in dense fog into a grove of trees, told a Moscow news portal that he had had difficulties understanding the crew, who he claimed had spoken poor Russian. \"Numbers were hard for them, so I could not determine their altitude,\" he said.Polish newspapers yesterday were replete with full-page black and white death notices, with lists of names and titles.

Thousands lined the streets in silence along the route to the presidential palace where the body was taken.Poland held a two-minute silence earlier to mark the death of the president, his wife and dozens of officials in a plane crash in western Russia yesterday.Russian officials said 97 people died, including eight crew members, after the president's Tupolev plane clipped trees on its approach to Smolensk airport in thick fog. There were no survivors. Russian TV showed pictures of the upended wing and smouldering fuselage. Small fires burned in woods shrouded in fog.Rescuers found several unidentified bodies and the plane's black box.This morning, the bodies of the victims arrived in Moscow by helicopter for identification. Relatives were expected to fly to the Russian capital later today.Jaroslaw Kaczynski visited the crash site last night, with TV pictures showing him kneeling and praying. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, also flew to Smolensk from Warsaw where he met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and placed a wreath.Across Poland bells were rung at a slow and mournful pace. People sought solace in churches and laid candles at national monuments and government buildings. Mourners queued in their hundreds to sign books of condolences. \"I can't fathom this, it reminds me of when the pope died, five years ago this month,\" said Zofia, recalling the death of Pope John Paul II on 5 April 2005.Kaczynski had been flying to Smolensk to attend the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre, when Soviet secret police killed 15,000 Polish officers in one of the most notorious atrocities of the second world war. In a tragic twist, family members of the Katyn victims were on board the president's plane. Others were waiting at the airport.There was no suspicion of foul play, but the extraordinary timing and location of the disaster, together with Kaczynski's known antipathy towards the Kremlin, are likely to fuel conspiracy theories on both sides.The Kremlin failed to invite Kaczynski to a ceremony in Katyn last Wednesday attended by Tusk and Putin. Kaczynski organised his own separate event. Newspapers bearing headlines such as \"Katyn \u2013 a double tragedy\" lay next to portraits of some of the crash victims.The subject of Katyn has for decades been a source of unresolved friction between Moscow and Warsaw, with successive Soviet governments falsely blaming the Nazis for the massacre. Recently, there have been signs that the tensions were easing. Last week, Putin became the first Russian or Soviet leader to join Polish officials in commemorating the massacre's anniversary when he met Tusk in Katyn.\"We still cannot fully understand the scope of this tragedy and what it means for us in the future. Nothing like this has ever happened in Poland,\" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Piotr Paszkowski. \"We can assume with great certainty that all persons on board have been killed.\"Russian officials said that the airport, 270 miles west of Moscow, had been closed because of thick fog. They advised the pilot to land instead in Moscow or Minsk, but he continued with the original flight plan, making three abortive attempts to land at Smolensk's Severny military airport. On the fourth attempt, the Russian-built airliner crashed. According to witnesses, Kaczynski's plane was between 500 and 700 metres from the runway, and about 20 metres from the ground when it ploughed into the trees.\"The Polish presidential plane did not make it to the runway while landing. Tentative findings indicate that it hit the treetops and fell apart,\" said Smolensk's governor, Sergei Anufriev.World leaders yesterday paid tribute to Kaczynski, who was elected in 2005 after defeating Tusk in a presidential vote. He and his twin brother, Jaroslaw, a former prime minister now in opposition, emerged from Poland's anti-communist Solidarity movement. They have dominated Polish politics for the last decade, espousing a national conservative \u2013 and often anti-Russian \u2013 ideology. Kaczynski leaves a daughter, Marta, and two granddaughters.Gordon Brown said: \"The whole world will be saddened and in sorrow as a result of this tragic death in a plane crash of President Kaczynski and his wife, Maria, and the party that were with him. I think we know the difficulties that Poland has gone through and the sacrifices that he himself made as part of the Solidarity movement, and we know the contribution he made to the independence and the freedom of Poland.\"Kaczynski had said he would seek a second term in presidential elections this autumn. He was expected to face an uphill struggle against the speaker, Bronislaw Komorowski, the candidate of Tusk's governing Civic Platform party. Komorowski has taken over Kaczynski's job as head of state, a largely symbolic role. The election will be brought forward, with Poles set to go to the polls to choose a new president by the end of June.Polish officials have long discussed replacing the planes that carry the country's leaders but said they lacked the funds. The presidential Tu-154 that crashed was 26 years old. It was overhauled in December in Russia, with Russian experts insisting that it was airworthy and blaming pilot error and bad weather.Among the victims was Anna Walentynowicz, whose dismissal in August 1980 from the Lenin shipyards in the Polish port of Gdansk ignited the strike that led to the creation of the Solidarity movement and, ultimately, the collapse of communist rule.

Kaczynski organised his own separate event. Newspapers bearing headlines such as \"Katyn \u2013 a double tragedy\" lay next to portraits of some of the crash victims.The subject of Katyn has for decades been a source of unresolved friction between Moscow and Warsaw, with successive Soviet governments falsely blaming the Nazis for the massacre. Recently, there have been signs that the tensions were easing. Last week, Putin became the first Russian or Soviet leader to join Polish officials in commemorating the massacre's anniversary when he met Tusk in Katyn.\"We still cannot fully understand the scope of this tragedy and what it means for us in the future. Nothing like this has ever happened in Poland,\" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Piotr Paszkowski. \"We can assume with great certainty that all persons on board have been killed.\"Russian officials said that the airport, 270 miles west of Moscow, had been closed because of thick fog. They advised the pilot to land instead in Moscow or Minsk, but he continued with the original flight plan, making three abortive attempts to land at Smolensk's Severny military airport. On the fourth attempt, the Russian-built airliner crashed. According to witnesses, Kaczynski's plane was between 500 and 700 metres from the runway, and about 20 metres from the ground when it ploughed into the trees.\"The Polish presidential plane did not make it to the runway while landing. Tentative findings indicate that it hit the treetops and fell apart,\" said Smolensk's governor, Sergei Anufriev.World leaders yesterday paid tribute to Kaczynski, who was elected in 2005 after defeating Tusk in a presidential vote. He and his twin brother, Jaroslaw, a former prime minister now in opposition, emerged from Poland's anti-communist Solidarity movement. They have dominated Polish politics for the last decade, espousing a national conservative \u2013 and often anti-Russian \u2013 ideology. Kaczynski leaves a daughter, Marta, and two granddaughters.Gordon Brown said: \"The whole world will be saddened and in sorrow as a result of this tragic death in a plane crash of President Kaczynski and his wife, Maria, and the party that were with him. I think we know the difficulties that Poland has gone through and the sacrifices that he himself made as part of the Solidarity movement, and we know the contribution he made to the independence and the freedom of Poland.\"Kaczynski had said he would seek a second term in presidential elections this autumn. He was expected to face an uphill struggle against the speaker, Bronislaw Komorowski, the candidate of Tusk's governing Civic Platform party. Komorowski has taken over Kaczynski's job as head of state, a largely symbolic role. The election will be brought forward, with Poles set to go to the polls to choose a new president by the end of June.Polish officials have long discussed replacing the planes that carry the country's leaders but said they lacked the funds. The presidential Tu-154 that crashed was 26 years old. It was overhauled in December in Russia, with Russian experts insisting that it was airworthy and blaming pilot error and bad weather.Among the victims was Anna Walentynowicz, whose dismissal in August 1980 from the Lenin shipyards in the Polish port of Gdansk ignited the strike that led to the creation of the Solidarity movement and, ultimately, the collapse of communist rule.

She was with the president's twin brother, Jaroslaw, the country's acting president, Bronislaw Komorowski, and the prime minister, Donald Tusk.As the late president lay in state at the palace, Russian air accident investigators gave their initial findings of the cause of the crash, which claimed 96 lives, including the head of the national bank, the leaders of all four branches of the military, the head of the Olympic committee, several champions of the country's struggle against communist dictatorship, historians and civil servants.The investigators said there was no evidence of technical failure on the 26-year-old Tupolev 154 and blamed pilot error.Deciphered recordings of conversations between the pilot and air traffic control on the ground in Smolensk did not indicate any problems in the crucial few seconds before the crash, Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the Russian's prosecutor's office, said.\"We have deciphered the tape reel and conducted a preliminary analysis. We will look in more detail in Moscow, but I repeat: the recording that we have confirms that there were no technical problems with the plane,\" he said. \"The pilot was informed about the difficult weather conditions, and yet he decided to make the landing.\"But speculation was rife that the president's own entourage might have insisted the pilot continue the flight, despite orders from Russian air traffic control for the plane to land in Minsk or Moscow due to the bad weather conditions in Smolensk.The high-profile delegation was on a tight schedule on Saturday to attend a memorial service for the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre. Kaczynski was known for his assertiveness towards pilots who had flown him on official business in the past.In a widely reported case in 2008, he flew to Tbilisi in his presidential plane during the war in Georgia. When his pilot refused to land in the Georgian capital, insisting it was too dangerous to do so, Kaczynski reportedly entered the cockpit and tried to change his mind. The pilot refused, and the party landed in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, and was forced to travel the remaining stretch to Georgia by car over arduous mountain roads. Attempts were subsequently made to sue the pilot for failing to obey orders, but the case was thrown out by prosecutors.The former Polish president Lech Walesa said it was too early to cast blame, but also suggested the pilot may have come under pressure from the Polish president and his delegation to land, despite the severe fog blanketing the approach to the airport.Russian officials said 24 bodies from the crash had been identified. These were passengers whose bodies were not badly mutilated in the accident or had their passports with them, they said. All bodies had now been brought to Moscow. Forensic and criminal experts were trying to identify the others.Relatives of the victims arrived in Moscow tonight to help with the process of identification. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who is heading a government commission to investigate the crash, told Polish TV: \"This is a horrible tragedy \u2013 96 people have died. This is first of all the tragedy of Poland and the Polish people. But this is our tragedy as well. We are grieving together with you. Our hearts go out to you.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Russia", "World news", "Vladimir Putin", "Europe"], "title": "Poland mourns president as plane crash investigation begins"},{"date": "2010-04-13T18:00:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The forests around Smolensk evoked dread in the Polish soul long before the tragic airplane accident that claimed the life of President Lech Kaczynski, his wife Maria and 94 others at the weekend.\"Katyn\" is shorthand for the events of 70 years ago, when an estimated 22,000 prisoners held in Soviet internment camps were murdered on Stalin's orders. Many of the prisoners, who were shot in the base of the skull by the NKVD, found their final resting place in the mass graves of Katyn Forest just outside Smolensk. Among the victims were professional army officers and reservists drawn from Poland's police forces and university-educated elites. One of them was Aleksander Wielebnowski, my great-grandfather.While it is impossible to overstate the significance of what is known as the Katyn massacre in Poland's collective memory, until 1989 this collective memory was officially suppressed and only maintained by thousands of families.Unlike national narratives that often form when the essence of shared experiences is captured by a writer, poet or statesman, the Katyn memory was formed through the fragmented suffering of the families of the victims, so unlike the public outpouring which has characterised the aftermath of the recent accident.My grandfather's story is not special \u2013 it is typical of the experiences of many in his generation. I wish to share it here not to evoke sympathy for him or for Poland, but to better explain why Kaczynski and a plane full of dignitaries and victim's families tried to touch down in the fog of Smolensk, and why recent Russian gestures, both before and after the plane accident, mean so much to the people of Poland and offer so much hope for reconciliation.My grandfather, Jerzy, grew up in Lutsk in what is today a large Ukrainian city. In September 1939, Jerzy was nine years old, and one day his father, a reserve officer, did not return home after he was arrested in his office at the local police headquarters.\"We first received a card letting us know that he was in an internment camp in January 1940,\" he recalls. \"He said that he was in Ostashkov, and that he was feeling well despite the cold winter. He tried to raise our spirits and he believed that he would come back.\"On 12 April 1940, Jerzy, his mother and his three siblings were woken up at 3am by an NKVD officer and two soldiers who stood at their door.\"The NKVD man told us that we would go to see our family,\" he recalls. \"This is what the Soviets would say back then. This was one of their ways of dealing with people.\"Instead, the family was sent east to a labour camp in Pavlodar, in modern Kazakhstan. Wielebnowski does not believe that they would have survived, but after the Soviet Union joined the war on the side of the allies, a friendly commissar's wife petitioned the NKVD for their release and they were evacuated, first to Tehran, and then to Lusaka where Jerzy spent the remainder of the war in an orphanage for Polish children.They returned in 1947, finding a Polish state dominated by the Soviet Union.\"My mother was 47 years old and still hoped to find my father, so we came back. But, just as we crossed the border she noticed that the secret police, questioning all the returnees, took away one of the men that we were travelling with. When she saw this, she said 'Kids, what have we done! We should not have returned'.\"Jerzy enrolled in school and, thanks to a high school principal who advised him on how to hide his background and a friend's father who worked in a city office and who falsely vouched for his working-class upbringing, he was able to attend university.\"At the time, the officials were trying to destroy young people with my background, but I managed to get by. In 1954 I finished my studies in architecture at the university in Gdansk. Could you imagine that? A policeman's son? If anyone found out what my family background was, I would have been thrown out, and probably ended up breaking boulders or mining uranium with a penal workcrew.\"The word \"Katyn\" remained painful when it was whispered in the post-war darkness when the truth was sacrificed on the altar of \"eternal friendship\" between the Polish and Soviet communist states. This is the reason why it was aggressively shouted after 1989 when the archive doors slowly began to open, reluctantly revealing what had happened to the victims.\"I only found out in 1990 what happened to my father. We always suspected what his fate was, but until we saw something final, like a list, we could never be certain. In 1990, Lech Walesa received the lists from Boris Yeltsin and those lists were given to families like ours looking for relatives. My father's name appears on 16 April 1940. He is listed 10th on a list of about 250 prisoners taken from Ostashkov to Tver, where he was executed in an NKVD building. That's when I finally knew what had happened to him.\"In 1992, Jerzy visited Ostashkov, Tver and Mednoje, where his father lies in a mass grave.In Ostashkov, he walked through the remains in the NKVD camp in an old island monastery, but found no signs of the prisoners. In Tver, he saw the room where the prisoners were executed, and in Mednoje he got angry.\"They built a summer recreational home for the NKVD on the site, and the latrines leaked into the mass grave. For me, as a son of someone who is laying there, I protest with every ounce of my being. This is unacceptable, and every time I speak about this, I choke up a little.\"In the aftermath of the crash, Poles are avoiding the \"second Katyn\" moniker that was used by Timothy Garton Ash, calling this the \"tragedy in Smolensk\" instead. This is apt, since this time the victims do not have to wait decades for information, and people both in Poland and abroad have publicly poured their hearts out while the Russian authorities are assisting the families at every turn.\"It is welcome and it is genuine,\" Jerzy said. \"And I hope that things will change. In the Soviet system, everything was possible and nothing was sacred. Today, memory is sacred again.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Russia", "Second world war", "War crimes", "World news", "Law", "Europe"], "title": "Memory is sacred again in Poland | Kris Kotarski"},{"date": "2010-04-12T10:21:48Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Schools across Poland observed a minute's silence this morning, two days after the air crash that claimed the life of the country's president and a swath of the political and military elite.In Warsaw, work was interrupted to allow groups to be taken to the presidential palace to lay candles and flowers and to sign condolence books.President Lech Kaczynski's coffin was brought to the palace yesterday after a slow, six-mile procession witnessed by hundreds of thousands of people. Preparations are under way for his lying in state, and the public is expected to be able to pay their respects from tomorrow.Parliament is set to gather to discuss proposals for a new head of the national bank, after the death in Saturday's crash of 47-year old Slawomir Skrzypek, who had been in the post for three years. Activity on Warsaw's stock exchange was said to be normal, and the national currency was solid despite fears the catastrophe might destabilise the country's economy.In addition to putting the pieces of government together, representatives of the president and prime minister were due to meet to discuss details of funerals for the 96 people who died.Kaczynski's body was returned to Warsaw yesterday, but those of his wife and other victims remain in Moscow, many still awaiting identification. A mass funeral is planned for Saturday in Warsaw's Pilsudski square, as Russian authorities have indicated that all of the bodies can be returned to Warsaw by Thursday.Poland's ambassador to Paris, Tomasz Orlowski, has been recalled to the capital to head the funeral arrangements after the death in Smolensk of Mariusz Kazana, chief of protocol at the ministry of foreign affairs, who would have been responsible for the plans.Fourteen of the bodies were identifiable on sight in Russia, but the rest were said by Russian experts to have been too badly charred in the accident. Families of the victims flew to Moscow last night accompanied by psychologists to help in the identification process, much of which will be carried out through DNA testing.Accident investigators continue to investigate the cause of the crash. Pavel Plusnin, a Russian air traffic controller who was the last person to talk to the crew of the president's Tupolew 154 before it crashed in dense fog into a grove of trees, told a Moscow news portal that he had had difficulties understanding the crew, who he claimed had spoken poor Russian. \"Numbers were hard for them, so I could not determine their altitude,\" he said.Polish newspapers yesterday were replete with full-page black and white death notices, with lists of names and titles. As details of the victims came to light, it emerged today that the ill-fated plane's crew, headed by the pilot Arkadiusz Protasiuk, a 36-year old father-of-two, as well as the co-pilot, navigator and technician, had recently been on a humanitarian mission to Haiti, for which they had received distinctions from their air force commander.The accident claimed the lives of many of the president's entourage, his personal chaplain, the top brass of the military, the deputy foreign minister, a former president, the head of the Olympic committee, historians and conservationists.

The election will also determine how it reacts to the new debt crisis.Komorowski is a pro-EU, moderate member of the governing Civic Platform party who has pledged to work closely with the prime minister, Donald Tusk, to adopt the euro in about five years, end the unpopular military mission in Afghanistan and promote pro-market reforms.Kaczynski is a social conservative who has pledged to fight crime and corruption, scale back market reforms in order to preserve a strong welfare state and promote Roman Catholic values in public life. More sceptical about the EU and the euro, Kaczynski says it is too early to set a timetable for giving up the Polish currency, the zloty.Kaczynski, a former prime minister, is known for his nationalism and his combative tone. But he has struck a more moderate tone since his brother's death. Many Poles are unsure whether the change is permanent or a strategy to win over middle-of-the-road voters.Opinions were split in Warsaw early today. Komorowski's supporters stressed his calm and ties to the governmentk, while backers of Kaczynski called him trustworthy and said he truly cares for Poland's interests.Jan Rostafinski said he voted for Komorowski, whom he knows personally. \"He is the best among the candidates: he has rich experience, moderate views and a sense of humour, which the predecessor was lacking, or at least so it seemed. Komorowski will represent Poland well,\" Rostafinski said.But Ewa Stawinska said she would vote for Kaczynski because she thought it was better for the president and the prime minister to be from different parties. She liked the fact that he stands for Catholic values in public life and believed he would push for a thorough investigation of the plane crash that Poles call the \"Smolensk tragedy\".Lech Kaczynski and his wife were among 96 people killed when their plane crashed while trying to land in heavy fog in Smolensk, Russia, on 10 April.

Kaczynski leaves a daughter, Marta, and two granddaughters.Gordon Brown said: \"The whole world will be saddened and in sorrow as a result of this tragic death in a plane crash of President Kaczynski and his wife Maria and the party that were with him. I think we know the difficulties that Poland has gone through and the sacrifices that he himself made as part of the Solidarity movement, and we know the contribution he made to the independence and the freedom of Poland.\"The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she was \"deeply dismayed by the plane crash and the death of the Polish president\", while France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, hailed him as a \"tireless defender\" of liberty and \"the fight against totalitarianism\". Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev, also sent his condolences.The subject of Katyn has for decades been a source of unresolved friction between Moscow and Warsaw \u2013 with successive Soviet governments falsely blaming the Nazis for the massacre. Recently, however, tensions had been easing, with Tusk and Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime minister, attending a joint ceremony at Katyn last Wednesday. Putin and Tusk were due to travel to Smolensk to inspect the crash site.Kaczynski had said he would seek a second term in presidential elections this autumn. He was expected to face an uphill struggle against the speaker, Bronislaw Komorowski, the candidate of Tusk's governing Civic Platform party. Komorowski yesterday took over Kaczynski's job as head of state, a largely symbolic role. The election will be brought forward, with Poles set to go to the polls to choose a new president by the end of June.Polish officials have long discussed replacing the planes that carry the country's leaders but said they lacked the funds.

It was overhauled in December in Russia, with Russian experts yesterday insisting that it was airworthy and blaming pilot error and bad weather.Among the victims was Anna Walentynowicz, whose dismissal in August 1980 from the Lenin shipyards in the Polish port of Gdansk ignited the strike that led to the creation of the Solidarity movement and, ultimately, the collapse of communist rule.

Many of the prisoners, who were shot in the base of the skull by the NKVD, found their final resting place in the mass graves of Katyn Forest just outside Smolensk. Among the victims were professional army officers and reservists drawn from Poland's police forces and university-educated elites. One of them was Aleksander Wielebnowski, my great-grandfather.While it is impossible to overstate the significance of what is known as the Katyn massacre in Poland's collective memory, until 1989 this collective memory was officially suppressed and only maintained by thousands of families.Unlike national narratives that often form when the essence of shared experiences is captured by a writer, poet or statesman, the Katyn memory was formed through the fragmented suffering of the families of the victims, so unlike the public outpouring which has characterised the aftermath of the recent accident.My grandfather's story is not special \u2013 it is typical of the experiences of many in his generation. I wish to share it here not to evoke sympathy for him or for Poland, but to better explain why Kaczynski and a plane full of dignitaries and victim's families tried to touch down in the fog of Smolensk, and why recent Russian gestures, both before and after the plane accident, mean so much to the people of Poland and offer so much hope for reconciliation.My grandfather, Jerzy, grew up in Lutsk in what is today a large Ukrainian city. In September 1939, Jerzy was nine years old, and one day his father, a reserve officer, did not return home after he was arrested in his office at the local police headquarters.\"We first received a card letting us know that he was in an internment camp in January 1940,\" he recalls. \"He said that he was in Ostashkov, and that he was feeling well despite the cold winter. He tried to raise our spirits and he believed that he would come back.\"On 12 April 1940, Jerzy, his mother and his three siblings were woken up at 3am by an NKVD officer and two soldiers who stood at their door.\"The NKVD man told us that we would go to see our family,\" he recalls. \"This is what the Soviets would say back then. This was one of their ways of dealing with people.\"Instead, the family was sent east to a labour camp in Pavlodar, in modern Kazakhstan. Wielebnowski does not believe that they would have survived, but after the Soviet Union joined the war on the side of the allies, a friendly commissar's wife petitioned the NKVD for their release and they were evacuated, first to Tehran, and then to Lusaka where Jerzy spent the remainder of the war in an orphanage for Polish children.They returned in 1947, finding a Polish state dominated by the Soviet Union.\"My mother was 47 years old and still hoped to find my father, so we came back. But, just as we crossed the border she noticed that the secret police, questioning all the returnees, took away one of the men that we were travelling with. When she saw this, she said 'Kids, what have we done! We should not have returned'.\"Jerzy enrolled in school and, thanks to a high school principal who advised him on how to hide his background and a friend's father who worked in a city office and who falsely vouched for his working-class upbringing, he was able to attend university.\"At the time, the officials were trying to destroy young people with my background, but I managed to get by. In 1954 I finished my studies in architecture at the university in Gdansk. Could you imagine that? A policeman's son? If anyone found out what my family background was, I would have been thrown out, and probably ended up breaking boulders or mining uranium with a penal workcrew.\"The word \"Katyn\" remained painful when it was whispered in the post-war darkness when the truth was sacrificed on the altar of \"eternal friendship\" between the Polish and Soviet communist states. This is the reason why it was aggressively shouted after 1989 when the archive doors slowly began to open, reluctantly revealing what had happened to the victims.\"I only found out in 1990 what happened to my father. We always suspected what his fate was, but until we saw something final, like a list, we could never be certain. In 1990, Lech Walesa received the lists from Boris Yeltsin and those lists were given to families like ours looking for relatives. My father's name appears on 16 April 1940. He is listed 10th on a list of about 250 prisoners taken from Ostashkov to Tver, where he was executed in an NKVD building. That's when I finally knew what had happened to him.\"In 1992, Jerzy visited Ostashkov, Tver and Mednoje, where his father lies in a mass grave.In Ostashkov, he walked through the remains in the NKVD camp in an old island monastery, but found no signs of the prisoners. In Tver, he saw the room where the prisoners were executed, and in Mednoje he got angry.\"They built a summer recreational home for the NKVD on the site, and the latrines leaked into the mass grave. For me, as a son of someone who is laying there, I protest with every ounce of my being. This is unacceptable, and every time I speak about this, I choke up a little.\"In the aftermath of the crash, Poles are avoiding the \"second Katyn\" moniker that was used by Timothy Garton Ash, calling this the \"tragedy in Smolensk\" instead. This is apt, since this time the victims do not have to wait decades for information, and people both in Poland and abroad have publicly poured their hearts out while the Russian authorities are assisting the families at every turn.\"It is welcome and it is genuine,\" Jerzy said. \"And I hope that things will change. In the Soviet system, everything was possible and nothing was sacred.

Preparations are under way for his lying in state, and the public is expected to be able to pay their respects from tomorrow.Parliament is set to gather to discuss proposals for a new head of the national bank, after the death in Saturday's crash of 47-year old Slawomir Skrzypek, who had been in the post for three years. Activity on Warsaw's stock exchange was said to be normal, and the national currency was solid despite fears the catastrophe might destabilise the country's economy.In addition to putting the pieces of government together, representatives of the president and prime minister were due to meet to discuss details of funerals for the 96 people who died.Kaczynski's body was returned to Warsaw yesterday, but those of his wife and other victims remain in Moscow, many still awaiting identification. A mass funeral is planned for Saturday in Warsaw's Pilsudski square, as Russian authorities have indicated that all of the bodies can be returned to Warsaw by Thursday.Poland's ambassador to Paris, Tomasz Orlowski, has been recalled to the capital to head the funeral arrangements after the death in Smolensk of Mariusz Kazana, chief of protocol at the ministry of foreign affairs, who would have been responsible for the plans.Fourteen of the bodies were identifiable on sight in Russia, but the rest were said by Russian experts to have been too badly charred in the accident. Families of the victims flew to Moscow last night accompanied by psychologists to help in the identification process, much of which will be carried out through DNA testing.Accident investigators continue to investigate the cause of the crash. Pavel Plusnin, a Russian air traffic controller who was the last person to talk to the crew of the president's Tupolew 154 before it crashed in dense fog into a grove of trees, told a Moscow news portal that he had had difficulties understanding the crew, who he claimed had spoken poor Russian. \"Numbers were hard for them, so I could not determine their altitude,\" he said.Polish newspapers yesterday were replete with full-page black and white death notices, with lists of names and titles. As details of the victims came to light, it emerged today that the ill-fated plane's crew, headed by the pilot Arkadiusz Protasiuk, a 36-year old father-of-two, as well as the co-pilot, navigator and technician, had recently been on a humanitarian mission to Haiti, for which they had received distinctions from their air force commander.The accident claimed the lives of many of the president's entourage, his personal chaplain, the top brass of the military, the deputy foreign minister, a former president, the head of the Olympic committee, historians and conservationists.

The election will also determine how it reacts to the new debt crisis.Komorowski is a pro-EU, moderate member of the governing Civic Platform party who has pledged to work closely with the prime minister, Donald Tusk, to adopt the euro in about five years, end the unpopular military mission in Afghanistan and promote pro-market reforms.Kaczynski is a social conservative who has pledged to fight crime and corruption, scale back market reforms in order to preserve a strong welfare state and promote Roman Catholic values in public life. More sceptical about the EU and the euro, Kaczynski says it is too early to set a timetable for giving up the Polish currency, the zloty.Kaczynski, a former prime minister, is known for his nationalism and his combative tone. But he has struck a more moderate tone since his brother's death. Many Poles are unsure whether the change is permanent or a strategy to win over middle-of-the-road voters.Opinions were split in Warsaw early today. Komorowski's supporters stressed his calm and ties to the governmentk, while backers of Kaczynski called him trustworthy and said he truly cares for Poland's interests.Jan Rostafinski said he voted for Komorowski, whom he knows personally. \"He is the best among the candidates: he has rich experience, moderate views and a sense of humour, which the predecessor was lacking, or at least so it seemed. Komorowski will represent Poland well,\" Rostafinski said.But Ewa Stawinska said she would vote for Kaczynski because she thought it was better for the president and the prime minister to be from different parties. She liked the fact that he stands for Catholic values in public life and believed he would push for a thorough investigation of the plane crash that Poles call the \"Smolensk tragedy\".Lech Kaczynski and his wife were among 96 people killed when their plane crashed while trying to land in heavy fog in Smolensk, Russia, on 10 April. The delegation included many high-ranking civilian and military leaders, and the loss provoked deep grief across the nation. Many officials have called it Poland's worst tragedy since the second world war.More than 30 million of Poland's 38 million citizens are registered to vote in nearly 26,000 polling stations across.One opinion poll published on Friday by the Rzeczpospolita daily newspaper showed Komorowski had the support of 42% of those surveyed, to Kaczynski's 31%.", "tags": ["Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski", "Poland", "European Union", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Polish election: Voters go to polls to choose late president's successor"},{"date": "2010-04-11T15:12:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Thousands of people lined the streets of Warsaw today to pay their last respects as the body of the Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, was flown back to the country.The flag-draped coffin was met by Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw, and his daughter Marta at Warsaw airport. Thousands lined the streets in silence along the route to the presidential palace where the body was taken.Poland held a two-minute silence earlier to mark the death of the president, his wife and dozens of officials in a plane crash in western Russia yesterday.Russian officials said 97 people died, including eight crew members, after the president's Tupolev plane clipped trees on its approach to Smolensk airport in thick fog. There were no survivors. Russian TV showed pictures of the upended wing and smouldering fuselage. Small fires burned in woods shrouded in fog.Rescuers found several unidentified bodies and the plane's black box.This morning, the bodies of the victims arrived in Moscow by helicopter for identification. Relatives were expected to fly to the Russian capital later today.Jaroslaw Kaczynski visited the crash site last night, with TV pictures showing him kneeling and praying.

In a tragic twist, family members of the Katyn victims were on board the president's plane. Others were waiting at the airport.There was no suspicion of foul play, but the extraordinary timing and location of the disaster, together with Kaczynski's known antipathy towards the Kremlin, are likely to fuel conspiracy theories on both sides.The Kremlin failed to invite Kaczynski to a ceremony in Katyn last Wednesday attended by Tusk and Putin. Kaczynski organised his own separate event. Newspapers bearing headlines such as \"Katyn \u2013 a double tragedy\" lay next to portraits of some of the crash victims.The subject of Katyn has for decades been a source of unresolved friction between Moscow and Warsaw, with successive Soviet governments falsely blaming the Nazis for the massacre. Recently, there have been signs that the tensions were easing. Last week, Putin became the first Russian or Soviet leader to join Polish officials in commemorating the massacre's anniversary when he met Tusk in Katyn.\"We still cannot fully understand the scope of this tragedy and what it means for us in the future. Nothing like this has ever happened in Poland,\" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Piotr Paszkowski. \"We can assume with great certainty that all persons on board have been killed.\"Russian officials said that the airport, 270 miles west of Moscow, had been closed because of thick fog. They advised the pilot to land instead in Moscow or Minsk, but he continued with the original flight plan, making three abortive attempts to land at Smolensk's Severny military airport. On the fourth attempt, the Russian-built airliner crashed. According to witnesses, Kaczynski's plane was between 500 and 700 metres from the runway, and about 20 metres from the ground when it ploughed into the trees.\"The Polish presidential plane did not make it to the runway while landing.

She was with the president's twin brother, Jaroslaw, the country's acting president, Bronislaw Komorowski, and the prime minister, Donald Tusk.As the late president lay in state at the palace, Russian air accident investigators gave their initial findings of the cause of the crash, which claimed 96 lives, including the head of the national bank, the leaders of all four branches of the military, the head of the Olympic committee, several champions of the country's struggle against communist dictatorship, historians and civil servants.The investigators said there was no evidence of technical failure on the 26-year-old Tupolev 154 and blamed pilot error.Deciphered recordings of conversations between the pilot and air traffic control on the ground in Smolensk did not indicate any problems in the crucial few seconds before the crash, Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the Russian's prosecutor's office, said.\"We have deciphered the tape reel and conducted a preliminary analysis. We will look in more detail in Moscow, but I repeat: the recording that we have confirms that there were no technical problems with the plane,\" he said. \"The pilot was informed about the difficult weather conditions, and yet he decided to make the landing.\"But speculation was rife that the president's own entourage might have insisted the pilot continue the flight, despite orders from Russian air traffic control for the plane to land in Minsk or Moscow due to the bad weather conditions in Smolensk.The high-profile delegation was on a tight schedule on Saturday to attend a memorial service for the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre. Kaczynski was known for his assertiveness towards pilots who had flown him on official business in the past.In a widely reported case in 2008, he flew to Tbilisi in his presidential plane during the war in Georgia. When his pilot refused to land in the Georgian capital, insisting it was too dangerous to do so, Kaczynski reportedly entered the cockpit and tried to change his mind. The pilot refused, and the party landed in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, and was forced to travel the remaining stretch to Georgia by car over arduous mountain roads. Attempts were subsequently made to sue the pilot for failing to obey orders, but the case was thrown out by prosecutors.The former Polish president Lech Walesa said it was too early to cast blame, but also suggested the pilot may have come under pressure from the Polish president and his delegation to land, despite the severe fog blanketing the approach to the airport.Russian officials said 24 bodies from the crash had been identified. These were passengers whose bodies were not badly mutilated in the accident or had their passports with them, they said. All bodies had now been brought to Moscow. Forensic and criminal experts were trying to identify the others.Relatives of the victims arrived in Moscow tonight to help with the process of identification. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who is heading a government commission to investigate the crash, told Polish TV: \"This is a horrible tragedy \u2013 96 people have died.

Many of the prisoners, who were shot in the base of the skull by the NKVD, found their final resting place in the mass graves of Katyn Forest just outside Smolensk. Among the victims were professional army officers and reservists drawn from Poland's police forces and university-educated elites. One of them was Aleksander Wielebnowski, my great-grandfather.While it is impossible to overstate the significance of what is known as the Katyn massacre in Poland's collective memory, until 1989 this collective memory was officially suppressed and only maintained by thousands of families.Unlike national narratives that often form when the essence of shared experiences is captured by a writer, poet or statesman, the Katyn memory was formed through the fragmented suffering of the families of the victims, so unlike the public outpouring which has characterised the aftermath of the recent accident.My grandfather's story is not special \u2013 it is typical of the experiences of many in his generation. I wish to share it here not to evoke sympathy for him or for Poland, but to better explain why Kaczynski and a plane full of dignitaries and victim's families tried to touch down in the fog of Smolensk, and why recent Russian gestures, both before and after the plane accident, mean so much to the people of Poland and offer so much hope for reconciliation.My grandfather, Jerzy, grew up in Lutsk in what is today a large Ukrainian city. In September 1939, Jerzy was nine years old, and one day his father, a reserve officer, did not return home after he was arrested in his office at the local police headquarters.\"We first received a card letting us know that he was in an internment camp in January 1940,\" he recalls. \"He said that he was in Ostashkov, and that he was feeling well despite the cold winter. He tried to raise our spirits and he believed that he would come back.\"On 12 April 1940, Jerzy, his mother and his three siblings were woken up at 3am by an NKVD officer and two soldiers who stood at their door.\"The NKVD man told us that we would go to see our family,\" he recalls. \"This is what the Soviets would say back then. This was one of their ways of dealing with people.\"Instead, the family was sent east to a labour camp in Pavlodar, in modern Kazakhstan. Wielebnowski does not believe that they would have survived, but after the Soviet Union joined the war on the side of the allies, a friendly commissar's wife petitioned the NKVD for their release and they were evacuated, first to Tehran, and then to Lusaka where Jerzy spent the remainder of the war in an orphanage for Polish children.They returned in 1947, finding a Polish state dominated by the Soviet Union.\"My mother was 47 years old and still hoped to find my father, so we came back. But, just as we crossed the border she noticed that the secret police, questioning all the returnees, took away one of the men that we were travelling with. When she saw this, she said 'Kids, what have we done! We should not have returned'.\"Jerzy enrolled in school and, thanks to a high school principal who advised him on how to hide his background and a friend's father who worked in a city office and who falsely vouched for his working-class upbringing, he was able to attend university.\"At the time, the officials were trying to destroy young people with my background, but I managed to get by. In 1954 I finished my studies in architecture at the university in Gdansk. Could you imagine that? A policeman's son? If anyone found out what my family background was, I would have been thrown out, and probably ended up breaking boulders or mining uranium with a penal workcrew.\"The word \"Katyn\" remained painful when it was whispered in the post-war darkness when the truth was sacrificed on the altar of \"eternal friendship\" between the Polish and Soviet communist states. This is the reason why it was aggressively shouted after 1989 when the archive doors slowly began to open, reluctantly revealing what had happened to the victims.\"I only found out in 1990 what happened to my father. We always suspected what his fate was, but until we saw something final, like a list, we could never be certain. In 1990, Lech Walesa received the lists from Boris Yeltsin and those lists were given to families like ours looking for relatives. My father's name appears on 16 April 1940. He is listed 10th on a list of about 250 prisoners taken from Ostashkov to Tver, where he was executed in an NKVD building. That's when I finally knew what had happened to him.\"In 1992, Jerzy visited Ostashkov, Tver and Mednoje, where his father lies in a mass grave.In Ostashkov, he walked through the remains in the NKVD camp in an old island monastery, but found no signs of the prisoners. In Tver, he saw the room where the prisoners were executed, and in Mednoje he got angry.\"They built a summer recreational home for the NKVD on the site, and the latrines leaked into the mass grave. For me, as a son of someone who is laying there, I protest with every ounce of my being. This is unacceptable, and every time I speak about this, I choke up a little.\"In the aftermath of the crash, Poles are avoiding the \"second Katyn\" moniker that was used by Timothy Garton Ash, calling this the \"tragedy in Smolensk\" instead. This is apt, since this time the victims do not have to wait decades for information, and people both in Poland and abroad have publicly poured their hearts out while the Russian authorities are assisting the families at every turn.\"It is welcome and it is genuine,\" Jerzy said. \"And I hope that things will change. In the Soviet system, everything was possible and nothing was sacred.

Preparations are under way for his lying in state, and the public is expected to be able to pay their respects from tomorrow.Parliament is set to gather to discuss proposals for a new head of the national bank, after the death in Saturday's crash of 47-year old Slawomir Skrzypek, who had been in the post for three years. Activity on Warsaw's stock exchange was said to be normal, and the national currency was solid despite fears the catastrophe might destabilise the country's economy.In addition to putting the pieces of government together, representatives of the president and prime minister were due to meet to discuss details of funerals for the 96 people who died.Kaczynski's body was returned to Warsaw yesterday, but those of his wife and other victims remain in Moscow, many still awaiting identification. A mass funeral is planned for Saturday in Warsaw's Pilsudski square, as Russian authorities have indicated that all of the bodies can be returned to Warsaw by Thursday.Poland's ambassador to Paris, Tomasz Orlowski, has been recalled to the capital to head the funeral arrangements after the death in Smolensk of Mariusz Kazana, chief of protocol at the ministry of foreign affairs, who would have been responsible for the plans.Fourteen of the bodies were identifiable on sight in Russia, but the rest were said by Russian experts to have been too badly charred in the accident. Families of the victims flew to Moscow last night accompanied by psychologists to help in the identification process, much of which will be carried out through DNA testing.Accident investigators continue to investigate the cause of the crash. Pavel Plusnin, a Russian air traffic controller who was the last person to talk to the crew of the president's Tupolew 154 before it crashed in dense fog into a grove of trees, told a Moscow news portal that he had had difficulties understanding the crew, who he claimed had spoken poor Russian. \"Numbers were hard for them, so I could not determine their altitude,\" he said.Polish newspapers yesterday were replete with full-page black and white death notices, with lists of names and titles. As details of the victims came to light, it emerged today that the ill-fated plane's crew, headed by the pilot Arkadiusz Protasiuk, a 36-year old father-of-two, as well as the co-pilot, navigator and technician, had recently been on a humanitarian mission to Haiti, for which they had received distinctions from their air force commander.The accident claimed the lives of many of the president's entourage, his personal chaplain, the top brass of the military, the deputy foreign minister, a former president, the head of the Olympic committee, historians and conservationists.

The election will also determine how it reacts to the new debt crisis.Komorowski is a pro-EU, moderate member of the governing Civic Platform party who has pledged to work closely with the prime minister, Donald Tusk, to adopt the euro in about five years, end the unpopular military mission in Afghanistan and promote pro-market reforms.Kaczynski is a social conservative who has pledged to fight crime and corruption, scale back market reforms in order to preserve a strong welfare state and promote Roman Catholic values in public life. More sceptical about the EU and the euro, Kaczynski says it is too early to set a timetable for giving up the Polish currency, the zloty.Kaczynski, a former prime minister, is known for his nationalism and his combative tone. But he has struck a more moderate tone since his brother's death. Many Poles are unsure whether the change is permanent or a strategy to win over middle-of-the-road voters.Opinions were split in Warsaw early today. Komorowski's supporters stressed his calm and ties to the governmentk, while backers of Kaczynski called him trustworthy and said he truly cares for Poland's interests.Jan Rostafinski said he voted for Komorowski, whom he knows personally. \"He is the best among the candidates: he has rich experience, moderate views and a sense of humour, which the predecessor was lacking, or at least so it seemed. Komorowski will represent Poland well,\" Rostafinski said.But Ewa Stawinska said she would vote for Kaczynski because she thought it was better for the president and the prime minister to be from different parties. She liked the fact that he stands for Catholic values in public life and believed he would push for a thorough investigation of the plane crash that Poles call the \"Smolensk tragedy\".Lech Kaczynski and his wife were among 96 people killed when their plane crashed while trying to land in heavy fog in Smolensk, Russia, on 10 April. The delegation included many high-ranking civilian and military leaders, and the loss provoked deep grief across the nation. Many officials have called it Poland's worst tragedy since the second world war.More than 30 million of Poland's 38 million citizens are registered to vote in nearly 26,000 polling stations across.One opinion poll published on Friday by the Rzeczpospolita daily newspaper showed Komorowski had the support of 42% of those surveyed, to Kaczynski's 31%.", "tags": ["Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski", "Poland", "European Union", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Polish election: Voters go to polls to choose late president's successor"},{"date": "2010-04-11T15:12:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Thousands of people lined the streets of Warsaw today to pay their last respects as the body of the Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, was flown back to the country.The flag-draped coffin was met by Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw, and his daughter Marta at Warsaw airport. Thousands lined the streets in silence along the route to the presidential palace where the body was taken.Poland held a two-minute silence earlier to mark the death of the president, his wife and dozens of officials in a plane crash in western Russia yesterday.Russian officials said 97 people died, including eight crew members, after the president's Tupolev plane clipped trees on its approach to Smolensk airport in thick fog. There were no survivors. Russian TV showed pictures of the upended wing and smouldering fuselage. Small fires burned in woods shrouded in fog.Rescuers found several unidentified bodies and the plane's black box.This morning, the bodies of the victims arrived in Moscow by helicopter for identification. Relatives were expected to fly to the Russian capital later today.Jaroslaw Kaczynski visited the crash site last night, with TV pictures showing him kneeling and praying. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, also flew to Smolensk from Warsaw where he met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and placed a wreath.Across Poland bells were rung at a slow and mournful pace. People sought solace in churches and laid candles at national monuments and government buildings. Mourners queued in their hundreds to sign books of condolences. \"I can't fathom this, it reminds me of when the pope died, five years ago this month,\" said Zofia, recalling the death of Pope John Paul II on 5 April 2005.Kaczynski had been flying to Smolensk to attend the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre, when Soviet secret police killed 15,000 Polish officers in one of the most notorious atrocities of the second world war. In a tragic twist, family members of the Katyn victims were on board the president's plane. Others were waiting at the airport.There was no suspicion of foul play, but the extraordinary timing and location of the disaster, together with Kaczynski's known antipathy towards the Kremlin, are likely to fuel conspiracy theories on both sides.The Kremlin failed to invite Kaczynski to a ceremony in Katyn last Wednesday attended by Tusk and Putin. Kaczynski organised his own separate event. Newspapers bearing headlines such as \"Katyn \u2013 a double tragedy\" lay next to portraits of some of the crash victims.The subject of Katyn has for decades been a source of unresolved friction between Moscow and Warsaw, with successive Soviet governments falsely blaming the Nazis for the massacre. Recently, there have been signs that the tensions were easing. Last week, Putin became the first Russian or Soviet leader to join Polish officials in commemorating the massacre's anniversary when he met Tusk in Katyn.\"We still cannot fully understand the scope of this tragedy and what it means for us in the future. Nothing like this has ever happened in Poland,\" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Piotr Paszkowski. \"We can assume with great certainty that all persons on board have been killed.\"Russian officials said that the airport, 270 miles west of Moscow, had been closed because of thick fog. They advised the pilot to land instead in Moscow or Minsk, but he continued with the original flight plan, making three abortive attempts to land at Smolensk's Severny military airport. On the fourth attempt, the Russian-built airliner crashed. According to witnesses, Kaczynski's plane was between 500 and 700 metres from the runway, and about 20 metres from the ground when it ploughed into the trees.\"The Polish presidential plane did not make it to the runway while landing. Tentative findings indicate that it hit the treetops and fell apart,\" said Smolensk's governor, Sergei Anufriev.World leaders yesterday paid tribute to Kaczynski, who was elected in 2005 after defeating Tusk in a presidential vote. He and his twin brother, Jaroslaw, a former prime minister now in opposition, emerged from Poland's anti-communist Solidarity movement. They have dominated Polish politics for the last decade, espousing a national conservative \u2013 and often anti-Russian \u2013 ideology. Kaczynski leaves a daughter, Marta, and two granddaughters.Gordon Brown said: \"The whole world will be saddened and in sorrow as a result of this tragic death in a plane crash of President Kaczynski and his wife, Maria, and the party that were with him. I think we know the difficulties that Poland has gone through and the sacrifices that he himself made as part of the Solidarity movement, and we know the contribution he made to the independence and the freedom of Poland.\"Kaczynski had said he would seek a second term in presidential elections this autumn. He was expected to face an uphill struggle against the speaker, Bronislaw Komorowski, the candidate of Tusk's governing Civic Platform party. Komorowski has taken over Kaczynski's job as head of state, a largely symbolic role. The election will be brought forward, with Poles set to go to the polls to choose a new president by the end of June.Polish officials have long discussed replacing the planes that carry the country's leaders but said they lacked the funds.

It was overhauled in December in Russia, with Russian experts insisting that it was airworthy and blaming pilot error and bad weather.Among the victims was Anna Walentynowicz, whose dismissal in August 1980 from the Lenin shipyards in the Polish port of Gdansk ignited the strike that led to the creation of the Solidarity movement and, ultimately, the collapse of communist rule.

She was with the president's twin brother, Jaroslaw, the country's acting president, Bronislaw Komorowski, and the prime minister, Donald Tusk.As the late president lay in state at the palace, Russian air accident investigators gave their initial findings of the cause of the crash, which claimed 96 lives, including the head of the national bank, the leaders of all four branches of the military, the head of the Olympic committee, several champions of the country's struggle against communist dictatorship, historians and civil servants.The investigators said there was no evidence of technical failure on the 26-year-old Tupolev 154 and blamed pilot error.Deciphered recordings of conversations between the pilot and air traffic control on the ground in Smolensk did not indicate any problems in the crucial few seconds before the crash, Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the Russian's prosecutor's office, said.\"We have deciphered the tape reel and conducted a preliminary analysis. We will look in more detail in Moscow, but I repeat: the recording that we have confirms that there were no technical problems with the plane,\" he said. \"The pilot was informed about the difficult weather conditions, and yet he decided to make the landing.\"But speculation was rife that the president's own entourage might have insisted the pilot continue the flight, despite orders from Russian air traffic control for the plane to land in Minsk or Moscow due to the bad weather conditions in Smolensk.The high-profile delegation was on a tight schedule on Saturday to attend a memorial service for the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre. Kaczynski was known for his assertiveness towards pilots who had flown him on official business in the past.In a widely reported case in 2008, he flew to Tbilisi in his presidential plane during the war in Georgia. When his pilot refused to land in the Georgian capital, insisting it was too dangerous to do so, Kaczynski reportedly entered the cockpit and tried to change his mind. The pilot refused, and the party landed in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, and was forced to travel the remaining stretch to Georgia by car over arduous mountain roads. Attempts were subsequently made to sue the pilot for failing to obey orders, but the case was thrown out by prosecutors.The former Polish president Lech Walesa said it was too early to cast blame, but also suggested the pilot may have come under pressure from the Polish president and his delegation to land, despite the severe fog blanketing the approach to the airport.Russian officials said 24 bodies from the crash had been identified. These were passengers whose bodies were not badly mutilated in the accident or had their passports with them, they said. All bodies had now been brought to Moscow. Forensic and criminal experts were trying to identify the others.Relatives of the victims arrived in Moscow tonight to help with the process of identification. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who is heading a government commission to investigate the crash, told Polish TV: \"This is a horrible tragedy \u2013 96 people have died.

I grew up in\u00a0what used to be called a working-class household. I tried to think of a politically correct equivalent, and I came up with \"people of restricted taste\". We didn't have classical music on in the house; it wasn't for the likes of us. I still feel, when I'm listening to classical music (and I like it a lot), as if I'm pretending. It's worse when I go to\u00a0the\u00a0theatre, where I feel as if I've wandered into a particularly middle-class drawing room with a game of charades going on. I want to stand up and say: \"Stop pretending!\"I understand the efforts of cultural institutions to attract a wider audience, because the visual arts have been through a very similar game. When I\u00a0started out as an artist 30 years ago, it\u00a0seemed a very rarefied, obscure activity. I got into it because I liked drawing, really. But I climbed the greasy pole, and I was a little bit cheesed-off, when I finally got up into the middle-class stratosphere of the art world, that it had suddenly decided to go all accessible. Galleries were full of school parties, baby buggies, people taking photographs with their phones \u2013 democratising art. Perhaps it is churlish of me to complain, when I\u00a0have benefited from the popularity of\u00a0contemporary art. Class travellers can\u00a0be\u00a0the worst kind of snobs.Classical music has gone through a similar sort of transition. It's let its accent slip, it's put on a bit of lipstick, dabbed on some hair gel. But a word of advice, classical musicians: avoid the c-word. Cool is a word that often crops up when it comes to talking about art,\u00a0and it's always bugged me. Being\u00a0creative is all about being unselfconscious; being prepared to\u00a0make a bit of a fool of myself. In my\u00a0experience, embarrassment is not\u00a0fatal.Few groups are straighter or more conservative than teenagers, who take\u00a0cool seriously. And what makes cool very immature in my book is that it's a\u00a0binary judgment: hip v square; in\u00a0v out. The other week, I quizzed my\u00a015-year-old neighbour about what the current words for \"cool\" were. He\u00a0told me that cool can be \"sick\" or\u00a0\"nang\", and uncool is \"wack\". Or interestingly, considering the attention span of the modern youth, uncool can\u00a0be \"long\". As in: \"Man, that opera\u00a0was long.\"I'd like to make a plea for difficulty over cool. In the end, I think being difficult is the coolest thing you can be. One of my guiding principles in life has\u00a0been to follow the path of most resistance: as soon as I start doing something well, I get bored. So I try\u00a0to\u00a0do something a bit harder.When I listen to a piece of classical music, what makes me well up is not just the melody, or the musicians' interpretation, it is the thought of the thousands and thousands of hours of practice. I'm in awe of the rigour, the dedication. Musicians seem to have a much clearer sense of what they're aiming for. In art nowadays, there's a terrible sense that anything goes \u2013 it makes me a bit sad. Musicians must continue to make difficult work, music that I can aspire to understand \u2013 and do it for the love of it. Here in the arts, we have to set a good example.This is an edited extract from a lecture given at the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards on Tuesday.

Many of the prisoners, who were shot in the base of the skull by the NKVD, found their final resting place in the mass graves of Katyn Forest just outside Smolensk. Among the victims were professional army officers and reservists drawn from Poland's police forces and university-educated elites. One of them was Aleksander Wielebnowski, my great-grandfather.While it is impossible to overstate the significance of what is known as the Katyn massacre in Poland's collective memory, until 1989 this collective memory was officially suppressed and only maintained by thousands of families.Unlike national narratives that often form when the essence of shared experiences is captured by a writer, poet or statesman, the Katyn memory was formed through the fragmented suffering of the families of the victims, so unlike the public outpouring which has characterised the aftermath of the recent accident.My grandfather's story is not special \u2013 it is typical of the experiences of many in his generation. I wish to share it here not to evoke sympathy for him or for Poland, but to better explain why Kaczynski and a plane full of dignitaries and victim's families tried to touch down in the fog of Smolensk, and why recent Russian gestures, both before and after the plane accident, mean so much to the people of Poland and offer so much hope for reconciliation.My grandfather, Jerzy, grew up in Lutsk in what is today a large Ukrainian city. In September 1939, Jerzy was nine years old, and one day his father, a reserve officer, did not return home after he was arrested in his office at the local police headquarters.\"We first received a card letting us know that he was in an internment camp in January 1940,\" he recalls. \"He said that he was in Ostashkov, and that he was feeling well despite the cold winter. He tried to raise our spirits and he believed that he would come back.\"On 12 April 1940, Jerzy, his mother and his three siblings were woken up at 3am by an NKVD officer and two soldiers who stood at their door.\"The NKVD man told us that we would go to see our family,\" he recalls. \"This is what the Soviets would say back then. This was one of their ways of dealing with people.\"Instead, the family was sent east to a labour camp in Pavlodar, in modern Kazakhstan. Wielebnowski does not believe that they would have survived, but after the Soviet Union joined the war on the side of the allies, a friendly commissar's wife petitioned the NKVD for their release and they were evacuated, first to Tehran, and then to Lusaka where Jerzy spent the remainder of the war in an orphanage for Polish children.They returned in 1947, finding a Polish state dominated by the Soviet Union.\"My mother was 47 years old and still hoped to find my father, so we came back. But, just as we crossed the border she noticed that the secret police, questioning all the returnees, took away one of the men that we were travelling with. When she saw this, she said 'Kids, what have we done! We should not have returned'.\"Jerzy enrolled in school and, thanks to a high school principal who advised him on how to hide his background and a friend's father who worked in a city office and who falsely vouched for his working-class upbringing, he was able to attend university.\"At the time, the officials were trying to destroy young people with my background, but I managed to get by. In 1954 I finished my studies in architecture at the university in Gdansk. Could you imagine that? A policeman's son? If anyone found out what my family background was, I would have been thrown out, and probably ended up breaking boulders or mining uranium with a penal workcrew.\"The word \"Katyn\" remained painful when it was whispered in the post-war darkness when the truth was sacrificed on the altar of \"eternal friendship\" between the Polish and Soviet communist states. This is the reason why it was aggressively shouted after 1989 when the archive doors slowly began to open, reluctantly revealing what had happened to the victims.\"I only found out in 1990 what happened to my father. We always suspected what his fate was, but until we saw something final, like a list, we could never be certain. In 1990, Lech Walesa received the lists from Boris Yeltsin and those lists were given to families like ours looking for relatives. My father's name appears on 16 April 1940. He is listed 10th on a list of about 250 prisoners taken from Ostashkov to Tver, where he was executed in an NKVD building. That's when I finally knew what had happened to him.\"In 1992, Jerzy visited Ostashkov, Tver and Mednoje, where his father lies in a mass grave.In Ostashkov, he walked through the remains in the NKVD camp in an old island monastery, but found no signs of the prisoners. In Tver, he saw the room where the prisoners were executed, and in Mednoje he got angry.\"They built a summer recreational home for the NKVD on the site, and the latrines leaked into the mass grave. For me, as a son of someone who is laying there, I protest with every ounce of my being. This is unacceptable, and every time I speak about this, I choke up a little.\"In the aftermath of the crash, Poles are avoiding the \"second Katyn\" moniker that was used by Timothy Garton Ash, calling this the \"tragedy in Smolensk\" instead. This is apt, since this time the victims do not have to wait decades for information, and people both in Poland and abroad have publicly poured their hearts out while the Russian authorities are assisting the families at every turn.\"It is welcome and it is genuine,\" Jerzy said. \"And I hope that things will change. In the Soviet system, everything was possible and nothing was sacred. Today, memory is sacred again.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Russia", "Second world war", "War crimes", "World news", "Law", "Europe"], "title": "Memory is sacred again in Poland | Kris Kotarski"},{"date": "2010-04-12T10:21:48Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Schools across Poland observed a minute's silence this morning, two days after the air crash that claimed the life of the country's president and a swath of the political and military elite.In Warsaw, work was interrupted to allow groups to be taken to the presidential palace to lay candles and flowers and to sign condolence books.President Lech Kaczynski's coffin was brought to the palace yesterday after a slow, six-mile procession witnessed by hundreds of thousands of people. Preparations are under way for his lying in state, and the public is expected to be able to pay their respects from tomorrow.Parliament is set to gather to discuss proposals for a new head of the national bank, after the death in Saturday's crash of 47-year old Slawomir Skrzypek, who had been in the post for three years. Activity on Warsaw's stock exchange was said to be normal, and the national currency was solid despite fears the catastrophe might destabilise the country's economy.In addition to putting the pieces of government together, representatives of the president and prime minister were due to meet to discuss details of funerals for the 96 people who died.Kaczynski's body was returned to Warsaw yesterday, but those of his wife and other victims remain in Moscow, many still awaiting identification. A mass funeral is planned for Saturday in Warsaw's Pilsudski square, as Russian authorities have indicated that all of the bodies can be returned to Warsaw by Thursday.Poland's ambassador to Paris, Tomasz Orlowski, has been recalled to the capital to head the funeral arrangements after the death in Smolensk of Mariusz Kazana, chief of protocol at the ministry of foreign affairs, who would have been responsible for the plans.Fourteen of the bodies were identifiable on sight in Russia, but the rest were said by Russian experts to have been too badly charred in the accident. Families of the victims flew to Moscow last night accompanied by psychologists to help in the identification process, much of which will be carried out through DNA testing.Accident investigators continue to investigate the cause of the crash. Pavel Plusnin, a Russian air traffic controller who was the last person to talk to the crew of the president's Tupolew 154 before it crashed in dense fog into a grove of trees, told a Moscow news portal that he had had difficulties understanding the crew, who he claimed had spoken poor Russian. \"Numbers were hard for them, so I could not determine their altitude,\" he said.Polish newspapers yesterday were replete with full-page black and white death notices, with lists of names and titles. As details of the victims came to light, it emerged today that the ill-fated plane's crew, headed by the pilot Arkadiusz Protasiuk, a 36-year old father-of-two, as well as the co-pilot, navigator and technician, had recently been on a humanitarian mission to Haiti, for which they had received distinctions from their air force commander.The accident claimed the lives of many of the president's entourage, his personal chaplain, the top brass of the military, the deputy foreign minister, a former president, the head of the Olympic committee, historians and conservationists.

The election will also determine how it reacts to the new debt crisis.Komorowski is a pro-EU, moderate member of the governing Civic Platform party who has pledged to work closely with the prime minister, Donald Tusk, to adopt the euro in about five years, end the unpopular military mission in Afghanistan and promote pro-market reforms.Kaczynski is a social conservative who has pledged to fight crime and corruption, scale back market reforms in order to preserve a strong welfare state and promote Roman Catholic values in public life. More sceptical about the EU and the euro, Kaczynski says it is too early to set a timetable for giving up the Polish currency, the zloty.Kaczynski, a former prime minister, is known for his nationalism and his combative tone. But he has struck a more moderate tone since his brother's death. Many Poles are unsure whether the change is permanent or a strategy to win over middle-of-the-road voters.Opinions were split in Warsaw early today. Komorowski's supporters stressed his calm and ties to the governmentk, while backers of Kaczynski called him trustworthy and said he truly cares for Poland's interests.Jan Rostafinski said he voted for Komorowski, whom he knows personally. \"He is the best among the candidates: he has rich experience, moderate views and a sense of humour, which the predecessor was lacking, or at least so it seemed. Komorowski will represent Poland well,\" Rostafinski said.But Ewa Stawinska said she would vote for Kaczynski because she thought it was better for the president and the prime minister to be from different parties. She liked the fact that he stands for Catholic values in public life and believed he would push for a thorough investigation of the plane crash that Poles call the \"Smolensk tragedy\".Lech Kaczynski and his wife were among 96 people killed when their plane crashed while trying to land in heavy fog in Smolensk, Russia, on 10 April. The delegation included many high-ranking civilian and military leaders, and the loss provoked deep grief across the nation. Many officials have called it Poland's worst tragedy since the second world war.More than 30 million of Poland's 38 million citizens are registered to vote in nearly 26,000 polling stations across.One opinion poll published on Friday by the Rzeczpospolita daily newspaper showed Komorowski had the support of 42% of those surveyed, to Kaczynski's 31%.", "tags": ["Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski", "Poland", "European Union", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Polish election: Voters go to polls to choose late president's successor"},{"date": "2010-04-11T15:12:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Thousands of people lined the streets of Warsaw today to pay their last respects as the body of the Polish president, Lech Kaczynski, was flown back to the country.The flag-draped coffin was met by Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw, and his daughter Marta at Warsaw airport. Thousands lined the streets in silence along the route to the presidential palace where the body was taken.Poland held a two-minute silence earlier to mark the death of the president, his wife and dozens of officials in a plane crash in western Russia yesterday.Russian officials said 97 people died, including eight crew members, after the president's Tupolev plane clipped trees on its approach to Smolensk airport in thick fog. There were no survivors. Russian TV showed pictures of the upended wing and smouldering fuselage. Small fires burned in woods shrouded in fog.Rescuers found several unidentified bodies and the plane's black box.This morning, the bodies of the victims arrived in Moscow by helicopter for identification. Relatives were expected to fly to the Russian capital later today.Jaroslaw Kaczynski visited the crash site last night, with TV pictures showing him kneeling and praying. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, also flew to Smolensk from Warsaw where he met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and placed a wreath.Across Poland bells were rung at a slow and mournful pace. People sought solace in churches and laid candles at national monuments and government buildings.

In a tragic twist, family members of the Katyn victims were on board the president's plane. Others were waiting at the airport.There was no suspicion of foul play, but the extraordinary timing and location of the disaster, together with Kaczynski's known antipathy towards the Kremlin, are likely to fuel conspiracy theories on both sides.The Kremlin failed to invite Kaczynski to a ceremony in Katyn last Wednesday attended by Tusk and Putin. Kaczynski organised his own separate event. Newspapers bearing headlines such as \"Katyn \u2013 a double tragedy\" lay next to portraits of some of the crash victims.The subject of Katyn has for decades been a source of unresolved friction between Moscow and Warsaw, with successive Soviet governments falsely blaming the Nazis for the massacre. Recently, there have been signs that the tensions were easing. Last week, Putin became the first Russian or Soviet leader to join Polish officials in commemorating the massacre's anniversary when he met Tusk in Katyn.\"We still cannot fully understand the scope of this tragedy and what it means for us in the future. Nothing like this has ever happened in Poland,\" said a foreign ministry spokesman, Piotr Paszkowski. \"We can assume with great certainty that all persons on board have been killed.\"Russian officials said that the airport, 270 miles west of Moscow, had been closed because of thick fog. They advised the pilot to land instead in Moscow or Minsk, but he continued with the original flight plan, making three abortive attempts to land at Smolensk's Severny military airport. On the fourth attempt, the Russian-built airliner crashed. According to witnesses, Kaczynski's plane was between 500 and 700 metres from the runway, and about 20 metres from the ground when it ploughed into the trees.\"The Polish presidential plane did not make it to the runway while landing. Tentative findings indicate that it hit the treetops and fell apart,\" said Smolensk's governor, Sergei Anufriev.World leaders yesterday paid tribute to Kaczynski, who was elected in 2005 after defeating Tusk in a presidential vote. He and his twin brother, Jaroslaw, a former prime minister now in opposition, emerged from Poland's anti-communist Solidarity movement. They have dominated Polish politics for the last decade, espousing a national conservative \u2013 and often anti-Russian \u2013 ideology. Kaczynski leaves a daughter, Marta, and two granddaughters.Gordon Brown said: \"The whole world will be saddened and in sorrow as a result of this tragic death in a plane crash of President Kaczynski and his wife, Maria, and the party that were with him. I think we know the difficulties that Poland has gone through and the sacrifices that he himself made as part of the Solidarity movement, and we know the contribution he made to the independence and the freedom of Poland.\"Kaczynski had said he would seek a second term in presidential elections this autumn. He was expected to face an uphill struggle against the speaker, Bronislaw Komorowski, the candidate of Tusk's governing Civic Platform party. Komorowski has taken over Kaczynski's job as head of state, a largely symbolic role. The election will be brought forward, with Poles set to go to the polls to choose a new president by the end of June.Polish officials have long discussed replacing the planes that carry the country's leaders but said they lacked the funds.

It was overhauled in December in Russia, with Russian experts insisting that it was airworthy and blaming pilot error and bad weather.Among the victims was Anna Walentynowicz, whose dismissal in August 1980 from the Lenin shipyards in the Polish port of Gdansk ignited the strike that led to the creation of the Solidarity movement and, ultimately, the collapse of communist rule.

She was with the president's twin brother, Jaroslaw, the country's acting president, Bronislaw Komorowski, and the prime minister, Donald Tusk.As the late president lay in state at the palace, Russian air accident investigators gave their initial findings of the cause of the crash, which claimed 96 lives, including the head of the national bank, the leaders of all four branches of the military, the head of the Olympic committee, several champions of the country's struggle against communist dictatorship, historians and civil servants.The investigators said there was no evidence of technical failure on the 26-year-old Tupolev 154 and blamed pilot error.Deciphered recordings of conversations between the pilot and air traffic control on the ground in Smolensk did not indicate any problems in the crucial few seconds before the crash, Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the Russian's prosecutor's office, said.\"We have deciphered the tape reel and conducted a preliminary analysis. We will look in more detail in Moscow, but I repeat: the recording that we have confirms that there were no technical problems with the plane,\" he said. \"The pilot was informed about the difficult weather conditions, and yet he decided to make the landing.\"But speculation was rife that the president's own entourage might have insisted the pilot continue the flight, despite orders from Russian air traffic control for the plane to land in Minsk or Moscow due to the bad weather conditions in Smolensk.The high-profile delegation was on a tight schedule on Saturday to attend a memorial service for the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre. Kaczynski was known for his assertiveness towards pilots who had flown him on official business in the past.In a widely reported case in 2008, he flew to Tbilisi in his presidential plane during the war in Georgia. When his pilot refused to land in the Georgian capital, insisting it was too dangerous to do so, Kaczynski reportedly entered the cockpit and tried to change his mind. The pilot refused, and the party landed in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, and was forced to travel the remaining stretch to Georgia by car over arduous mountain roads. Attempts were subsequently made to sue the pilot for failing to obey orders, but the case was thrown out by prosecutors.The former Polish president Lech Walesa said it was too early to cast blame, but also suggested the pilot may have come under pressure from the Polish president and his delegation to land, despite the severe fog blanketing the approach to the airport.Russian officials said 24 bodies from the crash had been identified. These were passengers whose bodies were not badly mutilated in the accident or had their passports with them, they said. All bodies had now been brought to Moscow. Forensic and criminal experts were trying to identify the others.Relatives of the victims arrived in Moscow tonight to help with the process of identification. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who is heading a government commission to investigate the crash, told Polish TV: \"This is a horrible tragedy \u2013 96 people have died.

Komorowski, the speaker of parliament, and an ally of prime minister Donald Tusk, has been acting president since the air disaster. The outpouring of national sympathy encouraged Jaroslaw Kaczynski to try to replace his twin. He marked their 61st birthdays on Friday at the Krakow cathedral where Lech is buried.A former prime minister whose rightwing Law and Justice party governed from 2005-7, Jaroslaw has been the more formidable strategist of the pair, but his administration proved chaotic, divisive and confrontational at home and abroad.His twin's death softened a notoriously abrasive outlook, but a talking point of the presidential election concerned the degree to his transformation from bruiser to healer was genuine, or merely tactical. While Komorowski was expected to win, his campaign failed to inspire, although, unlike Kaczynski, he is pro-European Union.While mainly ceremonial, the president can veto legislation, powers that Lech Kaczynski used to stymie Tusk and which Jaroslaw hoped to continue.", "tags": ["Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski", "Poland", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Poland rejects Jaroslaw Kaczynski as exit polls give Bronislaw Komorowski lead in presidential election"},{"date": "2010-05-12T21:35:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Whatever happens next in politics, there will be cuts to the cultural sector. The arts might be amazingly valuable to this country, but politicians know that artists are a minority, and an endangered minority. Very few people are going to bleat loudly if highbrow entertainment gets a bit of\u00a0a\u00a0pinch.In the runup to the election, there was little talk about the arts. I read an interview with Chris Smith, the former culture secretary, and he put it down to\u00a0the fact that people such as Alastair Campbell thought real people watched football and went to pop concerts. When politicians use the word \"real\", they usually mean depressingly average, sentimental, bitter and anti-intellectual types.Arts organisations will, of course, respond to these threatening cuts. I was recently at an event at the British Museum \u2013 the Cultural Capital campaign \u2013 and lined up on the stage were all the panjandrums of high culture: Nicholas Serota, Neil MacGregor, Jude Kelly, Nicholas Hytner, Alan Davey, head of Arts Council England. They spoke about how important the creative industries are to the economy: it's estimated at 8% of GDP, an incredible amount when you think how few people are employed in it. But I\u00a0had a suspicion that they were like the glamorous lost leaders of\u00a0UK Culture PLC, and that the real money is\u00a0now made by computer game designers, high street fashion and \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 Top Gear doing well in\u00a0Poland.We all care about the quality of our culture, but are the tears shed at an opera any better than those shed at a football match? Are they better quality tears? People sometimes talk as if there is a vintage type of tear that is shed only at Glyndebourne.Throughout my career, I have suffered terribly from what I would call\u00a0\"impostor syndrome\". I grew up in\u00a0what used to be called a working-class household. I tried to think of a politically correct equivalent, and I came up with \"people of restricted taste\". We didn't have classical music on in the house; it wasn't for the likes of us. I still feel, when I'm listening to classical music (and I like it a lot), as if I'm pretending. It's worse when I go to\u00a0the\u00a0theatre, where I feel as if I've wandered into a particularly middle-class drawing room with a game of charades going on. I want to stand up and say: \"Stop pretending!\"I understand the efforts of cultural institutions to attract a wider audience, because the visual arts have been through a very similar game. When I\u00a0started out as an artist 30 years ago, it\u00a0seemed a very rarefied, obscure activity. I got into it because I liked drawing, really. But I climbed the greasy pole, and I was a little bit cheesed-off, when I finally got up into the middle-class stratosphere of the art world, that it had suddenly decided to go all accessible. Galleries were full of school parties, baby buggies, people taking photographs with their phones \u2013 democratising art. Perhaps it is churlish of me to complain, when I\u00a0have benefited from the popularity of\u00a0contemporary art. Class travellers can\u00a0be\u00a0the worst kind of snobs.Classical music has gone through a similar sort of transition. It's let its accent slip, it's put on a bit of lipstick, dabbed on some hair gel. But a word of advice, classical musicians: avoid the c-word. Cool is a word that often crops up when it comes to talking about art,\u00a0and it's always bugged me. Being\u00a0creative is all about being unselfconscious; being prepared to\u00a0make a bit of a fool of myself. In my\u00a0experience, embarrassment is not\u00a0fatal.Few groups are straighter or more conservative than teenagers, who take\u00a0cool seriously. And what makes cool very immature in my book is that it's a\u00a0binary judgment: hip v square; in\u00a0v out. The other week, I quizzed my\u00a015-year-old neighbour about what the current words for \"cool\" were. He\u00a0told me that cool can be \"sick\" or\u00a0\"nang\", and uncool is \"wack\". Or interestingly, considering the attention span of the modern youth, uncool can\u00a0be \"long\". As in: \"Man, that opera\u00a0was long.\"I'd like to make a plea for difficulty over cool. In the end, I think being difficult is the coolest thing you can be. One of my guiding principles in life has\u00a0been to follow the path of most resistance: as soon as I start doing something well, I get bored. So I try\u00a0to\u00a0do something a bit harder.When I listen to a piece of classical music, what makes me well up is not just the melody, or the musicians' interpretation, it is the thought of the thousands and thousands of hours of practice. I'm in awe of the rigour, the dedication. Musicians seem to have a much clearer sense of what they're aiming for. In art nowadays, there's a terrible sense that anything goes \u2013 it makes me a bit sad. Musicians must continue to make difficult work, music that I can aspire to understand \u2013 and do it for the love of it. Here in the arts, we have to set a good example.This is an edited extract from a lecture given at the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards on Tuesday.

The stories were nonsense, they said, and Labour-inspired lies.I remember once being told to stop writing that \"ghastly stuff\" about the views of the Poles as it was all wrong and not helpful and I was just being urged on by Labour. It was a shameful defensive spin operation led by William Hague and the shadow Europe minister, Mark Francois, who had allowed their Eurosceptic zeal to cloud their judgment and any sense of what journalism is.Their reaction to the fact that independent journalists had unhelpfully revealed the truth about their new best friends in Europe was to attack the messengers in the free press.Also at that time, the Tories also tried to maintain that they had checked out the likes of Micha\u0142 Kami\u0144ski, the Polish leader of the new group in the European parliament. Kami\u0144ski, although on record as having called gay people \"poofs\", was a true moderniser, they said. He and his colleagues in Poland, and members of other parties in Latvia and the Czech Republic with which the Tories had linked up, were part of the European mainstream, was the Tory line.They were being honest about the fact they had checked them out \u2013 but dishonest about the findings of their investigations. As the Observer revealed earlier this month, in 2007 the Conservatives compiled their own internal and lengthy report on Law and Justice and the other parties they were to join up with two years later. It was never published, though. It revealed that Law and Justice and other parties now in the new grouping did have extremist tendencies and would be unsuitable partners.J\u00f3zef Pinior, a respected Polish Socialist and an ex-MEP, saw the report (he was shown it by Tory friends in the parliament) and remembers what it said. Its conclusion was clear \u2013 that the Tories should be very wary of forming an alliance with such people because they had homophobic tendencies and, in the case of the Polish, many had links with Radio Maryja, the Catholic fundamentalist outlet that gives airtime to those with hardline antisemitic views.Despite all this, and under pressure from their own Eurosceptic wing to get out of the pro-federal European People's party, the Tories decided to embrace them anyway. Last year, the new Tory group was formed. A very senior Conservative MEP who complained about the alliance, and about Kami\u0144ski, Edward McMillan-Scott, was duly expelled from the Tory party after 40 years of service.Furthermore, a new book by a Polish academic, Rafal Pankowski, now shows that anyone with any knowledge of Polish politics would have been aware by 2005 that PiS was peddling views massively out of kilter with the socially liberal Conservatism that Cameron was promoting in the UK.The book also shows in detail the close links between the PiS and Radio Maryja.There was no doubt about the facts then. And, as Cameron now admits, there is none now. But in the interim there was a shocking Tory determination to hide them.Will the Tories now withdraw their assertion that those who highlighted the facts last autumn were part of a Labour-led smear operation? As Cameron now tacitly admits by sending his envoy Herbert to Poland, they were nothing of the sort. Rather journalists were doing their job. And for doing it they became the object of a Tory smear operation aimed at killing off an important story.The truth has caught up with the Conservatives on this one. So belatedly, and knowing it has, Cameron is sending Herbert off to Poland to try to persuade the PiS to change its views. The Poles are \"on a journey\", Cameron now says.", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "General election 2010", "European Union", "Conservatives", "LGBT rights", "Poland", "World news", "Europe"], "title": "Tories and Poland: this is an admission from David Cameron that EU allies' homophobia is a problem | Toby Helm"},{"date": "2010-07-05T23:05:49Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland's presidential election was fought in the shadow cast by a plane crash that not only killed Lech Kaczynski but cut a swathe through the nationalist party he and his twin brother Jaroslaw had created.

He arrived in Warsaw on Wednesday to attend the World Chechen Congress, a meeting of Chechen exiles.Zakayev is the most high-profile surviving Chechen separatist leader from the 1990s, when he served as deputy prime minister in the quasi-independent government of Aslan Maskhadov.The British court decision to grant asylum on the basis he might be tortured in Russia enraged the Kremlin, and contributed to a slump in UK-Russian relations.Russia's prosecutor general, Yuri Chaika, phoned his Polish counterpart and passed on details of Zakayev's alleged involvement in terrorist activities. Russia had issued a warrant via Interpol for his arrest, and has been seeking his return for nearly a decade.But Zakayev's friends said they were confident he would not be sent back to Russia, where he would face jail. \"He is approaching it all with a large dose of calm,\" Adam Borowski, a conference organiser who was with him at the time of his arrest, told the Associated Press. \"He says he believes Poland, as a democratic country, will not believe Russia's fabricated evidence. He believes Poland will not extradite him.\"He was released last night by a Warsaw court, although Borowski said he will have to remain in the country pending a decision on his extradition. Since being granted asylum Zakayev has often travelled in Europe, visiting Poland three times this year, including three weeks ago. A London magistrates court struck out the original Russian arrest warrant in 2003. Up until now, EU states have accepted the London verdict.\"There is no reason to detain him. He should be able to rejoin the congress,\" Ivar Amundsen, director of the Chechnya Peace Forum, said. He blamed political pressure from Moscow for the arrest: \"The congress shines a light on Russia's war crimes in the Caucasus. They [the Russians] don't like that,\" he told the Guardian.Russo-Polish ties have improved after a plane crash in April that killed Poland's president Lech Kaczynski. Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, denied his government had acted on Kremlin orders.Tusk told national radio a decision on Zakayev's extradition would be taken \"in accordance with our understanding of Poland's interests, and with our sense of decency and justice. We will not be trying to meet anybody's expectations\".Last year Chechnya's Kremlin-installed president, Ramzan Kadyrov, tried to persuade Zakayev to return home, offering him a job as theatre director in the capital, Grozny. Zakayev, a former actor and the head of Chechnya's government-in-exile, held a series of discussions in Europe with Kadyrov's trusted aide Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov about political reconciliation. The plan fell through after Russia refused to drop outstanding terrorist charges against him. At the same time, Chechnya's current Islamist rebel leadership denounced Zakayev as a traitor and announced their intention to kill him.Today Kadyrov said Zakayev should be handed back to Russia for trial, and then sentenced to life in prison.Zakayev entered politics in 1994 as culture minister under Chechnya's first separatist president. He left Chechnya in 1999 after being wounded. His charisma has won him supporters including the actor Vanessa Redgrave, who has campaigned on his behalf and paid \u00a362,600 bail after he was detained at Heathrow in 2002. He has said he represents the Chechen separatist political faction, and distanced himself from radical Islamist rebels.This year he denounced the militant leader Doku Umarov who claimed responsibility for the Moscow subway bombings in March.

He arrived in Warsaw on Wednesday to attend the World Chechen Congress, a meeting of Chechen exiles.Zakayev is the most high-profile surviving Chechen separatist leader from the 1990s, when he served as deputy prime minister in the quasi-independent government of Aslan Maskhadov.The British court decision to grant asylum on the basis he might be tortured in Russia enraged the Kremlin, and contributed to a slump in UK-Russian relations.Russia's prosecutor general, Yuri Chaika, phoned his Polish counterpart and passed on details of Zakayev's alleged involvement in terrorist activities. Russia had issued a warrant via Interpol for his arrest, and has been seeking his return for nearly a decade.But Zakayev's friends said they were confident he would not be sent back to Russia, where he would face jail. \"He is approaching it all with a large dose of calm,\" Adam Borowski, a conference organiser who was with him at the time of his arrest, told the Associated Press. \"He says he believes Poland, as a democratic country, will not believe Russia's fabricated evidence. He believes Poland will not extradite him.\"He was released last night by a Warsaw court, although Borowski said he will have to remain in the country pending a decision on his extradition. Since being granted asylum Zakayev has often travelled in Europe, visiting Poland three times this year, including three weeks ago. A London magistrates court struck out the original Russian arrest warrant in 2003. Up until now, EU states have accepted the London verdict.\"There is no reason to detain him. He should be able to rejoin the congress,\" Ivar Amundsen, director of the Chechnya Peace Forum, said. He blamed political pressure from Moscow for the arrest: \"The congress shines a light on Russia's war crimes in the Caucasus. They [the Russians] don't like that,\" he told the Guardian.Russo-Polish ties have improved after a plane crash in April that killed Poland's president Lech Kaczynski. Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, denied his government had acted on Kremlin orders.Tusk told national radio a decision on Zakayev's extradition would be taken \"in accordance with our understanding of Poland's interests, and with our sense of decency and justice. We will not be trying to meet anybody's expectations\".Last year Chechnya's Kremlin-installed president, Ramzan Kadyrov, tried to persuade Zakayev to return home, offering him a job as theatre director in the capital, Grozny. Zakayev, a former actor and the head of Chechnya's government-in-exile, held a series of discussions in Europe with Kadyrov's trusted aide Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov about political reconciliation. The plan fell through after Russia refused to drop outstanding terrorist charges against him. At the same time, Chechnya's current Islamist rebel leadership denounced Zakayev as a traitor and announced their intention to kill him.Today Kadyrov said Zakayev should be handed back to Russia for trial, and then sentenced to life in prison.Zakayev entered politics in 1994 as culture minister under Chechnya's first separatist president. He left Chechnya in 1999 after being wounded. His charisma has won him supporters including the actor Vanessa Redgrave, who has campaigned on his behalf and paid \u00a362,600 bail after he was detained at Heathrow in 2002.

The Conservative opposition leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, (whose Law and Justice party is allied with the Tories), says his short-lived pact with the League was a mistake. Poland is the first ex-communist state in the EU to host Europride, which is a reasonable achievement, but not that surprising: the country has long pioneered tolerance, from the Statute of Kalisz to the Confederation of Warsaw to being the first European country to decriminalise homosexuality in 1932 (it took 35 years for Britain to catch up). Local \"tolerance parades\" have taken place in Poland for years, even when a former Warsaw mayor, the late Lech Kaczynski, refused to authorise one (he didn't actually stop it, as is mistakenly said).There's something holier-than-thou in the western media that isn't based on up-to-date experience of Polish culture, politics and society \u2013 it seems to be about liberals working themselves up into a frenzy of self-righteousness that is as exhilarating as rightwing hate-speak itself. Hopefully, Europride Warsaw 2010 has also weakened that prejudice.On Saturday, the view of the estimated 8,000 revellers (most of them Poles) to their audience of several thousand (also Poles, of course) was telling.

In Britain, cultural ties remain strong, even as belief fades.\"People here look at you a bit strangely if you say you are a regular churchgoer,\" says Bill McIlroy, a member of Brighton's humanist and secular association. \"But while many people here don't believe, they have still got a misplaced respect for the church.\"That sense of tradition frustrates campaigners against the influence of what is now politely described as the faith community.\"People cling to the idea of religion as a source of morality,\" says Terry Sanderson, president of the National Secular Society. \"There is a general apathy: people don't want to make a fuss.\"Many Britons have at best a shallow belief in God: the most recent British Social Attitudes survey found that just a third of the population held firm religious beliefs, with another third deeply sceptical and the final third uncertain.But far fewer are prepared to go further and describe themselves as openly atheist. It was telling that Nick Clegg caused a stir when he did so soon after becoming Liberal Democrat leader.\"People prefer to talk about spirituality rather than religion, which can mean anything you want it to,\" says\u00a0Sanderson.Even Holyoake \u2013 who went on to invent the term secularism \u2013 professed himself more sceptical about religion than opposed. \"You cannot be an atheist \u2013 you do not look like one,\" his memoirs record the magistrate telling him during his trial for blasphemy.Holyoake held firm: \"Though sorry to say what might outrage them or look like obstinacy, yet out of respect to my own conscience I must say that I was an\u00a0atheist.\"But by the end of his life he preferred to use the newly devised term agnostic. That still best fits the mainstream British view.According to demographer David Voas at Manchester University: \"The part of the population that is properly religious is a minority, but so is that part which is overtly secular. In the middle is an informal group of fuzzy people who don't really care.\"Britain is not, as some think, the most secular nation in Europe; it is less so than Scandinavia and parts of the former Soviet bloc.Migrant communities are the most committed \u2013 even long-standing ones, such as Irish Catholics who dominate what Voas calls \"the British bible belt\u00a0running from Merseyside to Wigan\u00a0pier\".Most other people are less engaged, although measuring belief is difficult and the data conflicting.Much depends on how questions are asked and whether they refer to broad cultural identity or practical belief.The census, which records the highest level of religious belief, assumes people are adherents of one religion or another and actively asks them to choose from a list.In 2001, more than two-thirds selected Christian and well under a fifth no religion. That, says Voas, overstates the reality of British religious belief. Asked to choose Christian rather than Muslim or Hindu, people see it as an ethnic identity. Voas argues that the British Social Attitudes survey, which found over half the population holding no strong religious views, is a better measure.Other polls go further. In a 2006 Guardian/ICM poll only 33% described themselves as religious, against 63% who said they were not \u2013 including a majority who described themselves more broadly as culturally Christian.Women and older people were more likely than average to believe in a god, but overall only 13% said they went to a place of worship at least once a week. More people saw religion as a force for harm than for good.That suggests a country where religion is on the retreat. \"There is a huge change \u2013 the trend is towards secularism,\" says Sanderson.Others, pointing to the impact of migration, from Catholic Poland as well as the Indian subcontinent, are less sure.The country's religious makeup is fragmenting as the Church of England declines. \"It is not the case that Britain is getting more religious,\" says Voas.The pope will find himself on an island full of doubters.", "tags": ["Religion", "Pope Benedict XVI", "UK news", "The papacy"], "title": "Not atheist, not religious: Typical Briton is a 'fuzzy believer'"},{"date": "2010-07-05T23:05:49Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland's presidential election was fought in the shadow cast by a plane crash that not only killed Lech Kaczynski but cut a swathe through the nationalist party he and his twin brother Jaroslaw had created. If before the plane crash Jaroslaw regarded himself as Lech's protector, after it, he assumed in his grief some of his lost twin's softer characteristics.To the surprise of many, Jaroslaw praised Edward Gierek, the communist leader from the 1970s as a patriot. He had softer words for traditional enemies like Russia and Germany. He no longer talked of the Democratic Left Alliance as being \"post-communist\", but about the need for Polish unity. Few had forgotten his short and divisive period of office as prime minister, when he argued that the transition to democracy after 1989 was only partial, and it was his government's task to winkle out those reds who had remained under the bed. That was only four years ago, so had the leopard changed his spots?The answer from the polls yesterday was no, although the result was close and reflected how polarised Poland had become between liberal urban elites and the conservative rural heartlands. While Kaczynski had undoubtedly reaped a sympathy vote and began closing the gap on his more centrist opponent, the tactic did not work. The leftwing vote, which held up in the first round, went to the moderate conservative Bronislaw Komorowski, a man of no great charisma, but an important member of the prime minister Donald Tusk's civic platform party. The result gives Tusk the best mandate he is likely to have to carry out reforms to the health and pension system.Why did Kaczynski fail? Partly because the ideological project he and his brother engaged on had lost its relevance to modern Poland. In their haste to make their country's long and bitter history their exclusive property, they lost sight of the generation of first-time voters who had grown up since communism \u2013 people who could travel freely and find work in other countries, like Britain and Ireland. Theirs has been a mixed experience, but it has given them a different outlook from the traditionalist, xenophobic one presented by the Law and Justice party. For them, the legitimacy with which politicians derive from their struggle with communism matters less than the lack of jobs, low wages or a functioning heath service.The government will be instinctively more europhile but is far from being left wing .

Understandable soreness at the Twinings tea factory in North Shields, which closes in September next year, is a reminder of how possessive we are about the cup that cheers.The closure is a tragedy but local unions say that staff \u2013 263 are retiring or looking for work elsewhere \u2013 have resigned themselves to last November's news that production will be transferred to Poland to save money. The firm has given long notice, training support, other jobs within the group and enhanced redundancy. Britain has benefited many times from similar closures overseas and transfers here.The bitterness, however, has come from the current scheme for Polish workers to visit the Tyne and learn its tea lore from the staff they are replacing. Not unusual, again; most of us will one day have to help someone to fill our shoes. But tea produced in Poland? No, no. That is against the laws of God and man.In a sense it is. One of the buttresses of conviction that tea is our sacred drink is the fact that it so evidently is not the continental Europeans'. Generations of UK holidaymakers have been appalled at watery rubbish in the lands where coffee rules. The United States is every bit as bad. They crown the offence by a fetish with teabags of gaudy colour and maximum complication (which, alarmingly, through globalisation, are making some headway here).Yet \"British\" tea is a sleight of hand, at its cheekiest in the marketing of Yorkshire Tea by Taylor's of Harrogate, whose adverts in distant places such as the London Underground subliminally suggest that the hills of the north are green with plantations of Camellia sinensis. When challenged, the reasoning goes that the blend is especially suited to Yorkshire water; but there are many variants of the latter, all deliciously different, and only a handful of bottled versions are available anywhere near the London Underground.We do have a case, though, against complaints of brand-theft by the world's original tea drinkers, who start beyond what you might call the Milk and Sugar Curtain, a border which follows the line of the old Iron Curtain and then loops round the Arab world, with its venerable and many-flavoured infusions. Their ceremonies are even more courtly than ours, and have the same mystique about pot-warming, pouring sequence and to-strain-or-not-to-strain \u2013 but Britons have laid down many more lives for the drink.\"Follow on!\" say the ghosts of Rudyard Kipling's imperial pioneers in Song of the Dead, \"For we are waiting, by the trails that we lost.\" Many of those trails led to survey sites for the planting of tea, or investments which failed in factories for sorting and grading its leaves. Sri Lanka rightly claims some of the best tea in the world, especially high-grown; but its industry acknowledges that it was a Briton \u2013 actually a Scotsman, but that is not far from Tyneside \u2013 who saved the day when coffee rust wiped out the island's previous staple crop in the 1860s. James Taylor's initial 19 acres at Loolecondera met the demands of Kipling's ghosts, and prompted another grand old imperial saying when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle declaimed in 1892: \"Not often is that men have the heart, when their one great industry is withered, to rear up another as rich to take its place. The tea fields of Ceylon [as Sri Lanka was then known in the UK] are as true a monument to courage as is the lion at Waterloo.\"It is much easier to say than to do, but that is the way forward for Tyneside. And who knows, it may be helped by the goodwill which comes from helping the Poles to deal with tea. In the same story, De Profundis, Conan Doyle refers to the paradox that this island's history is cosmopolitan, while so much of the European continent's has been insular.

He arrived in Warsaw on Wednesday to attend the World Chechen Congress, a meeting of Chechen exiles.Zakayev is the most high-profile surviving Chechen separatist leader from the 1990s, when he served as deputy prime minister in the quasi-independent government of Aslan Maskhadov.The British court decision to grant asylum on the basis he might be tortured in Russia enraged the Kremlin, and contributed to a slump in UK-Russian relations.Russia's prosecutor general, Yuri Chaika, phoned his Polish counterpart and passed on details of Zakayev's alleged involvement in terrorist activities. Russia had issued a warrant via Interpol for his arrest, and has been seeking his return for nearly a decade.But Zakayev's friends said they were confident he would not be sent back to Russia, where he would face jail. \"He is approaching it all with a large dose of calm,\" Adam Borowski, a conference organiser who was with him at the time of his arrest, told the Associated Press. \"He says he believes Poland, as a democratic country, will not believe Russia's fabricated evidence. He believes Poland will not extradite him.\"He was released last night by a Warsaw court, although Borowski said he will have to remain in the country pending a decision on his extradition. Since being granted asylum Zakayev has often travelled in Europe, visiting Poland three times this year, including three weeks ago. A London magistrates court struck out the original Russian arrest warrant in 2003. Up until now, EU states have accepted the London verdict.\"There is no reason to detain him. He should be able to rejoin the congress,\" Ivar Amundsen, director of the Chechnya Peace Forum, said. He blamed political pressure from Moscow for the arrest: \"The congress shines a light on Russia's war crimes in the Caucasus. They [the Russians] don't like that,\" he told the Guardian.Russo-Polish ties have improved after a plane crash in April that killed Poland's president Lech Kaczynski. Poland's prime minister, Donald Tusk, denied his government had acted on Kremlin orders.Tusk told national radio a decision on Zakayev's extradition would be taken \"in accordance with our understanding of Poland's interests, and with our sense of decency and justice. We will not be trying to meet anybody's expectations\".Last year Chechnya's Kremlin-installed president, Ramzan Kadyrov, tried to persuade Zakayev to return home, offering him a job as theatre director in the capital, Grozny. Zakayev, a former actor and the head of Chechnya's government-in-exile, held a series of discussions in Europe with Kadyrov's trusted aide Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov about political reconciliation. The plan fell through after Russia refused to drop outstanding terrorist charges against him. At the same time, Chechnya's current Islamist rebel leadership denounced Zakayev as a traitor and announced their intention to kill him.Today Kadyrov said Zakayev should be handed back to Russia for trial, and then sentenced to life in prison.Zakayev entered politics in 1994 as culture minister under Chechnya's first separatist president. He left Chechnya in 1999 after being wounded. His charisma has won him supporters including the actor Vanessa Redgrave, who has campaigned on his behalf and paid \u00a362,600 bail after he was detained at Heathrow in 2002. He has said he represents the Chechen separatist political faction, and distanced himself from radical Islamist rebels.This year he denounced the militant leader Doku Umarov who claimed responsibility for the Moscow subway bombings in March. Zakayev called the attack a \"monstrous crime\".The Chechen insurgency has evolved since the 1990s when Zakayev and other now-dead leaders sought to establish an independent state. The current generation of fighters are no longer battling for independence but want to establish a Taliban-style islamist emirate across Russia's northern caucasus.The war has spilled over from Chechnya into the volatile neighbouring republics of Ingushetia and Dagestan, where bomb attacks and shootouts between rebels and government security forces recur on a daily basis. Last week a suicide bomber killed 17 people after blowing up a crowded market in Vladikavkaz, the predominantly Christian capital of North Ossetia.The surviving separatist Chechen exiles from the 1990s have been dubbed \"constitutionalists\" to distinguish them from the radical Islamist \"military resistance\" which now dominates the insurgent hierarchy.The most powerful people currently inside Chechnya, however, are the armed followers of Kadyrov, many of whom have been absorbed into the republic's security and military structures.

Her Majesty's ambassador to Poland, Ric Todd, was also there, sporting a traditional panama hat, which stood out in the sea of curly rainbow wigs, pink feather boas and a pair of fake breasts.Is Nick's message, I wondered, to open British minds about Poland, or to open Polish minds about gay rights? Perhaps it is both. Or perhaps it is neither, and more about Conservative party public relations than anything else.Everyone knows Poland is a Catholic country, but few outsiders realise quite how fast this country is changing.On one hand, civil partnerships seem some way off, few Polish politicians endorsed Europride, and there was a big petition against it. Nobody forgets that, because of low voter turnout, an appalling (though small) fringe-right party, the League of Polish Families, joined a minority coalition government in 2006.On the other hand, record turnout in Poland's 2007 general election saw the League lose all parliamentary seats, and produced a landslide win for the liberal Civic Platform government. The Conservative opposition leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, (whose Law and Justice party is allied with the Tories), says his short-lived pact with the League was a mistake. Poland is the first ex-communist state in the EU to host Europride, which is a reasonable achievement, but not that surprising: the country has long pioneered tolerance, from the Statute of Kalisz to the Confederation of Warsaw to being the first European country to decriminalise homosexuality in 1932 (it took 35 years for Britain to catch up). Local \"tolerance parades\" have taken place in Poland for years, even when a former Warsaw mayor, the late Lech Kaczynski, refused to authorise one (he didn't actually stop it, as is mistakenly said).There's something holier-than-thou in the western media that isn't based on up-to-date experience of Polish culture, politics and society \u2013 it seems to be about liberals working themselves up into a frenzy of self-righteousness that is as exhilarating as rightwing hate-speak itself. Hopefully, Europride Warsaw 2010 has also weakened that prejudice.On Saturday, the view of the estimated 8,000 revellers (most of them Poles) to their audience of several thousand (also Poles, of course) was telling. First, there were about 2,000 police on the street \u2013 gay rights demonstrators could not have felt safer. The officers tended to look either indifferent or openly entertained. I spotted one angry counterdemonstration of about 35 skinheads, who had been rounded up into a tight circle by three ranks of beefy, black-clad, baton-wielding riot police. Apparently, eggs and plastic bottles had been thrown. There was a second group, of at most 20 youths, representing the Narodowe Odrodzenie Polski \u2013 who sniggered at their own adolescent, homophobic jokes like a class of confused British schoolboys.Nick put it like this: \"How many protesters were there compared with the numbers of people marching? They really were a tiny minority of protesters,\" he said. \"There's thousands of people here who are in support of this.\"There may have been other protest groups, but I didn't see them. They were completely outnumbered by the several thousand ordinary Polish pedestrians who had also come to see what was going on, many of whom joined the parade. There were very old Poles and very young Poles, people carrying shopping bags and newspapers, fruit-sellers from the local countryside, yuppies talking on iPhones. Almost all this diverse audience of Poles shared the same expression: they were smiling.

The town's conservative establishment prosecuted him for his outspokenness \u2013 one priest called it devilism \u2013 and it is said he was threatened with being taken from Cheltenham to Gloucester jail in chains.After his release from prison, he retreated for the last part of his life to Brighton. It was an appropriate refuge: the city is now, according to demographers, the least religious place in Britain.Yet even today Holyoake would stand out as an exception in Brighton \u2013 a man prepared to speak confidently about his lack of belief rather than fudge the issue.Most people in the Sussex city do not go to church: 27% said they had no religion in the last census.

The family house was big and rambling with lots of secret passages \u2013 the perfect place to fire the imagination. Although his parents didn't often talk about their past, they did so enough for the story to become familiar; his paternal grandparents had left London to run a successful family rubber business in Lodz, Poland; his grandmother had later fled the Nazis with her two sons and gone back to London; his grandfather had stayed on till the last possible minute when he and the gatekeeper buried the family treasure before his grandfather made a miracle escape \u2013 he was one of the last four people out of Lodz, a story reported in detail on the front page of the News of the World in 1939.Throughout his childhood, Mark thought about the treasure. But he didn't do anything about it. Childhood turned into adulthood and still he didn't act on it. Then, in 2000, his mother died and Mark and his father David decided to visit Latvia and Poland to explore their roots and distract themselves from their grief.Latvia meant little to them. They travelled on to Lodz with low expectations. Astonishingly, they found things pretty much unchanged from 70 years ago, including the family home. They rang the bell and were told in no uncertain terms to get lost. Mark saw a couple of words in Polish printed on the building and wrote them down in case they gave any clues as to the new owners of\u00a0their home. The two words were \"military\" and \"research\". The Polish army had taken over their house and turned it into a research base.That was when Mark really started to develop an obsession about his father's childhood home \u2013 and the treasure. If the house had survived so long perhaps the treasure had too. He began to think of it as the family treasure \u2013 not simply their property, but also their history. And he wanted it back. Mark knew his grandfather had spent much of the war interned in civilian camps (he had left London and gone to Denmark, where he was captured by the Gestapo and sent to Poland) but he had died before he was born. If Mark could reclaim the treasure, perhaps he could somehow reclaim his relationship with his grandfather. Perhaps it would bring him closer to his father and unite the many disparate elements of his family.Mark had always felt unsure of his identity. He looked Jewish but he wasn't because his father had married a gentile, and in Judaism it is the mother's bloodline that is followed. Actually, it was more complicated than that; his father also looked Jewish but he wasn't \u2013 his father had also married a gentile. Yet Judaism had shaped so much of their lives. After all, they had run away from Poland in the first place because they were regarded as Jewish. Throughout his childhood he had been on the move \u2013 from Northern Ireland to Leicestershire to London, and some more. Where did he belong? He didn't have a clue. The more he thought about the treasure, the more symbolic weight it assumed.\"I'd talk to my brother Nigel about it. We'd sit in a pub every so often and think about it. We wanted it kept \u2013 whether in the bosom of the family or in the town didn't matter, as long as it didn't get crushed under a steamroller or sold on the black market.\"So Mark told his father he would like to return to Lodz and dig up the treasure. David looked at him as if he was bonkers. \"I know it would be opening up a can of worms,\" Mark told David. \"Big worms,\" David replied. David felt the treasure belonged to a horrific past that he had no wish to revisit.But Mark convinced him otherwise. Not only that, he persuaded him to turn their real-life adventure into a film to be shown on television next week. The documentary is the closest you'll ever get to a Holocaust romp \u2013 part Simon Wiesenthal, part Enid Blyton, played out by a cast of Woody Allenesque eccentrics, it's an affecting and often funny look at family life through three generations.In Poland in the 1930s, Mark's grandparents were sharing the house with their relatives, the Schrages, who ran the rubber company with them. The Schrages also escaped the Nazis, moving first to Cuba and then to Los Angeles where they thrived in the automobile industry. Mark decided the first step was to visit them in LA to get their blessing to hunt the treasure and see if they had any tips. Ah, the treasure, they said. Of course they knew about the treasure \u2013 a bath tub of gold and silver was said to have been buried in the garden. Oh, and there were also two Rembrandts hidden along with\u00a0it, they added.Then Mark went to Lodz, embarking on what turned out to be a bureaucratic nightmare. The military wouldn't let him search the house or garden. He went to the mayor of Lodz for help and eventually he was told he could dig up a small area in the back garden. A few days later, David, along with Mark's two brothers, joined him outside the old family home to hunt down the treasure. Mark\u00a0became more and more frustrated the more obstacles he faced. He visited a clairvoyant and a rabbi for advice. Both told him the treasure was probably still there, but the most important treasure in his life might be closer to home \u2013 in his family.And this is really what the film is about. Family. Mark seems to have made it partly as a way of documenting David's life \u2013 when they started filming two years ago, his father had already been diagnosed with early-stage dementia. His memories of the distant past were vivid and detailed, but the here and now was slipping from his grasp. David, who spent his working life developing tennis and golf balls and working on Daleks for Dr Who, has a lovely way with words when he can find them. \"My father was always getting into trouble,\" he says. \"Disaster followed him \u2013 if he walked into a room, the ceiling would cave in.\"David says that because his dad spent so many years away in war camps, he was an absent father. And when they did get together, David's abiding memory is of them standing together, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say.Meanwhile, Mark has a different take on the grandfather he never met. He regards him as a romantic adventurer who might just help him to make sense of his own life. Just as David felt the absence of his father as a boy, Mark felt the absence of David when he was growing up. \"A lot of time when I was young, my dad was away working and we were always struggling to catch up with him. I became a lot closer to him when my mum died.\"We're on a train to Battle in Sussex, where the Battle of Hastings took place and where David, now 82, lives by himself in a small house. Mark, 47, a trainer in digital media, is talking about why it was so important for him to track down the treasure. \"Some property developer will buy that building, and if it's there they'll come across it and it will disappear. What a tragedy that would be when there is a chance to do something about it. If the Nazis didn't manage to get it and the communists didn't manage to get it but the capitalists did, that would be a gross injustice. And I was the only person who could possibly stand in the\u00a0way of that happening.\" He says in every family there tends to be a self-appointed keeper of the stories, and that is his role in the Atkin family.Was the value of the treasure important? \"No, it was the sense of injustice.\" He says a visit to the Jewish Museum in Berlin made him all the more determined to track it down. \"There was a battered old suitcase with a comb and collar and spoon in it, and these were the things that some guys had taken with them from Germany to Argentina. And some family had just kept that suitcase ... I found that quite profound.\"It was a way of reclaiming his history? \"Absolutely, and reuniting me with the grandfather I never met, who somehow I feel I have quite a connection with. Physically we looked quite similar and he was called Jack, and my friends all called me Jack through my childhood because my nose was even more prominent in those days \u2013 Jack for jackdaw. I liked that because it was my grandfather's name.\"How would it change his life if he found the Rembrandts? He looks at me, astonished by the question. \"I've never thought of it in those terms.\"Mark says he's never been interested in the financial aspect of his quest.We reach David's modest house in Battle. Although there were times when he made a good living, he could never emulate the lifestyle he was accustomed to as a little boy. David seems surprised to see us \u2013 he has forgotten that we're coming. Mark and David have a great relationship \u2013 David calls him Little Herbert (partly because he can't always remember his name and partly because he always had done) and they make each other laugh easily.Mark brings out old family photographs and bits and pieces from the camps, and this is when you realise just how different the lives of Jack, David and Mark have been. Here is a bunch of metal keys with Stalag 13A printed on them; a wooden cow Jack carved in the camps; pictures of men in drag from the dramatic productions they put on in the camps.However much trouble David might have keeping up with the present, he knows every story behind the photographs. He talks about the day he, his mother and younger brother left Poland and their three-day train journey to safety. \"She was a hopeless traveller. She just passed out on the train and I had all the documents. I was 10 or 11 years old, in charge of our travel, with my little brother who, thank the Lord, was a blond boy. At one point, to my horror, a fellow in jackboots came in for the documents, and he had SS on his lapel. My brother, who had been looking out of the window with his telescope, turned round, stuck the telescope up the SS man's bum and said, 'Stick 'em up!' I don't think that happened to him often. He said, 'I surrender!' when he saw this little blond boy.\"When they reached Berlin, they stopped to eat in a swanky restaurant. The way David tells the story, it could have happened yesterday. \"It was like a hunting lodge and we were well looked after and the ma\u00eetre d' said, 'What great misfortune, you poor things. If only you'd been here 20 minutes earlier \u2013 the F\u00fchrer himself was here.' Dad later said thank God he wasn't there because everyone else would have gone 'Sieg Heil' \u2013 and there is no way I would have done that. And if we hadn't we would have been in deep trouble.\" He pauses. \"Yes, I've had a fairly interesting childhood,\" and he giggles like a little boy.As a young boy, Mark knew little about his Jewish roots. Then, as he got older, he was invited to bar mitzvahs and weddings, and discovered more about the family's past. \"My Great-Uncle Hermann, from Latvia, would always make the speeches and he'd refer to the people who weren't there.\" Eventually, Mark realised that Great- Uncle Hermann meant those family members who had been killed in the Holocaust. \"The impact of that on me was immense.\"Mark has never been so aware of his Jewishness as when he was in Lodz. Between the wars, Lodz was 36% Jewish, but few Jews remain today. \"Whenever the military were looking at me I felt they were thinking, I know who you are and I know what you're doing here.\" At one point soldiers emerged with their guns angled in a less than friendly manner. Was he afraid? \"No, I just felt overtaken by a feeling of high indignation, that sense of injustice. I stood my ground. I didn't care if they wanted to lock me up \u2013 fine, I'd make a diplomatic incident of it.\"Meanwhile, David sat in the Lodz garden in his cowboy hat, taking in the sun and waiting till they had finished and it was time for a couple of glasses of wine. After they built a secret tunnel in an attempt to find the treasure, the Polish army found out what had been going on and things came to a head. Mark was told he would be in serious trouble unless he stopped digging. He was extremely put out, but David seemed relieved. Returning to his old\u00a0house, he says now, had been traumatic. \"Going through the big double gates I'd left as a boy, and I've never seen anything like them again, when I went back it all came in on me. I knew it all so well. It was all a bit\u00a0much, it all crowded in on me. It\u00a0was all there, my childhood was suddenly there.\"Did that upset him? \"Somewhat.\"Now they are back in his garden in Battle, he is much happier. \"The worst thing that could have happened is that we found the treasure,\" David says. \"It\u00a0would only be a hassle.\"\"What would the problems be if I\u00a0found it, Dad?\" Mark says.David looks at his son and smiles. \"Well, I can't imagine the Polish authorities just saying, 'Oh, is that your\u00a0treasure you're taking out? Carry on!' No way, Little Herbert. It would all be hassle.\"Mark knows all about the hassle, but still believes his mission was \u2013 and is \u2013 worthwhile. Now there is talk of the Atkins and the American side of the family buying the house in Lodz back from the Polish authorities. \"The worst thing is, so many people would want a share of the treasure,\" David says.\"I think you're right, but I'll think about that when it happens,\" Mark replies.They are sitting in the garden in Battle having a cuddle and giggle. \"How did we get ourselves into this situation?\" David asks his son repeatedly. No, he says, he wasn't interested in the treasure before the trip to Poland and he certainly isn't now. \"It's never been a priority in my life to find it and get it.

Komorowski said Warsaw would prefer a unique plan for Poland, although he allowed that Warsaw could accept the notion of two complementary chapters for Poland and the Baltic States within EAGLE GUARDIAN. More important for Poland was the need to avoid any delay in completing the plan or to rehash already-agreed components, such as the threat assessment.

He hinted that a creatively packaged regional plan that met Polish needs in terms of conditionality and automaticity might be acceptable, but cautioned that Warsaw would need assurances that NATO's defense of Poland was an \"issue in its own right\" and not dependent on the security or defense of other NATO members. Kobieracki insisted that Poland would also need assurances that regional planning would not negatively impact on NATO's response to prospective crises, particularly with respect to pre-planned deployments.

At a Nato summit in Lisbon last month, the allied leaders agreed for the first time to press ahead with the project and President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia was cautiously positive on the prospects for Moscow's co-operation.In November last year, Alexander Vershbow, the assistant defence secretary for international security, offered the Poles a role in the new project by hosting a land-based \"standard missile-3\" system, as seen in the leaked US embassy cables.The Poles, who have repeatedly told the Americans that they feel unthreatened by Iran but are regularly alarmed about Russia, asked \"a series of hypothetical questions on the adaptive nature of the system vis-a-vis the changing threat\".\"With regard to how Nato might defend itself from missiles coming from elsewhere than Iran or Syria, BG John Hesterman of the joint staff said that sea-borne platforms could provide surge capability against threats from an unforeseen direction, land-based sites could be upgraded with more interceptors if the scale of the threat were increased, and radars could be reoriented,\" the US embassy in Warsaw reports following the meetings.A series of cables going back over the past two years highlights the Polish eagerness to try to draw the US military, Nato assets, and possibly military bases into Poland, and a clear US ambivalence and wariness, sparking furious rows and mutual exasperation.\"How long will it take you to realise that nothing will change with Iran and Russia?\" a Polish presidential aide asks a trio of visiting US senators in May last year.\"The Polish prime minister's chief of staff, the president's deputy national security advisor, and the speaker of the Polish parliament expressed unanimous support for a large US military footprint in Poland \u2026 Most important for Poland is US involvement in Polish security, through physical presence of American forces in Poland, Nato facilities in Poland, fulfilling the commitment to provide Patriot missiles,\" the embassy reports. Six months later, Vershbow offered an alternative to the promised Patriots \"which the US believed may be more useful to Poland\".\"The three options presented were: 1) a quarterly rotation of F-16s, and the establishment of a small permanent support detachment, which would focus on enhancing Polish fighter capabilities, increasing sortie readiness and meeting Nato commitments; 2) quarterly C-130 rotations from Ramstein [airbase in Germany], also with a small permanent support detachment in Poland with the goal of increasing Polish readiness and ability to support own and Nato operations; 3) the relocation of a US naval special warfare unit from Stuttgart to Gdansk or Gdynia [on the Baltic coast].\"The Poles were enthusiastic, seeking to maximise the US offers. In February this year, the defence minister, Bogdan Klich, told the US ambassador, Lee Feinstein, in Warsaw that Poland was interested in all the options, particularly the F-16 fighter aircraft. Under government cost-cutting, Poland was closing down 20% of military facilities \"but would be saving three complexes for US forces,\" Klich said.Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also told Ellen Tauscher, the US under-secretary of state for arms control, that Warsaw was interested in the F-16s.", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US news", "The US embassy cables", "Russia", "Nato", "Europe"], "title": "WikiLeaks cables: Poland wants missile shield to protect against Russia"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:26Z", "country": "poland", "content": "It is the biggest single concrete example of US support for Polish security on the ground.

He added that the bilateral supplemental SoFA, signed December 11, provides a strong legal framework for defense ties. The SoFA ratification vote in the Sejm (the lower house of Parliament) was overwhelmingly in favor, and Senate approval would also come quickly.

(C) Klich said Poland has a strong desire to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, and he highlighted the political importance of an early first rotation in Poland of the U.S. Patriot battery. He said Poland hopes the first rotation will occur in April. The Ambassador said the United States wants the rotation to be viewed as a bilateral success. In answer to Klich's questions about timing, the Ambassader said the United States has said the first rotation would take place within 90 days of SOFA ratification. He said a more precise time frame will be determined at the last bilateral planning meeting for the Patriot rotation, which will take place in the first week in March.MILITARY FACILITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE U.S. PRESENCES--------------------------------------------- -----4. (C) Klich called for talks on other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. He said he had authorized Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski and ChoD Franciszek Gagor to take part in such talks. Klich highlighted Polish interest in all of the options presented by DOD A/S Vershbow at the October High Level Defense Group discussions: F-16s, C-130's, as well as \"stable, not temporary\" special operations forces. When asked, Klich confirmed that the GoP is particularly interested in U.S. F-16 rotations. Speaking personally, he said he also had a strong interest in a special operations force presence, since he had signed a bilateral special operations cooperation agreement with Secretary Gates a year ago. ChoD Gagor added that the biggest multilateral exercise Poland is hosting this year, \"Jackal Stone 10,\" will feature special operations forces.

(C) The Ambassador noted that the bilateral agenda for defense cooperation is a full one, and both governments should work together to inform public opinion about the many useful exchanges under way. Klich strongly agreed that Defense Ministry and Embassy staff should follow up in this area. Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski added that if A/S Vershbow visits Warsaw in the coming months, it might be a good occasion to do some joint public diplomacy work about planning for other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland.

For two years, the Polish prime minister, foreign and defence ministers had sold the Patriots to the public as a great boost to national air defences (against Russia).So when the Americans told them in late 2008 that the missiles would not be live, at least initially, the furious Poles complained they had expected an operational weapon, not \"potted plants\", the cables report.Even then the Poles did not know the full truth.

(S) SUMMARY: Deputy DefMin Stanislaw Komorowski and MFA Security Policy Director Adam Kobieracki reacted similarly when DCM raised reftel points -- Poland strongly agrees with the necessity of contingency planning for the Baltic States but would like to avoid delays in the completion of the EAGLE GUARDIAN plan for Poland. However, both Komorowski and Kobieracki suggested that Poland might be able to accept a \"creatively packaged\" plan that included separate but complementary components (\"chapters\") for Poland and the Baltic States. They agreed that discussions should not be made public. END SUMMARY.2. (S) In a meeting with DCM on December 17, Komorowski expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation with other NATO contingency planners on EAGLE GUARDIAN. Poles were active participants in the process and looked forward to its completion by the end of February or early March. Komorowski was skeptical that a regional approach to contingency planning was the best way ahead. Komorowski said Warsaw would prefer a unique plan for Poland, although he allowed that Warsaw could accept the notion of two complementary chapters for Poland and the Baltic States within EAGLE GUARDIAN. More important for Poland was the need to avoid any delay in completing the plan or to rehash already-agreed components, such as the threat assessment. He added that he \"agreed entirely\" that the issue should remain as secret as possible, and that it was in the \"common interest\" to avoid public discussion of NATO contingency planning.3. (S) Kobieracki made similar points to DCM on December 15, and suggested the USG engage in detailed consultations with Polish officials in Brussels and with the General Staff in Warsaw. He said Poland had hoped that a revised EAGLE GUARDIAN plan could be used as a starting point for developing contingency plans for the Baltic States rather than become intertwined with them. He hinted that a creatively packaged regional plan that met Polish needs in terms of conditionality and automaticity might be acceptable, but cautioned that Warsaw would need assurances that NATO's defense of Poland was an \"issue in its own right\" and not dependent on the security or defense of other NATO members. Kobieracki insisted that Poland would also need assurances that regional planning would not negatively impact on NATO's response to prospective crises, particularly with respect to pre-planned deployments. He urged that completion of EAGLE GUARDIAN not be delayed to accommodate incorporation of the Baltic States into a regional contingency plan. Kobieracki agreed that contingency planning discussions should not be made public.

They claim the treasured panel depicting Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of Ludovico Sforza, ruler of Milan and patron of Leonardo, is too delicate to travel. It is one of barely 20 paintings attributed to the artist.The Krakow division of the Association of Art Historians has sent an impassioned letter to ArtWatch UK, the restoration watchdog, to draw the world's attention to their \"anxiety\".In a letter to be published tomorrow, its president, Joanna Daranowska-Lukaszewska, writes: \"The sending of the Krakow picture abroad is insured for \u20ac300m [\u00a3250m], but in the event of a disaster no one would be able to restore this priceless masterpiece to life. We appeal to [ArtWatch] to draw the attention of world public opinion to the great dangers now faced by \u2026 common property of the whole cultural world.\"It is not just in Poland that fears are growing over the National Gallery's plans for its exhibition, \"Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan\". Concern is being voiced that other Leonardo paintings \u2013 La Belle Ferroni\u00e8re, from the Louvre; the Madonna Litta, from the Hermitage in St Petersburg; and Saint Jerome, from the Pinacoteca Vaticana in Rome \u2013 also face perilous journeys.But in Krakow \u2013 where Lady with an Ermine sits in the Czartoryski Museum \u2013 those concerns have reached an acute level. \"If you transport a picture panel such as the Lady with an Ermine \u2026 even the most ideal methods in the form of modern environmental chambers or special anti-shock frames are not able to sufficiently protect the work against a variety of vibrations, shocks or changes in pressure,\" said Professor Grazyna Korpal, dean of conservation.\"By allowing the painting to travel we create yet another serious threat [from] \u2026 possible human error. Such masterpieces require exceptional protection. The fundamental principle is the unconditional restriction of movement.\"A source at the National Museum revealed that a letter from Poland's deputy cultural and national heritage minister permitted the picture to be transported to London.Michael Daley of ArtWatch UK said it was hard to justify allowing such great masterpieces to be moved: \"With paintings on panel, any movement is dangerous and bound to have a deleterious effect. Why take the chance? There is nothing to contradict the warnings of the Polish restorers. Moving the Lady with an Ermine is absolutely crazy.\"He added that the danger of theft is heightened during any move. Last week a Picasso was among some 30 artworks valued at \u00a34.1m stolen in transit between galleries in Germany and Spain.Even moving works from room to room within a gallery presented dangers, Daley said. Two years ago, a Renaissance painting by Domenico Beccafumi was dropped while being taken off a wall at the National Gallery. Previously unpublished photographs of the damage will be published on ArtWatch's website tomorrow, along with the appeal from Poland and accounts of other accidents.Adam Zamoyski, UK historian and chairman of the Czartoryski Foundation, confirmed that Lady with an Ermine had an export licence. He said: \"It will be more closely guarded when in transit or on loan than when it is at its \u2026 home museum, which is now being rebuilt.\"", "tags": ["Leonardo da Vinci", "National Gallery", "Poland", "Painting", "Art and design", "Culture", "Art", "UK news", "Europe"], "title": "Leonardo da Vinci painting is 'put at risk by loan from Poland to London'"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:26Z", "country": "poland", "content": "It is the biggest single concrete example of US support for Polish security on the ground.

He added that he \"agreed entirely\" that the issue should remain as secret as possible, and that it was in the \"common interest\" to avoid public discussion of NATO contingency planning.3. (S) Kobieracki made similar points to DCM on December 15, and suggested the USG engage in detailed consultations with Polish officials in Brussels and with the General Staff in Warsaw. He said Poland had hoped that a revised EAGLE GUARDIAN plan could be used as a starting point for developing contingency plans for the Baltic States rather than become intertwined with them. He hinted that a creatively packaged regional plan that met Polish needs in terms of conditionality and automaticity might be acceptable, but cautioned that Warsaw would need assurances that NATO's defense of Poland was an \"issue in its own right\" and not dependent on the security or defense of other NATO members. Kobieracki insisted that Poland would also need assurances that regional planning would not negatively impact on NATO's response to prospective crises, particularly with respect to pre-planned deployments. He urged that completion of EAGLE GUARDIAN not be delayed to accommodate incorporation of the Baltic States into a regional contingency plan. Kobieracki agreed that contingency planning discussions should not be made public.

Barack Obama abandoned the scheme in September last year, under his policy of \"resetting\" relations with Russia.The Pentagon and Nato are developing a more modest and mobile phased missile shield, inviting the Russians to take part. At a Nato summit in Lisbon last month, the allied leaders agreed for the first time to press ahead with the project and President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia was cautiously positive on the prospects for Moscow's co-operation.In November last year, Alexander Vershbow, the assistant defence secretary for international security, offered the Poles a role in the new project by hosting a land-based \"standard missile-3\" system, as seen in the leaked US embassy cables.The Poles, who have repeatedly told the Americans that they feel unthreatened by Iran but are regularly alarmed about Russia, asked \"a series of hypothetical questions on the adaptive nature of the system vis-a-vis the changing threat\".\"With regard to how Nato might defend itself from missiles coming from elsewhere than Iran or Syria, BG John Hesterman of the joint staff said that sea-borne platforms could provide surge capability against threats from an unforeseen direction, land-based sites could be upgraded with more interceptors if the scale of the threat were increased, and radars could be reoriented,\" the US embassy in Warsaw reports following the meetings.A series of cables going back over the past two years highlights the Polish eagerness to try to draw the US military, Nato assets, and possibly military bases into Poland, and a clear US ambivalence and wariness, sparking furious rows and mutual exasperation.\"How long will it take you to realise that nothing will change with Iran and Russia?\" a Polish presidential aide asks a trio of visiting US senators in May last year.\"The Polish prime minister's chief of staff, the president's deputy national security advisor, and the speaker of the Polish parliament expressed unanimous support for a large US military footprint in Poland \u2026 Most important for Poland is US involvement in Polish security, through physical presence of American forces in Poland, Nato facilities in Poland, fulfilling the commitment to provide Patriot missiles,\" the embassy reports. Six months later, Vershbow offered an alternative to the promised Patriots \"which the US believed may be more useful to Poland\".\"The three options presented were: 1) a quarterly rotation of F-16s, and the establishment of a small permanent support detachment, which would focus on enhancing Polish fighter capabilities, increasing sortie readiness and meeting Nato commitments; 2) quarterly C-130 rotations from Ramstein [airbase in Germany], also with a small permanent support detachment in Poland with the goal of increasing Polish readiness and ability to support own and Nato operations; 3) the relocation of a US naval special warfare unit from Stuttgart to Gdansk or Gdynia [on the Baltic coast].\"The Poles were enthusiastic, seeking to maximise the US offers. In February this year, the defence minister, Bogdan Klich, told the US ambassador, Lee Feinstein, in Warsaw that Poland was interested in all the options, particularly the F-16 fighter aircraft. Under government cost-cutting, Poland was closing down 20% of military facilities \"but would be saving three complexes for US forces,\" Klich said.Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also told Ellen Tauscher, the US under-secretary of state for arms control, that Warsaw was interested in the F-16s.", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US news", "The US embassy cables", "Russia", "Nato", "Europe"], "title": "WikiLeaks cables: Poland wants missile shield to protect against Russia"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:14Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Monday, 22 February 2010, 16:12C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 WARSAW 000110 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/CE (GLANTZ, KARAGIANNIS) OSD FOR MITCHELL, AMBASSADOR VERSHBOW, ADMIRAL MULLEN EUCOM FOR ADMIRAL STAVRIDIS USAREUR FOR GENERAL HAM EO 12958 DECL: 02/22/2020 TAGS PREL, MARR, MOPS, PGOV, PL SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS DEFENSE MINISTER KLICH Classified By: Classified BY Political Counselor Dan Sainz, reason 1.4 (b, d)1. (C) SUMMARY: Defense Minister Bogdan Klich told the Ambassador on February 18 that Poland is eager to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, which he described as based on a solid political foundation. He emphasized the importance to Poland of an April arrival of the first Patriot battery rotation. Klich did not repeat recent Polish government points about the configuration of future rotations of the Patriot battery. End Summary.2. (C) During a February 18 meeting with the Ambassador, Polish Defense Minister Bogdan Klich said there is a good political framework for continued U.S.-Polish defense cooperation, and noted Under Secretary Tauscher's February 8 visit had been a very successful one. Klich said he does not expect anything will happen to undermine that solid foundation. He added that the bilateral supplemental SoFA, signed December 11, provides a strong legal framework for defense ties. The SoFA ratification vote in the Sejm (the lower house of Parliament) was overwhelmingly in favor, and Senate approval would also come quickly. (Note: The Senate voted 88-1 in favor of SOFA ratification later on February 18.) Klich said President Kaczynski would sign the SoFA ratification bill quickly.HOPING FOR PATRIOTS IN APRIL----------------------------3. (C) Klich said Poland has a strong desire to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, and he highlighted the political importance of an early first rotation in Poland of the U.S. Patriot battery. He said Poland hopes the first rotation will occur in April. The Ambassador said the United States wants the rotation to be viewed as a bilateral success. In answer to Klich's questions about timing, the Ambassader said the United States has said the first rotation would take place within 90 days of SOFA ratification. He said a more precise time frame will be determined at the last bilateral planning meeting for the Patriot rotation, which will take place in the first week in March.MILITARY FACILITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE U.S. PRESENCES--------------------------------------------- -----4. (C) Klich called for talks on other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. He said he had authorized Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski and ChoD Franciszek Gagor to take part in such talks. Klich highlighted Polish interest in all of the options presented by DOD A/S Vershbow at the October High Level Defense Group discussions: F-16s, C-130's, as well as \"stable, not temporary\" special operations forces. When asked, Klich confirmed that the GoP is particularly interested in U.S. F-16 rotations. Speaking personally, he said he also had a strong interest in a special operations force presence, since he had signed a bilateral special operations cooperation agreement with Secretary Gates a year ago. ChoD Gagor added that the biggest multilateral exercise Poland is hosting this year, \"Jackal Stone 10,\" will feature special operations forces. Klich added that as part of the first in-depth infrastructure review in postwar Poland, the Defense Ministry had decided to close 20% of defense facilities, but would be &saving8 three complexes for U.S. forces.GETTING THE WORD OUT ON DEFENSE COOPERATION-------------------------------------------5. (C) The Ambassador noted that the bilateral agenda for defense cooperation is a full one, and both governments should work together to inform public opinion about the many useful exchanges under way. Klich strongly agreed that Defense Ministry and Embassy staff should follow up in this area. Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski added that if A/S Vershbow visits Warsaw in the coming months, it might be a good occasion to do some joint public diplomacy work about planning for other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. (Note: Amb. Vershbow's planned mid-March trip has been postponed.)6. (C) COMMENT: Klich's emphasis on a hoped-for April arrivalWARSAW 00000110 002 OF 002of the first Patriot battery is consistent with other government statements and press leaks that signal a decision to focus on the timing of the first deployment, as opposed to other aspects of it. In that regard, Klich did not repeat government appeals that Patriot rotations be integrated into the Polish air defense system and include \"live\" missiles, as he did in a meeting the previous week with Under Secretary Tauscher. The emphasis on the timing of the first deployment corresponds with developments in the presidential race, and Foreign Minister Sikorsky,s active candidacy for the Civic Platform nomination.

They claim the treasured panel depicting Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of Ludovico Sforza, ruler of Milan and patron of Leonardo, is too delicate to travel. It is one of barely 20 paintings attributed to the artist.The Krakow division of the Association of Art Historians has sent an impassioned letter to ArtWatch UK, the restoration watchdog, to draw the world's attention to their \"anxiety\".In a letter to be published tomorrow, its president, Joanna Daranowska-Lukaszewska, writes: \"The sending of the Krakow picture abroad is insured for \u20ac300m [\u00a3250m], but in the event of a disaster no one would be able to restore this priceless masterpiece to life. We appeal to [ArtWatch] to draw the attention of world public opinion to the great dangers now faced by \u2026 common property of the whole cultural world.\"It is not just in Poland that fears are growing over the National Gallery's plans for its exhibition, \"Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan\". Concern is being voiced that other Leonardo paintings \u2013 La Belle Ferroni\u00e8re, from the Louvre; the Madonna Litta, from the Hermitage in St Petersburg; and Saint Jerome, from the Pinacoteca Vaticana in Rome \u2013 also face perilous journeys.But in Krakow \u2013 where Lady with an Ermine sits in the Czartoryski Museum \u2013 those concerns have reached an acute level. \"If you transport a picture panel such as the Lady with an Ermine \u2026 even the most ideal methods in the form of modern environmental chambers or special anti-shock frames are not able to sufficiently protect the work against a variety of vibrations, shocks or changes in pressure,\" said Professor Grazyna Korpal, dean of conservation.\"By allowing the painting to travel we create yet another serious threat [from] \u2026 possible human error. Such masterpieces require exceptional protection. The fundamental principle is the unconditional restriction of movement.\"A source at the National Museum revealed that a letter from Poland's deputy cultural and national heritage minister permitted the picture to be transported to London.Michael Daley of ArtWatch UK said it was hard to justify allowing such great masterpieces to be moved: \"With paintings on panel, any movement is dangerous and bound to have a deleterious effect. Why take the chance? There is nothing to contradict the warnings of the Polish restorers. Moving the Lady with an Ermine is absolutely crazy.\"He added that the danger of theft is heightened during any move. Last week a Picasso was among some 30 artworks valued at \u00a34.1m stolen in transit between galleries in Germany and Spain.Even moving works from room to room within a gallery presented dangers, Daley said. Two years ago, a Renaissance painting by Domenico Beccafumi was dropped while being taken off a wall at the National Gallery. Previously unpublished photographs of the damage will be published on ArtWatch's website tomorrow, along with the appeal from Poland and accounts of other accidents.Adam Zamoyski, UK historian and chairman of the Czartoryski Foundation, confirmed that Lady with an Ermine had an export licence.

Most high-ranking and mid-level Poles have stayed on in their positions in the Vatican bureaucracy since the death of John Paul, maintaining the Vatican's Polish flavor. Pope Benedict has consistently made gestures to acknowledge the importance of the Polish Catholic Church in the context of European and world Catholicism - an importance embodied most immediately by the crowds of Polish pilgrims that still flock to Rome. Pope Benedict and other Vatican officials maintain Pope John Paul's hope that Poland will serve as a counter-weight to Western European secularism, but are wary of nationalistic or divisive forces with a Catholic label, such as media outlets under the control of Polish station Radio Maryja. With Pope Benedict XVI's May 25-28 visit to Poland looming, many in and around the Vatican are addressing these subjects. End Summary.------------------------Poland: Still a Presence------------------------3. (C) The papacy of John Paul II is slowly fading into history, but Poland remains an important part of the conversation at the Vatican. Recent months have offered much evidence of this, and numerous opportunities to assess Holy See - Poland relations. Late last year, several groups of Polish bishops came to Rome for their quinquennial \"ad limina\" visit to the pope and Vatican officials. In December, then-President Aleksander Kwasniewski made his swan song visit to the Vatican and met with Benedict XVI. In January, his successor, President Lech Kaczynski, made his first trip abroad as president and met Pope Benedict XVI. The first anniversary of the death of the Polish pope in April saw waves of Polish pilgrims visiting Rome, but the sound of Polish on the streets of Rome hardly abated for the Easter celebrations two weeks later. Add periodic events commemorating various dates in the life of John Paul II or initiatives that he began, and there remains an inevitable Polish flavor to life at the Vatican.4. (C) In the aftermath of the death of the Polish pope, Pole-weary Italian journalists heralded the impending exodus of Poles from Rome and the Vatican Curia (bureaucracy) (ref a). Their hope was that an Italian would regain the papacy and add to the already imposing number of Italians in the Curia. Many predicted that the papacy would inevitably turn its attention from the homeland of the deceased pontiff. In the end, Joseph Ratzinger of Germany was elected pope, and the Poles, by and large, stayed. And although it was inevitable that the death of John Paul would signal a change in the relationship between Poland and the Holy See, the bond remains strong. The Vatican has continued to play close attention to Poland and Poles continue to wield great influence in Vatican City.-----------------------------------Polish Personnel, Influence Remain-----------------------------------5. (C) Benedict moved his own German secretary, Monsignor Georg Ganswein, into the Apostolic Palace, but he kept on Pope John Paul's Polish aide, Mieczyslaw Mokrzycki (an ethnic Pole from Ukraine) in a very visible position in the papal household. Other prominent Poles at the Vatican, such as Cardinal Zenon Grocholewski (Congregation for Education), Monsignor Antoni Stankiewicz (Roman Rota - the Vatican's high court), Archbishop Edward Nowak (Congregation for the Causes of Saints), Monsignor Krzysztof Nitkiewicz (Congregation for Oriental Churches), Archbishop Stanislaw Rylko (Council for Laity), and others are continuing in high-profile positions. [Note: Rylko was passed over for an expected elevation to the College of Cardinals at the most recent consistory, but still heads an important Vatican department.]6. (C) Benedict also named London-born Polish priest Wojciech Giertych as theologian of the Papal Household, another prestigious position. Giertych is the son of well-known PolishVATICAN 00000083 002.2 OF 004nationalist Jedrzej Giertych (1903-92), and brother of Maciej Giertych of the League of Polish Families party in Poland. Maciej's son, Roman, is the newly-named Education Minister (as reported by Embassy Warsaw) and a member of the Catholic organization, Opus Dei . Though Fr. Giertych was selected for his erudition and preaching rather than his nationality (we also doubt his family connections played a role in the appointment), his presence presents another opportunity for Polish visibility and influence. A host of lower-level Polish functionaries continue as well, doing a lot of the heavy lifting in and around the Vatican. The only major name to leave Rome in the wake of the death of John Paul was Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, John Paul's longtime secretary, whom Benedict sent to follow in his mentor's footsteps as Cardinal Archbishop of Krakow.7. (C) \"Even after the death of the Holy Father, we have a strong presence here,\" Grzegorz Kaszak, rector of the Polish College (residential seminary) in Rome and a former Vatican bureaucrat, told us. Kaszak pointed out that Poles had been making inroads at the Vatican for over twenty years. Their influence was unlikely to diminish overnight. Even when Benedict XVI makes the major changes in the Curia that Vatican-watchers have been predicting for some time, most Poles here do not predict that Polish influence in the Vatican will drop precipitously. \"We are now part of the culture here,\" and a crucial element of the Church in Europe and in the world, Kaszak insisted.------------------------------------------Vatican Publicizes Stats on Polish Church------------------------------------------8. (C) The statistics bear Kaszak out. We defer to Embassy Warsaw on the strength of the Polish Catholic Church domestically, but the Vatican was touting its numbers in advance of the pope's trip. The Holy See released statistics noting the country's 36.6 million Catholics at some 10,114 parishes and 800 pastoral centers. There are some 28 thousand priests and almost 25 thousand other religious personnel (nuns and other male religious) with 6,400 students studying to become priests. Vatican-based sources have remarked to us that Poland's Catholic muscle is felt far beyond the country's borders. In parishes in Italy, other European countries, the U.S., and elsewhere, it is not uncommon to come upon Polish clergy, either on loan, or having taken up residence in a foreign diocese. What's most important to the Holy See is the \"formation of the youth,\" according to Dariusz Giers, a Polish priest working at the Vatican's Health Ministry. \"The Vatican knows we have excellent programs to educate young people [in religious matters]\" he said, emphasizing the importance of this factor for the continuing strength of the religion. What's more, many at the Vatican consider Polish Catholicism to be dependably orthodox, compared to more liberal strains of the faith found in some parts of Western Europe. \"The Poles are grounded in the faith,\" one contact opined. \"You wouldn't have to worry about the Da Vinci Code confusing people in Poland.\"---------------------Ubiquitous Presence---------------------9. (C) As if to emphasize the ubiquitous presence of Poles in and around the Vatican, Kaszak exchanged several greetings in Polish with passing nuns as he spoke to us not far from St. Peter's Square. In fact, whether one's in the Vatican grocery store or post office, St. Peter's Basilica, or walking any of the streets around Vatican City, it's hard to go twenty minutes without hearing some Polish. And this is not just from the Vatican functionaries from Poland and the many Polish nuns who staff several Vatican offices and residences. The flow of Polish pilgrims to Rome has waned little even a year after the death of Pope John Paul. Of course, massive crowds of Poles came to Rome to observe the first anniversary of the pope's death on April 2. A mass said by Pope Benedict and other events packed an overflowing St. Peter's Square. But it seemed to onlookers that the Polish influx was just as great - or greater - for the Easter celebrations not long afterwards. As is typical for the outdoor audiences and public masses, banners from Polish parishes and towns highlighted Polish participation. \"I think there were even more Poles here for Easter,\" Vatican bureaucrat Giers told us. \"This has been nearly constant since the death of the Holy Father. I don't see signs of it slowing down.\"----------------------------Pope Reaches Out to Poles----------------------------10. (C) The Holy See clearly recognizes who its audience is. At his weekly public gathering (a mixture of prayer and pep rally), Pope Benedict speaks every week to the crowd in Polish,VATICAN 00000083 003.6 OF 004in addition to Italian, French, English, Spanish, and German. Polish is typically one of the languages used for prayers at Vatican masses. The pope often makes special emphasis on the Polish contingent at the audiences and other events, as on May 3, when he noted the anniversary of the 1791 ratification of the Polish Constitution and heralded the anniversary a noteworthy event in Polish Catholic history. Benedict XVI has also devoted some of his rare private audiences to Polish or Polish-affiliated groups such an April visit with representatives of the Krakow-based publishing house, Znak, publisher of Pope John Paul's last book and other Church-related works. That Pope Benedict, who travels much less than his predecessor, chose Poland as his second trip abroad (his first was a visit to World Youth Day in Germany that had been scheduled before his election) is perhaps the strongest sign of this recognition (septel).---------------------------------------A Counter-Weight to Secular Europe?---------------------------------------11. (C) The Holy See's attention to Poland is not simply customer service or \"taking care of the troops\". As was clear under Pope John Paul II, the Vatican has high hopes that Poland will serve as a counter-weight to Western European secularism as the nation makes itself more at home in an integrated Europe. Pope Benedict's preoccupation with what he sees as Europe's increasing psychological distance from its Christian roots is clear (ref a). He has continued to focus on Poland's potential in combating this trend. This was one of the themes of the visit of several groups of Polish bishops to the Vatican at the end of last year. \"It's a topic that always comes up,\" explained Monsignor Michael Banach, the Holy See MFA's country director for Poland. He told us that the two sides recognized that the Polish bishops needed to exert leadership in the face of Western European secularism. Certainly the Holy See hopes that Poland will hold the line at the EU on \"life and family\" issues that arise. But the necessity of maintaining and fortifying the faith internally in Polish society is perhaps an equally important - if not unrelated - focus. Several sources have told us that both sides are keenly aware of the danger that European secularism will dilute Polish faith and identity.-------------Trojan Horse-------------12. (C) Looking at Poland's position in Europe and the EU, several Polish interlocutors told us that Western European suspicion of Poland as a \"Trojan horse\" for the U.S. in the EU was not just a phenomenon among the laity - it had also infected the Vatican. \"We definitely get that feeling\" from a few of the French, German and other Western European prelates at the Vatican, said Giers. The war in Iraq, unpopular among many Vatican officials, has certainly played a role here. Traditional Polish affection for the U.S., on the other hand, seems as strong as ever among the Polish clergy stationed or studying in Rome. In conversations at a dinner not long ago at the Polish College, several seminarians and priests made a point of praising the U.S. and lauding USG foreign policy.----------------Radio Maryja----------------13. (C) Although the Vatican is on guard against encroaching secularism, it shares with many Polish bishops a wariness of Radio Maryja, the Catholic radio station accused of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Banach and Piotr Samerek, DCM at the Polish Embassy to the Holy See, told us that during their ad limina visits, several of the bishops appealed to Vatican Foreign Minister Giovanni Lajolo and others to clamp down on excesses of Radio Maryja and its sister media outlets. The complaints included Radio Maryja's meddling in Polish politics. According to Banach, Lajolo was sympathetic, and expressed his reservations about the network. But Lajolo took a typical Vatican line in judging the matter to be an Polish internal affair. Banach told us that Lajolo told more than one group of bishops that they had to deal with Radio Maryja themselves as part of their \"pastoral responsibilities\". Though media attributed some comments critical of Radio Maryja to Pope Benedict, the Holy See clearly did not want to get involved.14. (C) When Papal Nuncio Jozef Kowalczyk made an April statement chastising Radio Maryja, many assumed that the Vatican had finally decided to clamp down on the network. Our contacts tell us that wasn't the case, saying that while the Holy See agreed with the spirit of Kowalczyk's intervention, the nuncio had spoken out on his own. Some following the issue at the Vatican have told us that Kowalczyk went too far, given the Vatican's view of the matter as an internal Polish question. InVATICAN 00000083 004.4 OF 004any case, as Banach told us, things seem to be improving, as the proposed programming board set up to monitor the content of the station's broadcasts looks like a step in the right direction.----------------Other Influences----------------15. (C) As the Holy See examines the many aspects of its relationship with Poland, it seeks to maintain its focus on the pastoral rather than political. But religious subjects routinely morph into political ones. Banach wouldn't bite when asked for his view of the entry of radical elements such as Andrzej Lepper or ultra-Catholics like Roman Giertych into Poland's governing coalition and ministerial ranks (ref c). He did say that the Vatican understood the dangers that right-wing nationalists posed to Poland's future, and allowed that some saw a danger of Catholic fringe groups discrediting the mainstream Church. As far as the reputation for anti-Semitism that stuck to some nationalists, Banach commented that \"no one\" wanted to see the progress that had been made on such issues lost.----------Comment----------16. (C) It is only a little more than a year after the death of Pope John Paul II, and it is inevitable that with the passage of time Poland will eventually become less central to the world of the Vatican. John-Paul era Vatican bureaucrats will eventually move on. Poland may become more secular. The memory of the Polish pope will certainly recede further into the past. The growth of the Catholic Church in certain parts of the developing world could also play a role here, pushing the Poles, Italians and others to less prominent roles with the Holy See and capturing even more attention in Curial offices. For the near future, however, Poland is assured an important place at the Vatican table.ROONEY", "tags": ["The US embassy cables", "Catholicism", "Pope Benedict XVI", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Poland", "European Union", "Vatican", "Europe", "The papacy"], "title": "US embassy cables: Vatican hoped that Poland would 'hold the family line' in the EU"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:26Z", "country": "poland", "content": "It is the biggest single concrete example of US support for Polish security on the ground.

For two years, the Polish prime minister, foreign and defence ministers had sold the Patriots to the public as a great boost to national air defences (against Russia).So when the Americans told them in late 2008 that the missiles would not be live, at least initially, the furious Poles complained they had expected an operational weapon, not \"potted plants\", the cables report.Even then the Poles did not know the full truth. In February last year, the then US ambassador, Victor Ashe, cabled back to Washington: \"Polish officials are not privy to the full range of US planning and thinking with regard to the prospective Patriot battery rotation here, but they do have expectations \u2013 some naive, some tactical.\"This is a good juncture to point out the most glaring gap in understanding between us and the Poles. The Poles have not been told that the battery will rotate without actual missiles \u2013 ie not only will the rotation not be operational in the initial phase, but it will also not be operational, and certainly interoperable, at any point in our current plans. This will be a question of basic definitions for the Poles: is it a Patriot battery if it doesn't have live missiles?\"The Poles think the Patriots will become not only operable, but interoperable, over time \u2013 thus enhancing Poland's air defence.\"The Poles also believed the Patriot installation would be permanently manned by 110 Americans, while the US was planning to deploy at most 30.It was not until November last year that Vershbow told the Poles bluntly that the Patriot battery \"will be solely for training and exercises\".The Americans rubbed salt in Polish wounds by stressing that \"the Patriot battery would not be operational at any time \u2026 It was made clear that training opportunities would be limited to basic familiarisation training due to current disclosure restrictions unless Poland decided to buy Patriot systems.\"While, publicly, the Polish leadership continued to stress the centrality of the Patriot battery to national defences, privately top officials talked only of its \"political importance\".\"[Polish defence minister] Klich did not repeat government appeals that Patriot rotations be integrated into the Polish air defence system and include 'live' missiles, as he did in a meeting the previous week.\"Stanislaw Komorowski, the deputy defence minister and former ambassador in London, who did most of the negotiating, died a month before the Patriot battery arrived in the plane crash at Smolensk in Russia that killed scores of the Polish elite.In November last year he admitted that \"the Patriot's contribution to Polish air defence is minimal, though important symbolically.\"Ian Traynor", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "Nato", "The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "US news", "Europe"], "title": "Wikileaks cables: Poland furious over getting 'potted plants', not missiles"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:10Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Friday, 18 December 2009, 14:36S E C R E T WARSAW 001228 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/CE (GLANTZ) AND EUR/RPM EO 12958 DECL: 12/18/2019 TAGS NATO, MCAP, MARR, PREL, PL SUBJECT: POLAND COULD ACCEPT \"COMPLEMENTARY\" CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR POLAND AND BALTIC STATESREF: STATE 127892Classified By: DCM William Heidt for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)1. (S) SUMMARY: Deputy DefMin Stanislaw Komorowski and MFA Security Policy Director Adam Kobieracki reacted similarly when DCM raised reftel points -- Poland strongly agrees with the necessity of contingency planning for the Baltic States but would like to avoid delays in the completion of the EAGLE GUARDIAN plan for Poland. However, both Komorowski and Kobieracki suggested that Poland might be able to accept a \"creatively packaged\" plan that included separate but complementary components (\"chapters\") for Poland and the Baltic States. They agreed that discussions should not be made public. END SUMMARY.2. (S) In a meeting with DCM on December 17, Komorowski expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation with other NATO contingency planners on EAGLE GUARDIAN. Poles were active participants in the process and looked forward to its completion by the end of February or early March. Komorowski was skeptical that a regional approach to contingency planning was the best way ahead. Komorowski said Warsaw would prefer a unique plan for Poland, although he allowed that Warsaw could accept the notion of two complementary chapters for Poland and the Baltic States within EAGLE GUARDIAN. More important for Poland was the need to avoid any delay in completing the plan or to rehash already-agreed components, such as the threat assessment. He added that he \"agreed entirely\" that the issue should remain as secret as possible, and that it was in the \"common interest\" to avoid public discussion of NATO contingency planning.3. (S) Kobieracki made similar points to DCM on December 15, and suggested the USG engage in detailed consultations with Polish officials in Brussels and with the General Staff in Warsaw. He said Poland had hoped that a revised EAGLE GUARDIAN plan could be used as a starting point for developing contingency plans for the Baltic States rather than become intertwined with them. He hinted that a creatively packaged regional plan that met Polish needs in terms of conditionality and automaticity might be acceptable, but cautioned that Warsaw would need assurances that NATO's defense of Poland was an \"issue in its own right\" and not dependent on the security or defense of other NATO members. Kobieracki insisted that Poland would also need assurances that regional planning would not negatively impact on NATO's response to prospective crises, particularly with respect to pre-planned deployments. He urged that completion of EAGLE GUARDIAN not be delayed to accommodate incorporation of the Baltic States into a regional contingency plan. Kobieracki agreed that contingency planning discussions should not be made public.

Barack Obama abandoned the scheme in September last year, under his policy of \"resetting\" relations with Russia.The Pentagon and Nato are developing a more modest and mobile phased missile shield, inviting the Russians to take part. At a Nato summit in Lisbon last month, the allied leaders agreed for the first time to press ahead with the project and President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia was cautiously positive on the prospects for Moscow's co-operation.In November last year, Alexander Vershbow, the assistant defence secretary for international security, offered the Poles a role in the new project by hosting a land-based \"standard missile-3\" system, as seen in the leaked US embassy cables.The Poles, who have repeatedly told the Americans that they feel unthreatened by Iran but are regularly alarmed about Russia, asked \"a series of hypothetical questions on the adaptive nature of the system vis-a-vis the changing threat\".\"With regard to how Nato might defend itself from missiles coming from elsewhere than Iran or Syria, BG John Hesterman of the joint staff said that sea-borne platforms could provide surge capability against threats from an unforeseen direction, land-based sites could be upgraded with more interceptors if the scale of the threat were increased, and radars could be reoriented,\" the US embassy in Warsaw reports following the meetings.A series of cables going back over the past two years highlights the Polish eagerness to try to draw the US military, Nato assets, and possibly military bases into Poland, and a clear US ambivalence and wariness, sparking furious rows and mutual exasperation.\"How long will it take you to realise that nothing will change with Iran and Russia?\" a Polish presidential aide asks a trio of visiting US senators in May last year.\"The Polish prime minister's chief of staff, the president's deputy national security advisor, and the speaker of the Polish parliament expressed unanimous support for a large US military footprint in Poland \u2026 Most important for Poland is US involvement in Polish security, through physical presence of American forces in Poland, Nato facilities in Poland, fulfilling the commitment to provide Patriot missiles,\" the embassy reports. Six months later, Vershbow offered an alternative to the promised Patriots \"which the US believed may be more useful to Poland\".\"The three options presented were: 1) a quarterly rotation of F-16s, and the establishment of a small permanent support detachment, which would focus on enhancing Polish fighter capabilities, increasing sortie readiness and meeting Nato commitments; 2) quarterly C-130 rotations from Ramstein [airbase in Germany], also with a small permanent support detachment in Poland with the goal of increasing Polish readiness and ability to support own and Nato operations; 3) the relocation of a US naval special warfare unit from Stuttgart to Gdansk or Gdynia [on the Baltic coast].\"The Poles were enthusiastic, seeking to maximise the US offers. In February this year, the defence minister, Bogdan Klich, told the US ambassador, Lee Feinstein, in Warsaw that Poland was interested in all the options, particularly the F-16 fighter aircraft. Under government cost-cutting, Poland was closing down 20% of military facilities \"but would be saving three complexes for US forces,\" Klich said.Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also told Ellen Tauscher, the US under-secretary of state for arms control, that Warsaw was interested in the F-16s.", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US news", "The US embassy cables", "Russia", "Nato", "Europe"], "title": "WikiLeaks cables: Poland wants missile shield to protect against Russia"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:14Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Monday, 22 February 2010, 16:12C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 WARSAW 000110 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/CE (GLANTZ, KARAGIANNIS) OSD FOR MITCHELL, AMBASSADOR VERSHBOW, ADMIRAL MULLEN EUCOM FOR ADMIRAL STAVRIDIS USAREUR FOR GENERAL HAM EO 12958 DECL: 02/22/2020 TAGS PREL, MARR, MOPS, PGOV, PL SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS DEFENSE MINISTER KLICH Classified By: Classified BY Political Counselor Dan Sainz, reason 1.4 (b, d)1. (C) SUMMARY: Defense Minister Bogdan Klich told the Ambassador on February 18 that Poland is eager to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, which he described as based on a solid political foundation. He emphasized the importance to Poland of an April arrival of the first Patriot battery rotation. Klich did not repeat recent Polish government points about the configuration of future rotations of the Patriot battery. End Summary.2. (C) During a February 18 meeting with the Ambassador, Polish Defense Minister Bogdan Klich said there is a good political framework for continued U.S.-Polish defense cooperation, and noted Under Secretary Tauscher's February 8 visit had been a very successful one. Klich said he does not expect anything will happen to undermine that solid foundation. He added that the bilateral supplemental SoFA, signed December 11, provides a strong legal framework for defense ties. The SoFA ratification vote in the Sejm (the lower house of Parliament) was overwhelmingly in favor, and Senate approval would also come quickly. (Note: The Senate voted 88-1 in favor of SOFA ratification later on February 18.) Klich said President Kaczynski would sign the SoFA ratification bill quickly.HOPING FOR PATRIOTS IN APRIL----------------------------3. (C) Klich said Poland has a strong desire to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, and he highlighted the political importance of an early first rotation in Poland of the U.S. Patriot battery. He said Poland hopes the first rotation will occur in April. The Ambassador said the United States wants the rotation to be viewed as a bilateral success. In answer to Klich's questions about timing, the Ambassader said the United States has said the first rotation would take place within 90 days of SOFA ratification. He said a more precise time frame will be determined at the last bilateral planning meeting for the Patriot rotation, which will take place in the first week in March.MILITARY FACILITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE U.S. PRESENCES--------------------------------------------- -----4. (C) Klich called for talks on other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. He said he had authorized Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski and ChoD Franciszek Gagor to take part in such talks. Klich highlighted Polish interest in all of the options presented by DOD A/S Vershbow at the October High Level Defense Group discussions: F-16s, C-130's, as well as \"stable, not temporary\" special operations forces. When asked, Klich confirmed that the GoP is particularly interested in U.S. F-16 rotations. Speaking personally, he said he also had a strong interest in a special operations force presence, since he had signed a bilateral special operations cooperation agreement with Secretary Gates a year ago. ChoD Gagor added that the biggest multilateral exercise Poland is hosting this year, \"Jackal Stone 10,\" will feature special operations forces. Klich added that as part of the first in-depth infrastructure review in postwar Poland, the Defense Ministry had decided to close 20% of defense facilities, but would be &saving8 three complexes for U.S. forces.GETTING THE WORD OUT ON DEFENSE COOPERATION-------------------------------------------5. (C) The Ambassador noted that the bilateral agenda for defense cooperation is a full one, and both governments should work together to inform public opinion about the many useful exchanges under way. Klich strongly agreed that Defense Ministry and Embassy staff should follow up in this area. Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski added that if A/S Vershbow visits Warsaw in the coming months, it might be a good occasion to do some joint public diplomacy work about planning for other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. (Note: Amb. Vershbow's planned mid-March trip has been postponed.)6. (C) COMMENT: Klich's emphasis on a hoped-for April arrivalWARSAW 00000110 002 OF 002of the first Patriot battery is consistent with other government statements and press leaks that signal a decision to focus on the timing of the first deployment, as opposed to other aspects of it. In that regard, Klich did not repeat government appeals that Patriot rotations be integrated into the Polish air defense system and include \"live\" missiles, as he did in a meeting the previous week with Under Secretary Tauscher. The emphasis on the timing of the first deployment corresponds with developments in the presidential race, and Foreign Minister Sikorsky,s active candidacy for the Civic Platform nomination.

They claim the treasured panel depicting Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of Ludovico Sforza, ruler of Milan and patron of Leonardo, is too delicate to travel. It is one of barely 20 paintings attributed to the artist.The Krakow division of the Association of Art Historians has sent an impassioned letter to ArtWatch UK, the restoration watchdog, to draw the world's attention to their \"anxiety\".In a letter to be published tomorrow, its president, Joanna Daranowska-Lukaszewska, writes: \"The sending of the Krakow picture abroad is insured for \u20ac300m [\u00a3250m], but in the event of a disaster no one would be able to restore this priceless masterpiece to life. We appeal to [ArtWatch] to draw the attention of world public opinion to the great dangers now faced by \u2026 common property of the whole cultural world.\"It is not just in Poland that fears are growing over the National Gallery's plans for its exhibition, \"Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan\". Concern is being voiced that other Leonardo paintings \u2013 La Belle Ferroni\u00e8re, from the Louvre; the Madonna Litta, from the Hermitage in St Petersburg; and Saint Jerome, from the Pinacoteca Vaticana in Rome \u2013 also face perilous journeys.But in Krakow \u2013 where Lady with an Ermine sits in the Czartoryski Museum \u2013 those concerns have reached an acute level. \"If you transport a picture panel such as the Lady with an Ermine \u2026 even the most ideal methods in the form of modern environmental chambers or special anti-shock frames are not able to sufficiently protect the work against a variety of vibrations, shocks or changes in pressure,\" said Professor Grazyna Korpal, dean of conservation.\"By allowing the painting to travel we create yet another serious threat [from] \u2026 possible human error. Such masterpieces require exceptional protection. The fundamental principle is the unconditional restriction of movement.\"A source at the National Museum revealed that a letter from Poland's deputy cultural and national heritage minister permitted the picture to be transported to London.Michael Daley of ArtWatch UK said it was hard to justify allowing such great masterpieces to be moved: \"With paintings on panel, any movement is dangerous and bound to have a deleterious effect. Why take the chance? There is nothing to contradict the warnings of the Polish restorers. Moving the Lady with an Ermine is absolutely crazy.\"He added that the danger of theft is heightened during any move. Last week a Picasso was among some 30 artworks valued at \u00a34.1m stolen in transit between galleries in Germany and Spain.Even moving works from room to room within a gallery presented dangers, Daley said. Two years ago, a Renaissance painting by Domenico Beccafumi was dropped while being taken off a wall at the National Gallery. Previously unpublished photographs of the damage will be published on ArtWatch's website tomorrow, along with the appeal from Poland and accounts of other accidents.Adam Zamoyski, UK historian and chairman of the Czartoryski Foundation, confirmed that Lady with an Ermine had an export licence.

Most high-ranking and mid-level Poles have stayed on in their positions in the Vatican bureaucracy since the death of John Paul, maintaining the Vatican's Polish flavor. Pope Benedict has consistently made gestures to acknowledge the importance of the Polish Catholic Church in the context of European and world Catholicism - an importance embodied most immediately by the crowds of Polish pilgrims that still flock to Rome. Pope Benedict and other Vatican officials maintain Pope John Paul's hope that Poland will serve as a counter-weight to Western European secularism, but are wary of nationalistic or divisive forces with a Catholic label, such as media outlets under the control of Polish station Radio Maryja. With Pope Benedict XVI's May 25-28 visit to Poland looming, many in and around the Vatican are addressing these subjects. End Summary.------------------------Poland: Still a Presence------------------------3. (C) The papacy of John Paul II is slowly fading into history, but Poland remains an important part of the conversation at the Vatican. Recent months have offered much evidence of this, and numerous opportunities to assess Holy See - Poland relations. Late last year, several groups of Polish bishops came to Rome for their quinquennial \"ad limina\" visit to the pope and Vatican officials. In December, then-President Aleksander Kwasniewski made his swan song visit to the Vatican and met with Benedict XVI. In January, his successor, President Lech Kaczynski, made his first trip abroad as president and met Pope Benedict XVI. The first anniversary of the death of the Polish pope in April saw waves of Polish pilgrims visiting Rome, but the sound of Polish on the streets of Rome hardly abated for the Easter celebrations two weeks later. Add periodic events commemorating various dates in the life of John Paul II or initiatives that he began, and there remains an inevitable Polish flavor to life at the Vatican.4. (C) In the aftermath of the death of the Polish pope, Pole-weary Italian journalists heralded the impending exodus of Poles from Rome and the Vatican Curia (bureaucracy) (ref a). Their hope was that an Italian would regain the papacy and add to the already imposing number of Italians in the Curia. Many predicted that the papacy would inevitably turn its attention from the homeland of the deceased pontiff. In the end, Joseph Ratzinger of Germany was elected pope, and the Poles, by and large, stayed. And although it was inevitable that the death of John Paul would signal a change in the relationship between Poland and the Holy See, the bond remains strong. The Vatican has continued to play close attention to Poland and Poles continue to wield great influence in Vatican City.-----------------------------------Polish Personnel, Influence Remain-----------------------------------5. (C) Benedict moved his own German secretary, Monsignor Georg Ganswein, into the Apostolic Palace, but he kept on Pope John Paul's Polish aide, Mieczyslaw Mokrzycki (an ethnic Pole from Ukraine) in a very visible position in the papal household. Other prominent Poles at the Vatican, such as Cardinal Zenon Grocholewski (Congregation for Education), Monsignor Antoni Stankiewicz (Roman Rota - the Vatican's high court), Archbishop Edward Nowak (Congregation for the Causes of Saints), Monsignor Krzysztof Nitkiewicz (Congregation for Oriental Churches), Archbishop Stanislaw Rylko (Council for Laity), and others are continuing in high-profile positions. [Note: Rylko was passed over for an expected elevation to the College of Cardinals at the most recent consistory, but still heads an important Vatican department.]6. (C) Benedict also named London-born Polish priest Wojciech Giertych as theologian of the Papal Household, another prestigious position. Giertych is the son of well-known PolishVATICAN 00000083 002.2 OF 004nationalist Jedrzej Giertych (1903-92), and brother of Maciej Giertych of the League of Polish Families party in Poland. Maciej's son, Roman, is the newly-named Education Minister (as reported by Embassy Warsaw) and a member of the Catholic organization, Opus Dei . Though Fr. Giertych was selected for his erudition and preaching rather than his nationality (we also doubt his family connections played a role in the appointment), his presence presents another opportunity for Polish visibility and influence. A host of lower-level Polish functionaries continue as well, doing a lot of the heavy lifting in and around the Vatican. The only major name to leave Rome in the wake of the death of John Paul was Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, John Paul's longtime secretary, whom Benedict sent to follow in his mentor's footsteps as Cardinal Archbishop of Krakow.7. (C) \"Even after the death of the Holy Father, we have a strong presence here,\" Grzegorz Kaszak, rector of the Polish College (residential seminary) in Rome and a former Vatican bureaucrat, told us. Kaszak pointed out that Poles had been making inroads at the Vatican for over twenty years. Their influence was unlikely to diminish overnight. Even when Benedict XVI makes the major changes in the Curia that Vatican-watchers have been predicting for some time, most Poles here do not predict that Polish influence in the Vatican will drop precipitously. \"We are now part of the culture here,\" and a crucial element of the Church in Europe and in the world, Kaszak insisted.------------------------------------------Vatican Publicizes Stats on Polish Church------------------------------------------8. (C) The statistics bear Kaszak out. We defer to Embassy Warsaw on the strength of the Polish Catholic Church domestically, but the Vatican was touting its numbers in advance of the pope's trip. The Holy See released statistics noting the country's 36.6 million Catholics at some 10,114 parishes and 800 pastoral centers. There are some 28 thousand priests and almost 25 thousand other religious personnel (nuns and other male religious) with 6,400 students studying to become priests. Vatican-based sources have remarked to us that Poland's Catholic muscle is felt far beyond the country's borders. In parishes in Italy, other European countries, the U.S., and elsewhere, it is not uncommon to come upon Polish clergy, either on loan, or having taken up residence in a foreign diocese. What's most important to the Holy See is the \"formation of the youth,\" according to Dariusz Giers, a Polish priest working at the Vatican's Health Ministry. \"The Vatican knows we have excellent programs to educate young people [in religious matters]\" he said, emphasizing the importance of this factor for the continuing strength of the religion. What's more, many at the Vatican consider Polish Catholicism to be dependably orthodox, compared to more liberal strains of the faith found in some parts of Western Europe. \"The Poles are grounded in the faith,\" one contact opined. \"You wouldn't have to worry about the Da Vinci Code confusing people in Poland.\"---------------------Ubiquitous Presence---------------------9. (C) As if to emphasize the ubiquitous presence of Poles in and around the Vatican, Kaszak exchanged several greetings in Polish with passing nuns as he spoke to us not far from St. Peter's Square. In fact, whether one's in the Vatican grocery store or post office, St. Peter's Basilica, or walking any of the streets around Vatican City, it's hard to go twenty minutes without hearing some Polish. And this is not just from the Vatican functionaries from Poland and the many Polish nuns who staff several Vatican offices and residences. The flow of Polish pilgrims to Rome has waned little even a year after the death of Pope John Paul. Of course, massive crowds of Poles came to Rome to observe the first anniversary of the pope's death on April 2. A mass said by Pope Benedict and other events packed an overflowing St. Peter's Square. But it seemed to onlookers that the Polish influx was just as great - or greater - for the Easter celebrations not long afterwards. As is typical for the outdoor audiences and public masses, banners from Polish parishes and towns highlighted Polish participation. \"I think there were even more Poles here for Easter,\" Vatican bureaucrat Giers told us. \"This has been nearly constant since the death of the Holy Father. I don't see signs of it slowing down.\"----------------------------Pope Reaches Out to Poles----------------------------10. (C) The Holy See clearly recognizes who its audience is. At his weekly public gathering (a mixture of prayer and pep rally), Pope Benedict speaks every week to the crowd in Polish,VATICAN 00000083 003.6 OF 004in addition to Italian, French, English, Spanish, and German. Polish is typically one of the languages used for prayers at Vatican masses. The pope often makes special emphasis on the Polish contingent at the audiences and other events, as on May 3, when he noted the anniversary of the 1791 ratification of the Polish Constitution and heralded the anniversary a noteworthy event in Polish Catholic history. Benedict XVI has also devoted some of his rare private audiences to Polish or Polish-affiliated groups such an April visit with representatives of the Krakow-based publishing house, Znak, publisher of Pope John Paul's last book and other Church-related works. That Pope Benedict, who travels much less than his predecessor, chose Poland as his second trip abroad (his first was a visit to World Youth Day in Germany that had been scheduled before his election) is perhaps the strongest sign of this recognition (septel).---------------------------------------A Counter-Weight to Secular Europe?---------------------------------------11. (C) The Holy See's attention to Poland is not simply customer service or \"taking care of the troops\". As was clear under Pope John Paul II, the Vatican has high hopes that Poland will serve as a counter-weight to Western European secularism as the nation makes itself more at home in an integrated Europe. Pope Benedict's preoccupation with what he sees as Europe's increasing psychological distance from its Christian roots is clear (ref a). He has continued to focus on Poland's potential in combating this trend. This was one of the themes of the visit of several groups of Polish bishops to the Vatican at the end of last year. \"It's a topic that always comes up,\" explained Monsignor Michael Banach, the Holy See MFA's country director for Poland. He told us that the two sides recognized that the Polish bishops needed to exert leadership in the face of Western European secularism. Certainly the Holy See hopes that Poland will hold the line at the EU on \"life and family\" issues that arise. But the necessity of maintaining and fortifying the faith internally in Polish society is perhaps an equally important - if not unrelated - focus. Several sources have told us that both sides are keenly aware of the danger that European secularism will dilute Polish faith and identity.-------------Trojan Horse-------------12. (C) Looking at Poland's position in Europe and the EU, several Polish interlocutors told us that Western European suspicion of Poland as a \"Trojan horse\" for the U.S. in the EU was not just a phenomenon among the laity - it had also infected the Vatican. \"We definitely get that feeling\" from a few of the French, German and other Western European prelates at the Vatican, said Giers. The war in Iraq, unpopular among many Vatican officials, has certainly played a role here. Traditional Polish affection for the U.S., on the other hand, seems as strong as ever among the Polish clergy stationed or studying in Rome. In conversations at a dinner not long ago at the Polish College, several seminarians and priests made a point of praising the U.S. and lauding USG foreign policy.----------------Radio Maryja----------------13. (C) Although the Vatican is on guard against encroaching secularism, it shares with many Polish bishops a wariness of Radio Maryja, the Catholic radio station accused of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Banach and Piotr Samerek, DCM at the Polish Embassy to the Holy See, told us that during their ad limina visits, several of the bishops appealed to Vatican Foreign Minister Giovanni Lajolo and others to clamp down on excesses of Radio Maryja and its sister media outlets. The complaints included Radio Maryja's meddling in Polish politics. According to Banach, Lajolo was sympathetic, and expressed his reservations about the network. But Lajolo took a typical Vatican line in judging the matter to be an Polish internal affair. Banach told us that Lajolo told more than one group of bishops that they had to deal with Radio Maryja themselves as part of their \"pastoral responsibilities\". Though media attributed some comments critical of Radio Maryja to Pope Benedict, the Holy See clearly did not want to get involved.14. (C) When Papal Nuncio Jozef Kowalczyk made an April statement chastising Radio Maryja, many assumed that the Vatican had finally decided to clamp down on the network. Our contacts tell us that wasn't the case, saying that while the Holy See agreed with the spirit of Kowalczyk's intervention, the nuncio had spoken out on his own. Some following the issue at the Vatican have told us that Kowalczyk went too far, given the Vatican's view of the matter as an internal Polish question. InVATICAN 00000083 004.4 OF 004any case, as Banach told us, things seem to be improving, as the proposed programming board set up to monitor the content of the station's broadcasts looks like a step in the right direction.----------------Other Influences----------------15. (C) As the Holy See examines the many aspects of its relationship with Poland, it seeks to maintain its focus on the pastoral rather than political. But religious subjects routinely morph into political ones. Banach wouldn't bite when asked for his view of the entry of radical elements such as Andrzej Lepper or ultra-Catholics like Roman Giertych into Poland's governing coalition and ministerial ranks (ref c). He did say that the Vatican understood the dangers that right-wing nationalists posed to Poland's future, and allowed that some saw a danger of Catholic fringe groups discrediting the mainstream Church. As far as the reputation for anti-Semitism that stuck to some nationalists, Banach commented that \"no one\" wanted to see the progress that had been made on such issues lost.----------Comment----------16. (C) It is only a little more than a year after the death of Pope John Paul II, and it is inevitable that with the passage of time Poland will eventually become less central to the world of the Vatican. John-Paul era Vatican bureaucrats will eventually move on. Poland may become more secular. The memory of the Polish pope will certainly recede further into the past. The growth of the Catholic Church in certain parts of the developing world could also play a role here, pushing the Poles, Italians and others to less prominent roles with the Holy See and capturing even more attention in Curial offices. For the near future, however, Poland is assured an important place at the Vatican table.ROONEY", "tags": ["The US embassy cables", "Catholicism", "Pope Benedict XVI", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Poland", "European Union", "Vatican", "Europe", "The papacy"], "title": "US embassy cables: Vatican hoped that Poland would 'hold the family line' in the EU"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:13Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Thursday, 07 May 2009, 05:17C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 WARSAW 000467 SIPDIS EUR, PM, H EO 12958 DECL: 04/20/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, MARR, OREP, RS, PL SUBJECT: POLAND - CODEL LEVIN DISCUSSES MISSILE DEFENSE, PATRIOTSREF: WARSAW 375Classified By: Ambassador Ashe for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1. (C) SUMMARY: In meetings with CODEL Levin, the Polish Prime Minister's chief of staff, the President's deputy national security advisor, and the speaker of the Polish parliament expressed unanimous support for a large U.S. military footprint in Poland to bolster Article 5 guarantees. PM chief of staff Slawomir Nowak told CODEL that, regardless of the U.S. decision on Missile Defense, Poland expects the U.S. to \"honor its commitments\" to bring a Patriot battery to Poland. All three Polish officials requested that the U.S. keep Poland updated on the status of dialogue with Russia, suggesting that Russia, not Iran, poses the greater threat to Poland. CODEL's meeting with FM Sikorski is reported septel. END SUMMARY.2. (C) Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), visited Warsaw April 15-16 to discuss Missile Defense and Polish interest in a U.S. Patriot battery rotation with Polish officials, including Prime Minister Tusk's chief of staff Slawomir Nowak, Deputy Chief of President Kaczynski's National Security Bureau Witold Waszczykowski, and Parliamentary Speaker Bronislaw Komorowski (Civic Platform, PO). The Senators' meetings with Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski are reported septel.U.S. \"ROCK SOLID\" ON ARTICLE FIVE3. (C) Senator Levin began all three meetings by conveying the President's message that the U.S. commitment to the NATO Article 5 guarantee is \"rock solid.\" While U.S. support for Poland may differ in form under the Obama administration, U.S. support for Poland will be strong. When asked whether Warsaw felt assured that NATO would honor its Article 5 commitments to Poland, Waszczykowski said \"we still have our doubts,\" adding that some European members -- particularly France -- prefer talk to action, he wryly added \"that's why we bought F-16s and not French Mirages, and why we went through with the Missile Defense deal.\"PATRIOTS AND AMERICAN BOOTS4. (C) Senator Levin warned all three interlocutors that if the Czechs reject the proposed MD radar site, the Polish component of MD would be put in jeopardy under current U.S. legislation. Nowak expressed confidence that the Czechs would ratify the agreement with the U.S., suggesting they are simply waiting for a U.S. decision on MD. Speaker Komorowski acknowledged the provisions of U.S. law, but stated Poland does not want to be responsible for Czech problems. Senator Collins acknowledged the political cost to Poland of supporting MD, and asked for Komorowski,s views on how to maintain support for the United States if it pursues a different course.5. (C) Asked whether Poland would be reassured by the presence of Patriot batteries in lieu of MD, Nowak told CODEL Levin that, regardless of MD's fate, the GOP expects the USG to \"honor its commitments\" on Patriots. Poland intends to build a comprehensive air-defense system and has identified Patriots as \"the most important element\" of its defense modernization efforts. Nowak said Poland \"will not suffer\" if the U.S. withdraws from MD, but repeatedly asserted that the GOP is \"counting on Patriots.\" (NB: At one point, Nowak even intervened when his interpreter mistakenly said the Poles \"would like Patriots.\" \"No, we are counting on them,\" Nowak emphasized in English.)6. (C) Waszczykowski was less adamant about Patriots, stating that Poland and the U.S. had a binding political agreement on security matters, which he hoped the United States would respect. He added that Poland \"wants U.S. boots on the ground\" -- not necessarily as a tripwire, but as a deterrent. Nowak similarly stressed Poland's strong interest in \"deepening\" military cooperation, ideally to include a large U.S. footprint in Poland. He mused that one Patriot battery and ten MD interceptors do not constitute the \"impressive presence\" that Poland is hoping for.7. (C) Speaker Komorowski and Nowak both pointed out that, by agreeing to host the MD site, Poland had paid a \"high price\" -- especially in its relations with other EU members and with Russia. Komorowski expressed concern that Poland had again become a Russian target after a dozen years of improving relations -- senior Russian officials have threatened to target Poland with nuclear missiles, are stirring upWARSAW 00000467 002 OF 002anti-Polish sentiment among Russians, and are acting against Poland's interests in Ukraine.8. (C) Komorowski argued that the U.S. needs to fulfill its symbolic agreement to show involvement in defense of Polish territory. If the new administration is changing U.S. political priorities, it also needs to engage in dialogue with Poland, not just Russia. Most important for Poland is U.S. involvement in Polish security, through physical presence of American forces in Poland, NATO facilities in Poland, fulfilling the commitment to provide Patriot missiles, and greater U.S.-Polish cooperation.DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA9. (C) Komorowski, Nowak, and Waszczykowski stressed the importance of keeping Poland updated on the status of U.S.-Russia talks. Nowak stressed the GOP's strong interest in a positive outcome, but reminded the CODEL that U.S. negotiators had promised the USG would overcome Russian objections to MD. \"The MD site is an American base. The burden of achieving Russian agreement is on the U.S. side,\" he said. Even so, Nowak said, Poland had agreed to accept confidence-building measures with the Russians and was also working to convince Moscow that MD is not a threat to Russia's nuclear arsenal. Regardless, Russia will find it difficult to accept any \"tangible manifestation\" of a NATO presence in Poland or the Czech Republic.10. (C) Nowak said Poland had not discussed Patriots with the Russians. Russia should not have a say in Poland's defense modernization planning. Noting that Poland's armed forces are \"defensive in nature,\" Nowak reiterated that Poland's primary goal is to increase interoperability with allies.11. (C) Presidential Advisor Waszczykowski reacted more emotionally. While Washington is entitled to talk to Russia, to work toward a solution to the Iranian threat, and to make its own decision about the MD initiative, the U.S. should take care not to undermine Poland's security. He then wondered aloud, \"How long will it take you to realize that nothing will change with Iran and Russia?\" Waszczykowski asserted that Moscow is trying to regain its sphere of influence and stressed the critical importance of an increased U.S. or NATO presence for Poland's security. He added that Russia continues to deny its historical wrong-doings against Poland, imposes economic sanctions against Poland at will, and frequently disrupts the flow of oil and gas.THREAT FROM IRAN?12. (C) In all three meetings, Senator Nelson expressed doubt that Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons or missile programs, but noted that the Iranian threat to Europe could be met for the foreseeable future with the AEGIS and THAAD systems. Waszczykowski, who served as Poland's Ambassador to Tehran (1999-2002), agreed that Iran poses an increasing threat to the United States and Europe. He said that the Iranian regime has no incentive to warm relations with Washington because the regime has built its own legitimacy on the cornerstone of anti-Americanism.13. (C) Nowak and Komorowski told the CODEL that Poland does not perceive a direct threat from Iran. Nowak stated that, as an active and loyal ally, Poland had agreed to host the MD site because of the threat Iran poses to the U.S. and others in NATO. He noted that Poland's desire to be a strong ally was also the basis for its activity in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nowak said Poland perceives a greater threat from non-state actors, but conceded that Iran's support for terrorist organizations was troubling. He added that Poland's decision to host MD had moved it \"closer to the top of Iran's list,\" and, as a result, made Patriots more important to Poland's security.14.

But the leaked embassy cables show that a battery of Patriot missiles in the north-east of the country lacked one crucial component \u2013 live missiles.In May this year the Americans finally started rotating the missiles in and out of Morag, close to Kaliningrad, the Russian territory on the Baltic sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. For two years, the Polish prime minister, foreign and defence ministers had sold the Patriots to the public as a great boost to national air defences (against Russia).So when the Americans told them in late 2008 that the missiles would not be live, at least initially, the furious Poles complained they had expected an operational weapon, not \"potted plants\", the cables report.Even then the Poles did not know the full truth. In February last year, the then US ambassador, Victor Ashe, cabled back to Washington: \"Polish officials are not privy to the full range of US planning and thinking with regard to the prospective Patriot battery rotation here, but they do have expectations \u2013 some naive, some tactical.\"This is a good juncture to point out the most glaring gap in understanding between us and the Poles. The Poles have not been told that the battery will rotate without actual missiles \u2013 ie not only will the rotation not be operational in the initial phase, but it will also not be operational, and certainly interoperable, at any point in our current plans. This will be a question of basic definitions for the Poles: is it a Patriot battery if it doesn't have live missiles?\"The Poles think the Patriots will become not only operable, but interoperable, over time \u2013 thus enhancing Poland's air defence.\"The Poles also believed the Patriot installation would be permanently manned by 110 Americans, while the US was planning to deploy at most 30.It was not until November last year that Vershbow told the Poles bluntly that the Patriot battery \"will be solely for training and exercises\".The Americans rubbed salt in Polish wounds by stressing that \"the Patriot battery would not be operational at any time \u2026 It was made clear that training opportunities would be limited to basic familiarisation training due to current disclosure restrictions unless Poland decided to buy Patriot systems.\"While, publicly, the Polish leadership continued to stress the centrality of the Patriot battery to national defences, privately top officials talked only of its \"political importance\".\"[Polish defence minister] Klich did not repeat government appeals that Patriot rotations be integrated into the Polish air defence system and include 'live' missiles, as he did in a meeting the previous week.\"Stanislaw Komorowski, the deputy defence minister and former ambassador in London, who did most of the negotiating, died a month before the Patriot battery arrived in the plane crash at Smolensk in Russia that killed scores of the Polish elite.In November last year he admitted that \"the Patriot's contribution to Polish air defence is minimal, though important symbolically.\"Ian Traynor", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "Nato", "The US embassy cables", "US foreign policy", "US news", "Europe"], "title": "Wikileaks cables: Poland furious over getting 'potted plants', not missiles"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:10Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Friday, 18 December 2009, 14:36S E C R E T WARSAW 001228 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/CE (GLANTZ) AND EUR/RPM EO 12958 DECL: 12/18/2019 TAGS NATO, MCAP, MARR, PREL, PL SUBJECT: POLAND COULD ACCEPT \"COMPLEMENTARY\" CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR POLAND AND BALTIC STATESREF: STATE 127892Classified By: DCM William Heidt for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)1. (S) SUMMARY: Deputy DefMin Stanislaw Komorowski and MFA Security Policy Director Adam Kobieracki reacted similarly when DCM raised reftel points -- Poland strongly agrees with the necessity of contingency planning for the Baltic States but would like to avoid delays in the completion of the EAGLE GUARDIAN plan for Poland. However, both Komorowski and Kobieracki suggested that Poland might be able to accept a \"creatively packaged\" plan that included separate but complementary components (\"chapters\") for Poland and the Baltic States. They agreed that discussions should not be made public. END SUMMARY.2. (S) In a meeting with DCM on December 17, Komorowski expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation with other NATO contingency planners on EAGLE GUARDIAN. Poles were active participants in the process and looked forward to its completion by the end of February or early March. Komorowski was skeptical that a regional approach to contingency planning was the best way ahead. Komorowski said Warsaw would prefer a unique plan for Poland, although he allowed that Warsaw could accept the notion of two complementary chapters for Poland and the Baltic States within EAGLE GUARDIAN. More important for Poland was the need to avoid any delay in completing the plan or to rehash already-agreed components, such as the threat assessment. He added that he \"agreed entirely\" that the issue should remain as secret as possible, and that it was in the \"common interest\" to avoid public discussion of NATO contingency planning.3. (S) Kobieracki made similar points to DCM on December 15, and suggested the USG engage in detailed consultations with Polish officials in Brussels and with the General Staff in Warsaw. He said Poland had hoped that a revised EAGLE GUARDIAN plan could be used as a starting point for developing contingency plans for the Baltic States rather than become intertwined with them. He hinted that a creatively packaged regional plan that met Polish needs in terms of conditionality and automaticity might be acceptable, but cautioned that Warsaw would need assurances that NATO's defense of Poland was an \"issue in its own right\" and not dependent on the security or defense of other NATO members. Kobieracki insisted that Poland would also need assurances that regional planning would not negatively impact on NATO's response to prospective crises, particularly with respect to pre-planned deployments. He urged that completion of EAGLE GUARDIAN not be delayed to accommodate incorporation of the Baltic States into a regional contingency plan. Kobieracki agreed that contingency planning discussions should not be made public.

Barack Obama abandoned the scheme in September last year, under his policy of \"resetting\" relations with Russia.The Pentagon and Nato are developing a more modest and mobile phased missile shield, inviting the Russians to take part. At a Nato summit in Lisbon last month, the allied leaders agreed for the first time to press ahead with the project and President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia was cautiously positive on the prospects for Moscow's co-operation.In November last year, Alexander Vershbow, the assistant defence secretary for international security, offered the Poles a role in the new project by hosting a land-based \"standard missile-3\" system, as seen in the leaked US embassy cables.The Poles, who have repeatedly told the Americans that they feel unthreatened by Iran but are regularly alarmed about Russia, asked \"a series of hypothetical questions on the adaptive nature of the system vis-a-vis the changing threat\".\"With regard to how Nato might defend itself from missiles coming from elsewhere than Iran or Syria, BG John Hesterman of the joint staff said that sea-borne platforms could provide surge capability against threats from an unforeseen direction, land-based sites could be upgraded with more interceptors if the scale of the threat were increased, and radars could be reoriented,\" the US embassy in Warsaw reports following the meetings.A series of cables going back over the past two years highlights the Polish eagerness to try to draw the US military, Nato assets, and possibly military bases into Poland, and a clear US ambivalence and wariness, sparking furious rows and mutual exasperation.\"How long will it take you to realise that nothing will change with Iran and Russia?\" a Polish presidential aide asks a trio of visiting US senators in May last year.\"The Polish prime minister's chief of staff, the president's deputy national security advisor, and the speaker of the Polish parliament expressed unanimous support for a large US military footprint in Poland \u2026 Most important for Poland is US involvement in Polish security, through physical presence of American forces in Poland, Nato facilities in Poland, fulfilling the commitment to provide Patriot missiles,\" the embassy reports. Six months later, Vershbow offered an alternative to the promised Patriots \"which the US believed may be more useful to Poland\".\"The three options presented were: 1) a quarterly rotation of F-16s, and the establishment of a small permanent support detachment, which would focus on enhancing Polish fighter capabilities, increasing sortie readiness and meeting Nato commitments; 2) quarterly C-130 rotations from Ramstein [airbase in Germany], also with a small permanent support detachment in Poland with the goal of increasing Polish readiness and ability to support own and Nato operations; 3) the relocation of a US naval special warfare unit from Stuttgart to Gdansk or Gdynia [on the Baltic coast].\"The Poles were enthusiastic, seeking to maximise the US offers. In February this year, the defence minister, Bogdan Klich, told the US ambassador, Lee Feinstein, in Warsaw that Poland was interested in all the options, particularly the F-16 fighter aircraft. Under government cost-cutting, Poland was closing down 20% of military facilities \"but would be saving three complexes for US forces,\" Klich said.Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also told Ellen Tauscher, the US under-secretary of state for arms control, that Warsaw was interested in the F-16s.", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US news", "The US embassy cables", "Russia", "Nato", "Europe"], "title": "WikiLeaks cables: Poland wants missile shield to protect against Russia"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:14Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Monday, 22 February 2010, 16:12C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 WARSAW 000110 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/CE (GLANTZ, KARAGIANNIS) OSD FOR MITCHELL, AMBASSADOR VERSHBOW, ADMIRAL MULLEN EUCOM FOR ADMIRAL STAVRIDIS USAREUR FOR GENERAL HAM EO 12958 DECL: 02/22/2020 TAGS PREL, MARR, MOPS, PGOV, PL SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS DEFENSE MINISTER KLICH Classified By: Classified BY Political Counselor Dan Sainz, reason 1.4 (b, d)1. (C) SUMMARY: Defense Minister Bogdan Klich told the Ambassador on February 18 that Poland is eager to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, which he described as based on a solid political foundation. He emphasized the importance to Poland of an April arrival of the first Patriot battery rotation. Klich did not repeat recent Polish government points about the configuration of future rotations of the Patriot battery. End Summary.2. (C) During a February 18 meeting with the Ambassador, Polish Defense Minister Bogdan Klich said there is a good political framework for continued U.S.-Polish defense cooperation, and noted Under Secretary Tauscher's February 8 visit had been a very successful one. Klich said he does not expect anything will happen to undermine that solid foundation. He added that the bilateral supplemental SoFA, signed December 11, provides a strong legal framework for defense ties. The SoFA ratification vote in the Sejm (the lower house of Parliament) was overwhelmingly in favor, and Senate approval would also come quickly. (Note: The Senate voted 88-1 in favor of SOFA ratification later on February 18.) Klich said President Kaczynski would sign the SoFA ratification bill quickly.HOPING FOR PATRIOTS IN APRIL----------------------------3. (C) Klich said Poland has a strong desire to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, and he highlighted the political importance of an early first rotation in Poland of the U.S. Patriot battery. He said Poland hopes the first rotation will occur in April. The Ambassador said the United States wants the rotation to be viewed as a bilateral success. In answer to Klich's questions about timing, the Ambassader said the United States has said the first rotation would take place within 90 days of SOFA ratification. He said a more precise time frame will be determined at the last bilateral planning meeting for the Patriot rotation, which will take place in the first week in March.MILITARY FACILITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE U.S. PRESENCES--------------------------------------------- -----4. (C) Klich called for talks on other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. He said he had authorized Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski and ChoD Franciszek Gagor to take part in such talks. Klich highlighted Polish interest in all of the options presented by DOD A/S Vershbow at the October High Level Defense Group discussions: F-16s, C-130's, as well as \"stable, not temporary\" special operations forces. When asked, Klich confirmed that the GoP is particularly interested in U.S. F-16 rotations. Speaking personally, he said he also had a strong interest in a special operations force presence, since he had signed a bilateral special operations cooperation agreement with Secretary Gates a year ago. ChoD Gagor added that the biggest multilateral exercise Poland is hosting this year, \"Jackal Stone 10,\" will feature special operations forces. Klich added that as part of the first in-depth infrastructure review in postwar Poland, the Defense Ministry had decided to close 20% of defense facilities, but would be &saving8 three complexes for U.S. forces.GETTING THE WORD OUT ON DEFENSE COOPERATION-------------------------------------------5. (C) The Ambassador noted that the bilateral agenda for defense cooperation is a full one, and both governments should work together to inform public opinion about the many useful exchanges under way. Klich strongly agreed that Defense Ministry and Embassy staff should follow up in this area. Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski added that if A/S Vershbow visits Warsaw in the coming months, it might be a good occasion to do some joint public diplomacy work about planning for other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. (Note: Amb. Vershbow's planned mid-March trip has been postponed.)6. (C) COMMENT: Klich's emphasis on a hoped-for April arrivalWARSAW 00000110 002 OF 002of the first Patriot battery is consistent with other government statements and press leaks that signal a decision to focus on the timing of the first deployment, as opposed to other aspects of it. In that regard, Klich did not repeat government appeals that Patriot rotations be integrated into the Polish air defense system and include \"live\" missiles, as he did in a meeting the previous week with Under Secretary Tauscher. The emphasis on the timing of the first deployment corresponds with developments in the presidential race, and Foreign Minister Sikorsky,s active candidacy for the Civic Platform nomination.

They claim the treasured panel depicting Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of Ludovico Sforza, ruler of Milan and patron of Leonardo, is too delicate to travel. It is one of barely 20 paintings attributed to the artist.The Krakow division of the Association of Art Historians has sent an impassioned letter to ArtWatch UK, the restoration watchdog, to draw the world's attention to their \"anxiety\".In a letter to be published tomorrow, its president, Joanna Daranowska-Lukaszewska, writes: \"The sending of the Krakow picture abroad is insured for \u20ac300m [\u00a3250m], but in the event of a disaster no one would be able to restore this priceless masterpiece to life. We appeal to [ArtWatch] to draw the attention of world public opinion to the great dangers now faced by \u2026 common property of the whole cultural world.\"It is not just in Poland that fears are growing over the National Gallery's plans for its exhibition, \"Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan\". Concern is being voiced that other Leonardo paintings \u2013 La Belle Ferroni\u00e8re, from the Louvre; the Madonna Litta, from the Hermitage in St Petersburg; and Saint Jerome, from the Pinacoteca Vaticana in Rome \u2013 also face perilous journeys.But in Krakow \u2013 where Lady with an Ermine sits in the Czartoryski Museum \u2013 those concerns have reached an acute level. \"If you transport a picture panel such as the Lady with an Ermine \u2026 even the most ideal methods in the form of modern environmental chambers or special anti-shock frames are not able to sufficiently protect the work against a variety of vibrations, shocks or changes in pressure,\" said Professor Grazyna Korpal, dean of conservation.\"By allowing the painting to travel we create yet another serious threat [from] \u2026 possible human error. Such masterpieces require exceptional protection. The fundamental principle is the unconditional restriction of movement.\"A source at the National Museum revealed that a letter from Poland's deputy cultural and national heritage minister permitted the picture to be transported to London.Michael Daley of ArtWatch UK said it was hard to justify allowing such great masterpieces to be moved: \"With paintings on panel, any movement is dangerous and bound to have a deleterious effect. Why take the chance? There is nothing to contradict the warnings of the Polish restorers. Moving the Lady with an Ermine is absolutely crazy.\"He added that the danger of theft is heightened during any move. Last week a Picasso was among some 30 artworks valued at \u00a34.1m stolen in transit between galleries in Germany and Spain.Even moving works from room to room within a gallery presented dangers, Daley said. Two years ago, a Renaissance painting by Domenico Beccafumi was dropped while being taken off a wall at the National Gallery. Previously unpublished photographs of the damage will be published on ArtWatch's website tomorrow, along with the appeal from Poland and accounts of other accidents.Adam Zamoyski, UK historian and chairman of the Czartoryski Foundation, confirmed that Lady with an Ermine had an export licence.

(C) Even without Pope John Paul II at the helm of the Catholic Church, the Holy See's attention to Poland and the influence of Poles here remains an important dynamic in the workings of the Vatican. Recent months have offered much evidence of this, and numerous opportunities to assess the Poland - Holy See relationship. Most high-ranking and mid-level Poles have stayed on in their positions in the Vatican bureaucracy since the death of John Paul, maintaining the Vatican's Polish flavor. Pope Benedict has consistently made gestures to acknowledge the importance of the Polish Catholic Church in the context of European and world Catholicism - an importance embodied most immediately by the crowds of Polish pilgrims that still flock to Rome. Pope Benedict and other Vatican officials maintain Pope John Paul's hope that Poland will serve as a counter-weight to Western European secularism, but are wary of nationalistic or divisive forces with a Catholic label, such as media outlets under the control of Polish station Radio Maryja. With Pope Benedict XVI's May 25-28 visit to Poland looming, many in and around the Vatican are addressing these subjects. End Summary.------------------------Poland: Still a Presence------------------------3. (C) The papacy of John Paul II is slowly fading into history, but Poland remains an important part of the conversation at the Vatican. Recent months have offered much evidence of this, and numerous opportunities to assess Holy See - Poland relations. Late last year, several groups of Polish bishops came to Rome for their quinquennial \"ad limina\" visit to the pope and Vatican officials. In December, then-President Aleksander Kwasniewski made his swan song visit to the Vatican and met with Benedict XVI. In January, his successor, President Lech Kaczynski, made his first trip abroad as president and met Pope Benedict XVI. The first anniversary of the death of the Polish pope in April saw waves of Polish pilgrims visiting Rome, but the sound of Polish on the streets of Rome hardly abated for the Easter celebrations two weeks later. Add periodic events commemorating various dates in the life of John Paul II or initiatives that he began, and there remains an inevitable Polish flavor to life at the Vatican.4. (C) In the aftermath of the death of the Polish pope, Pole-weary Italian journalists heralded the impending exodus of Poles from Rome and the Vatican Curia (bureaucracy) (ref a). Their hope was that an Italian would regain the papacy and add to the already imposing number of Italians in the Curia. Many predicted that the papacy would inevitably turn its attention from the homeland of the deceased pontiff. In the end, Joseph Ratzinger of Germany was elected pope, and the Poles, by and large, stayed. And although it was inevitable that the death of John Paul would signal a change in the relationship between Poland and the Holy See, the bond remains strong. The Vatican has continued to play close attention to Poland and Poles continue to wield great influence in Vatican City.-----------------------------------Polish Personnel, Influence Remain-----------------------------------5. (C) Benedict moved his own German secretary, Monsignor Georg Ganswein, into the Apostolic Palace, but he kept on Pope John Paul's Polish aide, Mieczyslaw Mokrzycki (an ethnic Pole from Ukraine) in a very visible position in the papal household. Other prominent Poles at the Vatican, such as Cardinal Zenon Grocholewski (Congregation for Education), Monsignor Antoni Stankiewicz (Roman Rota - the Vatican's high court), Archbishop Edward Nowak (Congregation for the Causes of Saints), Monsignor Krzysztof Nitkiewicz (Congregation for Oriental Churches), Archbishop Stanislaw Rylko (Council for Laity), and others are continuing in high-profile positions. [Note: Rylko was passed over for an expected elevation to the College of Cardinals at the most recent consistory, but still heads an important Vatican department.]6. (C) Benedict also named London-born Polish priest Wojciech Giertych as theologian of the Papal Household, another prestigious position. Giertych is the son of well-known PolishVATICAN 00000083 002.2 OF 004nationalist Jedrzej Giertych (1903-92), and brother of Maciej Giertych of the League of Polish Families party in Poland. Maciej's son, Roman, is the newly-named Education Minister (as reported by Embassy Warsaw) and a member of the Catholic organization, Opus Dei . Though Fr. Giertych was selected for his erudition and preaching rather than his nationality (we also doubt his family connections played a role in the appointment), his presence presents another opportunity for Polish visibility and influence. A host of lower-level Polish functionaries continue as well, doing a lot of the heavy lifting in and around the Vatican. The only major name to leave Rome in the wake of the death of John Paul was Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, John Paul's longtime secretary, whom Benedict sent to follow in his mentor's footsteps as Cardinal Archbishop of Krakow.7. (C) \"Even after the death of the Holy Father, we have a strong presence here,\" Grzegorz Kaszak, rector of the Polish College (residential seminary) in Rome and a former Vatican bureaucrat, told us. Kaszak pointed out that Poles had been making inroads at the Vatican for over twenty years. Their influence was unlikely to diminish overnight. Even when Benedict XVI makes the major changes in the Curia that Vatican-watchers have been predicting for some time, most Poles here do not predict that Polish influence in the Vatican will drop precipitously. \"We are now part of the culture here,\" and a crucial element of the Church in Europe and in the world, Kaszak insisted.------------------------------------------Vatican Publicizes Stats on Polish Church------------------------------------------8. (C) The statistics bear Kaszak out. We defer to Embassy Warsaw on the strength of the Polish Catholic Church domestically, but the Vatican was touting its numbers in advance of the pope's trip. The Holy See released statistics noting the country's 36.6 million Catholics at some 10,114 parishes and 800 pastoral centers. There are some 28 thousand priests and almost 25 thousand other religious personnel (nuns and other male religious) with 6,400 students studying to become priests. Vatican-based sources have remarked to us that Poland's Catholic muscle is felt far beyond the country's borders. In parishes in Italy, other European countries, the U.S., and elsewhere, it is not uncommon to come upon Polish clergy, either on loan, or having taken up residence in a foreign diocese. What's most important to the Holy See is the \"formation of the youth,\" according to Dariusz Giers, a Polish priest working at the Vatican's Health Ministry. \"The Vatican knows we have excellent programs to educate young people [in religious matters]\" he said, emphasizing the importance of this factor for the continuing strength of the religion. What's more, many at the Vatican consider Polish Catholicism to be dependably orthodox, compared to more liberal strains of the faith found in some parts of Western Europe. \"The Poles are grounded in the faith,\" one contact opined. \"You wouldn't have to worry about the Da Vinci Code confusing people in Poland.\"---------------------Ubiquitous Presence---------------------9. (C) As if to emphasize the ubiquitous presence of Poles in and around the Vatican, Kaszak exchanged several greetings in Polish with passing nuns as he spoke to us not far from St. Peter's Square. In fact, whether one's in the Vatican grocery store or post office, St. Peter's Basilica, or walking any of the streets around Vatican City, it's hard to go twenty minutes without hearing some Polish. And this is not just from the Vatican functionaries from Poland and the many Polish nuns who staff several Vatican offices and residences. The flow of Polish pilgrims to Rome has waned little even a year after the death of Pope John Paul. Of course, massive crowds of Poles came to Rome to observe the first anniversary of the pope's death on April 2. A mass said by Pope Benedict and other events packed an overflowing St. Peter's Square. But it seemed to onlookers that the Polish influx was just as great - or greater - for the Easter celebrations not long afterwards. As is typical for the outdoor audiences and public masses, banners from Polish parishes and towns highlighted Polish participation. \"I think there were even more Poles here for Easter,\" Vatican bureaucrat Giers told us. \"This has been nearly constant since the death of the Holy Father. I don't see signs of it slowing down.\"----------------------------Pope Reaches Out to Poles----------------------------10. (C) The Holy See clearly recognizes who its audience is. At his weekly public gathering (a mixture of prayer and pep rally), Pope Benedict speaks every week to the crowd in Polish,VATICAN 00000083 003.6 OF 004in addition to Italian, French, English, Spanish, and German. Polish is typically one of the languages used for prayers at Vatican masses. The pope often makes special emphasis on the Polish contingent at the audiences and other events, as on May 3, when he noted the anniversary of the 1791 ratification of the Polish Constitution and heralded the anniversary a noteworthy event in Polish Catholic history. Benedict XVI has also devoted some of his rare private audiences to Polish or Polish-affiliated groups such an April visit with representatives of the Krakow-based publishing house, Znak, publisher of Pope John Paul's last book and other Church-related works. That Pope Benedict, who travels much less than his predecessor, chose Poland as his second trip abroad (his first was a visit to World Youth Day in Germany that had been scheduled before his election) is perhaps the strongest sign of this recognition (septel).---------------------------------------A Counter-Weight to Secular Europe?---------------------------------------11. (C) The Holy See's attention to Poland is not simply customer service or \"taking care of the troops\". As was clear under Pope John Paul II, the Vatican has high hopes that Poland will serve as a counter-weight to Western European secularism as the nation makes itself more at home in an integrated Europe. Pope Benedict's preoccupation with what he sees as Europe's increasing psychological distance from its Christian roots is clear (ref a). He has continued to focus on Poland's potential in combating this trend. This was one of the themes of the visit of several groups of Polish bishops to the Vatican at the end of last year. \"It's a topic that always comes up,\" explained Monsignor Michael Banach, the Holy See MFA's country director for Poland. He told us that the two sides recognized that the Polish bishops needed to exert leadership in the face of Western European secularism. Certainly the Holy See hopes that Poland will hold the line at the EU on \"life and family\" issues that arise. But the necessity of maintaining and fortifying the faith internally in Polish society is perhaps an equally important - if not unrelated - focus. Several sources have told us that both sides are keenly aware of the danger that European secularism will dilute Polish faith and identity.-------------Trojan Horse-------------12. (C) Looking at Poland's position in Europe and the EU, several Polish interlocutors told us that Western European suspicion of Poland as a \"Trojan horse\" for the U.S. in the EU was not just a phenomenon among the laity - it had also infected the Vatican. \"We definitely get that feeling\" from a few of the French, German and other Western European prelates at the Vatican, said Giers. The war in Iraq, unpopular among many Vatican officials, has certainly played a role here. Traditional Polish affection for the U.S., on the other hand, seems as strong as ever among the Polish clergy stationed or studying in Rome. In conversations at a dinner not long ago at the Polish College, several seminarians and priests made a point of praising the U.S. and lauding USG foreign policy.----------------Radio Maryja----------------13. (C) Although the Vatican is on guard against encroaching secularism, it shares with many Polish bishops a wariness of Radio Maryja, the Catholic radio station accused of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Banach and Piotr Samerek, DCM at the Polish Embassy to the Holy See, told us that during their ad limina visits, several of the bishops appealed to Vatican Foreign Minister Giovanni Lajolo and others to clamp down on excesses of Radio Maryja and its sister media outlets. The complaints included Radio Maryja's meddling in Polish politics. According to Banach, Lajolo was sympathetic, and expressed his reservations about the network. But Lajolo took a typical Vatican line in judging the matter to be an Polish internal affair. Banach told us that Lajolo told more than one group of bishops that they had to deal with Radio Maryja themselves as part of their \"pastoral responsibilities\". Though media attributed some comments critical of Radio Maryja to Pope Benedict, the Holy See clearly did not want to get involved.14. (C) When Papal Nuncio Jozef Kowalczyk made an April statement chastising Radio Maryja, many assumed that the Vatican had finally decided to clamp down on the network. Our contacts tell us that wasn't the case, saying that while the Holy See agreed with the spirit of Kowalczyk's intervention, the nuncio had spoken out on his own. Some following the issue at the Vatican have told us that Kowalczyk went too far, given the Vatican's view of the matter as an internal Polish question. InVATICAN 00000083 004.4 OF 004any case, as Banach told us, things seem to be improving, as the proposed programming board set up to monitor the content of the station's broadcasts looks like a step in the right direction.----------------Other Influences----------------15. (C) As the Holy See examines the many aspects of its relationship with Poland, it seeks to maintain its focus on the pastoral rather than political. But religious subjects routinely morph into political ones. Banach wouldn't bite when asked for his view of the entry of radical elements such as Andrzej Lepper or ultra-Catholics like Roman Giertych into Poland's governing coalition and ministerial ranks (ref c). He did say that the Vatican understood the dangers that right-wing nationalists posed to Poland's future, and allowed that some saw a danger of Catholic fringe groups discrediting the mainstream Church. As far as the reputation for anti-Semitism that stuck to some nationalists, Banach commented that \"no one\" wanted to see the progress that had been made on such issues lost.----------Comment----------16. (C) It is only a little more than a year after the death of Pope John Paul II, and it is inevitable that with the passage of time Poland will eventually become less central to the world of the Vatican. John-Paul era Vatican bureaucrats will eventually move on. Poland may become more secular. The memory of the Polish pope will certainly recede further into the past. The growth of the Catholic Church in certain parts of the developing world could also play a role here, pushing the Poles, Italians and others to less prominent roles with the Holy See and capturing even more attention in Curial offices. For the near future, however, Poland is assured an important place at the Vatican table.ROONEY", "tags": ["The US embassy cables", "Catholicism", "Pope Benedict XVI", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Poland", "European Union", "Vatican", "Europe", "The papacy"], "title": "US embassy cables: Vatican hoped that Poland would 'hold the family line' in the EU"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:13Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Thursday, 07 May 2009, 05:17C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 WARSAW 000467 SIPDIS EUR, PM, H EO 12958 DECL: 04/20/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, MARR, OREP, RS, PL SUBJECT: POLAND - CODEL LEVIN DISCUSSES MISSILE DEFENSE, PATRIOTSREF: WARSAW 375Classified By: Ambassador Ashe for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1. (C) SUMMARY: In meetings with CODEL Levin, the Polish Prime Minister's chief of staff, the President's deputy national security advisor, and the speaker of the Polish parliament expressed unanimous support for a large U.S. military footprint in Poland to bolster Article 5 guarantees. PM chief of staff Slawomir Nowak told CODEL that, regardless of the U.S. decision on Missile Defense, Poland expects the U.S. to \"honor its commitments\" to bring a Patriot battery to Poland. All three Polish officials requested that the U.S. keep Poland updated on the status of dialogue with Russia, suggesting that Russia, not Iran, poses the greater threat to Poland. CODEL's meeting with FM Sikorski is reported septel. END SUMMARY.2. (C) Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), visited Warsaw April 15-16 to discuss Missile Defense and Polish interest in a U.S. Patriot battery rotation with Polish officials, including Prime Minister Tusk's chief of staff Slawomir Nowak, Deputy Chief of President Kaczynski's National Security Bureau Witold Waszczykowski, and Parliamentary Speaker Bronislaw Komorowski (Civic Platform, PO). The Senators' meetings with Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski are reported septel.U.S. \"ROCK SOLID\" ON ARTICLE FIVE3. (C) Senator Levin began all three meetings by conveying the President's message that the U.S. commitment to the NATO Article 5 guarantee is \"rock solid.\" While U.S. support for Poland may differ in form under the Obama administration, U.S. support for Poland will be strong. When asked whether Warsaw felt assured that NATO would honor its Article 5 commitments to Poland, Waszczykowski said \"we still have our doubts,\" adding that some European members -- particularly France -- prefer talk to action, he wryly added \"that's why we bought F-16s and not French Mirages, and why we went through with the Missile Defense deal.\"PATRIOTS AND AMERICAN BOOTS4. (C) Senator Levin warned all three interlocutors that if the Czechs reject the proposed MD radar site, the Polish component of MD would be put in jeopardy under current U.S. legislation. Nowak expressed confidence that the Czechs would ratify the agreement with the U.S., suggesting they are simply waiting for a U.S. decision on MD. Speaker Komorowski acknowledged the provisions of U.S. law, but stated Poland does not want to be responsible for Czech problems. Senator Collins acknowledged the political cost to Poland of supporting MD, and asked for Komorowski,s views on how to maintain support for the United States if it pursues a different course.5. (C) Asked whether Poland would be reassured by the presence of Patriot batteries in lieu of MD, Nowak told CODEL Levin that, regardless of MD's fate, the GOP expects the USG to \"honor its commitments\" on Patriots. Poland intends to build a comprehensive air-defense system and has identified Patriots as \"the most important element\" of its defense modernization efforts. Nowak said Poland \"will not suffer\" if the U.S. withdraws from MD, but repeatedly asserted that the GOP is \"counting on Patriots.\" (NB: At one point, Nowak even intervened when his interpreter mistakenly said the Poles \"would like Patriots.\" \"No, we are counting on them,\" Nowak emphasized in English.)6. (C) Waszczykowski was less adamant about Patriots, stating that Poland and the U.S. had a binding political agreement on security matters, which he hoped the United States would respect. He added that Poland \"wants U.S. boots on the ground\" -- not necessarily as a tripwire, but as a deterrent. Nowak similarly stressed Poland's strong interest in \"deepening\" military cooperation, ideally to include a large U.S. footprint in Poland. He mused that one Patriot battery and ten MD interceptors do not constitute the \"impressive presence\" that Poland is hoping for.7. (C) Speaker Komorowski and Nowak both pointed out that, by agreeing to host the MD site, Poland had paid a \"high price\" -- especially in its relations with other EU members and with Russia. Komorowski expressed concern that Poland had again become a Russian target after a dozen years of improving relations -- senior Russian officials have threatened to target Poland with nuclear missiles, are stirring upWARSAW 00000467 002 OF 002anti-Polish sentiment among Russians, and are acting against Poland's interests in Ukraine.8. (C) Komorowski argued that the U.S. needs to fulfill its symbolic agreement to show involvement in defense of Polish territory. If the new administration is changing U.S. political priorities, it also needs to engage in dialogue with Poland, not just Russia. Most important for Poland is U.S. involvement in Polish security, through physical presence of American forces in Poland, NATO facilities in Poland, fulfilling the commitment to provide Patriot missiles, and greater U.S.-Polish cooperation.DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA9. (C) Komorowski, Nowak, and Waszczykowski stressed the importance of keeping Poland updated on the status of U.S.-Russia talks. Nowak stressed the GOP's strong interest in a positive outcome, but reminded the CODEL that U.S. negotiators had promised the USG would overcome Russian objections to MD. \"The MD site is an American base. The burden of achieving Russian agreement is on the U.S. side,\" he said. Even so, Nowak said, Poland had agreed to accept confidence-building measures with the Russians and was also working to convince Moscow that MD is not a threat to Russia's nuclear arsenal. Regardless, Russia will find it difficult to accept any \"tangible manifestation\" of a NATO presence in Poland or the Czech Republic.10. (C) Nowak said Poland had not discussed Patriots with the Russians. Russia should not have a say in Poland's defense modernization planning. Noting that Poland's armed forces are \"defensive in nature,\" Nowak reiterated that Poland's primary goal is to increase interoperability with allies.11. (C) Presidential Advisor Waszczykowski reacted more emotionally. While Washington is entitled to talk to Russia, to work toward a solution to the Iranian threat, and to make its own decision about the MD initiative, the U.S. should take care not to undermine Poland's security. He then wondered aloud, \"How long will it take you to realize that nothing will change with Iran and Russia?\" Waszczykowski asserted that Moscow is trying to regain its sphere of influence and stressed the critical importance of an increased U.S. or NATO presence for Poland's security. He added that Russia continues to deny its historical wrong-doings against Poland, imposes economic sanctions against Poland at will, and frequently disrupts the flow of oil and gas.THREAT FROM IRAN?12. (C) In all three meetings, Senator Nelson expressed doubt that Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons or missile programs, but noted that the Iranian threat to Europe could be met for the foreseeable future with the AEGIS and THAAD systems. Waszczykowski, who served as Poland's Ambassador to Tehran (1999-2002), agreed that Iran poses an increasing threat to the United States and Europe. He said that the Iranian regime has no incentive to warm relations with Washington because the regime has built its own legitimacy on the cornerstone of anti-Americanism.13. (C) Nowak and Komorowski told the CODEL that Poland does not perceive a direct threat from Iran. Nowak stated that, as an active and loyal ally, Poland had agreed to host the MD site because of the threat Iran poses to the U.S. and others in NATO. He noted that Poland's desire to be a strong ally was also the basis for its activity in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nowak said Poland perceives a greater threat from non-state actors, but conceded that Iran's support for terrorist organizations was troubling. He added that Poland's decision to host MD had moved it \"closer to the top of Iran's list,\" and, as a result, made Patriots more important to Poland's security.14.

Ashe for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)1. (S) SUMMARY. GOP officials are not privy to the full range of U.S. planning and thinking with regard to the prospective Patriot battery rotation here, but they do have expectations -- some naive, some tactical -- that they are making increasingly clear. For example, when told last autumn that the Patriots would not be integrated -- at least initially -- into the Polish air defense system, Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski angrily responded that Poland expected to have operational missiles, not \"potted plants.\" Merited or no, our Polish interlocutors believe: 1) (assuming successful SoFA talks) Patriots will start rotating to Poland this year regardless of the outcome of Washington's review of the Missile Defense program; 2) the battery will have some undefined \"operational capability;\" 3) the garrison remaining in Poland after 2012 will have the same size and composition as the uniformed elements that will staff the rotations; and 4) access to Patriot equipment for training will not be substantially impeded by provisions of the Export Control Act. To help us manage these issues, this cable lays out what we understand about Polish expectations and the backstory of how they got there. END SUMMARY.PATRIOTS AND MD - CONNECTED OR NO?2. (S) The proposed Patriot rotation was a condition of Polish agreement to sign the Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement (BMDA), and the U.S. would likely not have offered it outside of that context. A (very) simplified recounting of the story of how we got here seems in order.3. (S) The question of Patriots in Poland hung (largely silently) over the BMDA negotiations for much of last spring. The final breakthrough in the BMDA negotiations in fact came with a July 7 Polish non-paper, which indicated a GOP willingness to contribute to the deployment of a Patriot battery in Poland. The U.S. non-paper response of 10 August said that \"in the context of a broader and deeper bilateral security relationship, including the deployment of missile defense interceptors in Poland, the United States is prepared to deploy a U.S. Army Patriot battery in Poland (emphasis added).\" The Patriot deployment plans were made public in the Declaration of Strategic Cooperation, signed at the time of the BMDA, where we agreed to intensify our security and defense cooperation, including through \"the deployment of a U.S. Army Patriot air and missile defense system in Poland\" starting in 2009.4. (S) Since then both sides have used this connection to urge greater negotiating energy on the part of the other: the U.S. saying clearly that it will not move forward on Patriots without ratification of the BMDA and SOFA (a condition outlined in the 10 August non-paper), and the Poles moving cautiously at times on SOFA talks out of concern that the U.S. is not on schedule for a 2009 commencement of the Patriot rotation. Correctly or not, the Poles believe that ratification of SoFA and the BMDA gets them Patriots in 2009, independent of a USG decision on BMD, and that the Strategic Declaration signed at the time of the BMDA stands on its own. They have even turned our language on us in making the point, asking that the U.S. not be so \"transactional\" in tying its obligations to Poland's defense to new thinking about interceptors.WHEN IS A PATRIOT A PATRIOT?5. (S) The Declaration of Strategic Cooperation outlines some parameters for the proposed Patriot \"deployment,\" allowing that a Patriot battery rotation \"will include joint training opportunities that will enhance Polish air defense capabilities.\" The Poles interpret \"will include\" to mean \"not limited to\" and they expect that Polish air defenses will be enhanced in some operational capacity by the Patriot rotation. Repeated U.S. statements since August 2008 that the battery will not be operational are interpreted by the Poles to be part of a larger discussion of C4ISR and the inter-operability of Patriot in their overall air defense architecture. After months of back and forth, we think the Poles now understand that the rotation battery will not be fully operational and cannot be integrated immediately into the Polish system and that the battery will focus on training and exercises.6. (S) However, this is a good juncture to point out the most glaring gap in understanding between us and the Poles. The Poles have not been told that the battery will rotate without actual missiles -- i.e., not only will the rotation not be operational in the initial phase (due to C4ISR and other issues) but it will also not be operational, and certainly interoperable, at any point in our current plans. This will be a question of basic definitions for the Poles: is it a Patriot battery if it doesn't have live missiles? The Poles think the Patriots will become not only operable, but interoperable, over time - thus enhancing Poland's air defense. When told last Fall that the Patriots would not be operational, at least at first, Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski angrily responded that Poland expected to receive operational Patriot missiles, \"not potted plants.\"WHAT IS A GARRISON? WHAT IS JOINT TRAINING?7. (S) The GOP also has a different concept of the footprint involved when the U.S. agreed (also in the Declaration) to establish a \"garrison to support the U.S. Army Patriot battery\" by 2012. The Poles believe the permanent battery arrangement will have around 110 personnel -- about the same number required to staff planned temporary rotations between 2009 and 2012 -- which is to say that the Poles expect the \"garrison\" to convert the rotation itself into a permanent presence. Current U.S. planning appears to call for only 20-30 permanent personnel to maintain forward deployed equipment. In addition, the Poles understand that technology transfer regulations would normally restrict their access to Patriot equipment for purposes of training and exercises, but have interpreted the clause in the Declaration allowing for \"joint training opportunities\" to mean that they will have greater access to technology than is generally granted by the Export Control Act.COMMENT8. (S) We need to navigate the way forward carefully. We may be able to close some of the gaps between our plans and the Poles expectations with time and focus and patience on both sides. However, the \"potted plant\" problem, is much more tricky. Prime Minister Tusk, neither a fan of MD nor as wed to the U.S.-Polish strategic relationship as his predecessors, sold the BMDA to the Polish public as enhancing Polish security because of the Patriot agreement. Assuming the European missile site plans don't completely wither on the vine, the Poles will expect the Patriot rotation to not only go forward, but to have some operational, if not eventual interoperational capability. As we move forward, we will want to be careful not to stumble into this chasm. We need a strategy for how we will consult with the Poles to close the gap before it undoes much good work to date.

For two years, the Polish prime minister, foreign and defence ministers had sold the Patriots to the public as a great boost to national air defences (against Russia).So when the Americans told them in late 2008 that the missiles would not be live, at least initially, the furious Poles complained they had expected an operational weapon, not \"potted plants\", the cables report.Even then the Poles did not know the full truth.

(S) SUMMARY: Deputy DefMin Stanislaw Komorowski and MFA Security Policy Director Adam Kobieracki reacted similarly when DCM raised reftel points -- Poland strongly agrees with the necessity of contingency planning for the Baltic States but would like to avoid delays in the completion of the EAGLE GUARDIAN plan for Poland. However, both Komorowski and Kobieracki suggested that Poland might be able to accept a \"creatively packaged\" plan that included separate but complementary components (\"chapters\") for Poland and the Baltic States. They agreed that discussions should not be made public. END SUMMARY.2. (S) In a meeting with DCM on December 17, Komorowski expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation with other NATO contingency planners on EAGLE GUARDIAN. Poles were active participants in the process and looked forward to its completion by the end of February or early March. Komorowski was skeptical that a regional approach to contingency planning was the best way ahead. Komorowski said Warsaw would prefer a unique plan for Poland, although he allowed that Warsaw could accept the notion of two complementary chapters for Poland and the Baltic States within EAGLE GUARDIAN. More important for Poland was the need to avoid any delay in completing the plan or to rehash already-agreed components, such as the threat assessment. He added that he \"agreed entirely\" that the issue should remain as secret as possible, and that it was in the \"common interest\" to avoid public discussion of NATO contingency planning.3. (S) Kobieracki made similar points to DCM on December 15, and suggested the USG engage in detailed consultations with Polish officials in Brussels and with the General Staff in Warsaw. He said Poland had hoped that a revised EAGLE GUARDIAN plan could be used as a starting point for developing contingency plans for the Baltic States rather than become intertwined with them. He hinted that a creatively packaged regional plan that met Polish needs in terms of conditionality and automaticity might be acceptable, but cautioned that Warsaw would need assurances that NATO's defense of Poland was an \"issue in its own right\" and not dependent on the security or defense of other NATO members. Kobieracki insisted that Poland would also need assurances that regional planning would not negatively impact on NATO's response to prospective crises, particularly with respect to pre-planned deployments. He urged that completion of EAGLE GUARDIAN not be delayed to accommodate incorporation of the Baltic States into a regional contingency plan.

Barack Obama abandoned the scheme in September last year, under his policy of \"resetting\" relations with Russia.The Pentagon and Nato are developing a more modest and mobile phased missile shield, inviting the Russians to take part. At a Nato summit in Lisbon last month, the allied leaders agreed for the first time to press ahead with the project and President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia was cautiously positive on the prospects for Moscow's co-operation.In November last year, Alexander Vershbow, the assistant defence secretary for international security, offered the Poles a role in the new project by hosting a land-based \"standard missile-3\" system, as seen in the leaked US embassy cables.The Poles, who have repeatedly told the Americans that they feel unthreatened by Iran but are regularly alarmed about Russia, asked \"a series of hypothetical questions on the adaptive nature of the system vis-a-vis the changing threat\".\"With regard to how Nato might defend itself from missiles coming from elsewhere than Iran or Syria, BG John Hesterman of the joint staff said that sea-borne platforms could provide surge capability against threats from an unforeseen direction, land-based sites could be upgraded with more interceptors if the scale of the threat were increased, and radars could be reoriented,\" the US embassy in Warsaw reports following the meetings.A series of cables going back over the past two years highlights the Polish eagerness to try to draw the US military, Nato assets, and possibly military bases into Poland, and a clear US ambivalence and wariness, sparking furious rows and mutual exasperation.\"How long will it take you to realise that nothing will change with Iran and Russia?\" a Polish presidential aide asks a trio of visiting US senators in May last year.\"The Polish prime minister's chief of staff, the president's deputy national security advisor, and the speaker of the Polish parliament expressed unanimous support for a large US military footprint in Poland \u2026 Most important for Poland is US involvement in Polish security, through physical presence of American forces in Poland, Nato facilities in Poland, fulfilling the commitment to provide Patriot missiles,\" the embassy reports. Six months later, Vershbow offered an alternative to the promised Patriots \"which the US believed may be more useful to Poland\".\"The three options presented were: 1) a quarterly rotation of F-16s, and the establishment of a small permanent support detachment, which would focus on enhancing Polish fighter capabilities, increasing sortie readiness and meeting Nato commitments; 2) quarterly C-130 rotations from Ramstein [airbase in Germany], also with a small permanent support detachment in Poland with the goal of increasing Polish readiness and ability to support own and Nato operations; 3) the relocation of a US naval special warfare unit from Stuttgart to Gdansk or Gdynia [on the Baltic coast].\"The Poles were enthusiastic, seeking to maximise the US offers. In February this year, the defence minister, Bogdan Klich, told the US ambassador, Lee Feinstein, in Warsaw that Poland was interested in all the options, particularly the F-16 fighter aircraft. Under government cost-cutting, Poland was closing down 20% of military facilities \"but would be saving three complexes for US forces,\" Klich said.Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also told Ellen Tauscher, the US under-secretary of state for arms control, that Warsaw was interested in the F-16s.", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US news", "The US embassy cables", "Russia", "Nato", "Europe"], "title": "WikiLeaks cables: Poland wants missile shield to protect against Russia"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:14Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Monday, 22 February 2010, 16:12C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 WARSAW 000110 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/CE (GLANTZ, KARAGIANNIS) OSD FOR MITCHELL, AMBASSADOR VERSHBOW, ADMIRAL MULLEN EUCOM FOR ADMIRAL STAVRIDIS USAREUR FOR GENERAL HAM EO 12958 DECL: 02/22/2020 TAGS PREL, MARR, MOPS, PGOV, PL SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS DEFENSE MINISTER KLICH Classified By: Classified BY Political Counselor Dan Sainz, reason 1.4 (b, d)1. (C) SUMMARY: Defense Minister Bogdan Klich told the Ambassador on February 18 that Poland is eager to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, which he described as based on a solid political foundation. He emphasized the importance to Poland of an April arrival of the first Patriot battery rotation. Klich did not repeat recent Polish government points about the configuration of future rotations of the Patriot battery. End Summary.2. (C) During a February 18 meeting with the Ambassador, Polish Defense Minister Bogdan Klich said there is a good political framework for continued U.S.-Polish defense cooperation, and noted Under Secretary Tauscher's February 8 visit had been a very successful one. Klich said he does not expect anything will happen to undermine that solid foundation. He added that the bilateral supplemental SoFA, signed December 11, provides a strong legal framework for defense ties. The SoFA ratification vote in the Sejm (the lower house of Parliament) was overwhelmingly in favor, and Senate approval would also come quickly. (Note: The Senate voted 88-1 in favor of SOFA ratification later on February 18.) Klich said President Kaczynski would sign the SoFA ratification bill quickly.HOPING FOR PATRIOTS IN APRIL----------------------------3. (C) Klich said Poland has a strong desire to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, and he highlighted the political importance of an early first rotation in Poland of the U.S. Patriot battery. He said Poland hopes the first rotation will occur in April. The Ambassador said the United States wants the rotation to be viewed as a bilateral success. In answer to Klich's questions about timing, the Ambassader said the United States has said the first rotation would take place within 90 days of SOFA ratification. He said a more precise time frame will be determined at the last bilateral planning meeting for the Patriot rotation, which will take place in the first week in March.MILITARY FACILITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE U.S. PRESENCES--------------------------------------------- -----4. (C) Klich called for talks on other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. He said he had authorized Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski and ChoD Franciszek Gagor to take part in such talks. Klich highlighted Polish interest in all of the options presented by DOD A/S Vershbow at the October High Level Defense Group discussions: F-16s, C-130's, as well as \"stable, not temporary\" special operations forces. When asked, Klich confirmed that the GoP is particularly interested in U.S. F-16 rotations. Speaking personally, he said he also had a strong interest in a special operations force presence, since he had signed a bilateral special operations cooperation agreement with Secretary Gates a year ago. ChoD Gagor added that the biggest multilateral exercise Poland is hosting this year, \"Jackal Stone 10,\" will feature special operations forces. Klich added that as part of the first in-depth infrastructure review in postwar Poland, the Defense Ministry had decided to close 20% of defense facilities, but would be &saving8 three complexes for U.S. forces.GETTING THE WORD OUT ON DEFENSE COOPERATION-------------------------------------------5. (C) The Ambassador noted that the bilateral agenda for defense cooperation is a full one, and both governments should work together to inform public opinion about the many useful exchanges under way. Klich strongly agreed that Defense Ministry and Embassy staff should follow up in this area. Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski added that if A/S Vershbow visits Warsaw in the coming months, it might be a good occasion to do some joint public diplomacy work about planning for other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. (Note: Amb. Vershbow's planned mid-March trip has been postponed.)6. (C) COMMENT: Klich's emphasis on a hoped-for April arrivalWARSAW 00000110 002 OF 002of the first Patriot battery is consistent with other government statements and press leaks that signal a decision to focus on the timing of the first deployment, as opposed to other aspects of it. In that regard, Klich did not repeat government appeals that Patriot rotations be integrated into the Polish air defense system and include \"live\" missiles, as he did in a meeting the previous week with Under Secretary Tauscher. The emphasis on the timing of the first deployment corresponds with developments in the presidential race, and Foreign Minister Sikorsky,s active candidacy for the Civic Platform nomination.

They claim the treasured panel depicting Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of Ludovico Sforza, ruler of Milan and patron of Leonardo, is too delicate to travel. It is one of barely 20 paintings attributed to the artist.The Krakow division of the Association of Art Historians has sent an impassioned letter to ArtWatch UK, the restoration watchdog, to draw the world's attention to their \"anxiety\".In a letter to be published tomorrow, its president, Joanna Daranowska-Lukaszewska, writes: \"The sending of the Krakow picture abroad is insured for \u20ac300m [\u00a3250m], but in the event of a disaster no one would be able to restore this priceless masterpiece to life. We appeal to [ArtWatch] to draw the attention of world public opinion to the great dangers now faced by \u2026 common property of the whole cultural world.\"It is not just in Poland that fears are growing over the National Gallery's plans for its exhibition, \"Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan\". Concern is being voiced that other Leonardo paintings \u2013 La Belle Ferroni\u00e8re, from the Louvre; the Madonna Litta, from the Hermitage in St Petersburg; and Saint Jerome, from the Pinacoteca Vaticana in Rome \u2013 also face perilous journeys.But in Krakow \u2013 where Lady with an Ermine sits in the Czartoryski Museum \u2013 those concerns have reached an acute level. \"If you transport a picture panel such as the Lady with an Ermine \u2026 even the most ideal methods in the form of modern environmental chambers or special anti-shock frames are not able to sufficiently protect the work against a variety of vibrations, shocks or changes in pressure,\" said Professor Grazyna Korpal, dean of conservation.\"By allowing the painting to travel we create yet another serious threat [from] \u2026 possible human error. Such masterpieces require exceptional protection. The fundamental principle is the unconditional restriction of movement.\"A source at the National Museum revealed that a letter from Poland's deputy cultural and national heritage minister permitted the picture to be transported to London.Michael Daley of ArtWatch UK said it was hard to justify allowing such great masterpieces to be moved: \"With paintings on panel, any movement is dangerous and bound to have a deleterious effect. Why take the chance? There is nothing to contradict the warnings of the Polish restorers. Moving the Lady with an Ermine is absolutely crazy.\"He added that the danger of theft is heightened during any move. Last week a Picasso was among some 30 artworks valued at \u00a34.1m stolen in transit between galleries in Germany and Spain.Even moving works from room to room within a gallery presented dangers, Daley said. Two years ago, a Renaissance painting by Domenico Beccafumi was dropped while being taken off a wall at the National Gallery. Previously unpublished photographs of the damage will be published on ArtWatch's website tomorrow, along with the appeal from Poland and accounts of other accidents.Adam Zamoyski, UK historian and chairman of the Czartoryski Foundation, confirmed that Lady with an Ermine had an export licence.

Most high-ranking and mid-level Poles have stayed on in their positions in the Vatican bureaucracy since the death of John Paul, maintaining the Vatican's Polish flavor. Pope Benedict has consistently made gestures to acknowledge the importance of the Polish Catholic Church in the context of European and world Catholicism - an importance embodied most immediately by the crowds of Polish pilgrims that still flock to Rome. Pope Benedict and other Vatican officials maintain Pope John Paul's hope that Poland will serve as a counter-weight to Western European secularism, but are wary of nationalistic or divisive forces with a Catholic label, such as media outlets under the control of Polish station Radio Maryja. With Pope Benedict XVI's May 25-28 visit to Poland looming, many in and around the Vatican are addressing these subjects. End Summary.------------------------Poland: Still a Presence------------------------3. (C) The papacy of John Paul II is slowly fading into history, but Poland remains an important part of the conversation at the Vatican. Recent months have offered much evidence of this, and numerous opportunities to assess Holy See - Poland relations. Late last year, several groups of Polish bishops came to Rome for their quinquennial \"ad limina\" visit to the pope and Vatican officials. In December, then-President Aleksander Kwasniewski made his swan song visit to the Vatican and met with Benedict XVI. In January, his successor, President Lech Kaczynski, made his first trip abroad as president and met Pope Benedict XVI. The first anniversary of the death of the Polish pope in April saw waves of Polish pilgrims visiting Rome, but the sound of Polish on the streets of Rome hardly abated for the Easter celebrations two weeks later. Add periodic events commemorating various dates in the life of John Paul II or initiatives that he began, and there remains an inevitable Polish flavor to life at the Vatican.4. (C) In the aftermath of the death of the Polish pope, Pole-weary Italian journalists heralded the impending exodus of Poles from Rome and the Vatican Curia (bureaucracy) (ref a). Their hope was that an Italian would regain the papacy and add to the already imposing number of Italians in the Curia. Many predicted that the papacy would inevitably turn its attention from the homeland of the deceased pontiff. In the end, Joseph Ratzinger of Germany was elected pope, and the Poles, by and large, stayed. And although it was inevitable that the death of John Paul would signal a change in the relationship between Poland and the Holy See, the bond remains strong. The Vatican has continued to play close attention to Poland and Poles continue to wield great influence in Vatican City.-----------------------------------Polish Personnel, Influence Remain-----------------------------------5. (C) Benedict moved his own German secretary, Monsignor Georg Ganswein, into the Apostolic Palace, but he kept on Pope John Paul's Polish aide, Mieczyslaw Mokrzycki (an ethnic Pole from Ukraine) in a very visible position in the papal household. Other prominent Poles at the Vatican, such as Cardinal Zenon Grocholewski (Congregation for Education), Monsignor Antoni Stankiewicz (Roman Rota - the Vatican's high court), Archbishop Edward Nowak (Congregation for the Causes of Saints), Monsignor Krzysztof Nitkiewicz (Congregation for Oriental Churches), Archbishop Stanislaw Rylko (Council for Laity), and others are continuing in high-profile positions. [Note: Rylko was passed over for an expected elevation to the College of Cardinals at the most recent consistory, but still heads an important Vatican department.]6. (C) Benedict also named London-born Polish priest Wojciech Giertych as theologian of the Papal Household, another prestigious position. Giertych is the son of well-known PolishVATICAN 00000083 002.2 OF 004nationalist Jedrzej Giertych (1903-92), and brother of Maciej Giertych of the League of Polish Families party in Poland. Maciej's son, Roman, is the newly-named Education Minister (as reported by Embassy Warsaw) and a member of the Catholic organization, Opus Dei . Though Fr. Giertych was selected for his erudition and preaching rather than his nationality (we also doubt his family connections played a role in the appointment), his presence presents another opportunity for Polish visibility and influence. A host of lower-level Polish functionaries continue as well, doing a lot of the heavy lifting in and around the Vatican. The only major name to leave Rome in the wake of the death of John Paul was Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, John Paul's longtime secretary, whom Benedict sent to follow in his mentor's footsteps as Cardinal Archbishop of Krakow.7. (C) \"Even after the death of the Holy Father, we have a strong presence here,\" Grzegorz Kaszak, rector of the Polish College (residential seminary) in Rome and a former Vatican bureaucrat, told us. Kaszak pointed out that Poles had been making inroads at the Vatican for over twenty years. Their influence was unlikely to diminish overnight. Even when Benedict XVI makes the major changes in the Curia that Vatican-watchers have been predicting for some time, most Poles here do not predict that Polish influence in the Vatican will drop precipitously. \"We are now part of the culture here,\" and a crucial element of the Church in Europe and in the world, Kaszak insisted.------------------------------------------Vatican Publicizes Stats on Polish Church------------------------------------------8. (C) The statistics bear Kaszak out. We defer to Embassy Warsaw on the strength of the Polish Catholic Church domestically, but the Vatican was touting its numbers in advance of the pope's trip. The Holy See released statistics noting the country's 36.6 million Catholics at some 10,114 parishes and 800 pastoral centers. There are some 28 thousand priests and almost 25 thousand other religious personnel (nuns and other male religious) with 6,400 students studying to become priests. Vatican-based sources have remarked to us that Poland's Catholic muscle is felt far beyond the country's borders. In parishes in Italy, other European countries, the U.S., and elsewhere, it is not uncommon to come upon Polish clergy, either on loan, or having taken up residence in a foreign diocese. What's most important to the Holy See is the \"formation of the youth,\" according to Dariusz Giers, a Polish priest working at the Vatican's Health Ministry. \"The Vatican knows we have excellent programs to educate young people [in religious matters]\" he said, emphasizing the importance of this factor for the continuing strength of the religion. What's more, many at the Vatican consider Polish Catholicism to be dependably orthodox, compared to more liberal strains of the faith found in some parts of Western Europe. \"The Poles are grounded in the faith,\" one contact opined. \"You wouldn't have to worry about the Da Vinci Code confusing people in Poland.\"---------------------Ubiquitous Presence---------------------9. (C) As if to emphasize the ubiquitous presence of Poles in and around the Vatican, Kaszak exchanged several greetings in Polish with passing nuns as he spoke to us not far from St. Peter's Square. In fact, whether one's in the Vatican grocery store or post office, St. Peter's Basilica, or walking any of the streets around Vatican City, it's hard to go twenty minutes without hearing some Polish. And this is not just from the Vatican functionaries from Poland and the many Polish nuns who staff several Vatican offices and residences. The flow of Polish pilgrims to Rome has waned little even a year after the death of Pope John Paul. Of course, massive crowds of Poles came to Rome to observe the first anniversary of the pope's death on April 2. A mass said by Pope Benedict and other events packed an overflowing St. Peter's Square. But it seemed to onlookers that the Polish influx was just as great - or greater - for the Easter celebrations not long afterwards. As is typical for the outdoor audiences and public masses, banners from Polish parishes and towns highlighted Polish participation. \"I think there were even more Poles here for Easter,\" Vatican bureaucrat Giers told us. \"This has been nearly constant since the death of the Holy Father. I don't see signs of it slowing down.\"----------------------------Pope Reaches Out to Poles----------------------------10. (C) The Holy See clearly recognizes who its audience is. At his weekly public gathering (a mixture of prayer and pep rally), Pope Benedict speaks every week to the crowd in Polish,VATICAN 00000083 003.6 OF 004in addition to Italian, French, English, Spanish, and German. Polish is typically one of the languages used for prayers at Vatican masses. The pope often makes special emphasis on the Polish contingent at the audiences and other events, as on May 3, when he noted the anniversary of the 1791 ratification of the Polish Constitution and heralded the anniversary a noteworthy event in Polish Catholic history. Benedict XVI has also devoted some of his rare private audiences to Polish or Polish-affiliated groups such an April visit with representatives of the Krakow-based publishing house, Znak, publisher of Pope John Paul's last book and other Church-related works. That Pope Benedict, who travels much less than his predecessor, chose Poland as his second trip abroad (his first was a visit to World Youth Day in Germany that had been scheduled before his election) is perhaps the strongest sign of this recognition (septel).---------------------------------------A Counter-Weight to Secular Europe?---------------------------------------11. (C) The Holy See's attention to Poland is not simply customer service or \"taking care of the troops\". As was clear under Pope John Paul II, the Vatican has high hopes that Poland will serve as a counter-weight to Western European secularism as the nation makes itself more at home in an integrated Europe. Pope Benedict's preoccupation with what he sees as Europe's increasing psychological distance from its Christian roots is clear (ref a). He has continued to focus on Poland's potential in combating this trend. This was one of the themes of the visit of several groups of Polish bishops to the Vatican at the end of last year. \"It's a topic that always comes up,\" explained Monsignor Michael Banach, the Holy See MFA's country director for Poland. He told us that the two sides recognized that the Polish bishops needed to exert leadership in the face of Western European secularism. Certainly the Holy See hopes that Poland will hold the line at the EU on \"life and family\" issues that arise. But the necessity of maintaining and fortifying the faith internally in Polish society is perhaps an equally important - if not unrelated - focus. Several sources have told us that both sides are keenly aware of the danger that European secularism will dilute Polish faith and identity.-------------Trojan Horse-------------12. (C) Looking at Poland's position in Europe and the EU, several Polish interlocutors told us that Western European suspicion of Poland as a \"Trojan horse\" for the U.S. in the EU was not just a phenomenon among the laity - it had also infected the Vatican. \"We definitely get that feeling\" from a few of the French, German and other Western European prelates at the Vatican, said Giers. The war in Iraq, unpopular among many Vatican officials, has certainly played a role here. Traditional Polish affection for the U.S., on the other hand, seems as strong as ever among the Polish clergy stationed or studying in Rome. In conversations at a dinner not long ago at the Polish College, several seminarians and priests made a point of praising the U.S. and lauding USG foreign policy.----------------Radio Maryja----------------13. (C) Although the Vatican is on guard against encroaching secularism, it shares with many Polish bishops a wariness of Radio Maryja, the Catholic radio station accused of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Banach and Piotr Samerek, DCM at the Polish Embassy to the Holy See, told us that during their ad limina visits, several of the bishops appealed to Vatican Foreign Minister Giovanni Lajolo and others to clamp down on excesses of Radio Maryja and its sister media outlets. The complaints included Radio Maryja's meddling in Polish politics. According to Banach, Lajolo was sympathetic, and expressed his reservations about the network. But Lajolo took a typical Vatican line in judging the matter to be an Polish internal affair. Banach told us that Lajolo told more than one group of bishops that they had to deal with Radio Maryja themselves as part of their \"pastoral responsibilities\". Though media attributed some comments critical of Radio Maryja to Pope Benedict, the Holy See clearly did not want to get involved.14. (C) When Papal Nuncio Jozef Kowalczyk made an April statement chastising Radio Maryja, many assumed that the Vatican had finally decided to clamp down on the network. Our contacts tell us that wasn't the case, saying that while the Holy See agreed with the spirit of Kowalczyk's intervention, the nuncio had spoken out on his own. Some following the issue at the Vatican have told us that Kowalczyk went too far, given the Vatican's view of the matter as an internal Polish question. InVATICAN 00000083 004.4 OF 004any case, as Banach told us, things seem to be improving, as the proposed programming board set up to monitor the content of the station's broadcasts looks like a step in the right direction.----------------Other Influences----------------15. (C) As the Holy See examines the many aspects of its relationship with Poland, it seeks to maintain its focus on the pastoral rather than political. But religious subjects routinely morph into political ones. Banach wouldn't bite when asked for his view of the entry of radical elements such as Andrzej Lepper or ultra-Catholics like Roman Giertych into Poland's governing coalition and ministerial ranks (ref c). He did say that the Vatican understood the dangers that right-wing nationalists posed to Poland's future, and allowed that some saw a danger of Catholic fringe groups discrediting the mainstream Church. As far as the reputation for anti-Semitism that stuck to some nationalists, Banach commented that \"no one\" wanted to see the progress that had been made on such issues lost.----------Comment----------16. (C) It is only a little more than a year after the death of Pope John Paul II, and it is inevitable that with the passage of time Poland will eventually become less central to the world of the Vatican. John-Paul era Vatican bureaucrats will eventually move on. Poland may become more secular. The memory of the Polish pope will certainly recede further into the past. The growth of the Catholic Church in certain parts of the developing world could also play a role here, pushing the Poles, Italians and others to less prominent roles with the Holy See and capturing even more attention in Curial offices. For the near future, however, Poland is assured an important place at the Vatican table.ROONEY", "tags": ["The US embassy cables", "Catholicism", "Pope Benedict XVI", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Poland", "European Union", "Vatican", "Europe", "The papacy"], "title": "US embassy cables: Vatican hoped that Poland would 'hold the family line' in the EU"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:13Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Thursday, 07 May 2009, 05:17C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 WARSAW 000467 SIPDIS EUR, PM, H EO 12958 DECL: 04/20/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, MARR, OREP, RS, PL SUBJECT: POLAND - CODEL LEVIN DISCUSSES MISSILE DEFENSE, PATRIOTSREF: WARSAW 375Classified By: Ambassador Ashe for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1.

PM chief of staff Slawomir Nowak told CODEL that, regardless of the U.S. decision on Missile Defense, Poland expects the U.S. to \"honor its commitments\" to bring a Patriot battery to Poland. All three Polish officials requested that the U.S. keep Poland updated on the status of dialogue with Russia, suggesting that Russia, not Iran, poses the greater threat to Poland. CODEL's meeting with FM Sikorski is reported septel. END SUMMARY.2. (C) Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), visited Warsaw April 15-16 to discuss Missile Defense and Polish interest in a U.S. Patriot battery rotation with Polish officials, including Prime Minister Tusk's chief of staff Slawomir Nowak, Deputy Chief of President Kaczynski's National Security Bureau Witold Waszczykowski, and Parliamentary Speaker Bronislaw Komorowski (Civic Platform, PO). The Senators' meetings with Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski are reported septel.U.S. \"ROCK SOLID\" ON ARTICLE FIVE3. (C) Senator Levin began all three meetings by conveying the President's message that the U.S. commitment to the NATO Article 5 guarantee is \"rock solid.\" While U.S. support for Poland may differ in form under the Obama administration, U.S. support for Poland will be strong. When asked whether Warsaw felt assured that NATO would honor its Article 5 commitments to Poland, Waszczykowski said \"we still have our doubts,\" adding that some European members -- particularly France -- prefer talk to action, he wryly added \"that's why we bought F-16s and not French Mirages, and why we went through with the Missile Defense deal.\"PATRIOTS AND AMERICAN BOOTS4. (C) Senator Levin warned all three interlocutors that if the Czechs reject the proposed MD radar site, the Polish component of MD would be put in jeopardy under current U.S. legislation. Nowak expressed confidence that the Czechs would ratify the agreement with the U.S., suggesting they are simply waiting for a U.S. decision on MD. Speaker Komorowski acknowledged the provisions of U.S. law, but stated Poland does not want to be responsible for Czech problems. Senator Collins acknowledged the political cost to Poland of supporting MD, and asked for Komorowski,s views on how to maintain support for the United States if it pursues a different course.5. (C) Asked whether Poland would be reassured by the presence of Patriot batteries in lieu of MD, Nowak told CODEL Levin that, regardless of MD's fate, the GOP expects the USG to \"honor its commitments\" on Patriots. Poland intends to build a comprehensive air-defense system and has identified Patriots as \"the most important element\" of its defense modernization efforts. Nowak said Poland \"will not suffer\" if the U.S. withdraws from MD, but repeatedly asserted that the GOP is \"counting on Patriots.\" (NB: At one point, Nowak even intervened when his interpreter mistakenly said the Poles \"would like Patriots.\" \"No, we are counting on them,\" Nowak emphasized in English.)6. (C) Waszczykowski was less adamant about Patriots, stating that Poland and the U.S. had a binding political agreement on security matters, which he hoped the United States would respect. He added that Poland \"wants U.S. boots on the ground\" -- not necessarily as a tripwire, but as a deterrent. Nowak similarly stressed Poland's strong interest in \"deepening\" military cooperation, ideally to include a large U.S. footprint in Poland. He mused that one Patriot battery and ten MD interceptors do not constitute the \"impressive presence\" that Poland is hoping for.7. (C) Speaker Komorowski and Nowak both pointed out that, by agreeing to host the MD site, Poland had paid a \"high price\" -- especially in its relations with other EU members and with Russia. Komorowski expressed concern that Poland had again become a Russian target after a dozen years of improving relations -- senior Russian officials have threatened to target Poland with nuclear missiles, are stirring upWARSAW 00000467 002 OF 002anti-Polish sentiment among Russians, and are acting against Poland's interests in Ukraine.8. (C) Komorowski argued that the U.S. needs to fulfill its symbolic agreement to show involvement in defense of Polish territory. If the new administration is changing U.S. political priorities, it also needs to engage in dialogue with Poland, not just Russia. Most important for Poland is U.S. involvement in Polish security, through physical presence of American forces in Poland, NATO facilities in Poland, fulfilling the commitment to provide Patriot missiles, and greater U.S.-Polish cooperation.DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA9. (C) Komorowski, Nowak, and Waszczykowski stressed the importance of keeping Poland updated on the status of U.S.-Russia talks. Nowak stressed the GOP's strong interest in a positive outcome, but reminded the CODEL that U.S. negotiators had promised the USG would overcome Russian objections to MD. \"The MD site is an American base. The burden of achieving Russian agreement is on the U.S. side,\" he said. Even so, Nowak said, Poland had agreed to accept confidence-building measures with the Russians and was also working to convince Moscow that MD is not a threat to Russia's nuclear arsenal. Regardless, Russia will find it difficult to accept any \"tangible manifestation\" of a NATO presence in Poland or the Czech Republic.10. (C) Nowak said Poland had not discussed Patriots with the Russians. Russia should not have a say in Poland's defense modernization planning. Noting that Poland's armed forces are \"defensive in nature,\" Nowak reiterated that Poland's primary goal is to increase interoperability with allies.11. (C) Presidential Advisor Waszczykowski reacted more emotionally. While Washington is entitled to talk to Russia, to work toward a solution to the Iranian threat, and to make its own decision about the MD initiative, the U.S. should take care not to undermine Poland's security. He then wondered aloud, \"How long will it take you to realize that nothing will change with Iran and Russia?\" Waszczykowski asserted that Moscow is trying to regain its sphere of influence and stressed the critical importance of an increased U.S. or NATO presence for Poland's security. He added that Russia continues to deny its historical wrong-doings against Poland, imposes economic sanctions against Poland at will, and frequently disrupts the flow of oil and gas.THREAT FROM IRAN?12. (C) In all three meetings, Senator Nelson expressed doubt that Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons or missile programs, but noted that the Iranian threat to Europe could be met for the foreseeable future with the AEGIS and THAAD systems. Waszczykowski, who served as Poland's Ambassador to Tehran (1999-2002), agreed that Iran poses an increasing threat to the United States and Europe. He said that the Iranian regime has no incentive to warm relations with Washington because the regime has built its own legitimacy on the cornerstone of anti-Americanism.13. (C) Nowak and Komorowski told the CODEL that Poland does not perceive a direct threat from Iran. Nowak stated that, as an active and loyal ally, Poland had agreed to host the MD site because of the threat Iran poses to the U.S. and others in NATO. He noted that Poland's desire to be a strong ally was also the basis for its activity in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nowak said Poland perceives a greater threat from non-state actors, but conceded that Iran's support for terrorist organizations was troubling. He added that Poland's decision to host MD had moved it \"closer to the top of Iran's list,\" and, as a result, made Patriots more important to Poland's security.14.

Ashe for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)1. (S) SUMMARY. GOP officials are not privy to the full range of U.S. planning and thinking with regard to the prospective Patriot battery rotation here, but they do have expectations -- some naive, some tactical -- that they are making increasingly clear. For example, when told last autumn that the Patriots would not be integrated -- at least initially -- into the Polish air defense system, Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski angrily responded that Poland expected to have operational missiles, not \"potted plants.\" Merited or no, our Polish interlocutors believe: 1) (assuming successful SoFA talks) Patriots will start rotating to Poland this year regardless of the outcome of Washington's review of the Missile Defense program; 2) the battery will have some undefined \"operational capability;\" 3) the garrison remaining in Poland after 2012 will have the same size and composition as the uniformed elements that will staff the rotations; and 4) access to Patriot equipment for training will not be substantially impeded by provisions of the Export Control Act. To help us manage these issues, this cable lays out what we understand about Polish expectations and the backstory of how they got there. END SUMMARY.PATRIOTS AND MD - CONNECTED OR NO?2. (S) The proposed Patriot rotation was a condition of Polish agreement to sign the Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement (BMDA), and the U.S. would likely not have offered it outside of that context. A (very) simplified recounting of the story of how we got here seems in order.3. (S) The question of Patriots in Poland hung (largely silently) over the BMDA negotiations for much of last spring. The final breakthrough in the BMDA negotiations in fact came with a July 7 Polish non-paper, which indicated a GOP willingness to contribute to the deployment of a Patriot battery in Poland. The U.S. non-paper response of 10 August said that \"in the context of a broader and deeper bilateral security relationship, including the deployment of missile defense interceptors in Poland, the United States is prepared to deploy a U.S. Army Patriot battery in Poland (emphasis added).\" The Patriot deployment plans were made public in the Declaration of Strategic Cooperation, signed at the time of the BMDA, where we agreed to intensify our security and defense cooperation, including through \"the deployment of a U.S. Army Patriot air and missile defense system in Poland\" starting in 2009.4. (S) Since then both sides have used this connection to urge greater negotiating energy on the part of the other: the U.S. saying clearly that it will not move forward on Patriots without ratification of the BMDA and SOFA (a condition outlined in the 10 August non-paper), and the Poles moving cautiously at times on SOFA talks out of concern that the U.S. is not on schedule for a 2009 commencement of the Patriot rotation. Correctly or not, the Poles believe that ratification of SoFA and the BMDA gets them Patriots in 2009, independent of a USG decision on BMD, and that the Strategic Declaration signed at the time of the BMDA stands on its own. They have even turned our language on us in making the point, asking that the U.S. not be so \"transactional\" in tying its obligations to Poland's defense to new thinking about interceptors.WHEN IS A PATRIOT A PATRIOT?5. (S) The Declaration of Strategic Cooperation outlines some parameters for the proposed Patriot \"deployment,\" allowing that a Patriot battery rotation \"will include joint training opportunities that will enhance Polish air defense capabilities.\" The Poles interpret \"will include\" to mean \"not limited to\" and they expect that Polish air defenses will be enhanced in some operational capacity by the Patriot rotation. Repeated U.S. statements since August 2008 that the battery will not be operational are interpreted by the Poles to be part of a larger discussion of C4ISR and the inter-operability of Patriot in their overall air defense architecture. After months of back and forth, we think the Poles now understand that the rotation battery will not be fully operational and cannot be integrated immediately into the Polish system and that the battery will focus on training and exercises.6. (S) However, this is a good juncture to point out the most glaring gap in understanding between us and the Poles. The Poles have not been told that the battery will rotate without actual missiles -- i.e., not only will the rotation not be operational in the initial phase (due to C4ISR and other issues) but it will also not be operational, and certainly interoperable, at any point in our current plans. This will be a question of basic definitions for the Poles: is it a Patriot battery if it doesn't have live missiles? The Poles think the Patriots will become not only operable, but interoperable, over time - thus enhancing Poland's air defense. When told last Fall that the Patriots would not be operational, at least at first, Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski angrily responded that Poland expected to receive operational Patriot missiles, \"not potted plants.\"WHAT IS A GARRISON? WHAT IS JOINT TRAINING?7. (S) The GOP also has a different concept of the footprint involved when the U.S. agreed (also in the Declaration) to establish a \"garrison to support the U.S. Army Patriot battery\" by 2012. The Poles believe the permanent battery arrangement will have around 110 personnel -- about the same number required to staff planned temporary rotations between 2009 and 2012 -- which is to say that the Poles expect the \"garrison\" to convert the rotation itself into a permanent presence. Current U.S. planning appears to call for only 20-30 permanent personnel to maintain forward deployed equipment. In addition, the Poles understand that technology transfer regulations would normally restrict their access to Patriot equipment for purposes of training and exercises, but have interpreted the clause in the Declaration allowing for \"joint training opportunities\" to mean that they will have greater access to technology than is generally granted by the Export Control Act.COMMENT8. (S) We need to navigate the way forward carefully. We may be able to close some of the gaps between our plans and the Poles expectations with time and focus and patience on both sides. However, the \"potted plant\" problem, is much more tricky. Prime Minister Tusk, neither a fan of MD nor as wed to the U.S.-Polish strategic relationship as his predecessors, sold the BMDA to the Polish public as enhancing Polish security because of the Patriot agreement. Assuming the European missile site plans don't completely wither on the vine, the Poles will expect the Patriot rotation to not only go forward, but to have some operational, if not eventual interoperational capability. As we move forward, we will want to be careful not to stumble into this chasm. We need a strategy for how we will consult with the Poles to close the gap before it undoes much good work to date.

Originally, Zawadzki wanted a \"small garden sculpture\", but over time his ambitions have grown.The latest worries concern the sculpture's safety, after a crane collapsed when builders tried to place the head.

(S) SUMMARY: Deputy DefMin Stanislaw Komorowski and MFA Security Policy Director Adam Kobieracki reacted similarly when DCM raised reftel points -- Poland strongly agrees with the necessity of contingency planning for the Baltic States but would like to avoid delays in the completion of the EAGLE GUARDIAN plan for Poland. However, both Komorowski and Kobieracki suggested that Poland might be able to accept a \"creatively packaged\" plan that included separate but complementary components (\"chapters\") for Poland and the Baltic States. They agreed that discussions should not be made public. END SUMMARY.2. (S) In a meeting with DCM on December 17, Komorowski expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation with other NATO contingency planners on EAGLE GUARDIAN. Poles were active participants in the process and looked forward to its completion by the end of February or early March. Komorowski was skeptical that a regional approach to contingency planning was the best way ahead. Komorowski said Warsaw would prefer a unique plan for Poland, although he allowed that Warsaw could accept the notion of two complementary chapters for Poland and the Baltic States within EAGLE GUARDIAN. More important for Poland was the need to avoid any delay in completing the plan or to rehash already-agreed components, such as the threat assessment. He added that he \"agreed entirely\" that the issue should remain as secret as possible, and that it was in the \"common interest\" to avoid public discussion of NATO contingency planning.3. (S) Kobieracki made similar points to DCM on December 15, and suggested the USG engage in detailed consultations with Polish officials in Brussels and with the General Staff in Warsaw. He said Poland had hoped that a revised EAGLE GUARDIAN plan could be used as a starting point for developing contingency plans for the Baltic States rather than become intertwined with them. He hinted that a creatively packaged regional plan that met Polish needs in terms of conditionality and automaticity might be acceptable, but cautioned that Warsaw would need assurances that NATO's defense of Poland was an \"issue in its own right\" and not dependent on the security or defense of other NATO members. Kobieracki insisted that Poland would also need assurances that regional planning would not negatively impact on NATO's response to prospective crises, particularly with respect to pre-planned deployments. He urged that completion of EAGLE GUARDIAN not be delayed to accommodate incorporation of the Baltic States into a regional contingency plan. Kobieracki agreed that contingency planning discussions should not be made public.

Barack Obama abandoned the scheme in September last year, under his policy of \"resetting\" relations with Russia.The Pentagon and Nato are developing a more modest and mobile phased missile shield, inviting the Russians to take part. At a Nato summit in Lisbon last month, the allied leaders agreed for the first time to press ahead with the project and President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia was cautiously positive on the prospects for Moscow's co-operation.In November last year, Alexander Vershbow, the assistant defence secretary for international security, offered the Poles a role in the new project by hosting a land-based \"standard missile-3\" system, as seen in the leaked US embassy cables.The Poles, who have repeatedly told the Americans that they feel unthreatened by Iran but are regularly alarmed about Russia, asked \"a series of hypothetical questions on the adaptive nature of the system vis-a-vis the changing threat\".\"With regard to how Nato might defend itself from missiles coming from elsewhere than Iran or Syria, BG John Hesterman of the joint staff said that sea-borne platforms could provide surge capability against threats from an unforeseen direction, land-based sites could be upgraded with more interceptors if the scale of the threat were increased, and radars could be reoriented,\" the US embassy in Warsaw reports following the meetings.A series of cables going back over the past two years highlights the Polish eagerness to try to draw the US military, Nato assets, and possibly military bases into Poland, and a clear US ambivalence and wariness, sparking furious rows and mutual exasperation.\"How long will it take you to realise that nothing will change with Iran and Russia?\" a Polish presidential aide asks a trio of visiting US senators in May last year.\"The Polish prime minister's chief of staff, the president's deputy national security advisor, and the speaker of the Polish parliament expressed unanimous support for a large US military footprint in Poland \u2026 Most important for Poland is US involvement in Polish security, through physical presence of American forces in Poland, Nato facilities in Poland, fulfilling the commitment to provide Patriot missiles,\" the embassy reports. Six months later, Vershbow offered an alternative to the promised Patriots \"which the US believed may be more useful to Poland\".\"The three options presented were: 1) a quarterly rotation of F-16s, and the establishment of a small permanent support detachment, which would focus on enhancing Polish fighter capabilities, increasing sortie readiness and meeting Nato commitments; 2) quarterly C-130 rotations from Ramstein [airbase in Germany], also with a small permanent support detachment in Poland with the goal of increasing Polish readiness and ability to support own and Nato operations; 3) the relocation of a US naval special warfare unit from Stuttgart to Gdansk or Gdynia [on the Baltic coast].\"The Poles were enthusiastic, seeking to maximise the US offers. In February this year, the defence minister, Bogdan Klich, told the US ambassador, Lee Feinstein, in Warsaw that Poland was interested in all the options, particularly the F-16 fighter aircraft. Under government cost-cutting, Poland was closing down 20% of military facilities \"but would be saving three complexes for US forces,\" Klich said.Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, also told Ellen Tauscher, the US under-secretary of state for arms control, that Warsaw was interested in the F-16s.", "tags": ["Poland", "World news", "US foreign policy", "US news", "The US embassy cables", "Russia", "Nato", "Europe"], "title": "WikiLeaks cables: Poland wants missile shield to protect against Russia"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:14Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Monday, 22 February 2010, 16:12C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 WARSAW 000110 SIPDIS DEPT FOR EUR/CE (GLANTZ, KARAGIANNIS) OSD FOR MITCHELL, AMBASSADOR VERSHBOW, ADMIRAL MULLEN EUCOM FOR ADMIRAL STAVRIDIS USAREUR FOR GENERAL HAM EO 12958 DECL: 02/22/2020 TAGS PREL, MARR, MOPS, PGOV, PL SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS DEFENSE MINISTER KLICH Classified By: Classified BY Political Counselor Dan Sainz, reason 1.4 (b, d)1. (C) SUMMARY: Defense Minister Bogdan Klich told the Ambassador on February 18 that Poland is eager to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, which he described as based on a solid political foundation. He emphasized the importance to Poland of an April arrival of the first Patriot battery rotation. Klich did not repeat recent Polish government points about the configuration of future rotations of the Patriot battery. End Summary.2. (C) During a February 18 meeting with the Ambassador, Polish Defense Minister Bogdan Klich said there is a good political framework for continued U.S.-Polish defense cooperation, and noted Under Secretary Tauscher's February 8 visit had been a very successful one. Klich said he does not expect anything will happen to undermine that solid foundation. He added that the bilateral supplemental SoFA, signed December 11, provides a strong legal framework for defense ties. The SoFA ratification vote in the Sejm (the lower house of Parliament) was overwhelmingly in favor, and Senate approval would also come quickly. (Note: The Senate voted 88-1 in favor of SOFA ratification later on February 18.) Klich said President Kaczynski would sign the SoFA ratification bill quickly.HOPING FOR PATRIOTS IN APRIL----------------------------3. (C) Klich said Poland has a strong desire to see the fruits of bilateral defense cooperation, and he highlighted the political importance of an early first rotation in Poland of the U.S. Patriot battery. He said Poland hopes the first rotation will occur in April. The Ambassador said the United States wants the rotation to be viewed as a bilateral success. In answer to Klich's questions about timing, the Ambassader said the United States has said the first rotation would take place within 90 days of SOFA ratification. He said a more precise time frame will be determined at the last bilateral planning meeting for the Patriot rotation, which will take place in the first week in March.MILITARY FACILITIES FOR ALTERNATIVE U.S. PRESENCES--------------------------------------------- -----4. (C) Klich called for talks on other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. He said he had authorized Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski and ChoD Franciszek Gagor to take part in such talks. Klich highlighted Polish interest in all of the options presented by DOD A/S Vershbow at the October High Level Defense Group discussions: F-16s, C-130's, as well as \"stable, not temporary\" special operations forces. When asked, Klich confirmed that the GoP is particularly interested in U.S. F-16 rotations. Speaking personally, he said he also had a strong interest in a special operations force presence, since he had signed a bilateral special operations cooperation agreement with Secretary Gates a year ago. ChoD Gagor added that the biggest multilateral exercise Poland is hosting this year, \"Jackal Stone 10,\" will feature special operations forces. Klich added that as part of the first in-depth infrastructure review in postwar Poland, the Defense Ministry had decided to close 20% of defense facilities, but would be &saving8 three complexes for U.S. forces.GETTING THE WORD OUT ON DEFENSE COOPERATION-------------------------------------------5. (C) The Ambassador noted that the bilateral agenda for defense cooperation is a full one, and both governments should work together to inform public opinion about the many useful exchanges under way. Klich strongly agreed that Defense Ministry and Embassy staff should follow up in this area. Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski added that if A/S Vershbow visits Warsaw in the coming months, it might be a good occasion to do some joint public diplomacy work about planning for other forms of an enhanced U.S. security presence in Poland. (Note: Amb. Vershbow's planned mid-March trip has been postponed.)6. (C) COMMENT: Klich's emphasis on a hoped-for April arrivalWARSAW 00000110 002 OF 002of the first Patriot battery is consistent with other government statements and press leaks that signal a decision to focus on the timing of the first deployment, as opposed to other aspects of it. In that regard, Klich did not repeat government appeals that Patriot rotations be integrated into the Polish air defense system and include \"live\" missiles, as he did in a meeting the previous week with Under Secretary Tauscher. The emphasis on the timing of the first deployment corresponds with developments in the presidential race, and Foreign Minister Sikorsky,s active candidacy for the Civic Platform nomination.

They claim the treasured panel depicting Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of Ludovico Sforza, ruler of Milan and patron of Leonardo, is too delicate to travel. It is one of barely 20 paintings attributed to the artist.The Krakow division of the Association of Art Historians has sent an impassioned letter to ArtWatch UK, the restoration watchdog, to draw the world's attention to their \"anxiety\".In a letter to be published tomorrow, its president, Joanna Daranowska-Lukaszewska, writes: \"The sending of the Krakow picture abroad is insured for \u20ac300m [\u00a3250m], but in the event of a disaster no one would be able to restore this priceless masterpiece to life. We appeal to [ArtWatch] to draw the attention of world public opinion to the great dangers now faced by \u2026 common property of the whole cultural world.\"It is not just in Poland that fears are growing over the National Gallery's plans for its exhibition, \"Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan\". Concern is being voiced that other Leonardo paintings \u2013 La Belle Ferroni\u00e8re, from the Louvre; the Madonna Litta, from the Hermitage in St Petersburg; and Saint Jerome, from the Pinacoteca Vaticana in Rome \u2013 also face perilous journeys.But in Krakow \u2013 where Lady with an Ermine sits in the Czartoryski Museum \u2013 those concerns have reached an acute level. \"If you transport a picture panel such as the Lady with an Ermine \u2026 even the most ideal methods in the form of modern environmental chambers or special anti-shock frames are not able to sufficiently protect the work against a variety of vibrations, shocks or changes in pressure,\" said Professor Grazyna Korpal, dean of conservation.\"By allowing the painting to travel we create yet another serious threat [from] \u2026 possible human error. Such masterpieces require exceptional protection. The fundamental principle is the unconditional restriction of movement.\"A source at the National Museum revealed that a letter from Poland's deputy cultural and national heritage minister permitted the picture to be transported to London.Michael Daley of ArtWatch UK said it was hard to justify allowing such great masterpieces to be moved: \"With paintings on panel, any movement is dangerous and bound to have a deleterious effect. Why take the chance? There is nothing to contradict the warnings of the Polish restorers. Moving the Lady with an Ermine is absolutely crazy.\"He added that the danger of theft is heightened during any move. Last week a Picasso was among some 30 artworks valued at \u00a34.1m stolen in transit between galleries in Germany and Spain.Even moving works from room to room within a gallery presented dangers, Daley said.

Most high-ranking and mid-level Poles have stayed on in their positions in the Vatican bureaucracy since the death of John Paul, maintaining the Vatican's Polish flavor. Pope Benedict has consistently made gestures to acknowledge the importance of the Polish Catholic Church in the context of European and world Catholicism - an importance embodied most immediately by the crowds of Polish pilgrims that still flock to Rome. Pope Benedict and other Vatican officials maintain Pope John Paul's hope that Poland will serve as a counter-weight to Western European secularism, but are wary of nationalistic or divisive forces with a Catholic label, such as media outlets under the control of Polish station Radio Maryja. With Pope Benedict XVI's May 25-28 visit to Poland looming, many in and around the Vatican are addressing these subjects. End Summary.------------------------Poland: Still a Presence------------------------3. (C) The papacy of John Paul II is slowly fading into history, but Poland remains an important part of the conversation at the Vatican. Recent months have offered much evidence of this, and numerous opportunities to assess Holy See - Poland relations. Late last year, several groups of Polish bishops came to Rome for their quinquennial \"ad limina\" visit to the pope and Vatican officials. In December, then-President Aleksander Kwasniewski made his swan song visit to the Vatican and met with Benedict XVI. In January, his successor, President Lech Kaczynski, made his first trip abroad as president and met Pope Benedict XVI. The first anniversary of the death of the Polish pope in April saw waves of Polish pilgrims visiting Rome, but the sound of Polish on the streets of Rome hardly abated for the Easter celebrations two weeks later. Add periodic events commemorating various dates in the life of John Paul II or initiatives that he began, and there remains an inevitable Polish flavor to life at the Vatican.4. (C) In the aftermath of the death of the Polish pope, Pole-weary Italian journalists heralded the impending exodus of Poles from Rome and the Vatican Curia (bureaucracy) (ref a). Their hope was that an Italian would regain the papacy and add to the already imposing number of Italians in the Curia. Many predicted that the papacy would inevitably turn its attention from the homeland of the deceased pontiff. In the end, Joseph Ratzinger of Germany was elected pope, and the Poles, by and large, stayed. And although it was inevitable that the death of John Paul would signal a change in the relationship between Poland and the Holy See, the bond remains strong. The Vatican has continued to play close attention to Poland and Poles continue to wield great influence in Vatican City.-----------------------------------Polish Personnel, Influence Remain-----------------------------------5. (C) Benedict moved his own German secretary, Monsignor Georg Ganswein, into the Apostolic Palace, but he kept on Pope John Paul's Polish aide, Mieczyslaw Mokrzycki (an ethnic Pole from Ukraine) in a very visible position in the papal household. Other prominent Poles at the Vatican, such as Cardinal Zenon Grocholewski (Congregation for Education), Monsignor Antoni Stankiewicz (Roman Rota - the Vatican's high court), Archbishop Edward Nowak (Congregation for the Causes of Saints), Monsignor Krzysztof Nitkiewicz (Congregation for Oriental Churches), Archbishop Stanislaw Rylko (Council for Laity), and others are continuing in high-profile positions. [Note: Rylko was passed over for an expected elevation to the College of Cardinals at the most recent consistory, but still heads an important Vatican department.]6. (C) Benedict also named London-born Polish priest Wojciech Giertych as theologian of the Papal Household, another prestigious position. Giertych is the son of well-known PolishVATICAN 00000083 002.2 OF 004nationalist Jedrzej Giertych (1903-92), and brother of Maciej Giertych of the League of Polish Families party in Poland. Maciej's son, Roman, is the newly-named Education Minister (as reported by Embassy Warsaw) and a member of the Catholic organization, Opus Dei . Though Fr. Giertych was selected for his erudition and preaching rather than his nationality (we also doubt his family connections played a role in the appointment), his presence presents another opportunity for Polish visibility and influence. A host of lower-level Polish functionaries continue as well, doing a lot of the heavy lifting in and around the Vatican. The only major name to leave Rome in the wake of the death of John Paul was Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, John Paul's longtime secretary, whom Benedict sent to follow in his mentor's footsteps as Cardinal Archbishop of Krakow.7. (C) \"Even after the death of the Holy Father, we have a strong presence here,\" Grzegorz Kaszak, rector of the Polish College (residential seminary) in Rome and a former Vatican bureaucrat, told us. Kaszak pointed out that Poles had been making inroads at the Vatican for over twenty years. Their influence was unlikely to diminish overnight. Even when Benedict XVI makes the major changes in the Curia that Vatican-watchers have been predicting for some time, most Poles here do not predict that Polish influence in the Vatican will drop precipitously. \"We are now part of the culture here,\" and a crucial element of the Church in Europe and in the world, Kaszak insisted.------------------------------------------Vatican Publicizes Stats on Polish Church------------------------------------------8. (C) The statistics bear Kaszak out. We defer to Embassy Warsaw on the strength of the Polish Catholic Church domestically, but the Vatican was touting its numbers in advance of the pope's trip. The Holy See released statistics noting the country's 36.6 million Catholics at some 10,114 parishes and 800 pastoral centers. There are some 28 thousand priests and almost 25 thousand other religious personnel (nuns and other male religious) with 6,400 students studying to become priests. Vatican-based sources have remarked to us that Poland's Catholic muscle is felt far beyond the country's borders. In parishes in Italy, other European countries, the U.S., and elsewhere, it is not uncommon to come upon Polish clergy, either on loan, or having taken up residence in a foreign diocese. What's most important to the Holy See is the \"formation of the youth,\" according to Dariusz Giers, a Polish priest working at the Vatican's Health Ministry. \"The Vatican knows we have excellent programs to educate young people [in religious matters]\" he said, emphasizing the importance of this factor for the continuing strength of the religion. What's more, many at the Vatican consider Polish Catholicism to be dependably orthodox, compared to more liberal strains of the faith found in some parts of Western Europe. \"The Poles are grounded in the faith,\" one contact opined. \"You wouldn't have to worry about the Da Vinci Code confusing people in Poland.\"---------------------Ubiquitous Presence---------------------9. (C) As if to emphasize the ubiquitous presence of Poles in and around the Vatican, Kaszak exchanged several greetings in Polish with passing nuns as he spoke to us not far from St. Peter's Square. In fact, whether one's in the Vatican grocery store or post office, St. Peter's Basilica, or walking any of the streets around Vatican City, it's hard to go twenty minutes without hearing some Polish. And this is not just from the Vatican functionaries from Poland and the many Polish nuns who staff several Vatican offices and residences. The flow of Polish pilgrims to Rome has waned little even a year after the death of Pope John Paul. Of course, massive crowds of Poles came to Rome to observe the first anniversary of the pope's death on April 2. A mass said by Pope Benedict and other events packed an overflowing St. Peter's Square. But it seemed to onlookers that the Polish influx was just as great - or greater - for the Easter celebrations not long afterwards. As is typical for the outdoor audiences and public masses, banners from Polish parishes and towns highlighted Polish participation. \"I think there were even more Poles here for Easter,\" Vatican bureaucrat Giers told us. \"This has been nearly constant since the death of the Holy Father. I don't see signs of it slowing down.\"----------------------------Pope Reaches Out to Poles----------------------------10. (C) The Holy See clearly recognizes who its audience is. At his weekly public gathering (a mixture of prayer and pep rally), Pope Benedict speaks every week to the crowd in Polish,VATICAN 00000083 003.6 OF 004in addition to Italian, French, English, Spanish, and German. Polish is typically one of the languages used for prayers at Vatican masses. The pope often makes special emphasis on the Polish contingent at the audiences and other events, as on May 3, when he noted the anniversary of the 1791 ratification of the Polish Constitution and heralded the anniversary a noteworthy event in Polish Catholic history. Benedict XVI has also devoted some of his rare private audiences to Polish or Polish-affiliated groups such an April visit with representatives of the Krakow-based publishing house, Znak, publisher of Pope John Paul's last book and other Church-related works. That Pope Benedict, who travels much less than his predecessor, chose Poland as his second trip abroad (his first was a visit to World Youth Day in Germany that had been scheduled before his election) is perhaps the strongest sign of this recognition (septel).---------------------------------------A Counter-Weight to Secular Europe?---------------------------------------11. (C) The Holy See's attention to Poland is not simply customer service or \"taking care of the troops\". As was clear under Pope John Paul II, the Vatican has high hopes that Poland will serve as a counter-weight to Western European secularism as the nation makes itself more at home in an integrated Europe. Pope Benedict's preoccupation with what he sees as Europe's increasing psychological distance from its Christian roots is clear (ref a). He has continued to focus on Poland's potential in combating this trend. This was one of the themes of the visit of several groups of Polish bishops to the Vatican at the end of last year. \"It's a topic that always comes up,\" explained Monsignor Michael Banach, the Holy See MFA's country director for Poland. He told us that the two sides recognized that the Polish bishops needed to exert leadership in the face of Western European secularism. Certainly the Holy See hopes that Poland will hold the line at the EU on \"life and family\" issues that arise. But the necessity of maintaining and fortifying the faith internally in Polish society is perhaps an equally important - if not unrelated - focus. Several sources have told us that both sides are keenly aware of the danger that European secularism will dilute Polish faith and identity.-------------Trojan Horse-------------12. (C) Looking at Poland's position in Europe and the EU, several Polish interlocutors told us that Western European suspicion of Poland as a \"Trojan horse\" for the U.S. in the EU was not just a phenomenon among the laity - it had also infected the Vatican. \"We definitely get that feeling\" from a few of the French, German and other Western European prelates at the Vatican, said Giers. The war in Iraq, unpopular among many Vatican officials, has certainly played a role here. Traditional Polish affection for the U.S., on the other hand, seems as strong as ever among the Polish clergy stationed or studying in Rome. In conversations at a dinner not long ago at the Polish College, several seminarians and priests made a point of praising the U.S. and lauding USG foreign policy.----------------Radio Maryja----------------13. (C) Although the Vatican is on guard against encroaching secularism, it shares with many Polish bishops a wariness of Radio Maryja, the Catholic radio station accused of xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Banach and Piotr Samerek, DCM at the Polish Embassy to the Holy See, told us that during their ad limina visits, several of the bishops appealed to Vatican Foreign Minister Giovanni Lajolo and others to clamp down on excesses of Radio Maryja and its sister media outlets. The complaints included Radio Maryja's meddling in Polish politics. According to Banach, Lajolo was sympathetic, and expressed his reservations about the network. But Lajolo took a typical Vatican line in judging the matter to be an Polish internal affair. Banach told us that Lajolo told more than one group of bishops that they had to deal with Radio Maryja themselves as part of their \"pastoral responsibilities\". Though media attributed some comments critical of Radio Maryja to Pope Benedict, the Holy See clearly did not want to get involved.14. (C) When Papal Nuncio Jozef Kowalczyk made an April statement chastising Radio Maryja, many assumed that the Vatican had finally decided to clamp down on the network. Our contacts tell us that wasn't the case, saying that while the Holy See agreed with the spirit of Kowalczyk's intervention, the nuncio had spoken out on his own. Some following the issue at the Vatican have told us that Kowalczyk went too far, given the Vatican's view of the matter as an internal Polish question. InVATICAN 00000083 004.4 OF 004any case, as Banach told us, things seem to be improving, as the proposed programming board set up to monitor the content of the station's broadcasts looks like a step in the right direction.----------------Other Influences----------------15. (C) As the Holy See examines the many aspects of its relationship with Poland, it seeks to maintain its focus on the pastoral rather than political. But religious subjects routinely morph into political ones. Banach wouldn't bite when asked for his view of the entry of radical elements such as Andrzej Lepper or ultra-Catholics like Roman Giertych into Poland's governing coalition and ministerial ranks (ref c). He did say that the Vatican understood the dangers that right-wing nationalists posed to Poland's future, and allowed that some saw a danger of Catholic fringe groups discrediting the mainstream Church. As far as the reputation for anti-Semitism that stuck to some nationalists, Banach commented that \"no one\" wanted to see the progress that had been made on such issues lost.----------Comment----------16. (C) It is only a little more than a year after the death of Pope John Paul II, and it is inevitable that with the passage of time Poland will eventually become less central to the world of the Vatican. John-Paul era Vatican bureaucrats will eventually move on. Poland may become more secular. The memory of the Polish pope will certainly recede further into the past. The growth of the Catholic Church in certain parts of the developing world could also play a role here, pushing the Poles, Italians and others to less prominent roles with the Holy See and capturing even more attention in Curial offices. For the near future, however, Poland is assured an important place at the Vatican table.ROONEY", "tags": ["The US embassy cables", "Catholicism", "Pope Benedict XVI", "US foreign policy", "World news", "Poland", "European Union", "Vatican", "Europe", "The papacy"], "title": "US embassy cables: Vatican hoped that Poland would 'hold the family line' in the EU"},{"date": "2010-12-06T21:30:13Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Thursday, 07 May 2009, 05:17C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 WARSAW 000467 SIPDIS EUR, PM, H EO 12958 DECL: 04/20/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, MARR, OREP, RS, PL SUBJECT: POLAND - CODEL LEVIN DISCUSSES MISSILE DEFENSE, PATRIOTSREF: WARSAW 375Classified By: Ambassador Ashe for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).1. (C) SUMMARY: In meetings with CODEL Levin, the Polish Prime Minister's chief of staff, the President's deputy national security advisor, and the speaker of the Polish parliament expressed unanimous support for a large U.S. military footprint in Poland to bolster Article 5 guarantees. PM chief of staff Slawomir Nowak told CODEL that, regardless of the U.S. decision on Missile Defense, Poland expects the U.S. to \"honor its commitments\" to bring a Patriot battery to Poland. All three Polish officials requested that the U.S. keep Poland updated on the status of dialogue with Russia, suggesting that Russia, not Iran, poses the greater threat to Poland. CODEL's meeting with FM Sikorski is reported septel. END SUMMARY.2. (C) Senator Carl Levin (D-MI), Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), visited Warsaw April 15-16 to discuss Missile Defense and Polish interest in a U.S. Patriot battery rotation with Polish officials, including Prime Minister Tusk's chief of staff Slawomir Nowak, Deputy Chief of President Kaczynski's National Security Bureau Witold Waszczykowski, and Parliamentary Speaker Bronislaw Komorowski (Civic Platform, PO). The Senators' meetings with Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski and Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski are reported septel.U.S. \"ROCK SOLID\" ON ARTICLE FIVE3. (C) Senator Levin began all three meetings by conveying the President's message that the U.S. commitment to the NATO Article 5 guarantee is \"rock solid.\" While U.S. support for Poland may differ in form under the Obama administration, U.S. support for Poland will be strong. When asked whether Warsaw felt assured that NATO would honor its Article 5 commitments to Poland, Waszczykowski said \"we still have our doubts,\" adding that some European members -- particularly France -- prefer talk to action, he wryly added \"that's why we bought F-16s and not French Mirages, and why we went through with the Missile Defense deal.\"PATRIOTS AND AMERICAN BOOTS4. (C) Senator Levin warned all three interlocutors that if the Czechs reject the proposed MD radar site, the Polish component of MD would be put in jeopardy under current U.S. legislation. Nowak expressed confidence that the Czechs would ratify the agreement with the U.S., suggesting they are simply waiting for a U.S. decision on MD. Speaker Komorowski acknowledged the provisions of U.S. law, but stated Poland does not want to be responsible for Czech problems. Senator Collins acknowledged the political cost to Poland of supporting MD, and asked for Komorowski,s views on how to maintain support for the United States if it pursues a different course.5. (C) Asked whether Poland would be reassured by the presence of Patriot batteries in lieu of MD, Nowak told CODEL Levin that, regardless of MD's fate, the GOP expects the USG to \"honor its commitments\" on Patriots. Poland intends to build a comprehensive air-defense system and has identified Patriots as \"the most important element\" of its defense modernization efforts. Nowak said Poland \"will not suffer\" if the U.S. withdraws from MD, but repeatedly asserted that the GOP is \"counting on Patriots.\" (NB: At one point, Nowak even intervened when his interpreter mistakenly said the Poles \"would like Patriots.\" \"No, we are counting on them,\" Nowak emphasized in English.)6. (C) Waszczykowski was less adamant about Patriots, stating that Poland and the U.S. had a binding political agreement on security matters, which he hoped the United States would respect. He added that Poland \"wants U.S. boots on the ground\" -- not necessarily as a tripwire, but as a deterrent. Nowak similarly stressed Poland's strong interest in \"deepening\" military cooperation, ideally to include a large U.S. footprint in Poland. He mused that one Patriot battery and ten MD interceptors do not constitute the \"impressive presence\" that Poland is hoping for.7. (C) Speaker Komorowski and Nowak both pointed out that, by agreeing to host the MD site, Poland had paid a \"high price\" -- especially in its relations with other EU members and with Russia. Komorowski expressed concern that Poland had again become a Russian target after a dozen years of improving relations -- senior Russian officials have threatened to target Poland with nuclear missiles, are stirring upWARSAW 00000467 002 OF 002anti-Polish sentiment among Russians, and are acting against Poland's interests in Ukraine.8. (C) Komorowski argued that the U.S. needs to fulfill its symbolic agreement to show involvement in defense of Polish territory. If the new administration is changing U.S. political priorities, it also needs to engage in dialogue with Poland, not just Russia. Most important for Poland is U.S. involvement in Polish security, through physical presence of American forces in Poland, NATO facilities in Poland, fulfilling the commitment to provide Patriot missiles, and greater U.S.-Polish cooperation.DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA9. (C) Komorowski, Nowak, and Waszczykowski stressed the importance of keeping Poland updated on the status of U.S.-Russia talks. Nowak stressed the GOP's strong interest in a positive outcome, but reminded the CODEL that U.S. negotiators had promised the USG would overcome Russian objections to MD. \"The MD site is an American base. The burden of achieving Russian agreement is on the U.S. side,\" he said. Even so, Nowak said, Poland had agreed to accept confidence-building measures with the Russians and was also working to convince Moscow that MD is not a threat to Russia's nuclear arsenal. Regardless, Russia will find it difficult to accept any \"tangible manifestation\" of a NATO presence in Poland or the Czech Republic.10. (C) Nowak said Poland had not discussed Patriots with the Russians. Russia should not have a say in Poland's defense modernization planning. Noting that Poland's armed forces are \"defensive in nature,\" Nowak reiterated that Poland's primary goal is to increase interoperability with allies.11. (C) Presidential Advisor Waszczykowski reacted more emotionally. While Washington is entitled to talk to Russia, to work toward a solution to the Iranian threat, and to make its own decision about the MD initiative, the U.S. should take care not to undermine Poland's security. He then wondered aloud, \"How long will it take you to realize that nothing will change with Iran and Russia?\" Waszczykowski asserted that Moscow is trying to regain its sphere of influence and stressed the critical importance of an increased U.S. or NATO presence for Poland's security. He added that Russia continues to deny its historical wrong-doings against Poland, imposes economic sanctions against Poland at will, and frequently disrupts the flow of oil and gas.THREAT FROM IRAN?12. (C) In all three meetings, Senator Nelson expressed doubt that Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons or missile programs, but noted that the Iranian threat to Europe could be met for the foreseeable future with the AEGIS and THAAD systems. Waszczykowski, who served as Poland's Ambassador to Tehran (1999-2002), agreed that Iran poses an increasing threat to the United States and Europe. He said that the Iranian regime has no incentive to warm relations with Washington because the regime has built its own legitimacy on the cornerstone of anti-Americanism.13. (C) Nowak and Komorowski told the CODEL that Poland does not perceive a direct threat from Iran. Nowak stated that, as an active and loyal ally, Poland had agreed to host the MD site because of the threat Iran poses to the U.S. and others in NATO. He noted that Poland's desire to be a strong ally was also the basis for its activity in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nowak said Poland perceives a greater threat from non-state actors, but conceded that Iran's support for terrorist organizations was troubling. He added that Poland's decision to host MD had moved it \"closer to the top of Iran's list,\" and, as a result, made Patriots more important to Poland's security.14.

Ashe for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)1. (S) SUMMARY. GOP officials are not privy to the full range of U.S. planning and thinking with regard to the prospective Patriot battery rotation here, but they do have expectations -- some naive, some tactical -- that they are making increasingly clear. For example, when told last autumn that the Patriots would not be integrated -- at least initially -- into the Polish air defense system, Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski angrily responded that Poland expected to have operational missiles, not \"potted plants.\" Merited or no, our Polish interlocutors believe: 1) (assuming successful SoFA talks) Patriots will start rotating to Poland this year regardless of the outcome of Washington's review of the Missile Defense program; 2) the battery will have some undefined \"operational capability;\" 3) the garrison remaining in Poland after 2012 will have the same size and composition as the uniformed elements that will staff the rotations; and 4) access to Patriot equipment for training will not be substantially impeded by provisions of the Export Control Act. To help us manage these issues, this cable lays out what we understand about Polish expectations and the backstory of how they got there. END SUMMARY.PATRIOTS AND MD - CONNECTED OR NO?2. (S) The proposed Patriot rotation was a condition of Polish agreement to sign the Ballistic Missile Defense Agreement (BMDA), and the U.S. would likely not have offered it outside of that context. A (very) simplified recounting of the story of how we got here seems in order.3. (S) The question of Patriots in Poland hung (largely silently) over the BMDA negotiations for much of last spring. The final breakthrough in the BMDA negotiations in fact came with a July 7 Polish non-paper, which indicated a GOP willingness to contribute to the deployment of a Patriot battery in Poland. The U.S. non-paper response of 10 August said that \"in the context of a broader and deeper bilateral security relationship, including the deployment of missile defense interceptors in Poland, the United States is prepared to deploy a U.S. Army Patriot battery in Poland (emphasis added).\" The Patriot deployment plans were made public in the Declaration of Strategic Cooperation, signed at the time of the BMDA, where we agreed to intensify our security and defense cooperation, including through \"the deployment of a U.S. Army Patriot air and missile defense system in Poland\" starting in 2009.4. (S) Since then both sides have used this connection to urge greater negotiating energy on the part of the other: the U.S. saying clearly that it will not move forward on Patriots without ratification of the BMDA and SOFA (a condition outlined in the 10 August non-paper), and the Poles moving cautiously at times on SOFA talks out of concern that the U.S. is not on schedule for a 2009 commencement of the Patriot rotation. Correctly or not, the Poles believe that ratification of SoFA and the BMDA gets them Patriots in 2009, independent of a USG decision on BMD, and that the Strategic Declaration signed at the time of the BMDA stands on its own. They have even turned our language on us in making the point, asking that the U.S. not be so \"transactional\" in tying its obligations to Poland's defense to new thinking about interceptors.WHEN IS A PATRIOT A PATRIOT?5. (S) The Declaration of Strategic Cooperation outlines some parameters for the proposed Patriot \"deployment,\" allowing that a Patriot battery rotation \"will include joint training opportunities that will enhance Polish air defense capabilities.\" The Poles interpret \"will include\" to mean \"not limited to\" and they expect that Polish air defenses will be enhanced in some operational capacity by the Patriot rotation. Repeated U.S. statements since August 2008 that the battery will not be operational are interpreted by the Poles to be part of a larger discussion of C4ISR and the inter-operability of Patriot in their overall air defense architecture. After months of back and forth, we think the Poles now understand that the rotation battery will not be fully operational and cannot be integrated immediately into the Polish system and that the battery will focus on training and exercises.6. (S) However, this is a good juncture to point out the most glaring gap in understanding between us and the Poles. The Poles have not been told that the battery will rotate without actual missiles -- i.e., not only will the rotation not be operational in the initial phase (due to C4ISR and other issues) but it will also not be operational, and certainly interoperable, at any point in our current plans. This will be a question of basic definitions for the Poles: is it a Patriot battery if it doesn't have live missiles? The Poles think the Patriots will become not only operable, but interoperable, over time - thus enhancing Poland's air defense. When told last Fall that the Patriots would not be operational, at least at first, Deputy Defense Minister Komorowski angrily responded that Poland expected to receive operational Patriot missiles, \"not potted plants.\"WHAT IS A GARRISON? WHAT IS JOINT TRAINING?7. (S) The GOP also has a different concept of the footprint involved when the U.S. agreed (also in the Declaration) to establish a \"garrison to support the U.S. Army Patriot battery\" by 2012. The Poles believe the permanent battery arrangement will have around 110 personnel -- about the same number required to staff planned temporary rotations between 2009 and 2012 -- which is to say that the Poles expect the \"garrison\" to convert the rotation itself into a permanent presence. Current U.S. planning appears to call for only 20-30 permanent personnel to maintain forward deployed equipment. In addition, the Poles understand that technology transfer regulations would normally restrict their access to Patriot equipment for purposes of training and exercises, but have interpreted the clause in the Declaration allowing for \"joint training opportunities\" to mean that they will have greater access to technology than is generally granted by the Export Control Act.COMMENT8. (S) We need to navigate the way forward carefully. We may be able to close some of the gaps between our plans and the Poles expectations with time and focus and patience on both sides. However, the \"potted plant\" problem, is much more tricky. Prime Minister Tusk, neither a fan of MD nor as wed to the U.S.-Polish strategic relationship as his predecessors, sold the BMDA to the Polish public as enhancing Polish security because of the Patriot agreement. Assuming the European missile site plans don't completely wither on the vine, the Poles will expect the Patriot rotation to not only go forward, but to have some operational, if not eventual interoperational capability. As we move forward, we will want to be careful not to stumble into this chasm. We need a strategy for how we will consult with the Poles to close the gap before it undoes much good work to date.

As it fell, the head crushed a builder's foot, leading sceptics to call the accident a sign of God's disapproval. When Zawadzki suffered a heart attack the same claim was made.Building experts have voiced concerns that the statue's foundations \u2013 construction on which began even before planning approval was granted \u2013 are not deep enough. \"We'll give it 20 years, maximum, then it'll fall apart,\" a building expert told Polish media.Zawadzki stands accused of paying workers derisory wages, expecting them to carry out the work for next to nothing as a sign of their faith, and even of bringing in inmates from the local prison to work on the project, under an agreement he allegedly hatched with the prison governor.Waldemar Roszczuk, editor of the local newspaper Gazeta Swiebodzinska, has been leading a campaign against the structure, which has been compared to the type of communist-era icons that once commanded squares and public places.\"It's a monster of a statue which has nothing to do with Christian teaching,\" he said. \"It's making us a laughing stock in the whole country.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Christianity", "Catholicism", "World news", "Religion", "Europe"], "title": "Jesus Christ statue in smalltown Poland bids to rival Rio's Redeemer"},{"date": "2010-12-03T16:42:24Z", "country": "poland", "content": "About 30 people have frozen to death in Poland over the past three days as the cold spell gripped Europe.Those who died were mainly homeless men aged from their mid-30s to their 60s, including some alcoholics who were sleeping rough.

France also saw its first homeless death of the winter when a woman in her 40s who had been sleeping rough in the entrance of a block of flats in Marseille was found dead at the weekend.Thousands were evacuated from their homes after severe flooding in Montenegro, Bosnia and Serbia.Power supplies were hit across Europe with severe frost leaving around 150,000 people in the southern Polish city of Czestochowa without heating today. In France, which has suffered electricity blackouts in the centre and north-west, around 3,000 homes were without electricity today.Transport was hit with airports including the European hub, Frankfurt, suffering delays and cancellations. Eurostar links from Britain to France and Belgium have recorded delays and cancellations and the service will be disrupted until Sunday, authorities said.

The family lived close to the Gdansk shipyards in the early years of Solidarity, and after being good citizens for many years suddenly fell foul of the authorities. In 1979 they fled to Germany, were granted political asylum and remained in an internment camp for nine months. Dariusz, who at this point spoke only rudimentary German, learned the language and finished his baccalaureate in German.After a year reading economics, he was delighted to change to medicine at the university in Hamburg and submitted a doctorate on the biomechanics of the knee. He had to work to fund his studies and took on a variety of jobs including being a nurse and a film extra. Compulsory unpaid internships were difficult for an immigrant without independent means, so he moved to the UK, first to the military hospital in Aldershot and then to work in A&E in Glasgow, where he learned most of his English. After the usual hospital rotation, he moved to Birmingham for his general practice training and then worked for 10 years at Sherwood House.In 2008 he developed gastro-oesophageal cancer and underwent arduous and intensive treatment. The avalanche of cards and messages from staff, patients and friends kept him going through some dreadful low points, and that November he achieved his ambition to return to work. He continued to work and teach fourth-year medical students until a recurrence of cancer in March 2010. Despite further intensive treatment, he never recovered his former fitness. Forced to retire, he had intended to return to Hamburg to be near family but his disease returned swiftly and viciously and he spent the remainder of his time in Birmingham.He is survived by his father, Marian, and mother, Urszula.", "tags": ["Doctors", "NHS", "Medicine", "Poland", "Health"], "title": "Dariusz Butowski obituary"},{"date": "2011-02-10T11:08:43Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In the early eighties, Poland underwent a baby boom.

And, in 2009, Jerzy Hausner, former economy minister and deputy prime minister for Poland, threw his weight behind social enterprise when he was quoted as saying that the social economy was \"a social movement that should lead to a new vision for Poland's development,\" in a book called The Social Economy.This political support is not new. Several pieces of legislation have been introduced in the last eight years which have boost cooperatives, social enterprises and the people they help.In 2003, the Social Employment Act offered new tools to enable socially-excluded people to work. Then, in 2006 the Social Cooperatives Act came into force, encouraging a raft of new cooperatives. Additionally, coops set up by previously unemployed people receive public start up funding. Perhaps one of the biggest measures has been the introduction in 2004 of a mechanism enabling Poles to give 1% of their taxable income to a good cause of their choice.About 9 million of the country's 38 million citizens do this, which generated \u20ac92bn for Poland's social economy in 2009.When the country entered the European Union in 2004, it also benefited from the European Social Fund, re-invigorating a sector which had previously had a presence between the wars in the form of a co-operative movement.A large pot of that funding, in the form of the EQUAL programme, has now finished, although some ESF money is available until 2013. So, there is currently a mad rush to get social enterprises sustainable enough to operate more independently.Traditionally, about 20% of a Polish social enterprise's turnover is generated through 'trading', according to FISE (Foundation for Social and Economic Initiatives). Finding finance is tough, according to Magda Zawodny, the Polish representative for Social Enterprise Europe.\"Most social enterprises struggle to survive.

The Ministry for Regional Development is planning to run a loans-guarantee fund for social economy businesses, which they hope will help social enterprises to sustain themselves. The government, along with FISE and eight other NGOs, is running a project called the Integrated Scheme for Supporting Social Economy in Poland, which will create network of organisations to assist social start-ups and other social enterprises on their way to market. \"We want to improve social entrepreneurs' business skills and make the social economy stronger,\" he says. Before the year is out, we may also see a new act in Poland which could place the country as a leader in social enterprise in some respects.

The report linked the poor performance to a lack of co-ordinated support for English language teaching in rural areas. It recommended introducing new teaching methods and for additional time to be allocated to English lessons.Japan opens up to Indian teachersA major trade agreement signed between Japan and India last month is likely to make it easier for English language teachers from India to work in Japan.The pact covers trade in goods, services and investment and is expected to reduce tariffs in about 90% of trade between the two countries over the next 10 years.In return for easing export of goods and services to India, Japan has agreed to liberalise the temporary movement of English language teachers, yoga practitioners, classical music performers and chefs.Innovators take a bow at ELTons awards in LondonExcellence in English language teaching was celebrated at the annual British Council awards for innovation, better known as the ELTons, held in London in February.London-based language school United International College (UIC) was one of three recipients of the UK Award for Innovation, for its Communication Station resource incorporating radio and broadcast skills into lessons. The BBC picked up the other UK awards for two web-based learning resources, BBCe!, a bilingual radio show broadcast in Egypt, and Rinku's World, a multi-platform teaching resource for Bangladesh.Abax ELT, based in Japan, won the Cambridge ESOL International Award for Innovation for its Fiction in Action: Whodunit. The Macmillan Education Award for Innovative Writing went to Simona Petrescu, from Romania, for her proposal for a course based on human resources.Brian Abbs and Ingrid Freebairn were awarded the council's Lifetime Achievement award for their ground-breaking textbook series.Glaswegian tops 'most attractive' English pollGlaswegians have the most attractive accent for Japanese speakers of English, a study has revealed.The Glasgow accent came out on top for social attractiveness to Japanese people learning to speak English, found a survey by Northumbria University, England.Robert McKenzie, senior lecturer in sociolinguistics at the university, questioned more than 500 people to study how worldwide perceptions of the English language are changing.The six accents used were from Alabama and Ohio in America, the Glasgow dialect, Scottish standard English, moderately accented Japanese English and heavily accented Japanese English.Dr McKenzie said: \"It seems to be that globalisation, and especially the resultant worldwide spread of English-language media, are influencing non-native perceptions of the qualities associated with various forms of spoken English.\"Max de Lotbinieremax.delotbiniere@theguardian.com", "tags": ["Tefl", "Higher education"], "title": "UK universities set to lose $1.6bn from student visa cut"},{"date": "2011-02-10T11:08:43Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In the early eighties, Poland underwent a baby boom.

Compulsory unpaid internships were difficult for an immigrant without independent means, so he moved to the UK, first to the military hospital in Aldershot and then to work in A&E in Glasgow, where he learned most of his English. After the usual hospital rotation, he moved to Birmingham for his general practice training and then worked for 10 years at Sherwood House.In 2008 he developed gastro-oesophageal cancer and underwent arduous and intensive treatment. The avalanche of cards and messages from staff, patients and friends kept him going through some dreadful low points, and that November he achieved his ambition to return to work. He continued to work and teach fourth-year medical students until a recurrence of cancer in March 2010. Despite further intensive treatment, he never recovered his former fitness. Forced to retire, he had intended to return to Hamburg to be near family but his disease returned swiftly and viciously and he spent the remainder of his time in Birmingham.He is survived by his father, Marian, and mother, Urszula.", "tags": ["Doctors", "NHS", "Medicine", "Poland", "Health"], "title": "Dariusz Butowski obituary"},{"date": "2011-02-21T00:05:10Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Your article (Polish MEP and gay rights critic fights to lead David Cameron's allies in Europe, 17 February) caricatures MEP Ryszard Legutko in a deeply unfair manner.

The report linked the poor performance to a lack of co-ordinated support for English language teaching in rural areas. It recommended introducing new teaching methods and for additional time to be allocated to English lessons.Japan opens up to Indian teachersA major trade agreement signed between Japan and India last month is likely to make it easier for English language teachers from India to work in Japan.The pact covers trade in goods, services and investment and is expected to reduce tariffs in about 90% of trade between the two countries over the next 10 years.In return for easing export of goods and services to India, Japan has agreed to liberalise the temporary movement of English language teachers, yoga practitioners, classical music performers and chefs.Innovators take a bow at ELTons awards in LondonExcellence in English language teaching was celebrated at the annual British Council awards for innovation, better known as the ELTons, held in London in February.London-based language school United International College (UIC) was one of three recipients of the UK Award for Innovation, for its Communication Station resource incorporating radio and broadcast skills into lessons. The BBC picked up the other UK awards for two web-based learning resources, BBCe!, a bilingual radio show broadcast in Egypt, and Rinku's World, a multi-platform teaching resource for Bangladesh.Abax ELT, based in Japan, won the Cambridge ESOL International Award for Innovation for its Fiction in Action: Whodunit.

Salem Gnan, a London-based spokesman for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, says eyewitnesses in Tripoli have told him the navy has opened fire on parts of the capital.\u2022 Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, \"may have gone to Venezuela\", British foreign secretary William Hague has said. But sources in the Venezuelan government denied the reports.\u2022 Two Libyan fighter jets and two civilian helicopters have landed in Malta.\u2022 Elsewhere in the Middle East, the Bahrain grand prix has been cancelled because of anti-government protests there. And five people are dead after riots in Morocco.Follow this live blog for continuing coverage into the evening.5.59pm: Salem Gnan, a London-based spokesman for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, says eyewitnesses in Tripoli have told him the navy has opened fire on parts of the capital.We have just heard that the military ships are bombing an area in Tripoli and many people have been killed although we don't know how many at the moment because people have just called to tell us it is happening.Gnan said the navy appeared to be bombing a residential area outside the city centre as part of a desperate crackdown by Gaddafi's troops.He is even turning the ships on his people now. His plan is to use absolutely everything he can to stop what is happening.Gnan said he had had also had reports of ongoing shooting around Gaddafi's residence in Tripoli and said more people were taking to the capital's streets as darkness fell. \"This is going on because if it stops that means it is finished. This will be the last act.\" He said people were travelling to Tripoli from across the west of Libya for a \"final showdown.\"I have had calls from people in towns and cities all across Libya. Those in the east can not get out but those in towns and cities in western Libya, everybody is saying: \"We are going to Tripoli.\" The plan is to come from everywhere and go to Tripoli to sack the city, for the finish.6.04pm: Our Middle East editor Ian Black has been looking at reports that Libyan diplomats are deserting the regime. We are preparing it for publication now, but here's an extractLibyan diplomats are voting with their feet as the country's crisis deepens, with ambassadors resigning their positions in China, India, Indonesia, Poland as well as from the Arab League in Cairo.But Omar Jelban, head of the London People's Bureau, on Monday flatly denied an al-Jazeera report that he had quit. Jelban was earlier called into the Foreign Office to hear what William Hague called \"our absolute condemnation of the use of lethal force against demonstrators.\"Australia also summoned the Libyan envoy to protest at the bloodshed.Libya's deputy UN ambassador told the BBC that \"all the Libyan people want Gaddafi to go.\" Other members of Libya's UN mission said they were quitting to support anti-government protesters. \"We are aware that this will put our families back home in danger, but they are in danger anyway,\" said Adam Tarbah.In New Delhi Ali al-Essawi accused his own government of deploying foreign mercenaries against the protesters.Three local employees of the Libyan embassy in Stockholm, Sweden said they had quit in protest. \"It would be hypocritical to assist the Libyan government while we see them attacking people in the streets,\" said Sayed Jalabi.6.08pm: Reuters says the UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon held talks with Muammar Gaddafi on Monday, during which he condemned the escalating violence in Libya and told him it \"must stop immediately,\" A UN spokesman said: The secretary general expressed deep concern at the escalating scale of violence and emphasised that it must stop immediately. He reiterated his call for respect for basic freedoms and human rights, including peaceful assembly and informationThe secretary general underlined the need to ensure the protection of the civilian population under any circumstances. He urged all parties to exercise restraint and called upon the authorities to engage in broad-based dialogue to address legitimate concerns of the population.6.17pm: Reuters is reporting that 160 people have died in Tripoli, citing a television channel in the Gulf, although the figure has not yet been independently verified.Clashes in the Libyan capital Tripoli on Monday have left 160 people dead, Arabiya television quoted eyewitnesses as saying.The Arab satellite channel gave the number in a newsflash, without providing further details. 6.19pm: Libya dominated the headlines on the BBC six o'clock news, which reported: \"Libya is burning, and the fire has spread\".In the absence of a team on the ground, like other news organisations, the BBC showed footage from Youtube of the uprising on streets of Tripoli and in other cities.Reporting from Tunisia, the BBC's Ian Pannell said that Muammar Gaddafi's son, Saif, had made a \"bizarre and rambling\" speech in the early hours of the morning on state television \"blaming drug addicts and even the BBC.\"The channel also carried a segment from a short interview in Cairo with the Prime Minister, David Cameron, in which he said that condemned the violence of the Libyan regime and said that aspirations for greater rights should be met with reform.6.27pm: Signs that the Gaddafi regime is being abandoned by key officials are growing. They include Libya's entire delegation at the United Nations. The Associated Press news agency reported:Libya's ambassadors at the United Nations are calling for leader Muammar Gaddafi to step down as the country's ruler.Deputy Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi said Monday that if Gaddafi does not relinquish power, \"the Libyan people will get rid of him.\"Dabbashi urged the international community to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent mercenaries, weapons and other supplies from reaching Gaddafi and his security forces.Dabbashi also said he was not resigning.The diplomat says the Libyan delegation is also urging the International Criminal Court to investigate possible crimes against humanity committed against the Libyan people during the current protests. 6.33pm: The Associated Press news agency has filed some further interesting detail about an apparent defection by the pilots of Libyan airforce jets, which landed earlier in Malta.Two Libyan air force jets have arrived in Malta and military officials say their pilots have asked for political asylum amid a bloody crackdown on anti-government protesters in Libya.The two Mirage jets arrived Monday shortly after two civilian helicopters landed at the airport carrying seven people who said they were French.A military source familiar with the situation said the jet pilots, Libyan air force colonels, were allowed to land after they communicated from the air that they wanted asylum. They had left from a base near Tripoli and had flown low over Libyan airspace to avoid detection.The aircraft remain at Malta's airport while the pilots and helicopter passengers are being questioned by airport immigration officials. 6.38pm: After William Hague said earlier that he had seen information suggesting that Muammar Gaddafi had fled to Venezuela, Libyan state television has carried a denial that he has fled.The Libyan deputy foreign minister, Khalid Kayem, said: \"This news is groundless. It has no basis.\"6.53pm: The two Libyan Air Force fighter pilots who apparently defected earlier with their jets to Malta have told Maltese government officials that they had been ordered to bomb protesters, Reuters reports.7.04pm: An interesting development in London. Krishnan Guru-Murthy of Channel 4 news has just tweeted that the Libyan embassy in London has replaced the official national flag with the pre-Gaddafi era version, favoured by many of those involved in the current uprising.However, my colleague Amelia Hill spoke earlier to the Libyan ambassador, who insisted that he still held the post.While he made no mention of Gaddafi, Omar Jelbam told her: \"I am still the ambassador. I am still in control. There have been no defections from the Embassy. It is a lie started by the BBC, by a woman who used to work here.\"7.16pm: It remains very difficult to get a sense of what is happening on the ground in Libya, but many reports suggest that the violence is intensifying.Reuters has filed this report about claims that anti-government activists and others in Tripoli are being hit from the air:Tripoli residents gave conflicting reports on Monday, with some saying they could hear gunfire in the Libyan capital and a political activist telling Al Jazeera warplanes were bombing the city.\"We don't know what is going on, all we can hear are occasional gunshots,\" one resident who lives near the city's central Green Square told Reuters.\"I just hear gunshots sometimes. I am at home guarding my family because the situation is unstable. No one knows what will happen,\" another resident said.But Adel Mohamed Saleh, who called himself a political activist in Tripoli, said the aerial bombing had initially targeted a funeral procession.\"What we are witnessing today is unimaginable. Warplanes and helicopters are indiscriminately bombing one area after another. There are many, many dead,\" Saleh told al Jazeera television in a live broadcast.\"Our people are dying. It is the policy of scorched earth.\" he said. \"Every 20 minutes they are bombing.\"Asked if the attacks were still happening he said: \"It is continuing, it is continuing. Anyone who moves, even if they are in their car they will hit you.\"There was no independent verification of the report but Fathi al-Warfali, the Libyan activist who heads the Swiss-based Libyan Committee for Truth and Justice, who was taking part in a protest outside U.N. European headquarters in Geneva said he had heard the same reports.\"Military planes are attacking civilians, protesters in Tripoli now. The civilians are frightened,\" al-Warfali told Reuters. 7.24pm: A friend of the Libyan novelist Hisham Matar has passed on some details to the Guardian of what he has been seeing and hearing in Tripoli in the last few hours.He tells us that eight large carrier helicopters were spotted dropping ammunition from the south of Tripoli to Khamis Military facility in the North East side of Tripoli and passed on unconfirmed rumours that two helicopters had actually been brought down after coming under fire elsewhere.The man, who will just refer to as 'Ahmed', added:Though interrupted and random; gunfire remains to be heard in Tripoli with the occasional loud sound of what could be bomb sounds.Around residential areas (understandably) the city roads are completely absent of civilians \u2013 everyone is huddled at home or just in front of their houses to avoid possible confrontation with the regime.Shops are shut and mosques are hardly attended during prayer times.7.38pm: The BBC have just carried an interview with Libyans in Manchester who have taken to the streets there, as in Liverpool and other parts of the north of England, in solidarity with those opposing the regime in Libya.\"There are no other words to describe what is happening in Libya but genocide,\" said one.\"What we are witnessing is genocide and it will be recorded in history as that.\"Another man, identified as Mohamed Abdul Malek, said many Libyans in the UK were looking forward to going home in order to help \"build democracy\".Further protests are planned in the UK for Tuesday, according to the BBC, with many Libyans planning to travel down to London from the north.7.55pm: Through contacts, I've just talked on the phone with one of the organisers in Cairo of a convoy of medical supplies destined for the eastern part of Libya.He told me that the convoy, which was organised in conjunction with the Arab doctor's syndicate, the Red Crescent and Libyans living in Egypt, has just departed in the last couple of hours carrying antibiotics, needles and other supplies.It is made up of five ambulance and 30 doctors, according to the man, an engineer with relatives in Libya, who told me: \"The hospital system in the east of Libya and in other parts is collapsing.\"He added: \"The Egyptian government have been very good and have done everything to help facilitate us but we are worried that it is proving difficult to get across the border on the western side of Libya from Tunisia.\"7.59pm: We've heard about European countries who have sent planes and ferries to Libya to evacuate their citizens, including many employees of international oil companies.However, other foreigners awaiting evacuation from Libya include thousands of Turkish workers who have taken refuge inside a football stadium in the eastern city of Benghazi from where they heard gunfire and explosions through the night, according to reports.Speaking in Ankara earlier today, Turkey's Foreign Trade Minister Zafer Caglayan said looters had attacked Turkish companies, which have projects in Libya worth more than $15 billion, and officials estimated there were 25,000 Turks working there.Reuters also carried quotes from Hidir Yentur, a logistics manager with a construction company in Al Bayda, eastern Libya, who said workers were forced to move to a safer place after their site was stormed by looters.\"A group attacked our construction site and took computers, but they didn't do anything to us. Our water is running low,\" Yentur told the news agency by telephone from Libya.8.05pm: And now to some comments on Libya from another political leader facing problems of his own, Silvio Berlusconi.The Italian president has enjoyed a close relationship with Muammar Gaddafi and was the subject of intense criticism over the weekend for failing to condemn violence in Libya, when he said he had not called the Libyan leader because he did not want to \"disturb\" him during the revolt.Now, Reuters reports that Berlusconi appears to be changing his tune:Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Monday condemned violence by Libyan forces against civilians as \"unacceptable\" and said he was \"alarmed\" over the situation in the North African state.The statement by Berlusconi, who has cultivated close ties with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, comes after he was criticised widely for not speaking up earlier on Libya and saying that he did not want to \"disturb\" Gaddafi during the crisis.Berlusconi also called on the European Union and the international community to do everything to prevent the situation in Libya from degenerating into a civil war. 8.15pm: BBC news have been carrying an interview with Libya's deputy ambassador to the UN. Ibrahim Omar Al Dabashi said Gaddafi's government was carrying out a genocide:The regime is killing whoever gets out to the street. He (Gaddafi) has his mercenaries everywhere on the streets and whenever any demonstrator appears they just kill them.8.26pm: The Guardian's Middle East Editor, Ian Black, has put together this piece about Muammar Gaddafi's \"famously fractious\" family based on the insights provided by the US diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks.They include US assessments of his son Saif al-Islam, who vowed in a television address last night to \"eradicate enemies\" and warned that the regime would fight on until the last bullet.8.31pm: There is also more on Saif, whose LSE education and links to the UK have come under the spotlight, elsewhere on guardian.co.uk. Ian Cobain, Amelia Hill and Kartik Mehta have put together this portrait of \"the man the west can no longer deal with\".8.49pm: On Twitter, Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi is continuing to emerge as one of the 'must follow' tweeters on the Libyan uprising.A great monitor and interpreter of the Arab world's media, he's been tweeting here about reports that the regime has been stopping citizens in Tripoli from donating blood to injured demonstrators.After the apparent defections earlier in the day of two jet figher pilots who landed in Malta, he has also picked up on reports that military pilots have landed in the Libyan city of Benghazi after refusing orders to bomb it.9.06pm: An interesting development from an unlikely source: the Egyptian Army's Facebook page. It reportedly says that Libyan guards have now withdrawn from the border with Egypt.Does that mean it's going to be easier for refugees to flee? Or even for medical supplies to get in? This could be good news for that convoy we mentioned earlier.9.19pm: This could be a particularly ominous development however. Libyan airspace has been closed, the Austrian Army is saying.One of its transport planes, with some 60 European Union citizens onboard, is believed to be stranded in Tripoli at the moment.\"The entire airspace is currently blocked,\" an Austrian Defence Ministry employee told the German Press Agency dpa.9.22pm: A prominent Egyptian cleric, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, has called for a fatwa against Muammar Gaddafi.He made a public statement tonight that any Libyan soldier who has the opportunity should shoot and kill the Libyan leader.Al-Qaradawi might be familiar to many in Britain. The government was criticised back in 2008 by moderate Muslim groups after it banned him from entering Britain and branded him an extremist.Qaradawi (above), who was banned from entering the United States, had previously visited the UK in 2004 at the invitation of the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, sparking protests from Jewish groups and gay people, who regard him as anti-Semitic and homophobic.However, he is also arguably the most influential Sunni Muslim cleric in the world and has regularly spoken in the past in support of democracy.9.36pm: Here is another development on those suggestions earlier that Gaddafi could be on the verge of seeking a bolt-hole on the other side of the world, in Venezuela. Reuters reports:Both Libya and Venezuela on Monday denied reports that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was seeking asylum as a violent revolt gripped his country and would join his friend President Hugo Chavez in the South American oil producing nation.Fueling rumors in the media, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he had seen information to suggest Gaddafi had fled Libya and was on his way to Venezuela, a fellow OPEC member.But Venezuela's information minister said Gaddafi, who has ruled Libya for more than 40 years, was not coming.\"He is not traveling to Venezuela,\" Information Minister Andres Izarra told Reuters in Caracas.His comments were matched by the Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Kayem, who said the reports were \"groundless.\"Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said in a statement he had spoken by telephone to his Libyan counterpart Moussa Koussa, who told him Gaddafi was still in Tripoli. 9.41pm: OK. This is potentially big news. Al Arabiya is reporting that a speech by Gaddafi is imminent. We'll keep you updated on that.9.53pm: There are no details yet on what Gaddafi might say. That it is Muammar Gaddafi to speak, rather than his son Saif al-Islam who did so last night, suggests this could be an important announcement.10.10pm: Here is a summary of events today:\u2022  Al Arabiya is reporting that Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, is to give a televised address tonight. There are no details yet on the content of the speech or whether or not it will be live.\u2022 UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has condemned the escalating violence in Libya and told Muammar Gaddafi it \"must stop immediately\".  Silvio Berlusconi has joined international condemnation describing violent against civilians as \"unacceptable\" and said he was \"alarmed\".\u2022  Libya's ambassadors at the United Nations are calling for leader Muammar Gaddafi to step down as the country's ruler.  Libyan ambassadors have aldo resigned in China, India, Indonesia and Poland. \u2022 There are reports that Muammar Gaddafi ordered fighter jets to attack parts of the capital, Tripoli, and live rounds have been used on the streets. The death toll passed 250 after six days of unrest but this is a conservative estimate. Al-Jazeera quoted medical sources in Tripoli saying 61 people had died in the latest protests there.\u2022 Reports which originated from British foreign secretary William Hague that Muammar Gaddafi \"may have gone to Venezuela\" have been denied. The Libyan deputy foreign minister, Khalid Kayem, said: \"This news is groundless. It has no basis.\"\u2022 Two Libyan fighter jets and two civilian helicopters have landed in Malta. The fighter pilots, Libyan colonels, have asked for political asylum after apparently refusing to bomb protesters.\u2022 Elsewhere in the Middle East, the Bahrain grand prix has been cancelled because of anti-government protests there. And five people are dead after riots in Morocco.10.18pm: On earlier reports that Gaddafi was on his way to Venezuela, Rory Carroll in Caracas writes:William Hague's announcement that Gaddafi was possibly en route to Venezuela caused consternation in Caracas, with foreign diplomats and government officials scrambling for verification until the claim was officially denied.President Hugo Chavez's close ties to Libya's leader gave the rumour credibility, prompting images of Gaddafi retiring to a Caribbean bolthole, but within hours Venezuela's government issued a strong denial.The information minister, Andres Izarra, declared the claim \"false\" and later the foreign minister, Nicolas Maduro, issued a statement calling Hague's comment \"irresponsible\".Maduro said he had spoken by phone with his Libyan counterpart, Moussa Koussa, and confirmed that Gaddafi remained in Tripoli \"exercising the powers given to him by the state and addressing the situation in the country, thereby refuting the comments made to the press in an irresponsible manner by British Foreign Secretary William Hague\".The carefully worded statement skated between Chavez's alliance with Gaddafi and the rapidly unfolding events in Libya, referring to the \"historic friendship\" between the two countries and expressing hope of a peaceful solution to Libya's \"difficulties\" without \"imperialist interference\" from outsiders.The statement did not rule out the possibility that Gaddafi could end up in Venezuela but analysts said the prospect seemed doubtful given the potential damage to Chavez's image. Venezuela's president was understood to be closely following events in north Africa from his tactical \"situation room\" in Miraflores palace.10.23pm: There's further criticism of violence against civilians in Libya tonight. US secretary of state Hilary Clinton condemned the violence and said the Libya government must respect Libyan's universal rights.This comes as Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, has gone on state TV to deny aircraft have bombed populated areas in Tripoli and Benghazi. He says the targets were ammunition depots in remote areas.10.32pm: If Muammar Gaddafi stands down in the near future \u2013 and there's no immediate suggestion he will \u2013 it's not immediately clear who would succeed him. With Gaddafi's 41-year rule looking increasing fragile, the Guardian's Middle East editor, Ian Black, has looked at who might take over.He says until recently academics, analysts and diplomats agreed Gaddafi's most likely heirs were his sons, primarily the reformist-minded Saif al-Islam. But he says that option appears to have disappeared after Saif's TV address warning of \"civil war\".Takeover by the army also looks unlikely while civil society is virtually non-existent and the business sector still young and weak, he writes. Read the full analysis here.10.39pm: While we're waiting for Gaddafi to turn up (or not) on our screens, here's a taste of how the ripples from Libya are being felt on other continents, principally on the markets.Reuters reportsLatin American stocks fell off a two-week high on Monday as an increasingly bloody power struggle in Libya stoked concerns a spike in oil prices could weigh on economies around the world.Analysts were hesitant to read too much into Monday's drop, since a U.S. market holiday crimped volume.The spiraling violence in Libya sent Brent crude oil prices to $108 a barrel for the first time since 2008, reviving concerns that unrest in the Middle East could produce a spike in oil prices that might weigh on economic growth around the world.\"We could see markets trading this week in function of what happens in the Middle East,\" said Juan Jose Resendiz, an analyst at brokerage Arka in Mexico City.Further turmoil on the markets is also forecast for tomorrow:Asian stocks look set to come under pressure on Tuesday, as turmoil across the Middle East sends oil prices sharply higher and investors shied away from riskier assets such as equities.Investors were following reports of escalating violence in Libya with protests sweeping the capital Tripoli and anti-government forces reportedly taking control of the city of Benghazi.Brent crude futures hit $108 a barrel for the first time since 2008 on fears the violence might lead to supply disruptions.Asian markets will have no U.S. lead, as Wall Street was closed on Monday for a public holiday.British shares fell 1.1 percent while European shares dropped 1.3 percent as the Libyan violence made markets skittish, with volumes thinned by the U.S. holiday.The euro slipped on risk aversion, but hawkish comments on inflation from euro zone officials limited losses, while the U.S. dollar and yen gained on safe-haven buying.Japanese markets will likely fall, with Nikkei futures last trading in Osaka at 10,830, a 27.5 point discount to the index close on Monday.Australian stocks may make a flat start, with share price index futures up 3 points to 4,898, unchanged from the close of the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index.10.43pm: In the absence, thus far, of his father, here is some more on what Saif Gadaffi has been saying on television tonight.He claimed that air raids earlier tonight targeted ammunition depots and not populated areas in Tripoli and Benghanzi.\"There is no truth to information about a raid by the armed forces against Tripoli and Benghazi,\" Libyan television quoted Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as telling the official Jana news agency.\"The raid targeted ammunitions depots in areas remote from inhabited areas,\" added Saif.10.50pm: Another potentially significant development, if true. Sultan Al Qassemi has just tweeted that Al Jazeera are reporting on a statement by Libyan Military Officers which asks all members of the Libyan army to head to Tripoli and remove Gaddafi.10.54pm: The story of those two Libyan air force pilots who apparently defected earlier to Malta is becoming ever more fascinating.Al Jazeera has spoken to one of its correspondents on the island, who said the pilots have claimed they came so close to carrying out their mission to bomb anti-Gadaffi demonstrators that they could see the crowds on the ground.They have reportedly passed on \"classified\" information about the movements and actions of the Libyan military to Malta.Eric Montfort, a journalist on the island, has been in touch with the Guardian to tell us that the Mirage fighters which apparently defected to Malta are among the most prized in Libya's fighter plane force. Earlier in the afternoon there were also demonstrations in front of the Libyan Embassy at Balzan, Malta, where two embassy workers defected and joined the crowd.10.59pm: Back in London, it appears that it was a demonstrator outside the Libyan embassy who removed the country's current flag (as we reported earlier) and replaced it with an older pre-Gadaffi version.Staff at the embassy are said to have removed the flag now however.11.34pm: Reuters is reporting that Libyan state TV says Muammar Gaddafi is to \"speak soon\". Earlier it was Al Arabiya which was reporting that he was to speak \"imminently\". That was two hours ago. It is now 1.35am in Tripoli.11.43pm: The former British foreign secretary Lord Owen has tonight called on the UN and regional powers to enforce a no fly zone over Libya. He said: The UN Security Council should meet in emergency session tonight and declare the situation in Libya as a threat to peace under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and declare a no flight zone for the Libyan airforce and ask the regional power, Nato, to enforce it from dawn tomorrow.And hopefully other Arab nations, particularly Egypt, might decide to participate to demonstrate that this is not just a Western initiative.He also called on \"airforces in the region with sufficient range to reach Libya to prevent any Libyan airforce military action against civilians\".11.51pm: Here's the first details of the Muammar Gaddafi statement, which has not yet been broadcast. Reuters reports: Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi will refute in an interview with state television on Tuesday \"malicious rumours that have been broadcast\", state TV said. It reported earlier that Gaddafi would \"speak soon\". 12.10am: Libyan state TV suddenly cut a few minutes ago to footage of Muammar Gaddafi.\"I am in Tripoli and not in Venezuela,\" he said, according to a BBC translation of what was just a few seconds of footage.12.16am: Some more details of that footage of Gaddafi that has appeared on Libyan state TV. True to his eccentric reputation, he was carrying an umbrella and appeared to be sitting in a back of a car wearing a winter hat with ear flaps.12.20am: Some more on what Gadaffi said. He urged Libyans not to believe television channels, which he called 'dogs'.He went on to say that he wanted to go to Green Square and 'yishar' (spend the evening) with the youth there, but for the rain.12.45am: We've carried out an interview in the last hour with a contact in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, which appears destined to go down in history as the root of this uprising.A Libyan man who spent a number of years in the UK before five years ago to his home city said that the people were now largely control of Benghazi and that the army had fled.More than 350 people have been killed, he said, while adding that this death toll did not include the grim discovery made inside the army garrison headquarters by those who entered it following its surrender.\"We found 150 corpses burning and we believe they were the bodies of officers and soldiers who refused to follow orders to fire on the the people,\" he said.It has been largely quiet in the city since about 10 o'clock last night, he said, although citizens had been bracing themselves for an air strike that Arabic television channels had reported was on the way.Fears of this were calmed partially after two Libyan pilots landed their jets and said they had refused orders to bomb the city, instead choosing to jettison their bombs in the sea.\"I never believed that I would see this day. The atmosphere here has changed completely,\" he said.We're going to wrap up out blog for now, but join us again in a few hours for further coverage of events in Libya.", "tags": ["Arab and Middle East unrest", "World news", "Libya", "Bahrain", "Africa"], "title": "Libya in crisis -Monday 21 February "},{"date": "2011-02-10T11:08:43Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In the early eighties, Poland underwent a baby boom. It's this generation, now entering its thirties, which is driving the country's social enterprise sector.\"Those born when the country was still under communist regime are keen to set up their own businesses which fit within the social economy,\" says Andy Churchill, CEO of a UK social enterprise support organisation, Merseyside Network for Europe which shares best practice with Poland.\"Being a post-communist country, Poland is eager to develop a strong civic society and avoid the extremes of capitalism and communism, and social enterprise is seen as perhaps the key to 'a different way'. In the second half of 2011, Poland will have the EU presidency, just as the negotiations for the European programmes for 2014-2020 reach a key point, so the influence of Polish ideas, and the social economy could impact on what happens across Europe,\" he adds. There is strong political support for social enterprise in Poland. At the country's last major three-day NGO conference, political leaders were very engaged with the issues, according to the sector. And, in 2009, Jerzy Hausner, former economy minister and deputy prime minister for Poland, threw his weight behind social enterprise when he was quoted as saying that the social economy was \"a social movement that should lead to a new vision for Poland's development,\" in a book called The Social Economy.This political support is not new. Several pieces of legislation have been introduced in the last eight years which have boost cooperatives, social enterprises and the people they help.In 2003, the Social Employment Act offered new tools to enable socially-excluded people to work. Then, in 2006 the Social Cooperatives Act came into force, encouraging a raft of new cooperatives. Additionally, coops set up by previously unemployed people receive public start up funding. Perhaps one of the biggest measures has been the introduction in 2004 of a mechanism enabling Poles to give 1% of their taxable income to a good cause of their choice.About 9 million of the country's 38 million citizens do this, which generated \u20ac92bn for Poland's social economy in 2009.When the country entered the European Union in 2004, it also benefited from the European Social Fund, re-invigorating a sector which had previously had a presence between the wars in the form of a co-operative movement.A large pot of that funding, in the form of the EQUAL programme, has now finished, although some ESF money is available until 2013. So, there is currently a mad rush to get social enterprises sustainable enough to operate more independently.Traditionally, about 20% of a Polish social enterprise's turnover is generated through 'trading', according to FISE (Foundation for Social and Economic Initiatives). Finding finance is tough, according to Magda Zawodny, the Polish representative for Social Enterprise Europe.\"Most social enterprises struggle to survive. They have many problems, such as difficulties with obtaining funding and loans - we do not have ethical banks yet, like in the UK,\" she explains. Help could be on its way, according to Krzysztof Cibor, spokesperson for FISE. The Ministry for Regional Development is planning to run a loans-guarantee fund for social economy businesses, which they hope will help social enterprises to sustain themselves. The government, along with FISE and eight other NGOs, is running a project called the Integrated Scheme for Supporting Social Economy in Poland, which will create network of organisations to assist social start-ups and other social enterprises on their way to market. \"We want to improve social entrepreneurs' business skills and make the social economy stronger,\" he says. Before the year is out, we may also see a new act in Poland which could place the country as a leader in social enterprise in some respects. FISE and its partners are lobbying hard for a Social Entrepreneurship Act, which proposes a number of measures including a strengthening of the importance of social performance clauses in public procurement contracts. They say the social enterprise share of the one percent tax is low, and they want to see mainstream companies taxed and the money given to social enterprises, as well as other tax breaks.

And the road from Darlington to Middlesbrough goes by a mysterious new town called Chishmy.The latter name, when Googled, turns out to belong to a town with a pretty Orthodox-looking church in the Republic of Bashkortostan on the southern fringes of the Russian Federation. Chishmy lies 40 miles west of Bashkortostan's capital, Ufa.The new places the Chinese have added to Britain are, in fact, foreign towns and cities that have somehow slipped across the globe.Bashmakova, for example, sits astride a main railway line 300 miles south-east of Moscow. The real Ostrow Wielkopolski lies south of Poznan and west of Lodz.More difficult to explain is the new London neighbourhood of Unk, which apparently lies on a bend in the river Thames beside Richmond Park. It does, at least, have some natural twin towns dotted around the world as Map World places another Unk in Spain, four in Australia, three in Africa and two in Latin America.Google Maps registers only three Unks. Two lie just 30 miles apart in Iranian Kurdistan and in the Iraqi province of Suleiminya. The third is a cul-de-sac near the airport in the Liberian capital of Monrovia.These are not the only mistakes. Not far from Tyneside, you'll find the previously unknown English towns of Almenevo and Mar'yanovka.But sensitive Britons should not feel they have been singled out. Spaniards have discovered that the north-western port of Ferrol has been returned to the days of General Francisco Franco, Spain's dictator or \"caudillo\". He had his birthplace renamed El Ferrol del Caudillo. That name was removed in 1982 but remains on Map World.Map World launched on Tuesday after a three-month trial. About 30 million users had visited in that time, according to Min Yiren, the deputy director of China's State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping.\"We'll make greater efforts to build Map World into an international brand,\" Yiren said, according to People's Daily Online.Map World contains 11m place names.

The family lived close to the Gdansk shipyards in the early years of Solidarity, and after being good citizens for many years suddenly fell foul of the authorities. In 1979 they fled to Germany, were granted political asylum and remained in an internment camp for nine months. Dariusz, who at this point spoke only rudimentary German, learned the language and finished his baccalaureate in German.After a year reading economics, he was delighted to change to medicine at the university in Hamburg and submitted a doctorate on the biomechanics of the knee. He had to work to fund his studies and took on a variety of jobs including being a nurse and a film extra. Compulsory unpaid internships were difficult for an immigrant without independent means, so he moved to the UK, first to the military hospital in Aldershot and then to work in A&E in Glasgow, where he learned most of his English. After the usual hospital rotation, he moved to Birmingham for his general practice training and then worked for 10 years at Sherwood House.In 2008 he developed gastro-oesophageal cancer and underwent arduous and intensive treatment. The avalanche of cards and messages from staff, patients and friends kept him going through some dreadful low points, and that November he achieved his ambition to return to work. He continued to work and teach fourth-year medical students until a recurrence of cancer in March 2010. Despite further intensive treatment, he never recovered his former fitness.

The report linked the poor performance to a lack of co-ordinated support for English language teaching in rural areas. It recommended introducing new teaching methods and for additional time to be allocated to English lessons.Japan opens up to Indian teachersA major trade agreement signed between Japan and India last month is likely to make it easier for English language teachers from India to work in Japan.The pact covers trade in goods, services and investment and is expected to reduce tariffs in about 90% of trade between the two countries over the next 10 years.In return for easing export of goods and services to India, Japan has agreed to liberalise the temporary movement of English language teachers, yoga practitioners, classical music performers and chefs.Innovators take a bow at ELTons awards in LondonExcellence in English language teaching was celebrated at the annual British Council awards for innovation, better known as the ELTons, held in London in February.London-based language school United International College (UIC) was one of three recipients of the UK Award for Innovation, for its Communication Station resource incorporating radio and broadcast skills into lessons. The BBC picked up the other UK awards for two web-based learning resources, BBCe!, a bilingual radio show broadcast in Egypt, and Rinku's World, a multi-platform teaching resource for Bangladesh.Abax ELT, based in Japan, won the Cambridge ESOL International Award for Innovation for its Fiction in Action: Whodunit.

His plan is to use absolutely everything he can to stop what is happening.Gnan said he had had also had reports of ongoing shooting around Gaddafi's residence in Tripoli and said more people were taking to the capital's streets as darkness fell. \"This is going on because if it stops that means it is finished. This will be the last act.\" He said people were travelling to Tripoli from across the west of Libya for a \"final showdown.\"I have had calls from people in towns and cities all across Libya. Those in the east can not get out but those in towns and cities in western Libya, everybody is saying: \"We are going to Tripoli.\" The plan is to come from everywhere and go to Tripoli to sack the city, for the finish.6.04pm: Our Middle East editor Ian Black has been looking at reports that Libyan diplomats are deserting the regime. We are preparing it for publication now, but here's an extractLibyan diplomats are voting with their feet as the country's crisis deepens, with ambassadors resigning their positions in China, India, Indonesia, Poland as well as from the Arab League in Cairo.But Omar Jelban, head of the London People's Bureau, on Monday flatly denied an al-Jazeera report that he had quit. Jelban was earlier called into the Foreign Office to hear what William Hague called \"our absolute condemnation of the use of lethal force against demonstrators.\"Australia also summoned the Libyan envoy to protest at the bloodshed.Libya's deputy UN ambassador told the BBC that \"all the Libyan people want Gaddafi to go.\" Other members of Libya's UN mission said they were quitting to support anti-government protesters. \"We are aware that this will put our families back home in danger, but they are in danger anyway,\" said Adam Tarbah.In New Delhi Ali al-Essawi accused his own government of deploying foreign mercenaries against the protesters.Three local employees of the Libyan embassy in Stockholm, Sweden said they had quit in protest. \"It would be hypocritical to assist the Libyan government while we see them attacking people in the streets,\" said Sayed Jalabi.6.08pm: Reuters says the UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon held talks with Muammar Gaddafi on Monday, during which he condemned the escalating violence in Libya and told him it \"must stop immediately,\" A UN spokesman said: The secretary general expressed deep concern at the escalating scale of violence and emphasised that it must stop immediately. He reiterated his call for respect for basic freedoms and human rights, including peaceful assembly and informationThe secretary general underlined the need to ensure the protection of the civilian population under any circumstances. He urged all parties to exercise restraint and called upon the authorities to engage in broad-based dialogue to address legitimate concerns of the population.6.17pm: Reuters is reporting that 160 people have died in Tripoli, citing a television channel in the Gulf, although the figure has not yet been independently verified.Clashes in the Libyan capital Tripoli on Monday have left 160 people dead, Arabiya television quoted eyewitnesses as saying.The Arab satellite channel gave the number in a newsflash, without providing further details. 6.19pm: Libya dominated the headlines on the BBC six o'clock news, which reported: \"Libya is burning, and the fire has spread\".In the absence of a team on the ground, like other news organisations, the BBC showed footage from Youtube of the uprising on streets of Tripoli and in other cities.Reporting from Tunisia, the BBC's Ian Pannell said that Muammar Gaddafi's son, Saif, had made a \"bizarre and rambling\" speech in the early hours of the morning on state television \"blaming drug addicts and even the BBC.\"The channel also carried a segment from a short interview in Cairo with the Prime Minister, David Cameron, in which he said that condemned the violence of the Libyan regime and said that aspirations for greater rights should be met with reform.6.27pm: Signs that the Gaddafi regime is being abandoned by key officials are growing. They include Libya's entire delegation at the United Nations. The Associated Press news agency reported:Libya's ambassadors at the United Nations are calling for leader Muammar Gaddafi to step down as the country's ruler.Deputy Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi said Monday that if Gaddafi does not relinquish power, \"the Libyan people will get rid of him.\"Dabbashi urged the international community to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent mercenaries, weapons and other supplies from reaching Gaddafi and his security forces.Dabbashi also said he was not resigning.The diplomat says the Libyan delegation is also urging the International Criminal Court to investigate possible crimes against humanity committed against the Libyan people during the current protests. 6.33pm: The Associated Press news agency has filed some further interesting detail about an apparent defection by the pilots of Libyan airforce jets, which landed earlier in Malta.Two Libyan air force jets have arrived in Malta and military officials say their pilots have asked for political asylum amid a bloody crackdown on anti-government protesters in Libya.The two Mirage jets arrived Monday shortly after two civilian helicopters landed at the airport carrying seven people who said they were French.A military source familiar with the situation said the jet pilots, Libyan air force colonels, were allowed to land after they communicated from the air that they wanted asylum. They had left from a base near Tripoli and had flown low over Libyan airspace to avoid detection.The aircraft remain at Malta's airport while the pilots and helicopter passengers are being questioned by airport immigration officials. 6.38pm: After William Hague said earlier that he had seen information suggesting that Muammar Gaddafi had fled to Venezuela, Libyan state television has carried a denial that he has fled.The Libyan deputy foreign minister, Khalid Kayem, said: \"This news is groundless. It has no basis.\"6.53pm: The two Libyan Air Force fighter pilots who apparently defected earlier with their jets to Malta have told Maltese government officials that they had been ordered to bomb protesters, Reuters reports.7.04pm: An interesting development in London. Krishnan Guru-Murthy of Channel 4 news has just tweeted that the Libyan embassy in London has replaced the official national flag with the pre-Gaddafi era version, favoured by many of those involved in the current uprising.However, my colleague Amelia Hill spoke earlier to the Libyan ambassador, who insisted that he still held the post.While he made no mention of Gaddafi, Omar Jelbam told her: \"I am still the ambassador. I am still in control. There have been no defections from the Embassy. It is a lie started by the BBC, by a woman who used to work here.\"7.16pm: It remains very difficult to get a sense of what is happening on the ground in Libya, but many reports suggest that the violence is intensifying.Reuters has filed this report about claims that anti-government activists and others in Tripoli are being hit from the air:Tripoli residents gave conflicting reports on Monday, with some saying they could hear gunfire in the Libyan capital and a political activist telling Al Jazeera warplanes were bombing the city.\"We don't know what is going on, all we can hear are occasional gunshots,\" one resident who lives near the city's central Green Square told Reuters.\"I just hear gunshots sometimes. I am at home guarding my family because the situation is unstable. No one knows what will happen,\" another resident said.But Adel Mohamed Saleh, who called himself a political activist in Tripoli, said the aerial bombing had initially targeted a funeral procession.\"What we are witnessing today is unimaginable. Warplanes and helicopters are indiscriminately bombing one area after another. There are many, many dead,\" Saleh told al Jazeera television in a live broadcast.\"Our people are dying. It is the policy of scorched earth.\" he said. \"Every 20 minutes they are bombing.\"Asked if the attacks were still happening he said: \"It is continuing, it is continuing. Anyone who moves, even if they are in their car they will hit you.\"There was no independent verification of the report but Fathi al-Warfali, the Libyan activist who heads the Swiss-based Libyan Committee for Truth and Justice, who was taking part in a protest outside U.N. European headquarters in Geneva said he had heard the same reports.\"Military planes are attacking civilians, protesters in Tripoli now. The civilians are frightened,\" al-Warfali told Reuters. 7.24pm: A friend of the Libyan novelist Hisham Matar has passed on some details to the Guardian of what he has been seeing and hearing in Tripoli in the last few hours.He tells us that eight large carrier helicopters were spotted dropping ammunition from the south of Tripoli to Khamis Military facility in the North East side of Tripoli and passed on unconfirmed rumours that two helicopters had actually been brought down after coming under fire elsewhere.The man, who will just refer to as 'Ahmed', added:Though interrupted and random; gunfire remains to be heard in Tripoli with the occasional loud sound of what could be bomb sounds.Around residential areas (understandably) the city roads are completely absent of civilians \u2013 everyone is huddled at home or just in front of their houses to avoid possible confrontation with the regime.Shops are shut and mosques are hardly attended during prayer times.7.38pm: The BBC have just carried an interview with Libyans in Manchester who have taken to the streets there, as in Liverpool and other parts of the north of England, in solidarity with those opposing the regime in Libya.\"There are no other words to describe what is happening in Libya but genocide,\" said one.\"What we are witnessing is genocide and it will be recorded in history as that.\"Another man, identified as Mohamed Abdul Malek, said many Libyans in the UK were looking forward to going home in order to help \"build democracy\".Further protests are planned in the UK for Tuesday, according to the BBC, with many Libyans planning to travel down to London from the north.7.55pm: Through contacts, I've just talked on the phone with one of the organisers in Cairo of a convoy of medical supplies destined for the eastern part of Libya.He told me that the convoy, which was organised in conjunction with the Arab doctor's syndicate, the Red Crescent and Libyans living in Egypt, has just departed in the last couple of hours carrying antibiotics, needles and other supplies.It is made up of five ambulance and 30 doctors, according to the man, an engineer with relatives in Libya, who told me: \"The hospital system in the east of Libya and in other parts is collapsing.\"He added: \"The Egyptian government have been very good and have done everything to help facilitate us but we are worried that it is proving difficult to get across the border on the western side of Libya from Tunisia.\"7.59pm: We've heard about European countries who have sent planes and ferries to Libya to evacuate their citizens, including many employees of international oil companies.However, other foreigners awaiting evacuation from Libya include thousands of Turkish workers who have taken refuge inside a football stadium in the eastern city of Benghazi from where they heard gunfire and explosions through the night, according to reports.Speaking in Ankara earlier today, Turkey's Foreign Trade Minister Zafer Caglayan said looters had attacked Turkish companies, which have projects in Libya worth more than $15 billion, and officials estimated there were 25,000 Turks working there.Reuters also carried quotes from Hidir Yentur, a logistics manager with a construction company in Al Bayda, eastern Libya, who said workers were forced to move to a safer place after their site was stormed by looters.\"A group attacked our construction site and took computers, but they didn't do anything to us. Our water is running low,\" Yentur told the news agency by telephone from Libya.8.05pm: And now to some comments on Libya from another political leader facing problems of his own, Silvio Berlusconi.The Italian president has enjoyed a close relationship with Muammar Gaddafi and was the subject of intense criticism over the weekend for failing to condemn violence in Libya, when he said he had not called the Libyan leader because he did not want to \"disturb\" him during the revolt.Now, Reuters reports that Berlusconi appears to be changing his tune:Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on Monday condemned violence by Libyan forces against civilians as \"unacceptable\" and said he was \"alarmed\" over the situation in the North African state.The statement by Berlusconi, who has cultivated close ties with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, comes after he was criticised widely for not speaking up earlier on Libya and saying that he did not want to \"disturb\" Gaddafi during the crisis.Berlusconi also called on the European Union and the international community to do everything to prevent the situation in Libya from degenerating into a civil war. 8.15pm: BBC news have been carrying an interview with Libya's deputy ambassador to the UN. Ibrahim Omar Al Dabashi said Gaddafi's government was carrying out a genocide:The regime is killing whoever gets out to the street. He (Gaddafi) has his mercenaries everywhere on the streets and whenever any demonstrator appears they just kill them.8.26pm: The Guardian's Middle East Editor, Ian Black, has put together this piece about Muammar Gaddafi's \"famously fractious\" family based on the insights provided by the US diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks.They include US assessments of his son Saif al-Islam, who vowed in a television address last night to \"eradicate enemies\" and warned that the regime would fight on until the last bullet.8.31pm: There is also more on Saif, whose LSE education and links to the UK have come under the spotlight, elsewhere on guardian.co.uk. Ian Cobain, Amelia Hill and Kartik Mehta have put together this portrait of \"the man the west can no longer deal with\".8.49pm: On Twitter, Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi is continuing to emerge as one of the 'must follow' tweeters on the Libyan uprising.A great monitor and interpreter of the Arab world's media, he's been tweeting here about reports that the regime has been stopping citizens in Tripoli from donating blood to injured demonstrators.After the apparent defections earlier in the day of two jet figher pilots who landed in Malta, he has also picked up on reports that military pilots have landed in the Libyan city of Benghazi after refusing orders to bomb it.9.06pm: An interesting development from an unlikely source: the Egyptian Army's Facebook page. It reportedly says that Libyan guards have now withdrawn from the border with Egypt.Does that mean it's going to be easier for refugees to flee? Or even for medical supplies to get in? This could be good news for that convoy we mentioned earlier.9.19pm: This could be a particularly ominous development however. Libyan airspace has been closed, the Austrian Army is saying.One of its transport planes, with some 60 European Union citizens onboard, is believed to be stranded in Tripoli at the moment.\"The entire airspace is currently blocked,\" an Austrian Defence Ministry employee told the German Press Agency dpa.9.22pm: A prominent Egyptian cleric, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, has called for a fatwa against Muammar Gaddafi.He made a public statement tonight that any Libyan soldier who has the opportunity should shoot and kill the Libyan leader.Al-Qaradawi might be familiar to many in Britain. The government was criticised back in 2008 by moderate Muslim groups after it banned him from entering Britain and branded him an extremist.Qaradawi (above), who was banned from entering the United States, had previously visited the UK in 2004 at the invitation of the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, sparking protests from Jewish groups and gay people, who regard him as anti-Semitic and homophobic.However, he is also arguably the most influential Sunni Muslim cleric in the world and has regularly spoken in the past in support of democracy.9.36pm: Here is another development on those suggestions earlier that Gaddafi could be on the verge of seeking a bolt-hole on the other side of the world, in Venezuela. Reuters reports:Both Libya and Venezuela on Monday denied reports that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was seeking asylum as a violent revolt gripped his country and would join his friend President Hugo Chavez in the South American oil producing nation.Fueling rumors in the media, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he had seen information to suggest Gaddafi had fled Libya and was on his way to Venezuela, a fellow OPEC member.But Venezuela's information minister said Gaddafi, who has ruled Libya for more than 40 years, was not coming.\"He is not traveling to Venezuela,\" Information Minister Andres Izarra told Reuters in Caracas.His comments were matched by the Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Kayem, who said the reports were \"groundless.\"Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said in a statement he had spoken by telephone to his Libyan counterpart Moussa Koussa, who told him Gaddafi was still in Tripoli. 9.41pm: OK. This is potentially big news. Al Arabiya is reporting that a speech by Gaddafi is imminent. We'll keep you updated on that.9.53pm: There are no details yet on what Gaddafi might say. That it is Muammar Gaddafi to speak, rather than his son Saif al-Islam who did so last night, suggests this could be an important announcement.10.10pm: Here is a summary of events today:\u2022  Al Arabiya is reporting that Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, is to give a televised address tonight. There are no details yet on the content of the speech or whether or not it will be live.\u2022 UN secretary general Ban Ki Moon has condemned the escalating violence in Libya and told Muammar Gaddafi it \"must stop immediately\".  Silvio Berlusconi has joined international condemnation describing violent against civilians as \"unacceptable\" and said he was \"alarmed\".\u2022  Libya's ambassadors at the United Nations are calling for leader Muammar Gaddafi to step down as the country's ruler.  Libyan ambassadors have aldo resigned in China, India, Indonesia and Poland. \u2022 There are reports that Muammar Gaddafi ordered fighter jets to attack parts of the capital, Tripoli, and live rounds have been used on the streets. The death toll passed 250 after six days of unrest but this is a conservative estimate. Al-Jazeera quoted medical sources in Tripoli saying 61 people had died in the latest protests there.\u2022 Reports which originated from British foreign secretary William Hague that Muammar Gaddafi \"may have gone to Venezuela\" have been denied. The Libyan deputy foreign minister, Khalid Kayem, said: \"This news is groundless. It has no basis.\"\u2022 Two Libyan fighter jets and two civilian helicopters have landed in Malta. The fighter pilots, Libyan colonels, have asked for political asylum after apparently refusing to bomb protesters.\u2022 Elsewhere in the Middle East, the Bahrain grand prix has been cancelled because of anti-government protests there. And five people are dead after riots in Morocco.10.18pm: On earlier reports that Gaddafi was on his way to Venezuela, Rory Carroll in Caracas writes:William Hague's announcement that Gaddafi was possibly en route to Venezuela caused consternation in Caracas, with foreign diplomats and government officials scrambling for verification until the claim was officially denied.President Hugo Chavez's close ties to Libya's leader gave the rumour credibility, prompting images of Gaddafi retiring to a Caribbean bolthole, but within hours Venezuela's government issued a strong denial.The information minister, Andres Izarra, declared the claim \"false\" and later the foreign minister, Nicolas Maduro, issued a statement calling Hague's comment \"irresponsible\".Maduro said he had spoken by phone with his Libyan counterpart, Moussa Koussa, and confirmed that Gaddafi remained in Tripoli \"exercising the powers given to him by the state and addressing the situation in the country, thereby refuting the comments made to the press in an irresponsible manner by British Foreign Secretary William Hague\".The carefully worded statement skated between Chavez's alliance with Gaddafi and the rapidly unfolding events in Libya, referring to the \"historic friendship\" between the two countries and expressing hope of a peaceful solution to Libya's \"difficulties\" without \"imperialist interference\" from outsiders.The statement did not rule out the possibility that Gaddafi could end up in Venezuela but analysts said the prospect seemed doubtful given the potential damage to Chavez's image. Venezuela's president was understood to be closely following events in north Africa from his tactical \"situation room\" in Miraflores palace.10.23pm: There's further criticism of violence against civilians in Libya tonight. US secretary of state Hilary Clinton condemned the violence and said the Libya government must respect Libyan's universal rights.This comes as Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam, has gone on state TV to deny aircraft have bombed populated areas in Tripoli and Benghazi. He says the targets were ammunition depots in remote areas.10.32pm: If Muammar Gaddafi stands down in the near future \u2013 and there's no immediate suggestion he will \u2013 it's not immediately clear who would succeed him. With Gaddafi's 41-year rule looking increasing fragile, the Guardian's Middle East editor, Ian Black, has looked at who might take over.He says until recently academics, analysts and diplomats agreed Gaddafi's most likely heirs were his sons, primarily the reformist-minded Saif al-Islam. But he says that option appears to have disappeared after Saif's TV address warning of \"civil war\".Takeover by the army also looks unlikely while civil society is virtually non-existent and the business sector still young and weak, he writes. Read the full analysis here.10.39pm: While we're waiting for Gaddafi to turn up (or not) on our screens, here's a taste of how the ripples from Libya are being felt on other continents, principally on the markets.Reuters reportsLatin American stocks fell off a two-week high on Monday as an increasingly bloody power struggle in Libya stoked concerns a spike in oil prices could weigh on economies around the world.Analysts were hesitant to read too much into Monday's drop, since a U.S. market holiday crimped volume.The spiraling violence in Libya sent Brent crude oil prices to $108 a barrel for the first time since 2008, reviving concerns that unrest in the Middle East could produce a spike in oil prices that might weigh on economic growth around the world.\"We could see markets trading this week in function of what happens in the Middle East,\" said Juan Jose Resendiz, an analyst at brokerage Arka in Mexico City.Further turmoil on the markets is also forecast for tomorrow:Asian stocks look set to come under pressure on Tuesday, as turmoil across the Middle East sends oil prices sharply higher and investors shied away from riskier assets such as equities.Investors were following reports of escalating violence in Libya with protests sweeping the capital Tripoli and anti-government forces reportedly taking control of the city of Benghazi.Brent crude futures hit $108 a barrel for the first time since 2008 on fears the violence might lead to supply disruptions.Asian markets will have no U.S. lead, as Wall Street was closed on Monday for a public holiday.British shares fell 1.1 percent while European shares dropped 1.3 percent as the Libyan violence made markets skittish, with volumes thinned by the U.S. holiday.The euro slipped on risk aversion, but hawkish comments on inflation from euro zone officials limited losses, while the U.S. dollar and yen gained on safe-haven buying.Japanese markets will likely fall, with Nikkei futures last trading in Osaka at 10,830, a 27.5 point discount to the index close on Monday.Australian stocks may make a flat start, with share price index futures up 3 points to 4,898, unchanged from the close of the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index.10.43pm: In the absence, thus far, of his father, here is some more on what Saif Gadaffi has been saying on television tonight.He claimed that air raids earlier tonight targeted ammunition depots and not populated areas in Tripoli and Benghanzi.\"There is no truth to information about a raid by the armed forces against Tripoli and Benghazi,\" Libyan television quoted Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as telling the official Jana news agency.\"The raid targeted ammunitions depots in areas remote from inhabited areas,\" added Saif.10.50pm: Another potentially significant development, if true. Sultan Al Qassemi has just tweeted that Al Jazeera are reporting on a statement by Libyan Military Officers which asks all members of the Libyan army to head to Tripoli and remove Gaddafi.10.54pm: The story of those two Libyan air force pilots who apparently defected earlier to Malta is becoming ever more fascinating.Al Jazeera has spoken to one of its correspondents on the island, who said the pilots have claimed they came so close to carrying out their mission to bomb anti-Gadaffi demonstrators that they could see the crowds on the ground.They have reportedly passed on \"classified\" information about the movements and actions of the Libyan military to Malta.Eric Montfort, a journalist on the island, has been in touch with the Guardian to tell us that the Mirage fighters which apparently defected to Malta are among the most prized in Libya's fighter plane force. Earlier in the afternoon there were also demonstrations in front of the Libyan Embassy at Balzan, Malta, where two embassy workers defected and joined the crowd.10.59pm: Back in London, it appears that it was a demonstrator outside the Libyan embassy who removed the country's current flag (as we reported earlier) and replaced it with an older pre-Gadaffi version.Staff at the embassy are said to have removed the flag now however.11.34pm: Reuters is reporting that Libyan state TV says Muammar Gaddafi is to \"speak soon\". Earlier it was Al Arabiya which was reporting that he was to speak \"imminently\". That was two hours ago. It is now 1.35am in Tripoli.11.43pm: The former British foreign secretary Lord Owen has tonight called on the UN and regional powers to enforce a no fly zone over Libya. He said: The UN Security Council should meet in emergency session tonight and declare the situation in Libya as a threat to peace under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and declare a no flight zone for the Libyan airforce and ask the regional power, Nato, to enforce it from dawn tomorrow.And hopefully other Arab nations, particularly Egypt, might decide to participate to demonstrate that this is not just a Western initiative.He also called on \"airforces in the region with sufficient range to reach Libya to prevent any Libyan airforce military action against civilians\".11.51pm: Here's the first details of the Muammar Gaddafi statement, which has not yet been broadcast. Reuters reports: Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi will refute in an interview with state television on Tuesday \"malicious rumours that have been broadcast\", state TV said. It reported earlier that Gaddafi would \"speak soon\". 12.10am: Libyan state TV suddenly cut a few minutes ago to footage of Muammar Gaddafi.\"I am in Tripoli and not in Venezuela,\" he said, according to a BBC translation of what was just a few seconds of footage.12.16am: Some more details of that footage of Gaddafi that has appeared on Libyan state TV. True to his eccentric reputation, he was carrying an umbrella and appeared to be sitting in a back of a car wearing a winter hat with ear flaps.12.20am: Some more on what Gadaffi said. He urged Libyans not to believe television channels, which he called 'dogs'.He went on to say that he wanted to go to Green Square and 'yishar' (spend the evening) with the youth there, but for the rain.12.45am: We've carried out an interview in the last hour with a contact in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, which appears destined to go down in history as the root of this uprising.A Libyan man who spent a number of years in the UK before five years ago to his home city said that the people were now largely control of Benghazi and that the army had fled.More than 350 people have been killed, he said, while adding that this death toll did not include the grim discovery made inside the army garrison headquarters by those who entered it following its surrender.\"We found 150 corpses burning and we believe they were the bodies of officers and soldiers who refused to follow orders to fire on the the people,\" he said.It has been largely quiet in the city since about 10 o'clock last night, he said, although citizens had been bracing themselves for an air strike that Arabic television channels had reported was on the way.Fears of this were calmed partially after two Libyan pilots landed their jets and said they had refused orders to bomb the city, instead choosing to jettison their bombs in the sea.\"I never believed that I would see this day. The atmosphere here has changed completely,\" he said.We're going to wrap up out blog for now, but join us again in a few hours for further coverage of events in Libya.", "tags": ["Arab and Middle East unrest", "World news", "Libya", "Bahrain", "Africa"], "title": "Libya in crisis -Monday 21 February "},{"date": "2011-03-13T21:07:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Europe's hope of a better future is faltering, as the financial crisis and spending cuts bite, according to a Guardian/ICM poll of five leading EU countries. It finds trust in government at rock bottom and widespread fear of further economic decline. Few people are convinced that the present signs of recovery can be sustained.The poll was carried out online using a representative sample of more than 5,000 people of working age in five leading EU states \u2013 Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Spain. It paints a picture of a continent confident in its liberal values and still mostly committed to EU institutions such as the euro and the free movement of people between states, but notably hostile to state spending and political leaders.Carried out at the start of a month-long Guardian series examining Europe in the wake of recession, the poll makes it clear that few Europeans believe the worst of the economic crisis is over. A majority are also against immediate cuts in government spending.The result is a crisis in European democracy. While people are divided on the need for state spending cuts and the speed with which they should take place, very few in the five states surveyed trust their politicians to deal with the problems facing their countries \u2013 or even their honesty.Only 6% of people across Europe say they have a great deal of trust in their government, 46% say they have not very much and 32% none at all. Only 9% of Europeans think their politicians \u2013 in opposition or in power \u2013 act with honesty and integrity.The lack of trust in government is greatest in Poland and France, where distrust outweighs trust by a net 82 percentage points. In France, the net negative score is 78 points and in Germany 80 points. Only Britain breaks the consensus somewhat, with a net negative score of 66 points.Even fewer Europeans think their politicians are honest. In Poland, only 3% of those questioned agree; in Spain 8%; in Germany 10%; in France 11%; in Britain 12%. Overall, the percentage of those who think politicians are not at all, or not very, honest outweighs those who disagree by a massive 89 percentage points.Political anxiety appears to be fuelled by deep economic worries. Overall, 40% of those polled think their economy will get worse over the next 12 months, against 20% who think it will improve. Only in Germany are more people optimistic than pessimistic. Economic anxiety is greatest in France, where pessimists outnumber optimists by a net difference of 46 points. In Britain, the difference is 40 points and in Poland 30 points. Spain is more optimistic, with a net difference of 18 points \u2013 which could be explained by few people in the country thinking things can get worse than they already are.There are also signs of hope: except in Poland, people on balance are more likely to think things will get \"a little worse\" (26% of those polled) than \"a lot worse\" (21%). And others (31%) think things will simply stay the same. Europe is not in economic depression.But on the other hand there is limited hope for the future expressed in the EU's traditional economic powerhouses of Germany and France. Almost three-quarters of the French questioned think they will be worse off in a decade than they are now. In Germany \u2013 despite its recovery \u2013 over half think the same.In Britain, a majority think the next decade will either leave them poorer or, at best, no better off. Only a quarter think Britain will get richer over the next 10 years.Only in the more recent EU entrants of Spain and Poland is there significant optimism. In Poland, almost half think they will end up better off in a decade; in Spain, a majority think this. Both countries have experienced rapid growth within recent memory as a result of EU entry.The poll focused on national attitudes rather than those to the EU as a whole. But despite economic worries and the cost of bailing out Greece and Ireland, EU states already using the euro want to keep it. Overall, 68% questioned in the three euro countries \u2013 France, Spain and Germany \u2013 are in favour of retaining it. Spain (71%) is keenest, followed by France (60%). But a majority of Germans (59%) also want to keep the euro despite national concern about the Greek bailout.However, a narrow plurality of Poles (48% to 40%) oppose their country joining the single currency as is planned.ICM interviewed a random sample of 5,023 adults in five EU states aged 18\u201364 from its online panel between 24 February and 8 March, 2011. In order to achieve a nationally representative sample within each country, quotas were set by gender, age and region.

According to the last census in 2002, 96.7% of the country are Polish, with the main ethnic minorities hailing from Germany, Ukraine and Belarus. Though the proportion of foreigners is thought to have increased slightly in the past nine years, Poland remains an almost exclusively white, Catholic country.Poland is currently enjoying its second \"economic miracle\". Twenty-one years after Solidarity leaders gambled successfully on the \"big bang\", ushering in free market capitalism overnight on New Year's Day 1990, the economy they created has beaten the odds.

Billboards in the cities are advertising the new series of X Factor, and Taniec z Gwiazdami (Dancing with the Stars) is one of Poland's biggest shows. Though the majority of Polish cinemas spurn homegrown films in favour of Hollywood blockbusters, the indigenous film industry is in passable health. The National Film School in Lodz is still producing decent directors, though none of its alumni have ever replicated the worldwide success of Roman Polanski, Krzysztof \"Three Colors\" Kieslowski and Andrzej Wajda, whose film school in Warsaw now rivals his alma mater. Polish pop music does not travel well, but dominates the charts at home.

Hike the last kilometre to the highest peak of Sniezka, through which Poland's southern border runs. There's a flying-saucer-shaped Soviet-era cafe on top, with views north across Poland and south into the Czech Republic. In communist times this border was guarded by Russian soldiers with rifles. Kids would put a foot across the line then brag that they had been abroad. At a time when hardly anyone had a passport to travel, it was a bitter joke. Now the border is lost in long grass.It's a 45-minute walk to an isolated valley known as Samotnia, or \"the lonely place\". For around \u00a315 you can have a double room in the wooden chalet here, Schronisko Samotnia (+48 75 761 9376, samotnia.com.pl/en).

Local noble Jan Zamojski hired Italian architect Bernardo Morando for the job in 1580. The result is stunning \u2013 think your own private Padua, without the queues. Book a room on the arcaded main square and sit in the window with a bottle of champagne, toasting the brides who marry every couple of hours on the staircase of the pink town hall.

Visit his house (+48 46 863 3300, chopin.museum/en/museum/branches/id/216), a typical 19th-century Polish nobleman's house, or dworek. Sit in the garden with its stream and dragonflies, and listen to a nocturne on a warm summer evening (there are regular concerts). Chopin left Poland in 1831 and never returned. He lived in Paris, along with other Polish exiles, and the nostalgic music he wrote there still has the power to carry any Polish migrant back home whenever it is played.Cucumber season (sezon ogorkowy) is how Poles describe the long summer months when schools, theatres and pretty much everything else shuts down and there is nothing to do but watch cucumbers growing. Warm sunshine arrives (finally), pierogi (dumplings) are filled with blueberries, and soup is made from young beetroot shoots. It's the perfect time to get lost in the heart of Poland. First buy a picnic \u2013 ideally cold smoked sausage, beer, rye bread and cherries.There are daily farmers' markets in the rynek or market squares of most small towns and villages, with wonderfully fresh piles of unwashed carrots, beetroot and cabbages. There will be smoked cheeses and sausages, and you can buy just a half or a third of a loaf of delicious rye bread if that is all you need for lunch. No need to label the produce \"organic\" \u2013 there is no other kind of farming here \u2013 and it is all truly seasonal.Drive south from Warsaw for a couple of hours, then turn off on to the smallest road you can find. Keep turning randomly right and left wherever you see a plaster saint in a shrine by the road, until your route peters out in the middle of a blossoming potato field. Get out with your picnic. Lie on the ground and watch the passing clouds overhead for further directions.Lodz (pronounced woodge) is where cinema greats Roman Polanski, Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Kieslowski went to film school. \"HollyLodz\" animators strongly influenced British TV \u2013 the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield (where Nick Park conceived Wallace & Gromit) ran regular exchanges in the 1980s. This newly groovy industrial town 120km south of Warsaw is turning its old fabric factories into hip apartments and studios.

It was originally built by the Lubomirski dynasty (complete with exquisite tiny theatre), then extended by the Potockis into one of the grandest residences in Europe.Forget the rococo palaces and green gardens, it is Wolsztyn that many people (well, blokes mainly) want to visit. Towards the centre of the country, it is the only place in Europe that still operates a scheduled train service using steam locomotives. You can actually drive your own loco, and 40+-year-old boys from Texas to Amsterdam flock here to try footplating and shunting, far away from their day jobs, health and safety, and wives who just don't get it.

Compared with most other European countries, Poland has not attracted many immigrants either. According to the last census in 2002, 96.7% of the country are Polish, with the main ethnic minorities hailing from Germany, Ukraine and Belarus. Though the proportion of foreigners is thought to have increased slightly in the past nine years, Poland remains an almost exclusively white, Catholic country.Poland is currently enjoying its second \"economic miracle\". Twenty-one years after Solidarity leaders gambled successfully on the \"big bang\", ushering in free market capitalism overnight on New Year's Day 1990, the economy they created has beaten the odds. Alone in the whole EU it continued to grow through the recession of the past two years. Last year the economy grew by nearly 4%, and is projected to do even better this year. The country has EU investment to thank, as well as a construction boom driven by the need to prepare for the 2012 European football championships.Poland negotiated its way out of communism at the famous \"round table\" talks in 1989, but it only got round to drafting a comprehensive new constitution for the \"third republic\" in 1997. It is a self-conscious casting off of the communist past, rejecting the failed experiments in collectivisation by explicitly making the \"family farm\" the foundation of the agrarian economy. The system is semi-presidential. The presidency has more power than Germany's but less than the French Elys\u00e9e. The proportional representation elections to the lower house of parliament (the Sejm) produced two decades of shaky short-lived coalitions and continual spats between parliament and president. By those standards, the current period counts as the most stable in modern Polish history.Polish politics is currently a two-horse race. The party now in power is the liberal Civic Platform, led by the football-playing prime minister Donald Tusk. The president, Bronislaw Komorowski, is from the same party. These two took over from one of the world's more eccentric political double acts, the identical Kaczynski twins Jaroslaw and Lech, child actors who grew up to become prime minister and president respectively. Lech was killed in the Smolensk air crash last year, which his grieving brother still believes was more than an accident. In the general election this autumn, Jaroslaw will try to regain the premiership with his conservative Law and Justice party. Minor parties have names which hark back to bygone days, such as The League of Polish Families and Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland.Food and drinkSurely one of the underrated gems of European cuisine, Polish food is distinctive, and can be superb. The classic soup, zurek, is made of rye flour left to ferment in water for a few days. Mixed with stock and marjoram, with bits of kielbasa (sausage) and hard-boiled egg floating on the bottom, it can be addictive. Pierogi (ravioli) are a food group of their own \u2013 arguably the best variety being stuffed with minced cabbage and wild mushrooms (the object of a near-mystical reverence). Apart from the ubiquitous kebab, the Polish fast food of choice is the Zapiekanka, a baguette topped with melted cheese and mushrooms and smothered in ketchup. Vodka is not the dominant drink of yore. Its place has been taken by imported wine and excellent local beers, like Okocim, Zywiec and a crop of new micro-breweries.Poland has succumbed to the same guilty pleasures as much of the rest of the world. Billboards in the cities are advertising the new series of X Factor, and Taniec z Gwiazdami (Dancing with the Stars) is one of Poland's biggest shows. Though the majority of Polish cinemas spurn homegrown films in favour of Hollywood blockbusters, the indigenous film industry is in passable health. The National Film School in Lodz is still producing decent directors, though none of its alumni have ever replicated the worldwide success of Roman Polanski, Krzysztof \"Three Colors\" Kieslowski and Andrzej Wajda, whose film school in Warsaw now rivals his alma mater. Polish pop music does not travel well, but dominates the charts at home. Probably the most popular Polish band is Kult, whose thoughtful (if unusual) mix of punk, rock, jazz and poetry has been popular for almost 30 years. Poland's answer to Britney Spears is Doda, a busty and litigious 27-year-old (pictured top right) with a hellraising reputation.Polish men think of themselves as chivalrous and romantic, which is true up to a point. Women certainly shouldn't expect to have to open any doors during a visit to Poland, and will very likely receive flowers from any suitors. These days, though, men tend to shake rather than kiss a woman's hand when they meet. Premarital sex goes on but is not talked about much \u2013 outside the increasingly secular Warsaw, at least \u2013 and many parents are often unhappy when their offspring move in with their partners before getting wed. Abortions are illegal (apart from in rape cases or for health reasons), and contraception is not promoted. Sex education in schools is still referred to euphemistically as \"education for life and family\". Homophobia is still a problem: this year the ruling party had to expel an MP for abusive comments about gay people.Foreign policy has understandably been shaped by the repeated experience of being invaded (see below). An attempt to put history to rest ended in disaster a year ago when the plane taking President Lech Kaczynski to a joint Polish-Russian commemoration of the Katyn massacre crashed at Smolensk, killing not just the president but much of the military leadership. Ex-prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski outraged the Germans by suggesting that Poland's 6 million war victims should be taken into account when apportioning EU voting rights. Last month, the foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, called for historic resentments to be put aside and for Poland to do business with its neighbours like a normal country. It is still too early to say if that will work.It would be fair to say that history has not treated Poland kindly. Occupying the flat space between Germany and Russia, Poland is near-impossible to defend. The Commonwealth, as it calls itself, was swallowed up entirely in 1795 by the Russians, Prussians and Austrians and did not resurface until 1918. The \"second republic\" between the wars was an uneasy experience. Soviet conquest was narrowly averted in a 1920 battle on the outskirts of Warsaw, now known as \"the miracle on the Vistula\". The hero of the hour, Jozef Pilsudski, went on to stage a coup and dominated Poland between the wars. What followed was unmitigated disaster. Poland was carved up by Hitler and Stalin, who turned it into a killing field. Six million Poles \u2013 3 million Jewish and 3 million Catholic \u2013 were exterminated, including in the Soviets' execution of almost the entire officer corps at Katyn in 1940, a massacre Moscow blamed on the Nazis. At the war's end, Stalin swallowed Poland whole. One revolt after another was crushed until a now famous electrician climbed over the wall of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk and called for a strike. Lech Walesa and Solidarity were instrumental in bringing down communism not just in Poland but across eastern Europe, and Poles are not about to let Europe forget it.The Polish psyche is not given to optimism \u2013 perhaps to be expected given the centuries of oppression, invasions and foreign rule. This pessimism is best demonstrated in the common title of the Polish national anthem, Jeszcze Polska nie zginela, which means Poland\u00a0Has\u00a0Not Yet Perished. Be warned that if you ask Poles how they are, they will probably tell you the truth, and it may take some time. The classic Polish answer to \"How are you?\" is \"Stara bieda\" which literally means \"old poverty\". Poles are also less\u00a0afraid\u00a0of conversational silences than Britons.

The National Film School in Lodz is still producing decent directors, though none of its alumni have ever replicated the worldwide success of Roman Polanski, Krzysztof \"Three Colors\" Kieslowski and Andrzej Wajda, whose film school in Warsaw now rivals his alma mater. Polish pop music does not travel well, but dominates the charts at home. Probably the most popular Polish band is Kult, whose thoughtful (if unusual) mix of punk, rock, jazz and poetry has been popular for almost 30 years. Poland's answer to Britney Spears is Doda, a busty and litigious 27-year-old (pictured top right) with a hellraising reputation.Polish men think of themselves as chivalrous and romantic, which is true up to a point. Women certainly shouldn't expect to have to open any doors during a visit to Poland, and will very likely receive flowers from any suitors. These days, though, men tend to shake rather than kiss a woman's hand when they meet. Premarital sex goes on but is not talked about much \u2013 outside the increasingly secular Warsaw, at least \u2013 and many parents are often unhappy when their offspring move in with their partners before getting wed. Abortions are illegal (apart from in rape cases or for health reasons), and contraception is not promoted. Sex education in schools is still referred to euphemistically as \"education for life and family\". Homophobia is still a problem: this year the ruling party had to expel an MP for abusive comments about gay people.Foreign policy has understandably been shaped by the repeated experience of being invaded (see below). An attempt to put history to rest ended in disaster a year ago when the plane taking President Lech Kaczynski to a joint Polish-Russian commemoration of the Katyn massacre crashed at Smolensk, killing not just the president but much of the military leadership. Ex-prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski outraged the Germans by suggesting that Poland's 6 million war victims should be taken into account when apportioning EU voting rights. Last month, the foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, called for historic resentments to be put aside and for Poland to do business with its neighbours like a normal country. It is still too early to say if that will work.It would be fair to say that history has not treated Poland kindly. Occupying the flat space between Germany and Russia, Poland is near-impossible to defend. The Commonwealth, as it calls itself, was swallowed up entirely in 1795 by the Russians, Prussians and Austrians and did not resurface until 1918. The \"second republic\" between the wars was an uneasy experience. Soviet conquest was narrowly averted in a 1920 battle on the outskirts of Warsaw, now known as \"the miracle on the Vistula\". The hero of the hour, Jozef Pilsudski, went on to stage a coup and dominated Poland between the wars. What followed was unmitigated disaster. Poland was carved up by Hitler and Stalin, who turned it into a killing field. Six million Poles \u2013 3 million Jewish and 3 million Catholic \u2013 were exterminated, including in the Soviets' execution of almost the entire officer corps at Katyn in 1940, a massacre Moscow blamed on the Nazis. At the war's end, Stalin swallowed Poland whole. One revolt after another was crushed until a now famous electrician climbed over the wall of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk and called for a strike. Lech Walesa and Solidarity were instrumental in bringing down communism not just in Poland but across eastern Europe, and Poles are not about to let Europe forget it.The Polish psyche is not given to optimism \u2013 perhaps to be expected given the centuries of oppression, invasions and foreign rule. This pessimism is best demonstrated in the common title of the Polish national anthem, Jeszcze Polska nie zginela, which means Poland\u00a0Has\u00a0Not Yet Perished. Be warned that if you ask Poles how they are, they will probably tell you the truth, and it may take some time. The classic Polish answer to \"How are you?\" is \"Stara bieda\" which literally means \"old poverty\". Poles are also less\u00a0afraid\u00a0of conversational silences than Britons. Most of all, Poles are generous and hospitable and proud of their country surviving against the\u00a0odds.", "tags": ["Poland"], "title": "Poland at a glance"},{"date": "2011-04-08T23:04:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In the 19th century, Lower Silesia (the bottom left-hand corner of Poland) was a prized piece of the German empire. After King Wilhelm's brother built himself a summer palace here in 1822, every Prussian nobleman had to build one too, complete with English-style park, artificial ruins and romantic temples.Drive through the valley around Jelenia Gora and you'll find a crumbling castle every few miles. You could buy one and spend the next decade doing it up, or just stay the night in one of the restored palace hotels.Lomnica Palace (+48 75 713 0460, palac-lomnica.pl/en) has doubles from \u00a355 B&B, or Hotel Palac Staniszow (+48 75 755 8445, palacstaniszow.pl/en) has doubles from \u00a370 B&B. You'll eat dinner by candlelight reflected in polished stone floors, climb gothic carved timber staircases to bed, and sleep deeply to the sound of the wind in 100-year-old lime trees.Classical music nuts will thrill to the baroque abbey in Krzeszow, east of Jelenia Gora. Here, precious original manuscripts from Berlin (including a quarter of all Mozart's works) were kept out of range of Allied bombers during the second world war.Park in the resort of Karpacz, a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Wroclaw, then take the chairlift (ignore the sneering locals who climb on foot as a matter of national pride). Hike the last kilometre to the highest peak of Sniezka, through which Poland's southern border runs. There's a flying-saucer-shaped Soviet-era cafe on top, with views north across Poland and south into the Czech Republic. In communist times this border was guarded by Russian soldiers with rifles. Kids would put a foot across the line then brag that they had been abroad. At a time when hardly anyone had a passport to travel, it was a bitter joke. Now the border is lost in long grass.It's a 45-minute walk to an isolated valley known as Samotnia, or \"the lonely place\". For around \u00a315 you can have a double room in the wooden chalet here, Schronisko Samotnia (+48 75 761 9376, samotnia.com.pl/en). There's a cosy restaurant, or you can eat outside on benches by the lake.Leba is a small fishing village and resort on the Baltic coast, where you walk through pine forests to the beach. Kids queue to buy rurki z kremem, yummy cigar-shaped waffle tubes filled with vanilla cream. You can hunt for lumps of amber (fossilised tree resin) in the vast, lunar sand dunes where Rommel is said to have practised desert warfare, or watch families sheltering from the stiff Baltic breeze. Hotel Neptun (+48 59 866 1432, neptunhotel.pl/en) is the only hotel/castle in Poland built on a beach, and offers dinner, bed and breakfast for two from around \u00a395 a night.It was in nearby Gdansk that brave shipbuilders (encouraged by a forward-thinking Pope) first stood up to their communist occupiers. Light a candle in the austere St Bridget's church, where Solidarity members once gathered in secret, and spot red Solidarity flags peaking out from corners of this old traders' city, a reminder that this is where the end of the cold war began.Zamosc, near the eastern border with Ukraine, grew from one man's dream to build a perfect, Renaissance city. Local noble Jan Zamojski hired Italian architect Bernardo Morando for the job in 1580. The result is stunning \u2013 think your own private Padua, without the queues. Book a room on the arcaded main square and sit in the window with a bottle of champagne, toasting the brides who marry every couple of hours on the staircase of the pink town hall. Or visit the fabulous old synagogue on Zamenhofa, built by Sephardic Jews from Venice in the time of Shakespeare. Orbis Zamojski (+48 84 639 2516, accorhotels.com/gb) has basic doubles for around \u00a340 room only, but pay a bit more for the corner suite with a view of the town hall.Polish composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (his dad was French) was born in Zelazowa Wola, not far from Warsaw. Visit his house (+48 46 863 3300, chopin.museum/en/museum/branches/id/216), a typical 19th-century Polish nobleman's house, or dworek. Sit in the garden with its stream and dragonflies, and listen to a nocturne on a warm summer evening (there are regular concerts). Chopin left Poland in 1831 and never returned. He lived in Paris, along with other Polish exiles, and the nostalgic music he wrote there still has the power to carry any Polish migrant back home whenever it is played.Cucumber season (sezon ogorkowy) is how Poles describe the long summer months when schools, theatres and pretty much everything else shuts down and there is nothing to do but watch cucumbers growing. Warm sunshine arrives (finally), pierogi (dumplings) are filled with blueberries, and soup is made from young beetroot shoots. It's the perfect time to get lost in the heart of Poland. First buy a picnic \u2013 ideally cold smoked sausage, beer, rye bread and cherries.There are daily farmers' markets in the rynek or market squares of most small towns and villages, with wonderfully fresh piles of unwashed carrots, beetroot and cabbages. There will be smoked cheeses and sausages, and you can buy just a half or a third of a loaf of delicious rye bread if that is all you need for lunch. No need to label the produce \"organic\" \u2013 there is no other kind of farming here \u2013 and it is all truly seasonal.Drive south from Warsaw for a couple of hours, then turn off on to the smallest road you can find. Keep turning randomly right and left wherever you see a plaster saint in a shrine by the road, until your route peters out in the middle of a blossoming potato field. Get out with your picnic. Lie on the ground and watch the passing clouds overhead for further directions.Lodz (pronounced woodge) is where cinema greats Roman Polanski, Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Kieslowski went to film school. \"HollyLodz\" animators strongly influenced British TV \u2013 the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield (where Nick Park conceived Wallace & Gromit) ran regular exchanges in the 1980s. This newly groovy industrial town 120km south of Warsaw is turning its old fabric factories into hip apartments and studios. Walk the Polish equivalent of Hollywood Boulevard's Avenue of the Stars, Piotrkowska, and ask at the Film Commission (104 Piotrkowska, +48 42 638 5546, lodzfilmcommission.com) to go on the free Lodz Film Heritage Trail (Saturdays only).You can visit Lancut castle (+48 17 225 2008, zamek-lancut.pl/en), the historical heart of the elegant Polish aristocracy in the south-east corner of Poland, as long as you are prepared to shuffle round the parquet floors with protective slippers over your shoes. It was originally built by the Lubomirski dynasty (complete with exquisite tiny theatre), then extended by the Potockis into one of the grandest residences in Europe.Forget the rococo palaces and green gardens, it is Wolsztyn that many people (well, blokes mainly) want to visit. Towards the centre of the country, it is the only place in Europe that still operates a scheduled train service using steam locomotives. You can actually drive your own loco, and 40+-year-old boys from Texas to Amsterdam flock here to try footplating and shunting, far away from their day jobs, health and safety, and wives who just don't get it. The Wolsztyn Experience (01628 524876, thewolsztynexperience.org) has one-week courses from \u00a38250/week, and weekends from \u00a3130,, including accommodation, some in the depot. Alternatively, the nearby Hotel Wolsztyn Palace (+48 68 346 9358, www.palacwolsztyn.com.pl) has doubles for around \u00a370 B&B, and there is a fairyland of lakes, apple orchards and windmills to explore to the south.\u2022 Filmmaker and writer Simon Target is co-author with his Polish wife Beata Zatorska of Rose Petal Jam: Recipes & Stories from a Summer in Poland, published this week by Tabula Books, price \u00a325.

Booksonspain \u2013 no prizes for guessing who that is \u2013 nominated Benito Perez Galdos as \"*the* novelist of 19th-century Spain\", mapping \"Spanish society's difficult transition to modernity\", while Shorty confessed to loving \"I Love You When I'm Drunk\" \u2013 appropriately enough a \"short\" story collection from \"Catalonia's smartest and most compelling contemporary author\", Empar Moliner.Over here the discussion was much enlivened by smallpox throwing down the gauntlet, observing \"typically\" \u2013 ouch \u2013 \"you're a bit light on women writers here\". The responses came thick and fast: goldgathers replied with Carmen Conde's Mujer sin Ed\u00e9n, Haarlson with Merc\u00e9 Rodoreda and Joan Margarit. But unless I've missed it somewhere, the explanation smallpox demanded didn't seem to materialise. I'm no Spanish specialist, but the barriers to publication with which women have struggled in the UK since Miguel de Cervantes set out his blueprint for fiction are surely equally fearsome in the land of Sancho Panza. All the more reason to join with goldgathers in saluting Ediciones Torremozas, \"who publish poetry and short stories by women writers\".This week, though, the World literature tour comes into its own, as it heads into territory which is \u2013 at least to me \u2013 basically unknown. I'll mutter Witold Gombrowicz, hum and haw at Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, and tentatively suggest Michal Witkowski's recently-translated Lovetown, but the only thing I can really recommend about Polish literature is a marvellous short story by Michal Olszewski, wonderfully translated by Antonia Lloyd Jones, which we ran as part of a series of short stories to commemorate the fall of the Berlin wall a couple of years back.So it's over to you. As before, we're looking for the books which shed light on the Polish experience \u2013 fiction, non-fiction, poems and plays \u2013 whether written by those who'd call themselves Poles, or not. Just make your way down the page to the boxes of magic, fill in a country \u2013 that's Poland \u2013 an author, a title, maybe a translator and some indication of why it's a book you'd recommend. Then the elves will fly, the cogs will turn and hey presto, there'll be a list of knowledge, just like the one we made for Spain. After that the only issue will be where to head next.So tell us: where would you like to go next? Tell us in the comments, and we'll head wherever you fancy.

There are restaurants with Hebrew lettering, a new community centre where students drop in for a Sabbath meal, and even a Jewish kindergarten. And once a year, this quarter is dominated by a celebration of Jewish music, theatre and film that attracts up to 13,000 visitors.Krakow's Jewish Culture festival is the most prominent symbol of an apparent rejuvenation in the shadow of the Holocaust. This is the nearest Polish city to Auschwitz, but it has also become a place where Poles are discovering their lost Jewish heritage.The Jewish community centre on Miodowa Street, neighbouring a synagogue defiled by the Nazis but now restored for worship, has seen a steady stream of visitors. Opened in 2008 by Prince Charles, the centre offers Hebrew and Yiddish language lessons and an introductory religious course, alongside yoga, belly-dancing and basketball.Jonathan Ornstein, the centre's director, says: \"I think that people for a few years have been talking about a Jewish renaissance in Poland, in Krakow especially, and that was primarily an interest by non-Jews in Jewish culture, and I think that now we're in a second stage that is totally made possible by this first stage. That's people with Jewish roots getting involved in the Jewish community.\"Ornstein says the centre has young people coming in every day who have no contact with Jewish life but want to explore their Jewish roots. One local rabbi tells a story of a Pole who discovered from his mother's birth certificate that she was Jewish, born in Krakow's wartime ghetto. She told him that she had kept it a secret all her life \u2013 and then they discovered that the man's father was Jewish, too.There are reckoned to be slightly more than 100 official members of the Jewish community in Krakow, but 400 who consider themselves Jewish.The precursor of this renewal has been the festival, now in its 21st year. It is an event that looks both ways, embracing klezmer music and Yiddish movies of the past, but also seeking out the avant garde. This year that includes a \"hip-hop meets klezmer\" act from the US as well as workshops in Hebrew calligraphy, Jewish cooking and singing, all allowing the audience to get involved.It acts as a reminder to Poles that their culture is not a \"monolith\", says the festival's director, Janusz Makuch, citing the influential Jewish songwriter Mordechai Gebirtig as one example. \"Gebirtig composed a lot of beautiful songs, sung by the Poles. When Poles sang these tunes, they didn't realise they sang a Jewish song.\"Instead of [being] a hermetic culture, the secular Jewish culture was intertwined with Polish culture.\"One of this year's performers, Jarek Bester, of the Bester Quartet, describes his sound as contemporary chamber music that reinterprets traditional Yiddish folk. On CD it is a mix of plaintive violin and thundering accordion.Bester says: \"[The Holocaust] was a kind of intermission in composing and playing klezmer music. I'm trying to provide a continuation of klezmer \u2013 I think the way we play is how klezmer music would be played, if it wasn't for the second world war.\"Jewish life in Krakow, nearly extinguished by the Nazis, was driven underground in the communist era. Kazimierz, where Schindler's List was filmed, was a neglected and under-populated district under communism. In recent years it has been transformed into one of the hippest parts of the city. Pavements are crowded with cafe tables and streets are lined with vodka bars, vintage boutiques and tiny art galleries. Only the peeling plaster and brickwork of some of the facades gives away the past neglect, and that is rapidly being patched up.Jewishness has been adopted as a selling point, almost a badge of cool, in a way that is sometimes tasteless. Converted golf carts tout for tourist custom with awnings displaying the itinerary: \"Auschwitz, Schindler's factory, Jewish quarter.\" A local rabbi, Eliezer Gurary, spoke of his disquiet at the Jewish mannequins in shops \u2013 dolls of black-robed, bearded men that border on racist caricature. There have been complaints over a \"Jewish-themed\" restaurant that displays a page of the Torah on its wall.At the community centre, Ornstein says: \"You have some fake Jewish-style restaurants, and I would love those to be restaurants run by Jews, kosher restaurants and actually be realistic. I think that's a way off, [but] we're moving in that direction. These days in Poland the fact that you can call a restaurant a Jewish restaurant and that brings people in, is in itself a positive thing.\"I think the remarkable thing here is that you have a community that's growing, that's optimistic, that feels very safe, and it's going in a direction which is very different to most Jewish communities in Europe.\"A survey conducted last year by the Polish Public Opinion Poll Institute indicated a decline in antisemitism among all age groups over the decade. The poll, which asked questions intended to uncover people's belief in Jewish \"influence\" over Polish politics, found that fewer than 6% mentioned Jewish people when asked about influential minorities, compared with nearly 20% in 2002.Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, believes that the opinion polls on antisemitism fail to show the underlying change in Polish attitudes. \"The flaw in all these surveys is that \u2013 let's say they show that 20% of Poles have antisemitic attitudes \u2013 everyone misses what the other 80% is thinking,\" Schudrich says at his office at the Warsaw synagogue. \"Are they indifferent or are they appalled by the 20%? And it seems to me more and more people are raising their rejection of these antisemitic trends. That's mostly due to John Paul II, who did more to fight antisemitism than anyone in the last 2,000 years.\"Schudrich, who was born in New York and first came to Poland in 1992, believes that the late Polish pope, who will be beatified on 1 May, made indifference to antisemitism less acceptable in the Catholic mainstream.\"John Paul II empowered all those people who found it abhorrent,\" he says. The rabbi believes he is seeing a subtle, slow but telling transformation in the relationship between Polish Jews and the wider community.\"I get these calls from town X saying: 'We feel an obligation to perpetuate the memory of the Jews who once lived here.' It used to be: 'What can be done to clean your cemetery.' Now it's: 'What can be done to clean our cemetery.'\"On Tuesday the chief rabbi was in the eastern Polish town of Zamosc, along with ambassadors from the US, Germany and Israel, at the restoration of a 17th-century synagogue. The building is considered a jewel of Renaissance architecture, and will house a Polish Jewish cultural centre.Schudrich chooses his words carefully when talking about Golden Harvest, a controversial new book by a Princeton University professor, Jan Gross, about Poles who dug up the mass graves of Jews killed in the Holocaust looking for gold and precious stones.\"It's important to talk about this subject. Some people did horrific things, but we knew this already. The question is: was it rampant? In Treblinka and in Birkenau, was it the same 50 people doing this each time, or a different 50 people?\" Schudrich says. \"You could come away with the impression that everyone did it.\"And were they doing it because the victims were Jews, or because the Nazis destroyed any sense of morality so everything was permitted? I don't know. Gross writes in a way to provoke, not to educate, and Poles don't react well to it. Because of the style, too many people reject what he has to say.\"On a bright afternoon recently in Kazimierz a boy in a kippah (skullcap) walked along the street where a few hours earlier a golf cart filled with tourists had trundled past. Poland was once home to the second largest Jewish community in the world, and any revival is the faintest echo of what was destroyed \u2013 but it is a source of great pride to a city with 700 years of Jewish history.Makuch, of the Jewish Culture festival, says: \"We are sitting in Kazimierz, founded by one of the Polish kings in 1335; we are surrounded by seven beautiful synagogues built mostly in the baroque and Renaissance periods. Poland, and especially Krakow, was proud of cultural pluralism \u2013 a lot of people lived here: Poles, Jews, Russians, Armenians, all kinds of guys, and they lived together, and they respected each other.\"That's what I'm trying to explore and what I'm trying to keep. Everything was mixed, everything was intertwined before the second world war; almost everything.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Pope John Paul II", "Holocaust", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Europe", "World news", "The papacy"], "title": "A Jewish renaissance in Poland"},{"date": "2011-04-04T06:00:13Z", "country": "poland", "content": "There are 38.4 million people in Poland and its population is falling \u2013 the birth rate has plunged dramatically since the fall of the iron curtain and many of the million or so Poles who left after EU accession in 2004 have yet to return. Compared with most other European countries, Poland has not attracted many immigrants either. According to the last census in 2002, 96.7% of the country are Polish, with the main ethnic minorities hailing from Germany, Ukraine and Belarus. Though the proportion of foreigners is thought to have increased slightly in the past nine years, Poland remains an almost exclusively white, Catholic country.Poland is currently enjoying its second \"economic miracle\". Twenty-one years after Solidarity leaders gambled successfully on the \"big bang\", ushering in free market capitalism overnight on New Year's Day 1990, the economy they created has beaten the odds. Alone in the whole EU it continued to grow through the recession of the past two years. Last year the economy grew by nearly 4%, and is projected to do even better this year. The country has EU investment to thank, as well as a construction boom driven by the need to prepare for the 2012 European football championships.Poland negotiated its way out of communism at the famous \"round table\" talks in 1989, but it only got round to drafting a comprehensive new constitution for the \"third republic\" in 1997. It is a self-conscious casting off of the communist past, rejecting the failed experiments in collectivisation by explicitly making the \"family farm\" the foundation of the agrarian economy. The system is semi-presidential. The presidency has more power than Germany's but less than the French Elys\u00e9e. The proportional representation elections to the lower house of parliament (the Sejm) produced two decades of shaky short-lived coalitions and continual spats between parliament and president. By those standards, the current period counts as the most stable in modern Polish history.Polish politics is currently a two-horse race. The party now in power is the liberal Civic Platform, led by the football-playing prime minister Donald Tusk. The president, Bronislaw Komorowski, is from the same party. These two took over from one of the world's more eccentric political double acts, the identical Kaczynski twins Jaroslaw and Lech, child actors who grew up to become prime minister and president respectively. Lech was killed in the Smolensk air crash last year, which his grieving brother still believes was more than an accident. In the general election this autumn, Jaroslaw will try to regain the premiership with his conservative Law and Justice party. Minor parties have names which hark back to bygone days, such as The League of Polish Families and Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland.Food and drinkSurely one of the underrated gems of European cuisine, Polish food is distinctive, and can be superb. The classic soup, zurek, is made of rye flour left to ferment in water for a few days. Mixed with stock and marjoram, with bits of kielbasa (sausage) and hard-boiled egg floating on the bottom, it can be addictive. Pierogi (ravioli) are a food group of their own \u2013 arguably the best variety being stuffed with minced cabbage and wild mushrooms (the object of a near-mystical reverence). Apart from the ubiquitous kebab, the Polish fast food of choice is the Zapiekanka, a baguette topped with melted cheese and mushrooms and smothered in ketchup. Vodka is not the dominant drink of yore. Its place has been taken by imported wine and excellent local beers, like Okocim, Zywiec and a crop of new micro-breweries.Poland has succumbed to the same guilty pleasures as much of the rest of the world. Billboards in the cities are advertising the new series of X Factor, and Taniec z Gwiazdami (Dancing with the Stars) is one of Poland's biggest shows. Though the majority of Polish cinemas spurn homegrown films in favour of Hollywood blockbusters, the indigenous film industry is in passable health. The National Film School in Lodz is still producing decent directors, though none of its alumni have ever replicated the worldwide success of Roman Polanski, Krzysztof \"Three Colors\" Kieslowski and Andrzej Wajda, whose film school in Warsaw now rivals his alma mater. Polish pop music does not travel well, but dominates the charts at home. Probably the most popular Polish band is Kult, whose thoughtful (if unusual) mix of punk, rock, jazz and poetry has been popular for almost 30 years. Poland's answer to Britney Spears is Doda, a busty and litigious 27-year-old (pictured top right) with a hellraising reputation.Polish men think of themselves as chivalrous and romantic, which is true up to a point. Women certainly shouldn't expect to have to open any doors during a visit to Poland, and will very likely receive flowers from any suitors. These days, though, men tend to shake rather than kiss a woman's hand when they meet. Premarital sex goes on but is not talked about much \u2013 outside the increasingly secular Warsaw, at least \u2013 and many parents are often unhappy when their offspring move in with their partners before getting wed. Abortions are illegal (apart from in rape cases or for health reasons), and contraception is not promoted. Sex education in schools is still referred to euphemistically as \"education for life and family\". Homophobia is still a problem: this year the ruling party had to expel an MP for abusive comments about gay people.Foreign policy has understandably been shaped by the repeated experience of being invaded (see below). An attempt to put history to rest ended in disaster a year ago when the plane taking President Lech Kaczynski to a joint Polish-Russian commemoration of the Katyn massacre crashed at Smolensk, killing not just the president but much of the military leadership. Ex-prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski outraged the Germans by suggesting that Poland's 6 million war victims should be taken into account when apportioning EU voting rights. Last month, the foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, called for historic resentments to be put aside and for Poland to do business with its neighbours like a normal country. It is still too early to say if that will work.It would be fair to say that history has not treated Poland kindly. Occupying the flat space between Germany and Russia, Poland is near-impossible to defend. The Commonwealth, as it calls itself, was swallowed up entirely in 1795 by the Russians, Prussians and Austrians and did not resurface until 1918. The \"second republic\" between the wars was an uneasy experience. Soviet conquest was narrowly averted in a 1920 battle on the outskirts of Warsaw, now known as \"the miracle on the Vistula\". The hero of the hour, Jozef Pilsudski, went on to stage a coup and dominated Poland between the wars. What followed was unmitigated disaster. Poland was carved up by Hitler and Stalin, who turned it into a killing field. Six million Poles \u2013 3 million Jewish and 3 million Catholic \u2013 were exterminated, including in the Soviets' execution of almost the entire officer corps at Katyn in 1940, a massacre Moscow blamed on the Nazis. At the war's end, Stalin swallowed Poland whole. One revolt after another was crushed until a now famous electrician climbed over the wall of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk and called for a strike. Lech Walesa and Solidarity were instrumental in bringing down communism not just in Poland but across eastern Europe, and Poles are not about to let Europe forget it.The Polish psyche is not given to optimism \u2013 perhaps to be expected given the centuries of oppression, invasions and foreign rule. This pessimism is best demonstrated in the common title of the Polish national anthem, Jeszcze Polska nie zginela, which means Poland\u00a0Has\u00a0Not Yet Perished. Be warned that if you ask Poles how they are, they will probably tell you the truth, and it may take some time. The classic Polish answer to \"How are you?\" is \"Stara bieda\" which literally means \"old poverty\". Poles are also less\u00a0afraid\u00a0of conversational silences than Britons. Most of all, Poles are generous and hospitable and proud of their country surviving against the\u00a0odds.", "tags": ["Poland"], "title": "Poland at a glance"},{"date": "2011-04-08T23:04:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In the 19th century, Lower Silesia (the bottom left-hand corner of Poland) was a prized piece of the German empire. After King Wilhelm's brother built himself a summer palace here in 1822, every Prussian nobleman had to build one too, complete with English-style park, artificial ruins and romantic temples.Drive through the valley around Jelenia Gora and you'll find a crumbling castle every few miles. You could buy one and spend the next decade doing it up, or just stay the night in one of the restored palace hotels.Lomnica Palace (+48 75 713 0460, palac-lomnica.pl/en) has doubles from \u00a355 B&B, or Hotel Palac Staniszow (+48 75 755 8445, palacstaniszow.pl/en) has doubles from \u00a370 B&B. You'll eat dinner by candlelight reflected in polished stone floors, climb gothic carved timber staircases to bed, and sleep deeply to the sound of the wind in 100-year-old lime trees.Classical music nuts will thrill to the baroque abbey in Krzeszow, east of Jelenia Gora. Here, precious original manuscripts from Berlin (including a quarter of all Mozart's works) were kept out of range of Allied bombers during the second world war.Park in the resort of Karpacz, a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Wroclaw, then take the chairlift (ignore the sneering locals who climb on foot as a matter of national pride). Hike the last kilometre to the highest peak of Sniezka, through which Poland's southern border runs. There's a flying-saucer-shaped Soviet-era cafe on top, with views north across Poland and south into the Czech Republic. In communist times this border was guarded by Russian soldiers with rifles. Kids would put a foot across the line then brag that they had been abroad. At a time when hardly anyone had a passport to travel, it was a bitter joke. Now the border is lost in long grass.It's a 45-minute walk to an isolated valley known as Samotnia, or \"the lonely place\". For around \u00a315 you can have a double room in the wooden chalet here, Schronisko Samotnia (+48 75 761 9376, samotnia.com.pl/en). There's a cosy restaurant, or you can eat outside on benches by the lake.Leba is a small fishing village and resort on the Baltic coast, where you walk through pine forests to the beach. Kids queue to buy rurki z kremem, yummy cigar-shaped waffle tubes filled with vanilla cream. You can hunt for lumps of amber (fossilised tree resin) in the vast, lunar sand dunes where Rommel is said to have practised desert warfare, or watch families sheltering from the stiff Baltic breeze. Hotel Neptun (+48 59 866 1432, neptunhotel.pl/en) is the only hotel/castle in Poland built on a beach, and offers dinner, bed and breakfast for two from around \u00a395 a night.It was in nearby Gdansk that brave shipbuilders (encouraged by a forward-thinking Pope) first stood up to their communist occupiers. Light a candle in the austere St Bridget's church, where Solidarity members once gathered in secret, and spot red Solidarity flags peaking out from corners of this old traders' city, a reminder that this is where the end of the cold war began.Zamosc, near the eastern border with Ukraine, grew from one man's dream to build a perfect, Renaissance city. Local noble Jan Zamojski hired Italian architect Bernardo Morando for the job in 1580. The result is stunning \u2013 think your own private Padua, without the queues. Book a room on the arcaded main square and sit in the window with a bottle of champagne, toasting the brides who marry every couple of hours on the staircase of the pink town hall. Or visit the fabulous old synagogue on Zamenhofa, built by Sephardic Jews from Venice in the time of Shakespeare. Orbis Zamojski (+48 84 639 2516, accorhotels.com/gb) has basic doubles for around \u00a340 room only, but pay a bit more for the corner suite with a view of the town hall.Polish composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (his dad was French) was born in Zelazowa Wola, not far from Warsaw. Visit his house (+48 46 863 3300, chopin.museum/en/museum/branches/id/216), a typical 19th-century Polish nobleman's house, or dworek. Sit in the garden with its stream and dragonflies, and listen to a nocturne on a warm summer evening (there are regular concerts). Chopin left Poland in 1831 and never returned. He lived in Paris, along with other Polish exiles, and the nostalgic music he wrote there still has the power to carry any Polish migrant back home whenever it is played.Cucumber season (sezon ogorkowy) is how Poles describe the long summer months when schools, theatres and pretty much everything else shuts down and there is nothing to do but watch cucumbers growing. Warm sunshine arrives (finally), pierogi (dumplings) are filled with blueberries, and soup is made from young beetroot shoots. It's the perfect time to get lost in the heart of Poland. First buy a picnic \u2013 ideally cold smoked sausage, beer, rye bread and cherries.There are daily farmers' markets in the rynek or market squares of most small towns and villages, with wonderfully fresh piles of unwashed carrots, beetroot and cabbages. There will be smoked cheeses and sausages, and you can buy just a half or a third of a loaf of delicious rye bread if that is all you need for lunch. No need to label the produce \"organic\" \u2013 there is no other kind of farming here \u2013 and it is all truly seasonal.Drive south from Warsaw for a couple of hours, then turn off on to the smallest road you can find. Keep turning randomly right and left wherever you see a plaster saint in a shrine by the road, until your route peters out in the middle of a blossoming potato field. Get out with your picnic. Lie on the ground and watch the passing clouds overhead for further directions.Lodz (pronounced woodge) is where cinema greats Roman Polanski, Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Kieslowski went to film school. \"HollyLodz\" animators strongly influenced British TV \u2013 the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield (where Nick Park conceived Wallace & Gromit) ran regular exchanges in the 1980s. This newly groovy industrial town 120km south of Warsaw is turning its old fabric factories into hip apartments and studios. Walk the Polish equivalent of Hollywood Boulevard's Avenue of the Stars, Piotrkowska, and ask at the Film Commission (104 Piotrkowska, +48 42 638 5546, lodzfilmcommission.com) to go on the free Lodz Film Heritage Trail (Saturdays only).You can visit Lancut castle (+48 17 225 2008, zamek-lancut.pl/en), the historical heart of the elegant Polish aristocracy in the south-east corner of Poland, as long as you are prepared to shuffle round the parquet floors with protective slippers over your shoes. It was originally built by the Lubomirski dynasty (complete with exquisite tiny theatre), then extended by the Potockis into one of the grandest residences in Europe.Forget the rococo palaces and green gardens, it is Wolsztyn that many people (well, blokes mainly) want to visit. Towards the centre of the country, it is the only place in Europe that still operates a scheduled train service using steam locomotives. You can actually drive your own loco, and 40+-year-old boys from Texas to Amsterdam flock here to try footplating and shunting, far away from their day jobs, health and safety, and wives who just don't get it. The Wolsztyn Experience (01628 524876, thewolsztynexperience.org) has one-week courses from \u00a38250/week, and weekends from \u00a3130,, including accommodation, some in the depot. Alternatively, the nearby Hotel Wolsztyn Palace (+48 68 346 9358, www.palacwolsztyn.com.pl) has doubles for around \u00a370 B&B, and there is a fairyland of lakes, apple orchards and windmills to explore to the south.\u2022 Filmmaker and writer Simon Target is co-author with his Polish wife Beata Zatorska of Rose Petal Jam: Recipes & Stories from a Summer in Poland, published this week by Tabula Books, price \u00a325.

But unless I've missed it somewhere, the explanation smallpox demanded didn't seem to materialise. I'm no Spanish specialist, but the barriers to publication with which women have struggled in the UK since Miguel de Cervantes set out his blueprint for fiction are surely equally fearsome in the land of Sancho Panza. All the more reason to join with goldgathers in saluting Ediciones Torremozas, \"who publish poetry and short stories by women writers\".This week, though, the World literature tour comes into its own, as it heads into territory which is \u2013 at least to me \u2013 basically unknown. I'll mutter Witold Gombrowicz, hum and haw at Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, and tentatively suggest Michal Witkowski's recently-translated Lovetown, but the only thing I can really recommend about Polish literature is a marvellous short story by Michal Olszewski, wonderfully translated by Antonia Lloyd Jones, which we ran as part of a series of short stories to commemorate the fall of the Berlin wall a couple of years back.So it's over to you. As before, we're looking for the books which shed light on the Polish experience \u2013 fiction, non-fiction, poems and plays \u2013 whether written by those who'd call themselves Poles, or not. Just make your way down the page to the boxes of magic, fill in a country \u2013 that's Poland \u2013 an author, a title, maybe a translator and some indication of why it's a book you'd recommend. Then the elves will fly, the cogs will turn and hey presto, there'll be a list of knowledge, just like the one we made for Spain. After that the only issue will be where to head next.So tell us: where would you like to go next? Tell us in the comments, and we'll head wherever you fancy.

There are restaurants with Hebrew lettering, a new community centre where students drop in for a Sabbath meal, and even a Jewish kindergarten. And once a year, this quarter is dominated by a celebration of Jewish music, theatre and film that attracts up to 13,000 visitors.Krakow's Jewish Culture festival is the most prominent symbol of an apparent rejuvenation in the shadow of the Holocaust. This is the nearest Polish city to Auschwitz, but it has also become a place where Poles are discovering their lost Jewish heritage.The Jewish community centre on Miodowa Street, neighbouring a synagogue defiled by the Nazis but now restored for worship, has seen a steady stream of visitors. Opened in 2008 by Prince Charles, the centre offers Hebrew and Yiddish language lessons and an introductory religious course, alongside yoga, belly-dancing and basketball.Jonathan Ornstein, the centre's director, says: \"I think that people for a few years have been talking about a Jewish renaissance in Poland, in Krakow especially, and that was primarily an interest by non-Jews in Jewish culture, and I think that now we're in a second stage that is totally made possible by this first stage. That's people with Jewish roots getting involved in the Jewish community.\"Ornstein says the centre has young people coming in every day who have no contact with Jewish life but want to explore their Jewish roots. One local rabbi tells a story of a Pole who discovered from his mother's birth certificate that she was Jewish, born in Krakow's wartime ghetto. She told him that she had kept it a secret all her life \u2013 and then they discovered that the man's father was Jewish, too.There are reckoned to be slightly more than 100 official members of the Jewish community in Krakow, but 400 who consider themselves Jewish.The precursor of this renewal has been the festival, now in its 21st year. It is an event that looks both ways, embracing klezmer music and Yiddish movies of the past, but also seeking out the avant garde. This year that includes a \"hip-hop meets klezmer\" act from the US as well as workshops in Hebrew calligraphy, Jewish cooking and singing, all allowing the audience to get involved.It acts as a reminder to Poles that their culture is not a \"monolith\", says the festival's director, Janusz Makuch, citing the influential Jewish songwriter Mordechai Gebirtig as one example. \"Gebirtig composed a lot of beautiful songs, sung by the Poles. When Poles sang these tunes, they didn't realise they sang a Jewish song.\"Instead of [being] a hermetic culture, the secular Jewish culture was intertwined with Polish culture.\"One of this year's performers, Jarek Bester, of the Bester Quartet, describes his sound as contemporary chamber music that reinterprets traditional Yiddish folk. On CD it is a mix of plaintive violin and thundering accordion.Bester says: \"[The Holocaust] was a kind of intermission in composing and playing klezmer music. I'm trying to provide a continuation of klezmer \u2013 I think the way we play is how klezmer music would be played, if it wasn't for the second world war.\"Jewish life in Krakow, nearly extinguished by the Nazis, was driven underground in the communist era. Kazimierz, where Schindler's List was filmed, was a neglected and under-populated district under communism. In recent years it has been transformed into one of the hippest parts of the city. Pavements are crowded with cafe tables and streets are lined with vodka bars, vintage boutiques and tiny art galleries. Only the peeling plaster and brickwork of some of the facades gives away the past neglect, and that is rapidly being patched up.Jewishness has been adopted as a selling point, almost a badge of cool, in a way that is sometimes tasteless. Converted golf carts tout for tourist custom with awnings displaying the itinerary: \"Auschwitz, Schindler's factory, Jewish quarter.\" A local rabbi, Eliezer Gurary, spoke of his disquiet at the Jewish mannequins in shops \u2013 dolls of black-robed, bearded men that border on racist caricature. There have been complaints over a \"Jewish-themed\" restaurant that displays a page of the Torah on its wall.At the community centre, Ornstein says: \"You have some fake Jewish-style restaurants, and I would love those to be restaurants run by Jews, kosher restaurants and actually be realistic. I think that's a way off, [but] we're moving in that direction. These days in Poland the fact that you can call a restaurant a Jewish restaurant and that brings people in, is in itself a positive thing.\"I think the remarkable thing here is that you have a community that's growing, that's optimistic, that feels very safe, and it's going in a direction which is very different to most Jewish communities in Europe.\"A survey conducted last year by the Polish Public Opinion Poll Institute indicated a decline in antisemitism among all age groups over the decade. The poll, which asked questions intended to uncover people's belief in Jewish \"influence\" over Polish politics, found that fewer than 6% mentioned Jewish people when asked about influential minorities, compared with nearly 20% in 2002.Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, believes that the opinion polls on antisemitism fail to show the underlying change in Polish attitudes. \"The flaw in all these surveys is that \u2013 let's say they show that 20% of Poles have antisemitic attitudes \u2013 everyone misses what the other 80% is thinking,\" Schudrich says at his office at the Warsaw synagogue. \"Are they indifferent or are they appalled by the 20%? And it seems to me more and more people are raising their rejection of these antisemitic trends. That's mostly due to John Paul II, who did more to fight antisemitism than anyone in the last 2,000 years.\"Schudrich, who was born in New York and first came to Poland in 1992, believes that the late Polish pope, who will be beatified on 1 May, made indifference to antisemitism less acceptable in the Catholic mainstream.\"John Paul II empowered all those people who found it abhorrent,\" he says. The rabbi believes he is seeing a subtle, slow but telling transformation in the relationship between Polish Jews and the wider community.\"I get these calls from town X saying: 'We feel an obligation to perpetuate the memory of the Jews who once lived here.' It used to be: 'What can be done to clean your cemetery.' Now it's: 'What can be done to clean our cemetery.'\"On Tuesday the chief rabbi was in the eastern Polish town of Zamosc, along with ambassadors from the US, Germany and Israel, at the restoration of a 17th-century synagogue. The building is considered a jewel of Renaissance architecture, and will house a Polish Jewish cultural centre.Schudrich chooses his words carefully when talking about Golden Harvest, a controversial new book by a Princeton University professor, Jan Gross, about Poles who dug up the mass graves of Jews killed in the Holocaust looking for gold and precious stones.\"It's important to talk about this subject. Some people did horrific things, but we knew this already. The question is: was it rampant? In Treblinka and in Birkenau, was it the same 50 people doing this each time, or a different 50 people?\" Schudrich says. \"You could come away with the impression that everyone did it.\"And were they doing it because the victims were Jews, or because the Nazis destroyed any sense of morality so everything was permitted? I don't know. Gross writes in a way to provoke, not to educate, and Poles don't react well to it. Because of the style, too many people reject what he has to say.\"On a bright afternoon recently in Kazimierz a boy in a kippah (skullcap) walked along the street where a few hours earlier a golf cart filled with tourists had trundled past. Poland was once home to the second largest Jewish community in the world, and any revival is the faintest echo of what was destroyed \u2013 but it is a source of great pride to a city with 700 years of Jewish history.Makuch, of the Jewish Culture festival, says: \"We are sitting in Kazimierz, founded by one of the Polish kings in 1335; we are surrounded by seven beautiful synagogues built mostly in the baroque and Renaissance periods. Poland, and especially Krakow, was proud of cultural pluralism \u2013 a lot of people lived here: Poles, Jews, Russians, Armenians, all kinds of guys, and they lived together, and they respected each other.\"That's what I'm trying to explore and what I'm trying to keep. Everything was mixed, everything was intertwined before the second world war; almost everything.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Pope John Paul II", "Holocaust", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Europe", "World news", "The papacy"], "title": "A Jewish renaissance in Poland"},{"date": "2011-04-04T07:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A few weeks ago, Gazeta Wyborcza launched a new bestseller list. If it serves as a measure of the condition of Polish literature, one could say that we have come down with the same illness as the rest of the world: crime Larssonosis, romance-gastronomic Gilbertosis and vampiric Meyerosis. Vampires in particular featured heavily in the ratings; this should be a source of delight for us, as vampires are a Slavic invention. One can learn about their heritage from The Vampire: A Symbolic Biography by Maria Janion, one of the most outstanding Polish scholars of literary Romanticism. If this invaluable work were translated into English (what a pity you haven't translated it yet), the followers of Stephenie Meyer would have a chance to refresh their knowledge of creatures that balance between life and death. We call them \"upiory\", \"strzygi\", \"brukolaki\" or \"wapierze\".The launch of our bestseller list coincided with the publication of a book that caused enormous controversy: Golden Harvest by Jan Tomasz Gross and Irena Grudzinska-Gross. The scandal broke even before it appeared in bookshops. Its subject is the participation of Poles in the so-called third phase of the Holocaust, when Poles denounced their Jewish neighbours (Neighbours is the title of the first of Gross's books about the relations between Poles and Jews during the second world war) to pillage their property. Even their graves. This book has been taken by many as a blow to the image of Poles as innocent victims of the Nazis. And \u2013 as the authors emphasise \u2013 plundering Jewish property was common throughout Europe.The Holocaust in Polish literature means primarily Hanna Krall, who ever since her book Shielding the Flame \u2013 a record of interviews with Marek Edelman, one of the leaders of the Warsaw ghetto uprising \u2013 has been producing volumes of brilliant stories about the fate of Poland's Jews. Each of these stories contains enough material for a novel, but Krall has the ability to distil the tragic and sometimes grotesque essence from the life of her heroes. Her next book, White Maria, will be published in a few weeks.Krall started as a reporter, which is typical of Poland's flourishing non-fiction scene. She is still associated first and foremost with reportage, which in Poland is considered to be a genre somewhere between journalism and literature. Reading her books makes you wonder whether you are reading non-fiction or poetry.This genre-busting nature of Polish reportage is also the source of many misunderstandings. When a biography of Poland's most eminent reporter (and the best-known Polish writer worldwide), Ryszard Kapuscinski, came out last year (Kapuscinski Non-fiction by Artur Domos\u0142awski), it provoked many arguments, including about the reporter's competence. To what degree should a reporter be just a witness, and to what degree an author who includes his or her own outlook, interpretations and literary style? Where does journalism (non-fiction) end, and literary fiction begin? This dispute remains unsettled, just like many other arguments provoked by Domos\u0142awski's book, such as the controversy over the attitudes that journalists and writers adopted during the communist years, or the extent to which a biographer can explore the personal life of his or her subject.Regardless of the gravity of the charges against the so-called Polish School of Reportage, of which Kapuscinski was the most prominent representative, it is in good condition. Though it is ever rarer in the Polish press, it transfers relatively well to books. Successors of Kapuscinski \u2013 Mariusz Szczygie\u0142, Jacek Hugo-Bader, Wojciech Tochman \u2013 appear near the\u00a0top of the bestseller lists, and their\u00a0works have been translated into\u00a0all of the major European languages. So reportage is still a Polish speciality, although reporters tend now to wander the world and through history in their search for interesting subjects. Szczygie\u0142 devoted his book Gottland (winner of the 2009 European Book prize) to the conflicting attitudes that Czechs adopt towards communism; Hugo-Bader has travelled through a drink-sodden post-Soviet Russia (White Heat); while Tochman has analysed the consequences of the genocide in Rwanda (We Will Portray Death Today). Young writers are following their lead: in Murderer from the Apricot City, Witold Szab\u0142owski reports on the cultural clashes and conflicts that divide contemporary Turkey as it attempts to join the European Union.Poland's own accession to the EU, meanwhile, has resulted in a level of economic migration that has not yet been fully reflected in our literature. The only books that come to mind are a trilogy by one of Poland's most outstanding poets and essayists, Jaros\u0142aw Marek Rymkiewicz, who has tried to vaccinate Poles against the supposed loss of national identity that some feared membership would bring. In Kinderszenen Rymkiewicz ostensibly emotionlessly recounts some of the bloodiest episodes from Polish history \u2013 first of all the 1944 Warsaw uprising (not to be confused with the Warsaw ghetto uprising), which cost the lives of 200,000 people \u2013 and tries to make these victims a foundation for modern Polish society.However, the literary mainstream is made up of authors who follow Witold Gombrowicz, who teaches distance from those models of Polish identity. Janusz Rudnicki, Marcin Swietlicki, Micha\u0142 Witkowski and Jerzy Pilch are writers who find their own ironic ways of dealing with our literary tradition. The most important writer of this group is Pilch \u2013 not only because of his novels, but also because of his position as the country's leading columnist. In view of the vanishing significance of literary criticism, which is now found only in niche magazines, and \u2013 I must admit with a heavy heart \u2013 the claustrophobia that affects newspapers' cultural pages, Pilch is considered an authority on literature.Dorota Mas\u0142owska owes him a lot. Her White and Red was the most important debut to appear in the first 20 years after independence. It is seemingly a realist novel about the dregs of society, but in fact the broken language of its heroes, full of references to pop culture and different subcultures, perfectly reflects the chaotic consciousness of all Poles living through those days of political and social transformation. Her second novel, The Queen's Peacock, won the Nike, Poland's most important literary award. It's worth stressing here that awards are another substitute for literary criticism, though this is by no means an exclusively Polish phenomenon. The list of Nike laureates gives quite a reliable insight into the most important trends and names in Polish literature. Take poetry, which competes on equal terms with novels and essays for the title of the best book of the year. It is significant that the last two Nobel prizes for literature won by Poles went to poets: Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz (1981) and Wis\u0142awa Szymborska (1996).Who is likely to win the Nike award this year? Balladyny i romanse (\"Ballads and Romances\") by the young novelist Ignacy Karowicz is my favourite. It is an ironic story about gods from various large and small religions who decide to give up immortality and begin living a \"normal\" life among Poles. However, these gods share suspiciously Polish notions about the citizens of western Europe. Is life in a block of flats with worn-out gods, who desperately look to find their own place in the world, a metaphor for our presence in the European Union?1 The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown2 Nie potrafie schudnac by Pierre Dukan (diet book)3 Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert4 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson5 Zielone drzwi (Green Door) by Katarzyna Grochola (novel from \"queen of Polish fem-pulp\")Total 2010 book sales 133m", "tags": ["Publishing", "Books", "Culture"], "title": "What they're reading in Poland"},{"date": "2011-04-04T06:00:13Z", "country": "poland", "content": "There are 38.4 million people in Poland and its population is falling \u2013 the birth rate has plunged dramatically since the fall of the iron curtain and many of the million or so Poles who left after EU accession in 2004 have yet to return. Compared with most other European countries, Poland has not attracted many immigrants either. According to the last census in 2002, 96.7% of the country are Polish, with the main ethnic minorities hailing from Germany, Ukraine and Belarus. Though the proportion of foreigners is thought to have increased slightly in the past nine years, Poland remains an almost exclusively white, Catholic country.Poland is currently enjoying its second \"economic miracle\". Twenty-one years after Solidarity leaders gambled successfully on the \"big bang\", ushering in free market capitalism overnight on New Year's Day 1990, the economy they created has beaten the odds. Alone in the whole EU it continued to grow through the recession of the past two years. Last year the economy grew by nearly 4%, and is projected to do even better this year. The country has EU investment to thank, as well as a construction boom driven by the need to prepare for the 2012 European football championships.Poland negotiated its way out of communism at the famous \"round table\" talks in 1989, but it only got round to drafting a comprehensive new constitution for the \"third republic\" in 1997. It is a self-conscious casting off of the communist past, rejecting the failed experiments in collectivisation by explicitly making the \"family farm\" the foundation of the agrarian economy. The system is semi-presidential. The presidency has more power than Germany's but less than the French Elys\u00e9e. The proportional representation elections to the lower house of parliament (the Sejm) produced two decades of shaky short-lived coalitions and continual spats between parliament and president. By those standards, the current period counts as the most stable in modern Polish history.Polish politics is currently a two-horse race. The party now in power is the liberal Civic Platform, led by the football-playing prime minister Donald Tusk. The president, Bronislaw Komorowski, is from the same party. These two took over from one of the world's more eccentric political double acts, the identical Kaczynski twins Jaroslaw and Lech, child actors who grew up to become prime minister and president respectively. Lech was killed in the Smolensk air crash last year, which his grieving brother still believes was more than an accident. In the general election this autumn, Jaroslaw will try to regain the premiership with his conservative Law and Justice party. Minor parties have names which hark back to bygone days, such as The League of Polish Families and Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland.Food and drinkSurely one of the underrated gems of European cuisine, Polish food is distinctive, and can be superb. The classic soup, zurek, is made of rye flour left to ferment in water for a few days. Mixed with stock and marjoram, with bits of kielbasa (sausage) and hard-boiled egg floating on the bottom, it can be addictive. Pierogi (ravioli) are a food group of their own \u2013 arguably the best variety being stuffed with minced cabbage and wild mushrooms (the object of a near-mystical reverence). Apart from the ubiquitous kebab, the Polish fast food of choice is the Zapiekanka, a baguette topped with melted cheese and mushrooms and smothered in ketchup. Vodka is not the dominant drink of yore. Its place has been taken by imported wine and excellent local beers, like Okocim, Zywiec and a crop of new micro-breweries.Poland has succumbed to the same guilty pleasures as much of the rest of the world. Billboards in the cities are advertising the new series of X Factor, and Taniec z Gwiazdami (Dancing with the Stars) is one of Poland's biggest shows. Though the majority of Polish cinemas spurn homegrown films in favour of Hollywood blockbusters, the indigenous film industry is in passable health. The National Film School in Lodz is still producing decent directors, though none of its alumni have ever replicated the worldwide success of Roman Polanski, Krzysztof \"Three Colors\" Kieslowski and Andrzej Wajda, whose film school in Warsaw now rivals his alma mater. Polish pop music does not travel well, but dominates the charts at home. Probably the most popular Polish band is Kult, whose thoughtful (if unusual) mix of punk, rock, jazz and poetry has been popular for almost 30 years. Poland's answer to Britney Spears is Doda, a busty and litigious 27-year-old (pictured top right) with a hellraising reputation.Polish men think of themselves as chivalrous and romantic, which is true up to a point. Women certainly shouldn't expect to have to open any doors during a visit to Poland, and will very likely receive flowers from any suitors. These days, though, men tend to shake rather than kiss a woman's hand when they meet. Premarital sex goes on but is not talked about much \u2013 outside the increasingly secular Warsaw, at least \u2013 and many parents are often unhappy when their offspring move in with their partners before getting wed. Abortions are illegal (apart from in rape cases or for health reasons), and contraception is not promoted. Sex education in schools is still referred to euphemistically as \"education for life and family\". Homophobia is still a problem: this year the ruling party had to expel an MP for abusive comments about gay people.Foreign policy has understandably been shaped by the repeated experience of being invaded (see below). An attempt to put history to rest ended in disaster a year ago when the plane taking President Lech Kaczynski to a joint Polish-Russian commemoration of the Katyn massacre crashed at Smolensk, killing not just the president but much of the military leadership. Ex-prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski outraged the Germans by suggesting that Poland's 6 million war victims should be taken into account when apportioning EU voting rights. Last month, the foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, called for historic resentments to be put aside and for Poland to do business with its neighbours like a normal country. It is still too early to say if that will work.It would be fair to say that history has not treated Poland kindly. Occupying the flat space between Germany and Russia, Poland is near-impossible to defend. The Commonwealth, as it calls itself, was swallowed up entirely in 1795 by the Russians, Prussians and Austrians and did not resurface until 1918. The \"second republic\" between the wars was an uneasy experience. Soviet conquest was narrowly averted in a 1920 battle on the outskirts of Warsaw, now known as \"the miracle on the Vistula\". The hero of the hour, Jozef Pilsudski, went on to stage a coup and dominated Poland between the wars. What followed was unmitigated disaster. Poland was carved up by Hitler and Stalin, who turned it into a killing field. Six million Poles \u2013 3 million Jewish and 3 million Catholic \u2013 were exterminated, including in the Soviets' execution of almost the entire officer corps at Katyn in 1940, a massacre Moscow blamed on the Nazis. At the war's end, Stalin swallowed Poland whole. One revolt after another was crushed until a now famous electrician climbed over the wall of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk and called for a strike. Lech Walesa and Solidarity were instrumental in bringing down communism not just in Poland but across eastern Europe, and Poles are not about to let Europe forget it.The Polish psyche is not given to optimism \u2013 perhaps to be expected given the centuries of oppression, invasions and foreign rule. This pessimism is best demonstrated in the common title of the Polish national anthem, Jeszcze Polska nie zginela, which means Poland\u00a0Has\u00a0Not Yet Perished. Be warned that if you ask Poles how they are, they will probably tell you the truth, and it may take some time. The classic Polish answer to \"How are you?\" is \"Stara bieda\" which literally means \"old poverty\". Poles are also less\u00a0afraid\u00a0of conversational silences than Britons. Most of all, Poles are generous and hospitable and proud of their country surviving against the\u00a0odds.", "tags": ["Poland"], "title": "Poland at a glance"},{"date": "2011-04-08T23:04:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In the 19th century, Lower Silesia (the bottom left-hand corner of Poland) was a prized piece of the German empire. After King Wilhelm's brother built himself a summer palace here in 1822, every Prussian nobleman had to build one too, complete with English-style park, artificial ruins and romantic temples.Drive through the valley around Jelenia Gora and you'll find a crumbling castle every few miles. You could buy one and spend the next decade doing it up, or just stay the night in one of the restored palace hotels.Lomnica Palace (+48 75 713 0460, palac-lomnica.pl/en) has doubles from \u00a355 B&B, or Hotel Palac Staniszow (+48 75 755 8445, palacstaniszow.pl/en) has doubles from \u00a370 B&B. You'll eat dinner by candlelight reflected in polished stone floors, climb gothic carved timber staircases to bed, and sleep deeply to the sound of the wind in 100-year-old lime trees.Classical music nuts will thrill to the baroque abbey in Krzeszow, east of Jelenia Gora. Here, precious original manuscripts from Berlin (including a quarter of all Mozart's works) were kept out of range of Allied bombers during the second world war.Park in the resort of Karpacz, a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Wroclaw, then take the chairlift (ignore the sneering locals who climb on foot as a matter of national pride). Hike the last kilometre to the highest peak of Sniezka, through which Poland's southern border runs. There's a flying-saucer-shaped Soviet-era cafe on top, with views north across Poland and south into the Czech Republic. In communist times this border was guarded by Russian soldiers with rifles. Kids would put a foot across the line then brag that they had been abroad. At a time when hardly anyone had a passport to travel, it was a bitter joke. Now the border is lost in long grass.It's a 45-minute walk to an isolated valley known as Samotnia, or \"the lonely place\". For around \u00a315 you can have a double room in the wooden chalet here, Schronisko Samotnia (+48 75 761 9376, samotnia.com.pl/en). There's a cosy restaurant, or you can eat outside on benches by the lake.Leba is a small fishing village and resort on the Baltic coast, where you walk through pine forests to the beach. Kids queue to buy rurki z kremem, yummy cigar-shaped waffle tubes filled with vanilla cream. You can hunt for lumps of amber (fossilised tree resin) in the vast, lunar sand dunes where Rommel is said to have practised desert warfare, or watch families sheltering from the stiff Baltic breeze. Hotel Neptun (+48 59 866 1432, neptunhotel.pl/en) is the only hotel/castle in Poland built on a beach, and offers dinner, bed and breakfast for two from around \u00a395 a night.It was in nearby Gdansk that brave shipbuilders (encouraged by a forward-thinking Pope) first stood up to their communist occupiers. Light a candle in the austere St Bridget's church, where Solidarity members once gathered in secret, and spot red Solidarity flags peaking out from corners of this old traders' city, a reminder that this is where the end of the cold war began.Zamosc, near the eastern border with Ukraine, grew from one man's dream to build a perfect, Renaissance city. Local noble Jan Zamojski hired Italian architect Bernardo Morando for the job in 1580. The result is stunning \u2013 think your own private Padua, without the queues. Book a room on the arcaded main square and sit in the window with a bottle of champagne, toasting the brides who marry every couple of hours on the staircase of the pink town hall. Or visit the fabulous old synagogue on Zamenhofa, built by Sephardic Jews from Venice in the time of Shakespeare. Orbis Zamojski (+48 84 639 2516, accorhotels.com/gb) has basic doubles for around \u00a340 room only, but pay a bit more for the corner suite with a view of the town hall.Polish composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (his dad was French) was born in Zelazowa Wola, not far from Warsaw. Visit his house (+48 46 863 3300, chopin.museum/en/museum/branches/id/216), a typical 19th-century Polish nobleman's house, or dworek. Sit in the garden with its stream and dragonflies, and listen to a nocturne on a warm summer evening (there are regular concerts). Chopin left Poland in 1831 and never returned. He lived in Paris, along with other Polish exiles, and the nostalgic music he wrote there still has the power to carry any Polish migrant back home whenever it is played.Cucumber season (sezon ogorkowy) is how Poles describe the long summer months when schools, theatres and pretty much everything else shuts down and there is nothing to do but watch cucumbers growing. Warm sunshine arrives (finally), pierogi (dumplings) are filled with blueberries, and soup is made from young beetroot shoots. It's the perfect time to get lost in the heart of Poland. First buy a picnic \u2013 ideally cold smoked sausage, beer, rye bread and cherries.There are daily farmers' markets in the rynek or market squares of most small towns and villages, with wonderfully fresh piles of unwashed carrots, beetroot and cabbages. There will be smoked cheeses and sausages, and you can buy just a half or a third of a loaf of delicious rye bread if that is all you need for lunch. No need to label the produce \"organic\" \u2013 there is no other kind of farming here \u2013 and it is all truly seasonal.Drive south from Warsaw for a couple of hours, then turn off on to the smallest road you can find. Keep turning randomly right and left wherever you see a plaster saint in a shrine by the road, until your route peters out in the middle of a blossoming potato field. Get out with your picnic. Lie on the ground and watch the passing clouds overhead for further directions.Lodz (pronounced woodge) is where cinema greats Roman Polanski, Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Kieslowski went to film school. \"HollyLodz\" animators strongly influenced British TV \u2013 the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield (where Nick Park conceived Wallace & Gromit) ran regular exchanges in the 1980s. This newly groovy industrial town 120km south of Warsaw is turning its old fabric factories into hip apartments and studios. Walk the Polish equivalent of Hollywood Boulevard's Avenue of the Stars, Piotrkowska, and ask at the Film Commission (104 Piotrkowska, +48 42 638 5546, lodzfilmcommission.com) to go on the free Lodz Film Heritage Trail (Saturdays only).You can visit Lancut castle (+48 17 225 2008, zamek-lancut.pl/en), the historical heart of the elegant Polish aristocracy in the south-east corner of Poland, as long as you are prepared to shuffle round the parquet floors with protective slippers over your shoes. It was originally built by the Lubomirski dynasty (complete with exquisite tiny theatre), then extended by the Potockis into one of the grandest residences in Europe.Forget the rococo palaces and green gardens, it is Wolsztyn that many people (well, blokes mainly) want to visit. Towards the centre of the country, it is the only place in Europe that still operates a scheduled train service using steam locomotives. You can actually drive your own loco, and 40+-year-old boys from Texas to Amsterdam flock here to try footplating and shunting, far away from their day jobs, health and safety, and wives who just don't get it. The Wolsztyn Experience (01628 524876, thewolsztynexperience.org) has one-week courses from \u00a38250/week, and weekends from \u00a3130,, including accommodation, some in the depot. Alternatively, the nearby Hotel Wolsztyn Palace (+48 68 346 9358, www.palacwolsztyn.com.pl) has doubles for around \u00a370 B&B, and there is a fairyland of lakes, apple orchards and windmills to explore to the south.\u2022 Filmmaker and writer Simon Target is co-author with his Polish wife Beata Zatorska of Rose Petal Jam: Recipes & Stories from a Summer in Poland, published this week by Tabula Books, price \u00a325.

The responses came thick and fast: goldgathers replied with Carmen Conde's Mujer sin Ed\u00e9n, Haarlson with Merc\u00e9 Rodoreda and Joan Margarit. But unless I've missed it somewhere, the explanation smallpox demanded didn't seem to materialise. I'm no Spanish specialist, but the barriers to publication with which women have struggled in the UK since Miguel de Cervantes set out his blueprint for fiction are surely equally fearsome in the land of Sancho Panza. All the more reason to join with goldgathers in saluting Ediciones Torremozas, \"who publish poetry and short stories by women writers\".This week, though, the World literature tour comes into its own, as it heads into territory which is \u2013 at least to me \u2013 basically unknown. I'll mutter Witold Gombrowicz, hum and haw at Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, and tentatively suggest Michal Witkowski's recently-translated Lovetown, but the only thing I can really recommend about Polish literature is a marvellous short story by Michal Olszewski, wonderfully translated by Antonia Lloyd Jones, which we ran as part of a series of short stories to commemorate the fall of the Berlin wall a couple of years back.So it's over to you. As before, we're looking for the books which shed light on the Polish experience \u2013 fiction, non-fiction, poems and plays \u2013 whether written by those who'd call themselves Poles, or not. Just make your way down the page to the boxes of magic, fill in a country \u2013 that's Poland \u2013 an author, a title, maybe a translator and some indication of why it's a book you'd recommend. Then the elves will fly, the cogs will turn and hey presto, there'll be a list of knowledge, just like the one we made for Spain. After that the only issue will be where to head next.So tell us: where would you like to go next? Tell us in the comments, and we'll head wherever you fancy.

There are restaurants with Hebrew lettering, a new community centre where students drop in for a Sabbath meal, and even a Jewish kindergarten. And once a year, this quarter is dominated by a celebration of Jewish music, theatre and film that attracts up to 13,000 visitors.Krakow's Jewish Culture festival is the most prominent symbol of an apparent rejuvenation in the shadow of the Holocaust. This is the nearest Polish city to Auschwitz, but it has also become a place where Poles are discovering their lost Jewish heritage.The Jewish community centre on Miodowa Street, neighbouring a synagogue defiled by the Nazis but now restored for worship, has seen a steady stream of visitors. Opened in 2008 by Prince Charles, the centre offers Hebrew and Yiddish language lessons and an introductory religious course, alongside yoga, belly-dancing and basketball.Jonathan Ornstein, the centre's director, says: \"I think that people for a few years have been talking about a Jewish renaissance in Poland, in Krakow especially, and that was primarily an interest by non-Jews in Jewish culture, and I think that now we're in a second stage that is totally made possible by this first stage. That's people with Jewish roots getting involved in the Jewish community.\"Ornstein says the centre has young people coming in every day who have no contact with Jewish life but want to explore their Jewish roots. One local rabbi tells a story of a Pole who discovered from his mother's birth certificate that she was Jewish, born in Krakow's wartime ghetto. She told him that she had kept it a secret all her life \u2013 and then they discovered that the man's father was Jewish, too.There are reckoned to be slightly more than 100 official members of the Jewish community in Krakow, but 400 who consider themselves Jewish.The precursor of this renewal has been the festival, now in its 21st year. It is an event that looks both ways, embracing klezmer music and Yiddish movies of the past, but also seeking out the avant garde. This year that includes a \"hip-hop meets klezmer\" act from the US as well as workshops in Hebrew calligraphy, Jewish cooking and singing, all allowing the audience to get involved.It acts as a reminder to Poles that their culture is not a \"monolith\", says the festival's director, Janusz Makuch, citing the influential Jewish songwriter Mordechai Gebirtig as one example. \"Gebirtig composed a lot of beautiful songs, sung by the Poles. When Poles sang these tunes, they didn't realise they sang a Jewish song.\"Instead of [being] a hermetic culture, the secular Jewish culture was intertwined with Polish culture.\"One of this year's performers, Jarek Bester, of the Bester Quartet, describes his sound as contemporary chamber music that reinterprets traditional Yiddish folk. On CD it is a mix of plaintive violin and thundering accordion.Bester says: \"[The Holocaust] was a kind of intermission in composing and playing klezmer music. I'm trying to provide a continuation of klezmer \u2013 I think the way we play is how klezmer music would be played, if it wasn't for the second world war.\"Jewish life in Krakow, nearly extinguished by the Nazis, was driven underground in the communist era. Kazimierz, where Schindler's List was filmed, was a neglected and under-populated district under communism. In recent years it has been transformed into one of the hippest parts of the city. Pavements are crowded with cafe tables and streets are lined with vodka bars, vintage boutiques and tiny art galleries. Only the peeling plaster and brickwork of some of the facades gives away the past neglect, and that is rapidly being patched up.Jewishness has been adopted as a selling point, almost a badge of cool, in a way that is sometimes tasteless. Converted golf carts tout for tourist custom with awnings displaying the itinerary: \"Auschwitz, Schindler's factory, Jewish quarter.\" A local rabbi, Eliezer Gurary, spoke of his disquiet at the Jewish mannequins in shops \u2013 dolls of black-robed, bearded men that border on racist caricature. There have been complaints over a \"Jewish-themed\" restaurant that displays a page of the Torah on its wall.At the community centre, Ornstein says: \"You have some fake Jewish-style restaurants, and I would love those to be restaurants run by Jews, kosher restaurants and actually be realistic. I think that's a way off, [but] we're moving in that direction. These days in Poland the fact that you can call a restaurant a Jewish restaurant and that brings people in, is in itself a positive thing.\"I think the remarkable thing here is that you have a community that's growing, that's optimistic, that feels very safe, and it's going in a direction which is very different to most Jewish communities in Europe.\"A survey conducted last year by the Polish Public Opinion Poll Institute indicated a decline in antisemitism among all age groups over the decade. The poll, which asked questions intended to uncover people's belief in Jewish \"influence\" over Polish politics, found that fewer than 6% mentioned Jewish people when asked about influential minorities, compared with nearly 20% in 2002.Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, believes that the opinion polls on antisemitism fail to show the underlying change in Polish attitudes. \"The flaw in all these surveys is that \u2013 let's say they show that 20% of Poles have antisemitic attitudes \u2013 everyone misses what the other 80% is thinking,\" Schudrich says at his office at the Warsaw synagogue. \"Are they indifferent or are they appalled by the 20%? And it seems to me more and more people are raising their rejection of these antisemitic trends. That's mostly due to John Paul II, who did more to fight antisemitism than anyone in the last 2,000 years.\"Schudrich, who was born in New York and first came to Poland in 1992, believes that the late Polish pope, who will be beatified on 1 May, made indifference to antisemitism less acceptable in the Catholic mainstream.\"John Paul II empowered all those people who found it abhorrent,\" he says. The rabbi believes he is seeing a subtle, slow but telling transformation in the relationship between Polish Jews and the wider community.\"I get these calls from town X saying: 'We feel an obligation to perpetuate the memory of the Jews who once lived here.' It used to be: 'What can be done to clean your cemetery.' Now it's: 'What can be done to clean our cemetery.'\"On Tuesday the chief rabbi was in the eastern Polish town of Zamosc, along with ambassadors from the US, Germany and Israel, at the restoration of a 17th-century synagogue. The building is considered a jewel of Renaissance architecture, and will house a Polish Jewish cultural centre.Schudrich chooses his words carefully when talking about Golden Harvest, a controversial new book by a Princeton University professor, Jan Gross, about Poles who dug up the mass graves of Jews killed in the Holocaust looking for gold and precious stones.\"It's important to talk about this subject. Some people did horrific things, but we knew this already. The question is: was it rampant? In Treblinka and in Birkenau, was it the same 50 people doing this each time, or a different 50 people?\" Schudrich says. \"You could come away with the impression that everyone did it.\"And were they doing it because the victims were Jews, or because the Nazis destroyed any sense of morality so everything was permitted? I don't know. Gross writes in a way to provoke, not to educate, and Poles don't react well to it. Because of the style, too many people reject what he has to say.\"On a bright afternoon recently in Kazimierz a boy in a kippah (skullcap) walked along the street where a few hours earlier a golf cart filled with tourists had trundled past. Poland was once home to the second largest Jewish community in the world, and any revival is the faintest echo of what was destroyed \u2013 but it is a source of great pride to a city with 700 years of Jewish history.Makuch, of the Jewish Culture festival, says: \"We are sitting in Kazimierz, founded by one of the Polish kings in 1335; we are surrounded by seven beautiful synagogues built mostly in the baroque and Renaissance periods. Poland, and especially Krakow, was proud of cultural pluralism \u2013 a lot of people lived here: Poles, Jews, Russians, Armenians, all kinds of guys, and they lived together, and they respected each other.\"That's what I'm trying to explore and what I'm trying to keep. Everything was mixed, everything was intertwined before the second world war; almost everything.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Pope John Paul II", "Holocaust", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Europe", "World news", "The papacy"], "title": "A Jewish renaissance in Poland"},{"date": "2011-04-04T07:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A few weeks ago, Gazeta Wyborcza launched a new bestseller list. If it serves as a measure of the condition of Polish literature, one could say that we have come down with the same illness as the rest of the world: crime Larssonosis, romance-gastronomic Gilbertosis and vampiric Meyerosis. Vampires in particular featured heavily in the ratings; this should be a source of delight for us, as vampires are a Slavic invention. One can learn about their heritage from The Vampire: A Symbolic Biography by Maria Janion, one of the most outstanding Polish scholars of literary Romanticism. If this invaluable work were translated into English (what a pity you haven't translated it yet), the followers of Stephenie Meyer would have a chance to refresh their knowledge of creatures that balance between life and death. We call them \"upiory\", \"strzygi\", \"brukolaki\" or \"wapierze\".The launch of our bestseller list coincided with the publication of a book that caused enormous controversy: Golden Harvest by Jan Tomasz Gross and Irena Grudzinska-Gross. The scandal broke even before it appeared in bookshops. Its subject is the participation of Poles in the so-called third phase of the Holocaust, when Poles denounced their Jewish neighbours (Neighbours is the title of the first of Gross's books about the relations between Poles and Jews during the second world war) to pillage their property. Even their graves. This book has been taken by many as a blow to the image of Poles as innocent victims of the Nazis. And \u2013 as the authors emphasise \u2013 plundering Jewish property was common throughout Europe.The Holocaust in Polish literature means primarily Hanna Krall, who ever since her book Shielding the Flame \u2013 a record of interviews with Marek Edelman, one of the leaders of the Warsaw ghetto uprising \u2013 has been producing volumes of brilliant stories about the fate of Poland's Jews. Each of these stories contains enough material for a novel, but Krall has the ability to distil the tragic and sometimes grotesque essence from the life of her heroes. Her next book, White Maria, will be published in a few weeks.Krall started as a reporter, which is typical of Poland's flourishing non-fiction scene. She is still associated first and foremost with reportage, which in Poland is considered to be a genre somewhere between journalism and literature. Reading her books makes you wonder whether you are reading non-fiction or poetry.This genre-busting nature of Polish reportage is also the source of many misunderstandings. When a biography of Poland's most eminent reporter (and the best-known Polish writer worldwide), Ryszard Kapuscinski, came out last year (Kapuscinski Non-fiction by Artur Domos\u0142awski), it provoked many arguments, including about the reporter's competence. To what degree should a reporter be just a witness, and to what degree an author who includes his or her own outlook, interpretations and literary style? Where does journalism (non-fiction) end, and literary fiction begin? This dispute remains unsettled, just like many other arguments provoked by Domos\u0142awski's book, such as the controversy over the attitudes that journalists and writers adopted during the communist years, or the extent to which a biographer can explore the personal life of his or her subject.Regardless of the gravity of the charges against the so-called Polish School of Reportage, of which Kapuscinski was the most prominent representative, it is in good condition. Though it is ever rarer in the Polish press, it transfers relatively well to books. Successors of Kapuscinski \u2013 Mariusz Szczygie\u0142, Jacek Hugo-Bader, Wojciech Tochman \u2013 appear near the\u00a0top of the bestseller lists, and their\u00a0works have been translated into\u00a0all of the major European languages. So reportage is still a Polish speciality, although reporters tend now to wander the world and through history in their search for interesting subjects. Szczygie\u0142 devoted his book Gottland (winner of the 2009 European Book prize) to the conflicting attitudes that Czechs adopt towards communism; Hugo-Bader has travelled through a drink-sodden post-Soviet Russia (White Heat); while Tochman has analysed the consequences of the genocide in Rwanda (We Will Portray Death Today). Young writers are following their lead: in Murderer from the Apricot City, Witold Szab\u0142owski reports on the cultural clashes and conflicts that divide contemporary Turkey as it attempts to join the European Union.Poland's own accession to the EU, meanwhile, has resulted in a level of economic migration that has not yet been fully reflected in our literature. The only books that come to mind are a trilogy by one of Poland's most outstanding poets and essayists, Jaros\u0142aw Marek Rymkiewicz, who has tried to vaccinate Poles against the supposed loss of national identity that some feared membership would bring. In Kinderszenen Rymkiewicz ostensibly emotionlessly recounts some of the bloodiest episodes from Polish history \u2013 first of all the 1944 Warsaw uprising (not to be confused with the Warsaw ghetto uprising), which cost the lives of 200,000 people \u2013 and tries to make these victims a foundation for modern Polish society.However, the literary mainstream is made up of authors who follow Witold Gombrowicz, who teaches distance from those models of Polish identity. Janusz Rudnicki, Marcin Swietlicki, Micha\u0142 Witkowski and Jerzy Pilch are writers who find their own ironic ways of dealing with our literary tradition. The most important writer of this group is Pilch \u2013 not only because of his novels, but also because of his position as the country's leading columnist. In view of the vanishing significance of literary criticism, which is now found only in niche magazines, and \u2013 I must admit with a heavy heart \u2013 the claustrophobia that affects newspapers' cultural pages, Pilch is considered an authority on literature.Dorota Mas\u0142owska owes him a lot. Her White and Red was the most important debut to appear in the first 20 years after independence. It is seemingly a realist novel about the dregs of society, but in fact the broken language of its heroes, full of references to pop culture and different subcultures, perfectly reflects the chaotic consciousness of all Poles living through those days of political and social transformation. Her second novel, The Queen's Peacock, won the Nike, Poland's most important literary award. It's worth stressing here that awards are another substitute for literary criticism, though this is by no means an exclusively Polish phenomenon. The list of Nike laureates gives quite a reliable insight into the most important trends and names in Polish literature. Take poetry, which competes on equal terms with novels and essays for the title of the best book of the year. It is significant that the last two Nobel prizes for literature won by Poles went to poets: Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz (1981) and Wis\u0142awa Szymborska (1996).Who is likely to win the Nike award this year? Balladyny i romanse (\"Ballads and Romances\") by the young novelist Ignacy Karowicz is my favourite. It is an ironic story about gods from various large and small religions who decide to give up immortality and begin living a \"normal\" life among Poles. However, these gods share suspiciously Polish notions about the citizens of western Europe. Is life in a block of flats with worn-out gods, who desperately look to find their own place in the world, a metaphor for our presence in the European Union?1 The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown2 Nie potrafie schudnac by Pierre Dukan (diet book)3 Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert4 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson5 Zielone drzwi (Green Door) by Katarzyna Grochola (novel from \"queen of Polish fem-pulp\")Total 2010 book sales 133m", "tags": ["Publishing", "Books", "Culture"], "title": "What they're reading in Poland"},{"date": "2011-06-15T11:04:41Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland's leading newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, is playing host to 21 journalism students to test Poland's readiness to host football's 2012 Euro championship.The students, from City University London, will visit Poland's 21 biggest cities in a nine-day trip starting this weekend.The project, called Mission 21, is also an experiment by the newspaper into the journalistic effectiveness of social media tools.So, aside from their role as \"referees\" for the football event, students will be blogging and using Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to share their experiences.Grzegorz Piechota, a senior editor at the paper, says that the student visit \"is a bit like having a look in the mirror at ourselves.\"Professor George Brock, City's head of journalism, says: \"It is a unique chance for 21 of our best students to do some hands-on reporting in a foreign country, the kind of chance they are not likely to have again until well into their journalistic careers.\"Full disclosure: I teach at City Source: City University PR", "tags": ["Media", "Journalism education", "Poland", "City University London", "Blogging", "Social media", "Twitter", "Facebook", "YouTube", "Europe", "World news", "Football", "Uefa", "Euro 2012"], "title": "Journalism students visit Poland as football 'referees'"},{"date": "2011-04-04T06:00:13Z", "country": "poland", "content": "There are 38.4 million people in Poland and its population is falling \u2013 the birth rate has plunged dramatically since the fall of the iron curtain and many of the million or so Poles who left after EU accession in 2004 have yet to return. Compared with most other European countries, Poland has not attracted many immigrants either. According to the last census in 2002, 96.7% of the country are Polish, with the main ethnic minorities hailing from Germany, Ukraine and Belarus. Though the proportion of foreigners is thought to have increased slightly in the past nine years, Poland remains an almost exclusively white, Catholic country.Poland is currently enjoying its second \"economic miracle\". Twenty-one years after Solidarity leaders gambled successfully on the \"big bang\", ushering in free market capitalism overnight on New Year's Day 1990, the economy they created has beaten the odds. Alone in the whole EU it continued to grow through the recession of the past two years. Last year the economy grew by nearly 4%, and is projected to do even better this year. The country has EU investment to thank, as well as a construction boom driven by the need to prepare for the 2012 European football championships.Poland negotiated its way out of communism at the famous \"round table\" talks in 1989, but it only got round to drafting a comprehensive new constitution for the \"third republic\" in 1997. It is a self-conscious casting off of the communist past, rejecting the failed experiments in collectivisation by explicitly making the \"family farm\" the foundation of the agrarian economy. The system is semi-presidential. The presidency has more power than Germany's but less than the French Elys\u00e9e. The proportional representation elections to the lower house of parliament (the Sejm) produced two decades of shaky short-lived coalitions and continual spats between parliament and president. By those standards, the current period counts as the most stable in modern Polish history.Polish politics is currently a two-horse race. The party now in power is the liberal Civic Platform, led by the football-playing prime minister Donald Tusk. The president, Bronislaw Komorowski, is from the same party. These two took over from one of the world's more eccentric political double acts, the identical Kaczynski twins Jaroslaw and Lech, child actors who grew up to become prime minister and president respectively. Lech was killed in the Smolensk air crash last year, which his grieving brother still believes was more than an accident. In the general election this autumn, Jaroslaw will try to regain the premiership with his conservative Law and Justice party. Minor parties have names which hark back to bygone days, such as The League of Polish Families and Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland.Food and drinkSurely one of the underrated gems of European cuisine, Polish food is distinctive, and can be superb. The classic soup, zurek, is made of rye flour left to ferment in water for a few days. Mixed with stock and marjoram, with bits of kielbasa (sausage) and hard-boiled egg floating on the bottom, it can be addictive. Pierogi (ravioli) are a food group of their own \u2013 arguably the best variety being stuffed with minced cabbage and wild mushrooms (the object of a near-mystical reverence). Apart from the ubiquitous kebab, the Polish fast food of choice is the Zapiekanka, a baguette topped with melted cheese and mushrooms and smothered in ketchup. Vodka is not the dominant drink of yore. Its place has been taken by imported wine and excellent local beers, like Okocim, Zywiec and a crop of new micro-breweries.Poland has succumbed to the same guilty pleasures as much of the rest of the world. Billboards in the cities are advertising the new series of X Factor, and Taniec z Gwiazdami (Dancing with the Stars) is one of Poland's biggest shows. Though the majority of Polish cinemas spurn homegrown films in favour of Hollywood blockbusters, the indigenous film industry is in passable health. The National Film School in Lodz is still producing decent directors, though none of its alumni have ever replicated the worldwide success of Roman Polanski, Krzysztof \"Three Colors\" Kieslowski and Andrzej Wajda, whose film school in Warsaw now rivals his alma mater. Polish pop music does not travel well, but dominates the charts at home. Probably the most popular Polish band is Kult, whose thoughtful (if unusual) mix of punk, rock, jazz and poetry has been popular for almost 30 years. Poland's answer to Britney Spears is Doda, a busty and litigious 27-year-old (pictured top right) with a hellraising reputation.Polish men think of themselves as chivalrous and romantic, which is true up to a point. Women certainly shouldn't expect to have to open any doors during a visit to Poland, and will very likely receive flowers from any suitors. These days, though, men tend to shake rather than kiss a woman's hand when they meet. Premarital sex goes on but is not talked about much \u2013 outside the increasingly secular Warsaw, at least \u2013 and many parents are often unhappy when their offspring move in with their partners before getting wed. Abortions are illegal (apart from in rape cases or for health reasons), and contraception is not promoted. Sex education in schools is still referred to euphemistically as \"education for life and family\". Homophobia is still a problem: this year the ruling party had to expel an MP for abusive comments about gay people.Foreign policy has understandably been shaped by the repeated experience of being invaded (see below). An attempt to put history to rest ended in disaster a year ago when the plane taking President Lech Kaczynski to a joint Polish-Russian commemoration of the Katyn massacre crashed at Smolensk, killing not just the president but much of the military leadership. Ex-prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski outraged the Germans by suggesting that Poland's 6 million war victims should be taken into account when apportioning EU voting rights. Last month, the foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, called for historic resentments to be put aside and for Poland to do business with its neighbours like a normal country. It is still too early to say if that will work.It would be fair to say that history has not treated Poland kindly. Occupying the flat space between Germany and Russia, Poland is near-impossible to defend. The Commonwealth, as it calls itself, was swallowed up entirely in 1795 by the Russians, Prussians and Austrians and did not resurface until 1918. The \"second republic\" between the wars was an uneasy experience. Soviet conquest was narrowly averted in a 1920 battle on the outskirts of Warsaw, now known as \"the miracle on the Vistula\". The hero of the hour, Jozef Pilsudski, went on to stage a coup and dominated Poland between the wars. What followed was unmitigated disaster. Poland was carved up by Hitler and Stalin, who turned it into a killing field. Six million Poles \u2013 3 million Jewish and 3 million Catholic \u2013 were exterminated, including in the Soviets' execution of almost the entire officer corps at Katyn in 1940, a massacre Moscow blamed on the Nazis. At the war's end, Stalin swallowed Poland whole. One revolt after another was crushed until a now famous electrician climbed over the wall of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk and called for a strike. Lech Walesa and Solidarity were instrumental in bringing down communism not just in Poland but across eastern Europe, and Poles are not about to let Europe forget it.The Polish psyche is not given to optimism \u2013 perhaps to be expected given the centuries of oppression, invasions and foreign rule. This pessimism is best demonstrated in the common title of the Polish national anthem, Jeszcze Polska nie zginela, which means Poland\u00a0Has\u00a0Not Yet Perished. Be warned that if you ask Poles how they are, they will probably tell you the truth, and it may take some time. The classic Polish answer to \"How are you?\" is \"Stara bieda\" which literally means \"old poverty\". Poles are also less\u00a0afraid\u00a0of conversational silences than Britons. Most of all, Poles are generous and hospitable and proud of their country surviving against the\u00a0odds.", "tags": ["Poland"], "title": "Poland at a glance"},{"date": "2011-04-08T23:04:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In the 19th century, Lower Silesia (the bottom left-hand corner of Poland) was a prized piece of the German empire. After King Wilhelm's brother built himself a summer palace here in 1822, every Prussian nobleman had to build one too, complete with English-style park, artificial ruins and romantic temples.Drive through the valley around Jelenia Gora and you'll find a crumbling castle every few miles. You could buy one and spend the next decade doing it up, or just stay the night in one of the restored palace hotels.Lomnica Palace (+48 75 713 0460, palac-lomnica.pl/en) has doubles from \u00a355 B&B, or Hotel Palac Staniszow (+48 75 755 8445, palacstaniszow.pl/en) has doubles from \u00a370 B&B. You'll eat dinner by candlelight reflected in polished stone floors, climb gothic carved timber staircases to bed, and sleep deeply to the sound of the wind in 100-year-old lime trees.Classical music nuts will thrill to the baroque abbey in Krzeszow, east of Jelenia Gora. Here, precious original manuscripts from Berlin (including a quarter of all Mozart's works) were kept out of range of Allied bombers during the second world war.Park in the resort of Karpacz, a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Wroclaw, then take the chairlift (ignore the sneering locals who climb on foot as a matter of national pride). Hike the last kilometre to the highest peak of Sniezka, through which Poland's southern border runs. There's a flying-saucer-shaped Soviet-era cafe on top, with views north across Poland and south into the Czech Republic. In communist times this border was guarded by Russian soldiers with rifles. Kids would put a foot across the line then brag that they had been abroad. At a time when hardly anyone had a passport to travel, it was a bitter joke. Now the border is lost in long grass.It's a 45-minute walk to an isolated valley known as Samotnia, or \"the lonely place\". For around \u00a315 you can have a double room in the wooden chalet here, Schronisko Samotnia (+48 75 761 9376, samotnia.com.pl/en). There's a cosy restaurant, or you can eat outside on benches by the lake.Leba is a small fishing village and resort on the Baltic coast, where you walk through pine forests to the beach. Kids queue to buy rurki z kremem, yummy cigar-shaped waffle tubes filled with vanilla cream. You can hunt for lumps of amber (fossilised tree resin) in the vast, lunar sand dunes where Rommel is said to have practised desert warfare, or watch families sheltering from the stiff Baltic breeze. Hotel Neptun (+48 59 866 1432, neptunhotel.pl/en) is the only hotel/castle in Poland built on a beach, and offers dinner, bed and breakfast for two from around \u00a395 a night.It was in nearby Gdansk that brave shipbuilders (encouraged by a forward-thinking Pope) first stood up to their communist occupiers. Light a candle in the austere St Bridget's church, where Solidarity members once gathered in secret, and spot red Solidarity flags peaking out from corners of this old traders' city, a reminder that this is where the end of the cold war began.Zamosc, near the eastern border with Ukraine, grew from one man's dream to build a perfect, Renaissance city. Local noble Jan Zamojski hired Italian architect Bernardo Morando for the job in 1580. The result is stunning \u2013 think your own private Padua, without the queues. Book a room on the arcaded main square and sit in the window with a bottle of champagne, toasting the brides who marry every couple of hours on the staircase of the pink town hall. Or visit the fabulous old synagogue on Zamenhofa, built by Sephardic Jews from Venice in the time of Shakespeare. Orbis Zamojski (+48 84 639 2516, accorhotels.com/gb) has basic doubles for around \u00a340 room only, but pay a bit more for the corner suite with a view of the town hall.Polish composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (his dad was French) was born in Zelazowa Wola, not far from Warsaw. Visit his house (+48 46 863 3300, chopin.museum/en/museum/branches/id/216), a typical 19th-century Polish nobleman's house, or dworek. Sit in the garden with its stream and dragonflies, and listen to a nocturne on a warm summer evening (there are regular concerts). Chopin left Poland in 1831 and never returned. He lived in Paris, along with other Polish exiles, and the nostalgic music he wrote there still has the power to carry any Polish migrant back home whenever it is played.Cucumber season (sezon ogorkowy) is how Poles describe the long summer months when schools, theatres and pretty much everything else shuts down and there is nothing to do but watch cucumbers growing. Warm sunshine arrives (finally), pierogi (dumplings) are filled with blueberries, and soup is made from young beetroot shoots. It's the perfect time to get lost in the heart of Poland. First buy a picnic \u2013 ideally cold smoked sausage, beer, rye bread and cherries.There are daily farmers' markets in the rynek or market squares of most small towns and villages, with wonderfully fresh piles of unwashed carrots, beetroot and cabbages. There will be smoked cheeses and sausages, and you can buy just a half or a third of a loaf of delicious rye bread if that is all you need for lunch. No need to label the produce \"organic\" \u2013 there is no other kind of farming here \u2013 and it is all truly seasonal.Drive south from Warsaw for a couple of hours, then turn off on to the smallest road you can find. Keep turning randomly right and left wherever you see a plaster saint in a shrine by the road, until your route peters out in the middle of a blossoming potato field. Get out with your picnic. Lie on the ground and watch the passing clouds overhead for further directions.Lodz (pronounced woodge) is where cinema greats Roman Polanski, Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Kieslowski went to film school. \"HollyLodz\" animators strongly influenced British TV \u2013 the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield (where Nick Park conceived Wallace & Gromit) ran regular exchanges in the 1980s. This newly groovy industrial town 120km south of Warsaw is turning its old fabric factories into hip apartments and studios. Walk the Polish equivalent of Hollywood Boulevard's Avenue of the Stars, Piotrkowska, and ask at the Film Commission (104 Piotrkowska, +48 42 638 5546, lodzfilmcommission.com) to go on the free Lodz Film Heritage Trail (Saturdays only).You can visit Lancut castle (+48 17 225 2008, zamek-lancut.pl/en), the historical heart of the elegant Polish aristocracy in the south-east corner of Poland, as long as you are prepared to shuffle round the parquet floors with protective slippers over your shoes. It was originally built by the Lubomirski dynasty (complete with exquisite tiny theatre), then extended by the Potockis into one of the grandest residences in Europe.Forget the rococo palaces and green gardens, it is Wolsztyn that many people (well, blokes mainly) want to visit. Towards the centre of the country, it is the only place in Europe that still operates a scheduled train service using steam locomotives. You can actually drive your own loco, and 40+-year-old boys from Texas to Amsterdam flock here to try footplating and shunting, far away from their day jobs, health and safety, and wives who just don't get it. The Wolsztyn Experience (01628 524876, thewolsztynexperience.org) has one-week courses from \u00a38250/week, and weekends from \u00a3130,, including accommodation, some in the depot. Alternatively, the nearby Hotel Wolsztyn Palace (+48 68 346 9358, www.palacwolsztyn.com.pl) has doubles for around \u00a370 B&B, and there is a fairyland of lakes, apple orchards and windmills to explore to the south.\u2022 Filmmaker and writer Simon Target is co-author with his Polish wife Beata Zatorska of Rose Petal Jam: Recipes & Stories from a Summer in Poland, published this week by Tabula Books, price \u00a325.

The responses came thick and fast: goldgathers replied with Carmen Conde's Mujer sin Ed\u00e9n, Haarlson with Merc\u00e9 Rodoreda and Joan Margarit. But unless I've missed it somewhere, the explanation smallpox demanded didn't seem to materialise. I'm no Spanish specialist, but the barriers to publication with which women have struggled in the UK since Miguel de Cervantes set out his blueprint for fiction are surely equally fearsome in the land of Sancho Panza. All the more reason to join with goldgathers in saluting Ediciones Torremozas, \"who publish poetry and short stories by women writers\".This week, though, the World literature tour comes into its own, as it heads into territory which is \u2013 at least to me \u2013 basically unknown. I'll mutter Witold Gombrowicz, hum and haw at Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, and tentatively suggest Michal Witkowski's recently-translated Lovetown, but the only thing I can really recommend about Polish literature is a marvellous short story by Michal Olszewski, wonderfully translated by Antonia Lloyd Jones, which we ran as part of a series of short stories to commemorate the fall of the Berlin wall a couple of years back.So it's over to you. As before, we're looking for the books which shed light on the Polish experience \u2013 fiction, non-fiction, poems and plays \u2013 whether written by those who'd call themselves Poles, or not. Just make your way down the page to the boxes of magic, fill in a country \u2013 that's Poland \u2013 an author, a title, maybe a translator and some indication of why it's a book you'd recommend. Then the elves will fly, the cogs will turn and hey presto, there'll be a list of knowledge, just like the one we made for Spain. After that the only issue will be where to head next.So tell us: where would you like to go next? Tell us in the comments, and we'll head wherever you fancy.

There are restaurants with Hebrew lettering, a new community centre where students drop in for a Sabbath meal, and even a Jewish kindergarten. And once a year, this quarter is dominated by a celebration of Jewish music, theatre and film that attracts up to 13,000 visitors.Krakow's Jewish Culture festival is the most prominent symbol of an apparent rejuvenation in the shadow of the Holocaust. This is the nearest Polish city to Auschwitz, but it has also become a place where Poles are discovering their lost Jewish heritage.The Jewish community centre on Miodowa Street, neighbouring a synagogue defiled by the Nazis but now restored for worship, has seen a steady stream of visitors. Opened in 2008 by Prince Charles, the centre offers Hebrew and Yiddish language lessons and an introductory religious course, alongside yoga, belly-dancing and basketball.Jonathan Ornstein, the centre's director, says: \"I think that people for a few years have been talking about a Jewish renaissance in Poland, in Krakow especially, and that was primarily an interest by non-Jews in Jewish culture, and I think that now we're in a second stage that is totally made possible by this first stage. That's people with Jewish roots getting involved in the Jewish community.\"Ornstein says the centre has young people coming in every day who have no contact with Jewish life but want to explore their Jewish roots. One local rabbi tells a story of a Pole who discovered from his mother's birth certificate that she was Jewish, born in Krakow's wartime ghetto. She told him that she had kept it a secret all her life \u2013 and then they discovered that the man's father was Jewish, too.There are reckoned to be slightly more than 100 official members of the Jewish community in Krakow, but 400 who consider themselves Jewish.The precursor of this renewal has been the festival, now in its 21st year. It is an event that looks both ways, embracing klezmer music and Yiddish movies of the past, but also seeking out the avant garde. This year that includes a \"hip-hop meets klezmer\" act from the US as well as workshops in Hebrew calligraphy, Jewish cooking and singing, all allowing the audience to get involved.It acts as a reminder to Poles that their culture is not a \"monolith\", says the festival's director, Janusz Makuch, citing the influential Jewish songwriter Mordechai Gebirtig as one example. \"Gebirtig composed a lot of beautiful songs, sung by the Poles. When Poles sang these tunes, they didn't realise they sang a Jewish song.\"Instead of [being] a hermetic culture, the secular Jewish culture was intertwined with Polish culture.\"One of this year's performers, Jarek Bester, of the Bester Quartet, describes his sound as contemporary chamber music that reinterprets traditional Yiddish folk. On CD it is a mix of plaintive violin and thundering accordion.Bester says: \"[The Holocaust] was a kind of intermission in composing and playing klezmer music. I'm trying to provide a continuation of klezmer \u2013 I think the way we play is how klezmer music would be played, if it wasn't for the second world war.\"Jewish life in Krakow, nearly extinguished by the Nazis, was driven underground in the communist era. Kazimierz, where Schindler's List was filmed, was a neglected and under-populated district under communism. In recent years it has been transformed into one of the hippest parts of the city. Pavements are crowded with cafe tables and streets are lined with vodka bars, vintage boutiques and tiny art galleries. Only the peeling plaster and brickwork of some of the facades gives away the past neglect, and that is rapidly being patched up.Jewishness has been adopted as a selling point, almost a badge of cool, in a way that is sometimes tasteless. Converted golf carts tout for tourist custom with awnings displaying the itinerary: \"Auschwitz, Schindler's factory, Jewish quarter.\" A local rabbi, Eliezer Gurary, spoke of his disquiet at the Jewish mannequins in shops \u2013 dolls of black-robed, bearded men that border on racist caricature. There have been complaints over a \"Jewish-themed\" restaurant that displays a page of the Torah on its wall.At the community centre, Ornstein says: \"You have some fake Jewish-style restaurants, and I would love those to be restaurants run by Jews, kosher restaurants and actually be realistic. I think that's a way off, [but] we're moving in that direction. These days in Poland the fact that you can call a restaurant a Jewish restaurant and that brings people in, is in itself a positive thing.\"I think the remarkable thing here is that you have a community that's growing, that's optimistic, that feels very safe, and it's going in a direction which is very different to most Jewish communities in Europe.\"A survey conducted last year by the Polish Public Opinion Poll Institute indicated a decline in antisemitism among all age groups over the decade. The poll, which asked questions intended to uncover people's belief in Jewish \"influence\" over Polish politics, found that fewer than 6% mentioned Jewish people when asked about influential minorities, compared with nearly 20% in 2002.Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, believes that the opinion polls on antisemitism fail to show the underlying change in Polish attitudes. \"The flaw in all these surveys is that \u2013 let's say they show that 20% of Poles have antisemitic attitudes \u2013 everyone misses what the other 80% is thinking,\" Schudrich says at his office at the Warsaw synagogue. \"Are they indifferent or are they appalled by the 20%? And it seems to me more and more people are raising their rejection of these antisemitic trends. That's mostly due to John Paul II, who did more to fight antisemitism than anyone in the last 2,000 years.\"Schudrich, who was born in New York and first came to Poland in 1992, believes that the late Polish pope, who will be beatified on 1 May, made indifference to antisemitism less acceptable in the Catholic mainstream.\"John Paul II empowered all those people who found it abhorrent,\" he says. The rabbi believes he is seeing a subtle, slow but telling transformation in the relationship between Polish Jews and the wider community.\"I get these calls from town X saying: 'We feel an obligation to perpetuate the memory of the Jews who once lived here.' It used to be: 'What can be done to clean your cemetery.' Now it's: 'What can be done to clean our cemetery.'\"On Tuesday the chief rabbi was in the eastern Polish town of Zamosc, along with ambassadors from the US, Germany and Israel, at the restoration of a 17th-century synagogue. The building is considered a jewel of Renaissance architecture, and will house a Polish Jewish cultural centre.Schudrich chooses his words carefully when talking about Golden Harvest, a controversial new book by a Princeton University professor, Jan Gross, about Poles who dug up the mass graves of Jews killed in the Holocaust looking for gold and precious stones.\"It's important to talk about this subject. Some people did horrific things, but we knew this already. The question is: was it rampant? In Treblinka and in Birkenau, was it the same 50 people doing this each time, or a different 50 people?\" Schudrich says. \"You could come away with the impression that everyone did it.\"And were they doing it because the victims were Jews, or because the Nazis destroyed any sense of morality so everything was permitted? I don't know. Gross writes in a way to provoke, not to educate, and Poles don't react well to it. Because of the style, too many people reject what he has to say.\"On a bright afternoon recently in Kazimierz a boy in a kippah (skullcap) walked along the street where a few hours earlier a golf cart filled with tourists had trundled past. Poland was once home to the second largest Jewish community in the world, and any revival is the faintest echo of what was destroyed \u2013 but it is a source of great pride to a city with 700 years of Jewish history.Makuch, of the Jewish Culture festival, says: \"We are sitting in Kazimierz, founded by one of the Polish kings in 1335; we are surrounded by seven beautiful synagogues built mostly in the baroque and Renaissance periods. Poland, and especially Krakow, was proud of cultural pluralism \u2013 a lot of people lived here: Poles, Jews, Russians, Armenians, all kinds of guys, and they lived together, and they respected each other.\"That's what I'm trying to explore and what I'm trying to keep. Everything was mixed, everything was intertwined before the second world war; almost everything.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Pope John Paul II", "Holocaust", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Europe", "World news", "The papacy"], "title": "A Jewish renaissance in Poland"},{"date": "2011-04-04T07:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A few weeks ago, Gazeta Wyborcza launched a new bestseller list. If it serves as a measure of the condition of Polish literature, one could say that we have come down with the same illness as the rest of the world: crime Larssonosis, romance-gastronomic Gilbertosis and vampiric Meyerosis. Vampires in particular featured heavily in the ratings; this should be a source of delight for us, as vampires are a Slavic invention. One can learn about their heritage from The Vampire: A Symbolic Biography by Maria Janion, one of the most outstanding Polish scholars of literary Romanticism. If this invaluable work were translated into English (what a pity you haven't translated it yet), the followers of Stephenie Meyer would have a chance to refresh their knowledge of creatures that balance between life and death. We call them \"upiory\", \"strzygi\", \"brukolaki\" or \"wapierze\".The launch of our bestseller list coincided with the publication of a book that caused enormous controversy: Golden Harvest by Jan Tomasz Gross and Irena Grudzinska-Gross. The scandal broke even before it appeared in bookshops. Its subject is the participation of Poles in the so-called third phase of the Holocaust, when Poles denounced their Jewish neighbours (Neighbours is the title of the first of Gross's books about the relations between Poles and Jews during the second world war) to pillage their property. Even their graves. This book has been taken by many as a blow to the image of Poles as innocent victims of the Nazis. And \u2013 as the authors emphasise \u2013 plundering Jewish property was common throughout Europe.The Holocaust in Polish literature means primarily Hanna Krall, who ever since her book Shielding the Flame \u2013 a record of interviews with Marek Edelman, one of the leaders of the Warsaw ghetto uprising \u2013 has been producing volumes of brilliant stories about the fate of Poland's Jews. Each of these stories contains enough material for a novel, but Krall has the ability to distil the tragic and sometimes grotesque essence from the life of her heroes. Her next book, White Maria, will be published in a few weeks.Krall started as a reporter, which is typical of Poland's flourishing non-fiction scene. She is still associated first and foremost with reportage, which in Poland is considered to be a genre somewhere between journalism and literature. Reading her books makes you wonder whether you are reading non-fiction or poetry.This genre-busting nature of Polish reportage is also the source of many misunderstandings. When a biography of Poland's most eminent reporter (and the best-known Polish writer worldwide), Ryszard Kapuscinski, came out last year (Kapuscinski Non-fiction by Artur Domos\u0142awski), it provoked many arguments, including about the reporter's competence. To what degree should a reporter be just a witness, and to what degree an author who includes his or her own outlook, interpretations and literary style? Where does journalism (non-fiction) end, and literary fiction begin? This dispute remains unsettled, just like many other arguments provoked by Domos\u0142awski's book, such as the controversy over the attitudes that journalists and writers adopted during the communist years, or the extent to which a biographer can explore the personal life of his or her subject.Regardless of the gravity of the charges against the so-called Polish School of Reportage, of which Kapuscinski was the most prominent representative, it is in good condition. Though it is ever rarer in the Polish press, it transfers relatively well to books. Successors of Kapuscinski \u2013 Mariusz Szczygie\u0142, Jacek Hugo-Bader, Wojciech Tochman \u2013 appear near the\u00a0top of the bestseller lists, and their\u00a0works have been translated into\u00a0all of the major European languages. So reportage is still a Polish speciality, although reporters tend now to wander the world and through history in their search for interesting subjects. Szczygie\u0142 devoted his book Gottland (winner of the 2009 European Book prize) to the conflicting attitudes that Czechs adopt towards communism; Hugo-Bader has travelled through a drink-sodden post-Soviet Russia (White Heat); while Tochman has analysed the consequences of the genocide in Rwanda (We Will Portray Death Today). Young writers are following their lead: in Murderer from the Apricot City, Witold Szab\u0142owski reports on the cultural clashes and conflicts that divide contemporary Turkey as it attempts to join the European Union.Poland's own accession to the EU, meanwhile, has resulted in a level of economic migration that has not yet been fully reflected in our literature. The only books that come to mind are a trilogy by one of Poland's most outstanding poets and essayists, Jaros\u0142aw Marek Rymkiewicz, who has tried to vaccinate Poles against the supposed loss of national identity that some feared membership would bring. In Kinderszenen Rymkiewicz ostensibly emotionlessly recounts some of the bloodiest episodes from Polish history \u2013 first of all the 1944 Warsaw uprising (not to be confused with the Warsaw ghetto uprising), which cost the lives of 200,000 people \u2013 and tries to make these victims a foundation for modern Polish society.However, the literary mainstream is made up of authors who follow Witold Gombrowicz, who teaches distance from those models of Polish identity. Janusz Rudnicki, Marcin Swietlicki, Micha\u0142 Witkowski and Jerzy Pilch are writers who find their own ironic ways of dealing with our literary tradition. The most important writer of this group is Pilch \u2013 not only because of his novels, but also because of his position as the country's leading columnist. In view of the vanishing significance of literary criticism, which is now found only in niche magazines, and \u2013 I must admit with a heavy heart \u2013 the claustrophobia that affects newspapers' cultural pages, Pilch is considered an authority on literature.Dorota Mas\u0142owska owes him a lot. Her White and Red was the most important debut to appear in the first 20 years after independence. It is seemingly a realist novel about the dregs of society, but in fact the broken language of its heroes, full of references to pop culture and different subcultures, perfectly reflects the chaotic consciousness of all Poles living through those days of political and social transformation. Her second novel, The Queen's Peacock, won the Nike, Poland's most important literary award. It's worth stressing here that awards are another substitute for literary criticism, though this is by no means an exclusively Polish phenomenon. The list of Nike laureates gives quite a reliable insight into the most important trends and names in Polish literature. Take poetry, which competes on equal terms with novels and essays for the title of the best book of the year. It is significant that the last two Nobel prizes for literature won by Poles went to poets: Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz (1981) and Wis\u0142awa Szymborska (1996).Who is likely to win the Nike award this year? Balladyny i romanse (\"Ballads and Romances\") by the young novelist Ignacy Karowicz is my favourite. It is an ironic story about gods from various large and small religions who decide to give up immortality and begin living a \"normal\" life among Poles. However, these gods share suspiciously Polish notions about the citizens of western Europe. Is life in a block of flats with worn-out gods, who desperately look to find their own place in the world, a metaphor for our presence in the European Union?1 The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown2 Nie potrafie schudnac by Pierre Dukan (diet book)3 Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert4 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson5 Zielone drzwi (Green Door) by Katarzyna Grochola (novel from \"queen of Polish fem-pulp\")Total 2010 book sales 133m", "tags": ["Publishing", "Books", "Culture"], "title": "What they're reading in Poland"},{"date": "2011-06-15T11:04:41Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland's leading newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, is playing host to 21 journalism students to test Poland's readiness to host football's 2012 Euro championship.The students, from City University London, will visit Poland's 21 biggest cities in a nine-day trip starting this weekend.The project, called Mission 21, is also an experiment by the newspaper into the journalistic effectiveness of social media tools.So, aside from their role as \"referees\" for the football event, students will be blogging and using Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to share their experiences.Grzegorz Piechota, a senior editor at the paper, says that the student visit \"is a bit like having a look in the mirror at ourselves.\"Professor George Brock, City's head of journalism, says: \"It is a unique chance for 21 of our best students to do some hands-on reporting in a foreign country, the kind of chance they are not likely to have again until well into their journalistic careers.\"Full disclosure: I teach at City Source: City University PR", "tags": ["Media", "Journalism education", "Poland", "City University London", "Blogging", "Social media", "Twitter", "Facebook", "YouTube", "Europe", "World news", "Football", "Uefa", "Euro 2012"], "title": "Journalism students visit Poland as football 'referees'"},{"date": "2011-04-08T23:05:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Even teetotal travellers to Poland are likely to stumble across Zubrowka vodka. It comes in a bottle with a distinctive label featuring a bison, zubr, and a blade of buffalo grass, supposedly urinated on by one of these magnificent creatures. But few visitors bold enough to try this national firewater will be aware of the precarious existence of the European bison, or realise that they can actually see them in the wild.Conserving bison is not just about protecting a national symbol of Poland; it is linked to the survival of Europe's last primeval forest, the 8,000-year-old Bialowieza, which straddles the border with Belarus. Around 16% of the Polish part of the forest is a national park and home to about 470 of the animals.The bison is Europe's heaviest land mammal, weighing up to 800kg. They\u00a0are naturally shy \u2013 and experts want to keep it that way \u2013 but it is possible to see them.Tourists can visit the protected primeval area of the national park, a Unesco world heritage site, though only if they book a guided tour. It's worth a trip: the forest teems with life \u2013 wolves, elks, stags, lynx and a great variety of birds \u2013 and it's a haunting experience to wander among its ancient trees. I have seen them there myself, and it's an incredible experience if you are lucky.The easiest place to spot them should be the hay meadows on which they feed, on the fringes of the forest, which you can visit under your own steam. Conservation efforts (part-funded by the EU) to expand the area the bison live in and bring them out on to the hay meadows to feed in autumn/winter (and not rely on artificial feeding) are increasing opportunities to see them, though in summer they tend to stick to the forest. An easier solution is to visit the large semi-natural enclosure, or \"show reserve\" near the village.Ironically, the primeval forest survives because of hunting. Polish kings and Russian tsars were fond of hunting bison and maintained a small population. But during the first world war, bison were hunted to near extinction for food by German soldiers\u00a0and locals. In 1929 a captive-breeding programme started, and in 1952 the animal was reintroduced to the forest.\u2022 See bpn.com.pl for information about visiting the park. It costs \u00a31.30 to\u00a0visit the show reserve; tours of the forest arranged at the park's information centre cost around \u00a377 for a group for three hours. From Warsaw, take a\u00a0train to Bialystok, then hire a car to drive to the forest (a couple of hours), or\u00a0get the train to Hajnowka and then a bus.

Compared with most other European countries, Poland has not attracted many immigrants either. According to the last census in 2002, 96.7% of the country are Polish, with the main ethnic minorities hailing from Germany, Ukraine and Belarus. Though the proportion of foreigners is thought to have increased slightly in the past nine years, Poland remains an almost exclusively white, Catholic country.Poland is currently enjoying its second \"economic miracle\". Twenty-one years after Solidarity leaders gambled successfully on the \"big bang\", ushering in free market capitalism overnight on New Year's Day 1990, the economy they created has beaten the odds. Alone in the whole EU it continued to grow through the recession of the past two years. Last year the economy grew by nearly 4%, and is projected to do even better this year. The country has EU investment to thank, as well as a construction boom driven by the need to prepare for the 2012 European football championships.Poland negotiated its way out of communism at the famous \"round table\" talks in 1989, but it only got round to drafting a comprehensive new constitution for the \"third republic\" in 1997. It is a self-conscious casting off of the communist past, rejecting the failed experiments in collectivisation by explicitly making the \"family farm\" the foundation of the agrarian economy. The system is semi-presidential. The presidency has more power than Germany's but less than the French Elys\u00e9e. The proportional representation elections to the lower house of parliament (the Sejm) produced two decades of shaky short-lived coalitions and continual spats between parliament and president. By those standards, the current period counts as the most stable in modern Polish history.Polish politics is currently a two-horse race. The party now in power is the liberal Civic Platform, led by the football-playing prime minister Donald Tusk. The president, Bronislaw Komorowski, is from the same party. These two took over from one of the world's more eccentric political double acts, the identical Kaczynski twins Jaroslaw and Lech, child actors who grew up to become prime minister and president respectively. Lech was killed in the Smolensk air crash last year, which his grieving brother still believes was more than an accident. In the general election this autumn, Jaroslaw will try to regain the premiership with his conservative Law and Justice party. Minor parties have names which hark back to bygone days, such as The League of Polish Families and Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland.Food and drinkSurely one of the underrated gems of European cuisine, Polish food is distinctive, and can be superb. The classic soup, zurek, is made of rye flour left to ferment in water for a few days. Mixed with stock and marjoram, with bits of kielbasa (sausage) and hard-boiled egg floating on the bottom, it can be addictive. Pierogi (ravioli) are a food group of their own \u2013 arguably the best variety being stuffed with minced cabbage and wild mushrooms (the object of a near-mystical reverence). Apart from the ubiquitous kebab, the Polish fast food of choice is the Zapiekanka, a baguette topped with melted cheese and mushrooms and smothered in ketchup. Vodka is not the dominant drink of yore. Its place has been taken by imported wine and excellent local beers, like Okocim, Zywiec and a crop of new micro-breweries.Poland has succumbed to the same guilty pleasures as much of the rest of the world. Billboards in the cities are advertising the new series of X Factor, and Taniec z Gwiazdami (Dancing with the Stars) is one of Poland's biggest shows. Though the majority of Polish cinemas spurn homegrown films in favour of Hollywood blockbusters, the indigenous film industry is in passable health. The National Film School in Lodz is still producing decent directors, though none of its alumni have ever replicated the worldwide success of Roman Polanski, Krzysztof \"Three Colors\" Kieslowski and Andrzej Wajda, whose film school in Warsaw now rivals his alma mater. Polish pop music does not travel well, but dominates the charts at home. Probably the most popular Polish band is Kult, whose thoughtful (if unusual) mix of punk, rock, jazz and poetry has been popular for almost 30 years. Poland's answer to Britney Spears is Doda, a busty and litigious 27-year-old (pictured top right) with a hellraising reputation.Polish men think of themselves as chivalrous and romantic, which is true up to a point. Women certainly shouldn't expect to have to open any doors during a visit to Poland, and will very likely receive flowers from any suitors. These days, though, men tend to shake rather than kiss a woman's hand when they meet. Premarital sex goes on but is not talked about much \u2013 outside the increasingly secular Warsaw, at least \u2013 and many parents are often unhappy when their offspring move in with their partners before getting wed. Abortions are illegal (apart from in rape cases or for health reasons), and contraception is not promoted. Sex education in schools is still referred to euphemistically as \"education for life and family\". Homophobia is still a problem: this year the ruling party had to expel an MP for abusive comments about gay people.Foreign policy has understandably been shaped by the repeated experience of being invaded (see below). An attempt to put history to rest ended in disaster a year ago when the plane taking President Lech Kaczynski to a joint Polish-Russian commemoration of the Katyn massacre crashed at Smolensk, killing not just the president but much of the military leadership. Ex-prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski outraged the Germans by suggesting that Poland's 6 million war victims should be taken into account when apportioning EU voting rights. Last month, the foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, called for historic resentments to be put aside and for Poland to do business with its neighbours like a normal country. It is still too early to say if that will work.It would be fair to say that history has not treated Poland kindly. Occupying the flat space between Germany and Russia, Poland is near-impossible to defend. The Commonwealth, as it calls itself, was swallowed up entirely in 1795 by the Russians, Prussians and Austrians and did not resurface until 1918. The \"second republic\" between the wars was an uneasy experience. Soviet conquest was narrowly averted in a 1920 battle on the outskirts of Warsaw, now known as \"the miracle on the Vistula\". The hero of the hour, Jozef Pilsudski, went on to stage a coup and dominated Poland between the wars. What followed was unmitigated disaster. Poland was carved up by Hitler and Stalin, who turned it into a killing field. Six million Poles \u2013 3 million Jewish and 3 million Catholic \u2013 were exterminated, including in the Soviets' execution of almost the entire officer corps at Katyn in 1940, a massacre Moscow blamed on the Nazis. At the war's end, Stalin swallowed Poland whole. One revolt after another was crushed until a now famous electrician climbed over the wall of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk and called for a strike. Lech Walesa and Solidarity were instrumental in bringing down communism not just in Poland but across eastern Europe, and Poles are not about to let Europe forget it.The Polish psyche is not given to optimism \u2013 perhaps to be expected given the centuries of oppression, invasions and foreign rule. This pessimism is best demonstrated in the common title of the Polish national anthem, Jeszcze Polska nie zginela, which means Poland\u00a0Has\u00a0Not Yet Perished. Be warned that if you ask Poles how they are, they will probably tell you the truth, and it may take some time. The classic Polish answer to \"How are you?\" is \"Stara bieda\" which literally means \"old poverty\". Poles are also less\u00a0afraid\u00a0of conversational silences than Britons. Most of all, Poles are generous and hospitable and proud of their country surviving against the\u00a0odds.", "tags": ["Poland"], "title": "Poland at a glance"},{"date": "2011-04-08T23:04:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In the 19th century, Lower Silesia (the bottom left-hand corner of Poland) was a prized piece of the German empire. After King Wilhelm's brother built himself a summer palace here in 1822, every Prussian nobleman had to build one too, complete with English-style park, artificial ruins and romantic temples.Drive through the valley around Jelenia Gora and you'll find a crumbling castle every few miles.

You'll eat dinner by candlelight reflected in polished stone floors, climb gothic carved timber staircases to bed, and sleep deeply to the sound of the wind in 100-year-old lime trees.Classical music nuts will thrill to the baroque abbey in Krzeszow, east of Jelenia Gora. Here, precious original manuscripts from Berlin (including a quarter of all Mozart's works) were kept out of range of Allied bombers during the second world war.Park in the resort of Karpacz, a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Wroclaw, then take the chairlift (ignore the sneering locals who climb on foot as a matter of national pride). Hike the last kilometre to the highest peak of Sniezka, through which Poland's southern border runs. There's a flying-saucer-shaped Soviet-era cafe on top, with views north across Poland and south into the Czech Republic. In communist times this border was guarded by Russian soldiers with rifles. Kids would put a foot across the line then brag that they had been abroad. At a time when hardly anyone had a passport to travel, it was a bitter joke. Now the border is lost in long grass.It's a 45-minute walk to an isolated valley known as Samotnia, or \"the lonely place\". For around \u00a315 you can have a double room in the wooden chalet here, Schronisko Samotnia (+48 75 761 9376, samotnia.com.pl/en). There's a cosy restaurant, or you can eat outside on benches by the lake.Leba is a small fishing village and resort on the Baltic coast, where you walk through pine forests to the beach. Kids queue to buy rurki z kremem, yummy cigar-shaped waffle tubes filled with vanilla cream. You can hunt for lumps of amber (fossilised tree resin) in the vast, lunar sand dunes where Rommel is said to have practised desert warfare, or watch families sheltering from the stiff Baltic breeze. Hotel Neptun (+48 59 866 1432, neptunhotel.pl/en) is the only hotel/castle in Poland built on a beach, and offers dinner, bed and breakfast for two from around \u00a395 a night.It was in nearby Gdansk that brave shipbuilders (encouraged by a forward-thinking Pope) first stood up to their communist occupiers.

Local noble Jan Zamojski hired Italian architect Bernardo Morando for the job in 1580. The result is stunning \u2013 think your own private Padua, without the queues. Book a room on the arcaded main square and sit in the window with a bottle of champagne, toasting the brides who marry every couple of hours on the staircase of the pink town hall.

Orbis Zamojski (+48 84 639 2516, accorhotels.com/gb) has basic doubles for around \u00a340 room only, but pay a bit more for the corner suite with a view of the town hall.Polish composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin (his dad was French) was born in Zelazowa Wola, not far from Warsaw. Visit his house (+48 46 863 3300, chopin.museum/en/museum/branches/id/216), a typical 19th-century Polish nobleman's house, or dworek. Sit in the garden with its stream and dragonflies, and listen to a nocturne on a warm summer evening (there are regular concerts). Chopin left Poland in 1831 and never returned. He lived in Paris, along with other Polish exiles, and the nostalgic music he wrote there still has the power to carry any Polish migrant back home whenever it is played.Cucumber season (sezon ogorkowy) is how Poles describe the long summer months when schools, theatres and pretty much everything else shuts down and there is nothing to do but watch cucumbers growing. Warm sunshine arrives (finally), pierogi (dumplings) are filled with blueberries, and soup is made from young beetroot shoots. It's the perfect time to get lost in the heart of Poland. First buy a picnic \u2013 ideally cold smoked sausage, beer, rye bread and cherries.There are daily farmers' markets in the rynek or market squares of most small towns and villages, with wonderfully fresh piles of unwashed carrots, beetroot and cabbages. There will be smoked cheeses and sausages, and you can buy just a half or a third of a loaf of delicious rye bread if that is all you need for lunch. No need to label the produce \"organic\" \u2013 there is no other kind of farming here \u2013 and it is all truly seasonal.Drive south from Warsaw for a couple of hours, then turn off on to the smallest road you can find. Keep turning randomly right and left wherever you see a plaster saint in a shrine by the road, until your route peters out in the middle of a blossoming potato field. Get out with your picnic. Lie on the ground and watch the passing clouds overhead for further directions.Lodz (pronounced woodge) is where cinema greats Roman Polanski, Andrzej Wajda and Krzysztof Kieslowski went to film school. \"HollyLodz\" animators strongly influenced British TV \u2013 the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield (where Nick Park conceived Wallace & Gromit) ran regular exchanges in the 1980s. This newly groovy industrial town 120km south of Warsaw is turning its old fabric factories into hip apartments and studios. Walk the Polish equivalent of Hollywood Boulevard's Avenue of the Stars, Piotrkowska, and ask at the Film Commission (104 Piotrkowska, +48 42 638 5546, lodzfilmcommission.com) to go on the free Lodz Film Heritage Trail (Saturdays only).You can visit Lancut castle (+48 17 225 2008, zamek-lancut.pl/en), the historical heart of the elegant Polish aristocracy in the south-east corner of Poland, as long as you are prepared to shuffle round the parquet floors with protective slippers over your shoes. It was originally built by the Lubomirski dynasty (complete with exquisite tiny theatre), then extended by the Potockis into one of the grandest residences in Europe.Forget the rococo palaces and green gardens, it is Wolsztyn that many people (well, blokes mainly) want to visit. Towards the centre of the country, it is the only place in Europe that still operates a scheduled train service using steam locomotives. You can actually drive your own loco, and 40+-year-old boys from Texas to Amsterdam flock here to try footplating and shunting, far away from their day jobs, health and safety, and wives who just don't get it. The Wolsztyn Experience (01628 524876, thewolsztynexperience.org) has one-week courses from \u00a38250/week, and weekends from \u00a3130,, including accommodation, some in the depot.

I'll mutter Witold Gombrowicz, hum and haw at Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski, and tentatively suggest Michal Witkowski's recently-translated Lovetown, but the only thing I can really recommend about Polish literature is a marvellous short story by Michal Olszewski, wonderfully translated by Antonia Lloyd Jones, which we ran as part of a series of short stories to commemorate the fall of the Berlin wall a couple of years back.So it's over to you. As before, we're looking for the books which shed light on the Polish experience \u2013 fiction, non-fiction, poems and plays \u2013 whether written by those who'd call themselves Poles, or not. Just make your way down the page to the boxes of magic, fill in a country \u2013 that's Poland \u2013 an author, a title, maybe a translator and some indication of why it's a book you'd recommend. Then the elves will fly, the cogs will turn and hey presto, there'll be a list of knowledge, just like the one we made for Spain. After that the only issue will be where to head next.So tell us: where would you like to go next? Tell us in the comments, and we'll head wherever you fancy.

There are restaurants with Hebrew lettering, a new community centre where students drop in for a Sabbath meal, and even a Jewish kindergarten. And once a year, this quarter is dominated by a celebration of Jewish music, theatre and film that attracts up to 13,000 visitors.Krakow's Jewish Culture festival is the most prominent symbol of an apparent rejuvenation in the shadow of the Holocaust. This is the nearest Polish city to Auschwitz, but it has also become a place where Poles are discovering their lost Jewish heritage.The Jewish community centre on Miodowa Street, neighbouring a synagogue defiled by the Nazis but now restored for worship, has seen a steady stream of visitors. Opened in 2008 by Prince Charles, the centre offers Hebrew and Yiddish language lessons and an introductory religious course, alongside yoga, belly-dancing and basketball.Jonathan Ornstein, the centre's director, says: \"I think that people for a few years have been talking about a Jewish renaissance in Poland, in Krakow especially, and that was primarily an interest by non-Jews in Jewish culture, and I think that now we're in a second stage that is totally made possible by this first stage. That's people with Jewish roots getting involved in the Jewish community.\"Ornstein says the centre has young people coming in every day who have no contact with Jewish life but want to explore their Jewish roots. One local rabbi tells a story of a Pole who discovered from his mother's birth certificate that she was Jewish, born in Krakow's wartime ghetto. She told him that she had kept it a secret all her life \u2013 and then they discovered that the man's father was Jewish, too.There are reckoned to be slightly more than 100 official members of the Jewish community in Krakow, but 400 who consider themselves Jewish.The precursor of this renewal has been the festival, now in its 21st year. It is an event that looks both ways, embracing klezmer music and Yiddish movies of the past, but also seeking out the avant garde. This year that includes a \"hip-hop meets klezmer\" act from the US as well as workshops in Hebrew calligraphy, Jewish cooking and singing, all allowing the audience to get involved.It acts as a reminder to Poles that their culture is not a \"monolith\", says the festival's director, Janusz Makuch, citing the influential Jewish songwriter Mordechai Gebirtig as one example. \"Gebirtig composed a lot of beautiful songs, sung by the Poles. When Poles sang these tunes, they didn't realise they sang a Jewish song.\"Instead of [being] a hermetic culture, the secular Jewish culture was intertwined with Polish culture.\"One of this year's performers, Jarek Bester, of the Bester Quartet, describes his sound as contemporary chamber music that reinterprets traditional Yiddish folk. On CD it is a mix of plaintive violin and thundering accordion.Bester says: \"[The Holocaust] was a kind of intermission in composing and playing klezmer music. I'm trying to provide a continuation of klezmer \u2013 I think the way we play is how klezmer music would be played, if it wasn't for the second world war.\"Jewish life in Krakow, nearly extinguished by the Nazis, was driven underground in the communist era. Kazimierz, where Schindler's List was filmed, was a neglected and under-populated district under communism. In recent years it has been transformed into one of the hippest parts of the city. Pavements are crowded with cafe tables and streets are lined with vodka bars, vintage boutiques and tiny art galleries. Only the peeling plaster and brickwork of some of the facades gives away the past neglect, and that is rapidly being patched up.Jewishness has been adopted as a selling point, almost a badge of cool, in a way that is sometimes tasteless. Converted golf carts tout for tourist custom with awnings displaying the itinerary: \"Auschwitz, Schindler's factory, Jewish quarter.\" A local rabbi, Eliezer Gurary, spoke of his disquiet at the Jewish mannequins in shops \u2013 dolls of black-robed, bearded men that border on racist caricature. There have been complaints over a \"Jewish-themed\" restaurant that displays a page of the Torah on its wall.At the community centre, Ornstein says: \"You have some fake Jewish-style restaurants, and I would love those to be restaurants run by Jews, kosher restaurants and actually be realistic. I think that's a way off, [but] we're moving in that direction. These days in Poland the fact that you can call a restaurant a Jewish restaurant and that brings people in, is in itself a positive thing.\"I think the remarkable thing here is that you have a community that's growing, that's optimistic, that feels very safe, and it's going in a direction which is very different to most Jewish communities in Europe.\"A survey conducted last year by the Polish Public Opinion Poll Institute indicated a decline in antisemitism among all age groups over the decade. The poll, which asked questions intended to uncover people's belief in Jewish \"influence\" over Polish politics, found that fewer than 6% mentioned Jewish people when asked about influential minorities, compared with nearly 20% in 2002.Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, believes that the opinion polls on antisemitism fail to show the underlying change in Polish attitudes. \"The flaw in all these surveys is that \u2013 let's say they show that 20% of Poles have antisemitic attitudes \u2013 everyone misses what the other 80% is thinking,\" Schudrich says at his office at the Warsaw synagogue. \"Are they indifferent or are they appalled by the 20%? And it seems to me more and more people are raising their rejection of these antisemitic trends. That's mostly due to John Paul II, who did more to fight antisemitism than anyone in the last 2,000 years.\"Schudrich, who was born in New York and first came to Poland in 1992, believes that the late Polish pope, who will be beatified on 1 May, made indifference to antisemitism less acceptable in the Catholic mainstream.\"John Paul II empowered all those people who found it abhorrent,\" he says. The rabbi believes he is seeing a subtle, slow but telling transformation in the relationship between Polish Jews and the wider community.\"I get these calls from town X saying: 'We feel an obligation to perpetuate the memory of the Jews who once lived here.' It used to be: 'What can be done to clean your cemetery.' Now it's: 'What can be done to clean our cemetery.'\"On Tuesday the chief rabbi was in the eastern Polish town of Zamosc, along with ambassadors from the US, Germany and Israel, at the restoration of a 17th-century synagogue. The building is considered a jewel of Renaissance architecture, and will house a Polish Jewish cultural centre.Schudrich chooses his words carefully when talking about Golden Harvest, a controversial new book by a Princeton University professor, Jan Gross, about Poles who dug up the mass graves of Jews killed in the Holocaust looking for gold and precious stones.\"It's important to talk about this subject. Some people did horrific things, but we knew this already. The question is: was it rampant? In Treblinka and in Birkenau, was it the same 50 people doing this each time, or a different 50 people?\" Schudrich says. \"You could come away with the impression that everyone did it.\"And were they doing it because the victims were Jews, or because the Nazis destroyed any sense of morality so everything was permitted? I don't know. Gross writes in a way to provoke, not to educate, and Poles don't react well to it. Because of the style, too many people reject what he has to say.\"On a bright afternoon recently in Kazimierz a boy in a kippah (skullcap) walked along the street where a few hours earlier a golf cart filled with tourists had trundled past. Poland was once home to the second largest Jewish community in the world, and any revival is the faintest echo of what was destroyed \u2013 but it is a source of great pride to a city with 700 years of Jewish history.Makuch, of the Jewish Culture festival, says: \"We are sitting in Kazimierz, founded by one of the Polish kings in 1335; we are surrounded by seven beautiful synagogues built mostly in the baroque and Renaissance periods. Poland, and especially Krakow, was proud of cultural pluralism \u2013 a lot of people lived here: Poles, Jews, Russians, Armenians, all kinds of guys, and they lived together, and they respected each other.\"That's what I'm trying to explore and what I'm trying to keep. Everything was mixed, everything was intertwined before the second world war; almost everything.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Pope John Paul II", "Holocaust", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Europe", "World news", "The papacy"], "title": "A Jewish renaissance in Poland"},{"date": "2011-04-04T07:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A few weeks ago, Gazeta Wyborcza launched a new bestseller list. If it serves as a measure of the condition of Polish literature, one could say that we have come down with the same illness as the rest of the world: crime Larssonosis, romance-gastronomic Gilbertosis and vampiric Meyerosis. Vampires in particular featured heavily in the ratings; this should be a source of delight for us, as vampires are a Slavic invention. One can learn about their heritage from The Vampire: A Symbolic Biography by Maria Janion, one of the most outstanding Polish scholars of literary Romanticism. If this invaluable work were translated into English (what a pity you haven't translated it yet), the followers of Stephenie Meyer would have a chance to refresh their knowledge of creatures that balance between life and death. We call them \"upiory\", \"strzygi\", \"brukolaki\" or \"wapierze\".The launch of our bestseller list coincided with the publication of a book that caused enormous controversy: Golden Harvest by Jan Tomasz Gross and Irena Grudzinska-Gross. The scandal broke even before it appeared in bookshops. Its subject is the participation of Poles in the so-called third phase of the Holocaust, when Poles denounced their Jewish neighbours (Neighbours is the title of the first of Gross's books about the relations between Poles and Jews during the second world war) to pillage their property. Even their graves. This book has been taken by many as a blow to the image of Poles as innocent victims of the Nazis. And \u2013 as the authors emphasise \u2013 plundering Jewish property was common throughout Europe.The Holocaust in Polish literature means primarily Hanna Krall, who ever since her book Shielding the Flame \u2013 a record of interviews with Marek Edelman, one of the leaders of the Warsaw ghetto uprising \u2013 has been producing volumes of brilliant stories about the fate of Poland's Jews. Each of these stories contains enough material for a novel, but Krall has the ability to distil the tragic and sometimes grotesque essence from the life of her heroes. Her next book, White Maria, will be published in a few weeks.Krall started as a reporter, which is typical of Poland's flourishing non-fiction scene. She is still associated first and foremost with reportage, which in Poland is considered to be a genre somewhere between journalism and literature. Reading her books makes you wonder whether you are reading non-fiction or poetry.This genre-busting nature of Polish reportage is also the source of many misunderstandings. When a biography of Poland's most eminent reporter (and the best-known Polish writer worldwide), Ryszard Kapuscinski, came out last year (Kapuscinski Non-fiction by Artur Domos\u0142awski), it provoked many arguments, including about the reporter's competence. To what degree should a reporter be just a witness, and to what degree an author who includes his or her own outlook, interpretations and literary style? Where does journalism (non-fiction) end, and literary fiction begin? This dispute remains unsettled, just like many other arguments provoked by Domos\u0142awski's book, such as the controversy over the attitudes that journalists and writers adopted during the communist years, or the extent to which a biographer can explore the personal life of his or her subject.Regardless of the gravity of the charges against the so-called Polish School of Reportage, of which Kapuscinski was the most prominent representative, it is in good condition. Though it is ever rarer in the Polish press, it transfers relatively well to books. Successors of Kapuscinski \u2013 Mariusz Szczygie\u0142, Jacek Hugo-Bader, Wojciech Tochman \u2013 appear near the\u00a0top of the bestseller lists, and their\u00a0works have been translated into\u00a0all of the major European languages. So reportage is still a Polish speciality, although reporters tend now to wander the world and through history in their search for interesting subjects. Szczygie\u0142 devoted his book Gottland (winner of the 2009 European Book prize) to the conflicting attitudes that Czechs adopt towards communism; Hugo-Bader has travelled through a drink-sodden post-Soviet Russia (White Heat); while Tochman has analysed the consequences of the genocide in Rwanda (We Will Portray Death Today). Young writers are following their lead: in Murderer from the Apricot City, Witold Szab\u0142owski reports on the cultural clashes and conflicts that divide contemporary Turkey as it attempts to join the European Union.Poland's own accession to the EU, meanwhile, has resulted in a level of economic migration that has not yet been fully reflected in our literature. The only books that come to mind are a trilogy by one of Poland's most outstanding poets and essayists, Jaros\u0142aw Marek Rymkiewicz, who has tried to vaccinate Poles against the supposed loss of national identity that some feared membership would bring. In Kinderszenen Rymkiewicz ostensibly emotionlessly recounts some of the bloodiest episodes from Polish history \u2013 first of all the 1944 Warsaw uprising (not to be confused with the Warsaw ghetto uprising), which cost the lives of 200,000 people \u2013 and tries to make these victims a foundation for modern Polish society.However, the literary mainstream is made up of authors who follow Witold Gombrowicz, who teaches distance from those models of Polish identity. Janusz Rudnicki, Marcin Swietlicki, Micha\u0142 Witkowski and Jerzy Pilch are writers who find their own ironic ways of dealing with our literary tradition. The most important writer of this group is Pilch \u2013 not only because of his novels, but also because of his position as the country's leading columnist. In view of the vanishing significance of literary criticism, which is now found only in niche magazines, and \u2013 I must admit with a heavy heart \u2013 the claustrophobia that affects newspapers' cultural pages, Pilch is considered an authority on literature.Dorota Mas\u0142owska owes him a lot. Her White and Red was the most important debut to appear in the first 20 years after independence. It is seemingly a realist novel about the dregs of society, but in fact the broken language of its heroes, full of references to pop culture and different subcultures, perfectly reflects the chaotic consciousness of all Poles living through those days of political and social transformation. Her second novel, The Queen's Peacock, won the Nike, Poland's most important literary award. It's worth stressing here that awards are another substitute for literary criticism, though this is by no means an exclusively Polish phenomenon. The list of Nike laureates gives quite a reliable insight into the most important trends and names in Polish literature. Take poetry, which competes on equal terms with novels and essays for the title of the best book of the year. It is significant that the last two Nobel prizes for literature won by Poles went to poets: Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz (1981) and Wis\u0142awa Szymborska (1996).Who is likely to win the Nike award this year? Balladyny i romanse (\"Ballads and Romances\") by the young novelist Ignacy Karowicz is my favourite. It is an ironic story about gods from various large and small religions who decide to give up immortality and begin living a \"normal\" life among Poles. However, these gods share suspiciously Polish notions about the citizens of western Europe. Is life in a block of flats with worn-out gods, who desperately look to find their own place in the world, a metaphor for our presence in the European Union?1 The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown2 Nie potrafie schudnac by Pierre Dukan (diet book)3 Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert4 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson5 Zielone drzwi (Green Door) by Katarzyna Grochola (novel from \"queen of Polish fem-pulp\")Total 2010 book sales 133m", "tags": ["Publishing", "Books", "Culture"], "title": "What they're reading in Poland"},{"date": "2011-06-15T11:04:41Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland's leading newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, is playing host to 21 journalism students to test Poland's readiness to host football's 2012 Euro championship.The students, from City University London, will visit Poland's 21 biggest cities in a nine-day trip starting this weekend.The project, called Mission 21, is also an experiment by the newspaper into the journalistic effectiveness of social media tools.So, aside from their role as \"referees\" for the football event, students will be blogging and using Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to share their experiences.Grzegorz Piechota, a senior editor at the paper, says that the student visit \"is a bit like having a look in the mirror at ourselves.\"Professor George Brock, City's head of journalism, says: \"It is a unique chance for 21 of our best students to do some hands-on reporting in a foreign country, the kind of chance they are not likely to have again until well into their journalistic careers.\"Full disclosure: I teach at City Source: City University PR", "tags": ["Media", "Journalism education", "Poland", "City University London", "Blogging", "Social media", "Twitter", "Facebook", "YouTube", "Europe", "World news", "Football", "Uefa", "Euro 2012"], "title": "Journalism students visit Poland as football 'referees'"},{"date": "2011-04-08T23:05:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Even teetotal travellers to Poland are likely to stumble across Zubrowka vodka. It comes in a bottle with a distinctive label featuring a bison, zubr, and a blade of buffalo grass, supposedly urinated on by one of these magnificent creatures. But few visitors bold enough to try this national firewater will be aware of the precarious existence of the European bison, or realise that they can actually see them in the wild.Conserving bison is not just about protecting a national symbol of Poland; it is linked to the survival of Europe's last primeval forest, the 8,000-year-old Bialowieza, which straddles the border with Belarus. Around 16% of the Polish part of the forest is a national park and home to about 470 of the animals.The bison is Europe's heaviest land mammal, weighing up to 800kg. They\u00a0are naturally shy \u2013 and experts want to keep it that way \u2013 but it is possible to see them.Tourists can visit the protected primeval area of the national park, a Unesco world heritage site, though only if they book a guided tour. It's worth a trip: the forest teems with life \u2013 wolves, elks, stags, lynx and a great variety of birds \u2013 and it's a haunting experience to wander among its ancient trees. I have seen them there myself, and it's an incredible experience if you are lucky.The easiest place to spot them should be the hay meadows on which they feed, on the fringes of the forest, which you can visit under your own steam. Conservation efforts (part-funded by the EU) to expand the area the bison live in and bring them out on to the hay meadows to feed in autumn/winter (and not rely on artificial feeding) are increasing opportunities to see them, though in summer they tend to stick to the forest. An easier solution is to visit the large semi-natural enclosure, or \"show reserve\" near the village.Ironically, the primeval forest survives because of hunting. Polish kings and Russian tsars were fond of hunting bison and maintained a small population. But during the first world war, bison were hunted to near extinction for food by German soldiers\u00a0and locals. In 1929 a captive-breeding programme started, and in 1952 the animal was reintroduced to the forest.\u2022 See bpn.com.pl for information about visiting the park. It costs \u00a31.30 to\u00a0visit the show reserve; tours of the forest arranged at the park's information centre cost around \u00a377 for a group for three hours. From Warsaw, take a\u00a0train to Bialystok, then hire a car to drive to the forest (a couple of hours), or\u00a0get the train to Hajnowka and then a bus.

The problem in Japan was not the power plants themselves, but the earthquake. We need to make a decision based on rational analysis and not emotions.\"The nuclear disaster in Fukushima has sparked public debates about the future of nuclear power around the world and Germany temporarily shut down seven of its oldest reactors pending a safety review.Grad said the centre-right government wants Poland's first two nuclear reactors to produce a tenth of the country's energy. Most of it comes from coal and gas, as well as renewables such as wind farms.Poland is in the middle of privatising some of its biggest energy companies, as part of a privatisation spree that started 20 years ago and transformed Poland's socialist state to a market economy. Many banks were privatised in the 1990s, and the Polish telecoms group TPSA was sold to France Telecom in 2000.More than 800 companies were put on the privatisation list in 2008 and so far 440 have been privatised. The list includes large companies such as the airline Lot which could be sold by the end of the year, as well as hundreds of smaller firms.The Treasury minister, who is in charge of the sell-offs, said: \"The scope of the privatisation programme is unprecedented in the whole region of central and eastern Europe. We carried on throughout the crisis even though some projects were put on hold.\"However, the government has run into some problems recently. Last Friday it abandoned plans to sell a 51% stake in Enea, Poland's third-largest energy group, after bidders, which included France's EDF, did not meet its requirements.Price was not an issue, said Grad, but pointed to the government's condition not to break up the company and corporate governance requirements. \"When the time is right, we will relaunch the process,\" he said.Poland aims to raise some 15bn zloty (\u00a33.25bn) from sell-offs of state assets this year. It needs the privatisation proceeds to cut its budget deficit, which amounts to nearly 8% of GDP. The government of prime minister Donald Tusk has also reined in public spending but ruled out tax hikes, which would be embarrassing given his 2007 election promise to lower taxes.Some 20 companies, mainly in the energy and infrastructure sectors, will remain in state ownership, including PGE, Poland's bigger power group, which will build its nuclear reactors. Grad expressed some impatience with the speed of the privatisation programme, after a slowdown under the two previous Polish governments.\"After 20 years of transformation we should have this process behind us,\" he said. \"When I look at the small and medium-sized businesses, these are sectors the Treasury should have exited many years ago. Not every government sees this as a priority.

Here, Chruszczow stepped in: \"You must not make the mistake of confusing the aims of the EU [under our presidency] and our domestic arrangements on how to meet our targets.\"That would indeed be a scary mistake, given Mackowiak Pandera;'s assessment of the role of coal and gas in Polish energy policy. \"For sure coal is harmful but we see it as a strategic source of energy. We have a source of coal for 300 years,\" she said. \"Poland is 95% dependent on coal. We have to search for new technologies, clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage.\"If there seems any chance that Poland is going to ease up on its coal burning, it looks like shale gas would take its place. \"There is a great expectation that shale gas will help us reach our climate goals,\" Mackowiak Pandera said, notwithstanding the debate on whether shale really is a much lower carbon fuel than coal.

Now a judge on The Voice of Poland, the controversy surrounding Darski has highlighted shifting values in Polish society.Despite being found not guilty last month, the judge ruling that the Bible-ripping act was legitimate artistic expression, Darski has seen a campaign launched against him by a group of conservative Catholics. Indeed, while Polish law remains hardline on blasphemy , with article 196 of the penal code making \"offending religious feelings\" a crime carrying a maximum two-year prison sentence, it has only tended to be applied at the intervention of rightwing politicians. Ryszard Nowak \u2013 a former Law and Justice party MP, and chairman of the committee for the defence against sects \u2013 spearheaded the original case against Darski, as well as naming Behemoth in a blacklist of \"dangerous\" bands distributed to Polish government departments back in 2007.But the fact that The Voice of Poland is aired by the public television network TVP has brought out new critics. Bishop Wies\u0142aw Mering of the northern Polish diocese of W\u0142oc\u0142awek issued a pastoral letter at the beginning of this month condemning Darski as \"a blasphemer, satanist and lover of evil incarnate [who] will have free use of the public television screen to spread his poisonous teachings\", and threatening a licence-fee boycott.Meanwhile, the Association of Catholic Journalists has launched a petition to get Darski removed from the show, and Bishop Grzegorz Kaszak of Sosnowiec has called for active opposition to the singer .TVP, and Darski himself, must be thrilled with all the publicity. But Bishop Mering and others take Darski too seriously in depicting him as a proselytising devil-worshipper. Behemoth owe much of their aesthetic to the black metal scene that emerged in Norway in the late 80s, at the heart of which, says sociologist and metal culture specialist Keith Kahn-Harris, \"lies virulent opposition to religion, particularly Christianity\".This scene has been associated with satanism, fascist ideology, church burnings and a string of violent crimes, but Behemoth's views are somewhat less virulent. Their statement that their 2007 album, The Apostasy, was so named as the word's \"basic meaning is 'to go against religion', and with Poland being one of the top religious countries in the world, Behemoth strives to convey that being religious is not the key to happiness\" was rather mild. And Darski has made frequent suggestions that his \"satanism\" is more about a general anti-establishment individualism than any theistic idea. Indeed, some opponents have dubbed the likes of Darski \"Sunday satanists\".Yet whatever the confusion over what metal culture really represents, it is clear that this row is about more than just religious offence.Last week Darski appeared on the cover of Polish Newsweek swathed in the Polish flag, with the headline: God, Horror, Fatherland. Here was an interrogation of what Polishness might mean, and while Darski's religious disrespect is condemned by people on both sides of the political divide, as an articulate, prosperous, educated young person, he symbolises something of the new Poland. Meanwhile, the church whose fortunes have been so intertwined with that of the nation it serves has lost much of its traditional role as consoler and, often, guardian of liberty in the face of oppression.With Poland only just entering its third decade as a free nation after the communist era, and among the newest members of the EU, a renegotiation of what it means to be Polish, and the place of religion in that national identity, seems to be an ongoing process.With a blasphemy case against Darski's former fianc\u00e9e, the pop star Dorota Rabczewska, still ongoing, and Mering confirming on his website on Thursday that a licence-fee boycott will be going ahead, this row, and all that it might mean for Poland, shows no sign of being resolved.", "tags": ["Poland", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Metal", "Christianity", "Music", "Europe", "Culture", "World news"], "title": "A Sunday satanist or the voice of new Poland? | Sophia Deboick"},{"date": "2011-09-12T15:03:36Z", "country": "poland", "content": "With the next major round of global warming talks now less than 10 weeks away, the European Union's preparations are being led by Poland, a nation which is dependent for 95% of its electricity on dirty coal and, I was told today, has 90 shale gas applications under consideration.So can Poland, current holders of the rotating EU presidency, truly represent the EU's ambition to tackle climate change, when it has been the principle obstacle to greater ambition within the bloc?Who better to answer this that the Polish minister for climate change, Joanna Mackowiak Pandera, and her senior advisor, Tomasz Chruszczow, whom I met today in London.\"Durban is the last call to maintain the global instrument on climate policy,\" Mackowiak Pandera began, before going on to show that at the very least she is across her brief, discussing details of the Kyoto protocol, the Green Fund, technology transfer, monitoring, recording and verification (MRV).But how can Poland be a serious negotiator for the EU with China, India, the US and others, when it has blocked higher carbon cuts in Brussels, I asked?

It blames the accident mainly on the poor training of the pilots, and has since triggered the resignation of the Polish defence minister. Is that the end of the issue? Not a chance.The debate regarding the Smolensk catastrophe long ago stopped revolving around the 96 people who lost their lives that day and the circumstances in which it occurred. Rather, the tragic event sparked off sociopolitical reactions, which have exposed and enhanced the deep cultural divisions existing within Polish society.When Poles heard that a plane carrying the first couple, the country's top military commanders and leading politicians had crashed fatally in Russia while heading to the 70th anniversary ceremony of the Katyn massacre, their instinctive reaction was to rally around each other in a memorable demonstration of national unity.Supporters and critics of Lech Kaczy\u0144ski headed towards the presidential palace in Warsaw, singing songs, holding hands and lighting candles. For a few days, Poland was united. Three days, to be precise. Once they had passed, it was announced the Kaczy\u0144skis would be entombed in Krakow's Wawel Cathedral, the resting place of Polish historical leaders. Many Poles were furious, insisting Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's achievements didn't warrant a burial alongside Poland's greatest.They rejected as \"nonsense\" the arguments of the archbishop of Krakow, Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, who said the late president had \"died a heroic death because he was flying to Katyn to honour Polish martyrs in the name of the whole nation\".Some, including the solidarity legend Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, even went as far as saying that the plane crash was Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's own fault, as he had no doubt put pressure on the pilots to land in spite of adverse weather conditions, in order to get his photo opportunity at the Katyn ceremony. This in turn enraged supporters of the late president.While the immediate reaction to the catastrophe showed that national identity and symbols are important to Poles, the ensuing events also revealed how strongly they differ when it comes to the values around which this identity should be built.Supporters of the late president and the party he co-founded, Law and Justice (PiS), have a very clear vision on the issue. It is a vision shaped by values that can be described as nationalistic, messianistic and Catholic-centered.For them, the Smolensk catastrophe was no coincidence, but another historical sacrifice for the nation, similar to the failed 1944 Warsaw uprising or the 1940 Katyn massacre. They consider these experiences unique to Poland and all historically linked recognition of which is the litmus test for Polish patriotism. This group makes up at least a third of the Polish population.A second group \u2013 the majority \u2013 disagrees with this definition of patriotism but is not as cohesive in its views and doesn't have its own uniform opinion on what modern-day Polish patriotism should resemble. Many of them reject the celebration of events such as the 1944 Warsaw uprising, deeming it unpragmatic. \"A senseless loss of lives, after all it was doomed to fail due to overwhelming German firepower,\" they argue. These Poles see what is labelled \"the Polish martyrdom mentality\" as an obstacle to Poland being able to flow in the political and intellectual mainstream of Europe and they are ashamed that such an image of the country has been created abroad.What really binds them together is the fear of the \"martyr group\", currently led by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of PiS and twin brother of the late president, running Poland. That's the main reason they support the prime minister, Donald Tusk, and his Civic Platform (PO) party, considering them the only force strong enough to keep the \"fanatics\" at bay.Poland is not alone in having strong cultural divisions within its society, the existence of which is not a danger in of itself. What is worrying is the lack of tolerance these groups exhibit for each other. Both have their own political and literary elites who find it hard to conceal their contempt for the other side.Jaros\u0142aw Rymkiewicz, a famous poet and intellectual guru of the Kaczy\u0144ski camp, said recently that the Polish nation has always been made up of two groups: patriots and collaborators. Then there is Stefan Niesio\u0142owski, deputy speaker of parliament from PO, who once said \"the Kaczy\u0144skis are the source of all evil, especially Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\". Such rhetoric doesn't give one much hope for dialogue.George W Bush once famously said \"you are either with us or against us\". The emotions triggered by the Smolensk catastrophe have led most Poles to openly declare which side they are on, thus voluntarily putting themselves in a box.Politicians are quite happy to have people thinking in a box as they are then much more predictable and easier to manipulate. The truth is that the Smolensk catastrophe has benefitted the two major parties in Poland and they will continue exploiting the divisions it exposed and deepened for as long as Poles allow them to.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "Poland is still coming to terms with the Smolensk air disaster | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2011-09-24T13:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A TV talent show has became the focus of a national row in Poland, with the parliamentary commission for culture and the media dramatically condemning one of the show's judges as a \"satanist who publicly offends Christian values\".Adam \"Nergal\" Darski, singer and guitarist in blackened death metal band Behemoth, became a hate figure when he was charged with blasphemy offences for ripping up a Bible on stage at a concert in his hometown of Gdynia, northern Poland, in 2007.

Why is there so much talk of an EU crisis? Some people have a blunt, noisy answer: \"Too much Europe!\" EU structures and policies are said to be creating more problems than they are solving: over-complex institutions, over-ambitious integration (the eurozone, above all), over-centralisation of decision-making. We see a quite new and disturbing decline in confidence at the very heart of European solidarity as it has developed since the second world war.We can't choose the problems that life throws at us. We do decide how we face them. And for Poland, European integration is not a crisis. It's an inspiration.Twenty-two years ago, when communism ended, Poland's GDP shrank by 12%. Inflation ran out of control. Key export markets vanished. We had to build a modern democracy and a thriving market economy from scratch, while disentangling ourselves from the Warsaw pact.With huge efforts \u2013 and generous help from our European partners \u2013 we have succeeded. Poland's economy is growing at more than 4% a year. We are now the sixth largest economy in Europe, and one of the top 20 economies in the world. Poland is the only EU member to have maintained positive growth through the recent economic storms.It's no surprise that Eurobarometer finds Poles expressing strong confidence in the EU. All our success would not have been possible without the collective investment in institutional stability and solidarity that the EU has delivered.But it is not enough to be optimistic and positive. We also must be realistic. The EU does face painful decisions in the months and years to come. Poland will not accept that the answer lies in less solidarity, or \"less integration\". That is the sure path to disintegration, leaving us all worse off \u2013 and with new divisions.Poland is not yet a member of the eurozone, but it is our strategic commitment to join when the conditions are right. We see the euro as a vital national interest, and will play our part, as president, in getting the right decisions taken.Too many of Europe's rules and regulations were designed for very different times. We'll be pressing the case for smarter integration, to release the full potential of the single market and make Europe competitive. An EU-wide common sales contract, cheaper roaming services and a better EU patent regime would transform the way we all do business across Europe.National governments are facing hard financial constraints, so Europe must use its resources more wisely, but with no less ambition. The \"Europe 2020\" strategy requires a budget that maintains Europe's investment in a common future and makes the common agricultural policy more efficient. Europe needs smarter energy policies that reconcile production, supply and distribution with environmental concerns.The wider context is dramatic. As we haggle over our internal problems, hundreds of millions of people look to the EU for help and hope. Countries in the Balkans and in eastern Europe are banging on Europe's door. Democratic movements for change have emerged across the world. These changes are not easy. The human cost can be high. Warsaw is the seat of the EU's borders agency, Frontex. We want to empower the agency to help support member states when migration pressures get acute, as in the southern Mediterranean today.In short, Europe will make a strategic mistake if it retreats into unhappy introspection. Poland takes very seriously the recent stark warnings from Washington about Europe's unsatisfactory contribution to shared defence burdens.Part of the answer to the security challenges facing Europe lies in maintaining steadfast openness to new members, and to the core principle that integration is the best security. Our presidency should see Croatia's accession negotiations completed, and new progress made with Turkey and Iceland.Poland naturally wants to see progress on Europe's own unfinished business. We will work to set up a new framework for co-operation between the EU and Russia, its largest neighbour. We also want to see the EU-Ukraine association agreement signed, paving the way for a free trade area. We will push to advance Association Agreement talks with Moldova. And we'll do what we can to help Belarus, now slumping into severe difficulties after years of oppressive mismanagement.Poland made strong steady strides towards its current success thanks to outside engagement. We in turn want to develop and contribute to the new structures and policies Europe needs in these turbulent times, not least the emerging External Action Service led by Catherine Ashton. In January this year Poland launched the idea of a new European Endowment for Democracy. This would focus European efforts to help our neighbours in eastern Europe and north Africa, reaching out to civil society and reforming governments alike with practical and efficient support.These presidency policy initiatives all show that Poland is keeping optimistic faith with the European ideal.Thirty years ago the Gdansk ship-workers led the way and changed the world, as millions of Poles joined the Solidarity movement to insist on their basic democratic rights and freedoms. The Polish presidency wants to help the EU draw strength from the ambition and patient wisdom of that movement. Poland itself is an EU success story.By investing in solidarity a growing, open and secure Europe delivers spectacular results, and sets an example to other countries and regions now starting their own transitions.As prime minister Donald Tusk said last year on receiving the Charlemagne prize: \"We Poles really believe in Europe.\" We will invigorate Europe with our faith.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "European Union", "UK news"], "title": "For Poland, European integration is not a crisis.

Now a judge on The Voice of Poland, the controversy surrounding Darski has highlighted shifting values in Polish society.Despite being found not guilty last month, the judge ruling that the Bible-ripping act was legitimate artistic expression, Darski has seen a campaign launched against him by a group of conservative Catholics. Indeed, while Polish law remains hardline on blasphemy , with article 196 of the penal code making \"offending religious feelings\" a crime carrying a maximum two-year prison sentence, it has only tended to be applied at the intervention of rightwing politicians. Ryszard Nowak \u2013 a former Law and Justice party MP, and chairman of the committee for the defence against sects \u2013 spearheaded the original case against Darski, as well as naming Behemoth in a blacklist of \"dangerous\" bands distributed to Polish government departments back in 2007.But the fact that The Voice of Poland is aired by the public television network TVP has brought out new critics. Bishop Wies\u0142aw Mering of the northern Polish diocese of W\u0142oc\u0142awek issued a pastoral letter at the beginning of this month condemning Darski as \"a blasphemer, satanist and lover of evil incarnate [who] will have free use of the public television screen to spread his poisonous teachings\", and threatening a licence-fee boycott.Meanwhile, the Association of Catholic Journalists has launched a petition to get Darski removed from the show, and Bishop Grzegorz Kaszak of Sosnowiec has called for active opposition to the singer .TVP, and Darski himself, must be thrilled with all the publicity. But Bishop Mering and others take Darski too seriously in depicting him as a proselytising devil-worshipper. Behemoth owe much of their aesthetic to the black metal scene that emerged in Norway in the late 80s, at the heart of which, says sociologist and metal culture specialist Keith Kahn-Harris, \"lies virulent opposition to religion, particularly Christianity\".This scene has been associated with satanism, fascist ideology, church burnings and a string of violent crimes, but Behemoth's views are somewhat less virulent. Their statement that their 2007 album, The Apostasy, was so named as the word's \"basic meaning is 'to go against religion', and with Poland being one of the top religious countries in the world, Behemoth strives to convey that being religious is not the key to happiness\" was rather mild. And Darski has made frequent suggestions that his \"satanism\" is more about a general anti-establishment individualism than any theistic idea. Indeed, some opponents have dubbed the likes of Darski \"Sunday satanists\".Yet whatever the confusion over what metal culture really represents, it is clear that this row is about more than just religious offence.Last week Darski appeared on the cover of Polish Newsweek swathed in the Polish flag, with the headline: God, Horror, Fatherland. Here was an interrogation of what Polishness might mean, and while Darski's religious disrespect is condemned by people on both sides of the political divide, as an articulate, prosperous, educated young person, he symbolises something of the new Poland. Meanwhile, the church whose fortunes have been so intertwined with that of the nation it serves has lost much of its traditional role as consoler and, often, guardian of liberty in the face of oppression.With Poland only just entering its third decade as a free nation after the communist era, and among the newest members of the EU, a renegotiation of what it means to be Polish, and the place of religion in that national identity, seems to be an ongoing process.With a blasphemy case against Darski's former fianc\u00e9e, the pop star Dorota Rabczewska, still ongoing, and Mering confirming on his website on Thursday that a licence-fee boycott will be going ahead, this row, and all that it might mean for Poland, shows no sign of being resolved.", "tags": ["Poland", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Metal", "Christianity", "Music", "Europe", "Culture", "World news"], "title": "A Sunday satanist or the voice of new Poland? | Sophia Deboick"},{"date": "2011-09-12T15:03:36Z", "country": "poland", "content": "With the next major round of global warming talks now less than 10 weeks away, the European Union's preparations are being led by Poland, a nation which is dependent for 95% of its electricity on dirty coal and, I was told today, has 90 shale gas applications under consideration.So can Poland, current holders of the rotating EU presidency, truly represent the EU's ambition to tackle climate change, when it has been the principle obstacle to greater ambition within the bloc?Who better to answer this that the Polish minister for climate change, Joanna Mackowiak Pandera, and her senior advisor, Tomasz Chruszczow, whom I met today in London.\"Durban is the last call to maintain the global instrument on climate policy,\" Mackowiak Pandera began, before going on to show that at the very least she is across her brief, discussing details of the Kyoto protocol, the Green Fund, technology transfer, monitoring, recording and verification (MRV).But how can Poland be a serious negotiator for the EU with China, India, the US and others, when it has blocked higher carbon cuts in Brussels, I asked?

It blames the accident mainly on the poor training of the pilots, and has since triggered the resignation of the Polish defence minister. Is that the end of the issue? Not a chance.The debate regarding the Smolensk catastrophe long ago stopped revolving around the 96 people who lost their lives that day and the circumstances in which it occurred. Rather, the tragic event sparked off sociopolitical reactions, which have exposed and enhanced the deep cultural divisions existing within Polish society.When Poles heard that a plane carrying the first couple, the country's top military commanders and leading politicians had crashed fatally in Russia while heading to the 70th anniversary ceremony of the Katyn massacre, their instinctive reaction was to rally around each other in a memorable demonstration of national unity.Supporters and critics of Lech Kaczy\u0144ski headed towards the presidential palace in Warsaw, singing songs, holding hands and lighting candles. For a few days, Poland was united. Three days, to be precise. Once they had passed, it was announced the Kaczy\u0144skis would be entombed in Krakow's Wawel Cathedral, the resting place of Polish historical leaders. Many Poles were furious, insisting Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's achievements didn't warrant a burial alongside Poland's greatest.They rejected as \"nonsense\" the arguments of the archbishop of Krakow, Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, who said the late president had \"died a heroic death because he was flying to Katyn to honour Polish martyrs in the name of the whole nation\".Some, including the solidarity legend Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, even went as far as saying that the plane crash was Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's own fault, as he had no doubt put pressure on the pilots to land in spite of adverse weather conditions, in order to get his photo opportunity at the Katyn ceremony. This in turn enraged supporters of the late president.While the immediate reaction to the catastrophe showed that national identity and symbols are important to Poles, the ensuing events also revealed how strongly they differ when it comes to the values around which this identity should be built.Supporters of the late president and the party he co-founded, Law and Justice (PiS), have a very clear vision on the issue. It is a vision shaped by values that can be described as nationalistic, messianistic and Catholic-centered.For them, the Smolensk catastrophe was no coincidence, but another historical sacrifice for the nation, similar to the failed 1944 Warsaw uprising or the 1940 Katyn massacre. They consider these experiences unique to Poland and all historically linked recognition of which is the litmus test for Polish patriotism. This group makes up at least a third of the Polish population.A second group \u2013 the majority \u2013 disagrees with this definition of patriotism but is not as cohesive in its views and doesn't have its own uniform opinion on what modern-day Polish patriotism should resemble. Many of them reject the celebration of events such as the 1944 Warsaw uprising, deeming it unpragmatic. \"A senseless loss of lives, after all it was doomed to fail due to overwhelming German firepower,\" they argue. These Poles see what is labelled \"the Polish martyrdom mentality\" as an obstacle to Poland being able to flow in the political and intellectual mainstream of Europe and they are ashamed that such an image of the country has been created abroad.What really binds them together is the fear of the \"martyr group\", currently led by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of PiS and twin brother of the late president, running Poland. That's the main reason they support the prime minister, Donald Tusk, and his Civic Platform (PO) party, considering them the only force strong enough to keep the \"fanatics\" at bay.Poland is not alone in having strong cultural divisions within its society, the existence of which is not a danger in of itself. What is worrying is the lack of tolerance these groups exhibit for each other. Both have their own political and literary elites who find it hard to conceal their contempt for the other side.Jaros\u0142aw Rymkiewicz, a famous poet and intellectual guru of the Kaczy\u0144ski camp, said recently that the Polish nation has always been made up of two groups: patriots and collaborators. Then there is Stefan Niesio\u0142owski, deputy speaker of parliament from PO, who once said \"the Kaczy\u0144skis are the source of all evil, especially Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\". Such rhetoric doesn't give one much hope for dialogue.George W Bush once famously said \"you are either with us or against us\". The emotions triggered by the Smolensk catastrophe have led most Poles to openly declare which side they are on, thus voluntarily putting themselves in a box.Politicians are quite happy to have people thinking in a box as they are then much more predictable and easier to manipulate. The truth is that the Smolensk catastrophe has benefitted the two major parties in Poland and they will continue exploiting the divisions it exposed and deepened for as long as Poles allow them to.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "Poland is still coming to terms with the Smolensk air disaster | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2011-07-02T11:00:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "On 1 July Poland takes over the presidency of the European Union for the first time.Inheriting the presidency in mid-2011 looks like a mixed blessing.What has gone wrong? Why is there so much talk of an EU crisis? Some people have a blunt, noisy answer: \"Too much Europe!\" EU structures and policies are said to be creating more problems than they are solving: over-complex institutions, over-ambitious integration (the eurozone, above all), over-centralisation of decision-making. We see a quite new and disturbing decline in confidence at the very heart of European solidarity as it has developed since the second world war.We can't choose the problems that life throws at us. We do decide how we face them. And for Poland, European integration is not a crisis. It's an inspiration.Twenty-two years ago, when communism ended, Poland's GDP shrank by 12%. Inflation ran out of control. Key export markets vanished. We had to build a modern democracy and a thriving market economy from scratch, while disentangling ourselves from the Warsaw pact.With huge efforts \u2013 and generous help from our European partners \u2013 we have succeeded. Poland's economy is growing at more than 4% a year. We are now the sixth largest economy in Europe, and one of the top 20 economies in the world. Poland is the only EU member to have maintained positive growth through the recent economic storms.It's no surprise that Eurobarometer finds Poles expressing strong confidence in the EU. All our success would not have been possible without the collective investment in institutional stability and solidarity that the EU has delivered.But it is not enough to be optimistic and positive. We also must be realistic. The EU does face painful decisions in the months and years to come. Poland will not accept that the answer lies in less solidarity, or \"less integration\". That is the sure path to disintegration, leaving us all worse off \u2013 and with new divisions.Poland is not yet a member of the eurozone, but it is our strategic commitment to join when the conditions are right. We see the euro as a vital national interest, and will play our part, as president, in getting the right decisions taken.Too many of Europe's rules and regulations were designed for very different times. We'll be pressing the case for smarter integration, to release the full potential of the single market and make Europe competitive. An EU-wide common sales contract, cheaper roaming services and a better EU patent regime would transform the way we all do business across Europe.National governments are facing hard financial constraints, so Europe must use its resources more wisely, but with no less ambition. The \"Europe 2020\" strategy requires a budget that maintains Europe's investment in a common future and makes the common agricultural policy more efficient. Europe needs smarter energy policies that reconcile production, supply and distribution with environmental concerns.The wider context is dramatic. As we haggle over our internal problems, hundreds of millions of people look to the EU for help and hope. Countries in the Balkans and in eastern Europe are banging on Europe's door. Democratic movements for change have emerged across the world. These changes are not easy. The human cost can be high. Warsaw is the seat of the EU's borders agency, Frontex. We want to empower the agency to help support member states when migration pressures get acute, as in the southern Mediterranean today.In short, Europe will make a strategic mistake if it retreats into unhappy introspection. Poland takes very seriously the recent stark warnings from Washington about Europe's unsatisfactory contribution to shared defence burdens.Part of the answer to the security challenges facing Europe lies in maintaining steadfast openness to new members, and to the core principle that integration is the best security. Our presidency should see Croatia's accession negotiations completed, and new progress made with Turkey and Iceland.Poland naturally wants to see progress on Europe's own unfinished business. We will work to set up a new framework for co-operation between the EU and Russia, its largest neighbour. We also want to see the EU-Ukraine association agreement signed, paving the way for a free trade area. We will push to advance Association Agreement talks with Moldova.

Once they had passed, it was announced the Kaczy\u0144skis would be entombed in Krakow's Wawel Cathedral, the resting place of Polish historical leaders. Many Poles were furious, insisting Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's achievements didn't warrant a burial alongside Poland's greatest.They rejected as \"nonsense\" the arguments of the archbishop of Krakow, Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, who said the late president had \"died a heroic death because he was flying to Katyn to honour Polish martyrs in the name of the whole nation\".Some, including the solidarity legend Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, even went as far as saying that the plane crash was Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's own fault, as he had no doubt put pressure on the pilots to land in spite of adverse weather conditions, in order to get his photo opportunity at the Katyn ceremony. This in turn enraged supporters of the late president.While the immediate reaction to the catastrophe showed that national identity and symbols are important to Poles, the ensuing events also revealed how strongly they differ when it comes to the values around which this identity should be built.Supporters of the late president and the party he co-founded, Law and Justice (PiS), have a very clear vision on the issue. It is a vision shaped by values that can be described as nationalistic, messianistic and Catholic-centered.For them, the Smolensk catastrophe was no coincidence, but another historical sacrifice for the nation, similar to the failed 1944 Warsaw uprising or the 1940 Katyn massacre. They consider these experiences unique to Poland and all historically linked recognition of which is the litmus test for Polish patriotism. This group makes up at least a third of the Polish population.A second group \u2013 the majority \u2013 disagrees with this definition of patriotism but is not as cohesive in its views and doesn't have its own uniform opinion on what modern-day Polish patriotism should resemble. Many of them reject the celebration of events such as the 1944 Warsaw uprising, deeming it unpragmatic. \"A senseless loss of lives, after all it was doomed to fail due to overwhelming German firepower,\" they argue. These Poles see what is labelled \"the Polish martyrdom mentality\" as an obstacle to Poland being able to flow in the political and intellectual mainstream of Europe and they are ashamed that such an image of the country has been created abroad.What really binds them together is the fear of the \"martyr group\", currently led by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of PiS and twin brother of the late president, running Poland. That's the main reason they support the prime minister, Donald Tusk, and his Civic Platform (PO) party, considering them the only force strong enough to keep the \"fanatics\" at bay.Poland is not alone in having strong cultural divisions within its society, the existence of which is not a danger in of itself. What is worrying is the lack of tolerance these groups exhibit for each other. Both have their own political and literary elites who find it hard to conceal their contempt for the other side.Jaros\u0142aw Rymkiewicz, a famous poet and intellectual guru of the Kaczy\u0144ski camp, said recently that the Polish nation has always been made up of two groups: patriots and collaborators. Then there is Stefan Niesio\u0142owski, deputy speaker of parliament from PO, who once said \"the Kaczy\u0144skis are the source of all evil, especially Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\". Such rhetoric doesn't give one much hope for dialogue.George W Bush once famously said \"you are either with us or against us\". The emotions triggered by the Smolensk catastrophe have led most Poles to openly declare which side they are on, thus voluntarily putting themselves in a box.Politicians are quite happy to have people thinking in a box as they are then much more predictable and easier to manipulate. The truth is that the Smolensk catastrophe has benefitted the two major parties in Poland and they will continue exploiting the divisions it exposed and deepened for as long as Poles allow them to.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "Poland is still coming to terms with the Smolensk air disaster | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2011-07-02T11:00:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "On 1 July Poland takes over the presidency of the European Union for the first time.Inheriting the presidency in mid-2011 looks like a mixed blessing.What has gone wrong? Why is there so much talk of an EU crisis? Some people have a blunt, noisy answer: \"Too much Europe!\" EU structures and policies are said to be creating more problems than they are solving: over-complex institutions, over-ambitious integration (the eurozone, above all), over-centralisation of decision-making. We see a quite new and disturbing decline in confidence at the very heart of European solidarity as it has developed since the second world war.We can't choose the problems that life throws at us. We do decide how we face them. And for Poland, European integration is not a crisis. It's an inspiration.Twenty-two years ago, when communism ended, Poland's GDP shrank by 12%. Inflation ran out of control. Key export markets vanished. We had to build a modern democracy and a thriving market economy from scratch, while disentangling ourselves from the Warsaw pact.With huge efforts \u2013 and generous help from our European partners \u2013 we have succeeded. Poland's economy is growing at more than 4% a year. We are now the sixth largest economy in Europe, and one of the top 20 economies in the world. Poland is the only EU member to have maintained positive growth through the recent economic storms.It's no surprise that Eurobarometer finds Poles expressing strong confidence in the EU. All our success would not have been possible without the collective investment in institutional stability and solidarity that the EU has delivered.But it is not enough to be optimistic and positive. We also must be realistic. The EU does face painful decisions in the months and years to come. Poland will not accept that the answer lies in less solidarity, or \"less integration\". That is the sure path to disintegration, leaving us all worse off \u2013 and with new divisions.Poland is not yet a member of the eurozone, but it is our strategic commitment to join when the conditions are right. We see the euro as a vital national interest, and will play our part, as president, in getting the right decisions taken.Too many of Europe's rules and regulations were designed for very different times. We'll be pressing the case for smarter integration, to release the full potential of the single market and make Europe competitive. An EU-wide common sales contract, cheaper roaming services and a better EU patent regime would transform the way we all do business across Europe.National governments are facing hard financial constraints, so Europe must use its resources more wisely, but with no less ambition. The \"Europe 2020\" strategy requires a budget that maintains Europe's investment in a common future and makes the common agricultural policy more efficient. Europe needs smarter energy policies that reconcile production, supply and distribution with environmental concerns.The wider context is dramatic. As we haggle over our internal problems, hundreds of millions of people look to the EU for help and hope. Countries in the Balkans and in eastern Europe are banging on Europe's door. Democratic movements for change have emerged across the world. These changes are not easy. The human cost can be high. Warsaw is the seat of the EU's borders agency, Frontex. We want to empower the agency to help support member states when migration pressures get acute, as in the southern Mediterranean today.In short, Europe will make a strategic mistake if it retreats into unhappy introspection. Poland takes very seriously the recent stark warnings from Washington about Europe's unsatisfactory contribution to shared defence burdens.Part of the answer to the security challenges facing Europe lies in maintaining steadfast openness to new members, and to the core principle that integration is the best security. Our presidency should see Croatia's accession negotiations completed, and new progress made with Turkey and Iceland.Poland naturally wants to see progress on Europe's own unfinished business. We will work to set up a new framework for co-operation between the EU and Russia, its largest neighbour. We also want to see the EU-Ukraine association agreement signed, paving the way for a free trade area. We will push to advance Association Agreement talks with Moldova. And we'll do what we can to help Belarus, now slumping into severe difficulties after years of oppressive mismanagement.Poland made strong steady strides towards its current success thanks to outside engagement. We in turn want to develop and contribute to the new structures and policies Europe needs in these turbulent times, not least the emerging External Action Service led by Catherine Ashton. In January this year Poland launched the idea of a new European Endowment for Democracy. This would focus European efforts to help our neighbours in eastern Europe and north Africa, reaching out to civil society and reforming governments alike with practical and efficient support.These presidency policy initiatives all show that Poland is keeping optimistic faith with the European ideal.Thirty years ago the Gdansk ship-workers led the way and changed the world, as millions of Poles joined the Solidarity movement to insist on their basic democratic rights and freedoms. The Polish presidency wants to help the EU draw strength from the ambition and patient wisdom of that movement. Poland itself is an EU success story.By investing in solidarity a growing, open and secure Europe delivers spectacular results, and sets an example to other countries and regions now starting their own transitions.As prime minister Donald Tusk said last year on receiving the Charlemagne prize: \"We Poles really believe in Europe.\" We will invigorate Europe with our faith.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "European Union", "UK news"], "title": "For Poland, European integration is not a crisis.

Crucially, my European colleagues need to accept the remorseless logic of monetary union that leads from a single currency to greater fiscal integration.\"He said excessive debt across the world was the \"root cause\" of worsening economic situations, adding: \"What started as a debt crisis in the banking sector in 2008 has now turned into a wider crisis of sovereign, banking and private sector debt. And Britain cannot blame the rest of the world for these debts, for we were one of the biggest contributors to them.\"He said his \"decisive action\" to introduce an emergency budget last summer \"on our own terms\" had put the UK \"ahead of the curve\" in the challenging economic times.Osborne also used his speech to court business leaders to help the government face down \"the forces of stagnation\" resisting reforms he said were necessary to allow businesses to generate growth.Telling the audience they were the \"real engine of growth\", he said the government was working \"flat out to help your businesses not only survive but thrive\".But he claimed that while the government was doing all it could to help the sector succeed, including reducing business taxes and \"burdensome red tape\", special interest groups were trying to prevent ministers from pushing through changes designed to aid recovery.Citing the controversy over proposals to shake up planning legislation, Osborne said the presumption in favour of \"sustainable development\", which could help businesses and create jobs, had \"even been opposed by the Telegraph\".He said he wanted the business community to give \"loud and clear support\" for proposals to reduce more than 1,000 pages of planning regulations to 50 to make it easier for them to develop their businesses.On the growing lobby opposing some of the planning reforms, which includes some of his Conservative colleagues, he said: \"Don't underestimate our determination to win this argument.\"", "tags": ["George Osborne", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Eurozone crisis", "European banks", "Economics", "Business", "Euro", "European Union", "World news", "UK news"], "title": "Eurozone crisis: time to find a solution is short, says Osborne"},{"date": "2011-09-14T21:38:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Europe's struggle to come good on pledges to rescue Greece from bankruptcy and save its single currency has descended into confusion amid political feuding and parliamentary setbacks across the eurozone.Angela Merkel's coalition in Germany faced rows about whether Greece should be allowed to fail; a parliamentary committee in Austria delayed a vote to ratify plans for a stronger bailout fund; and Slovakia's Eurosceptic parliamentary speaker demanded that Greece be allowed to go bust, making clear that he would seek to undermine the plan hatched at a eurozone summit in July in Brussels.Amid the cacophony, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, head of the European commission, voiced exasperation at the failure of EU national leaders to keep their promises and talked up the benefits of eurobonds, a pooling of eurozone government debt.The Polish finance minister said the survival of the EU was at stake. \"Europe is in danger,\" Jacek Rostowski told the European parliament in Strasbourg. \"If the euro area breaks up, the European Union will not be able to survive.\"Poland currently holds the EU presidency and Rostowski faces a tough challenge on Friday when he chairs a meeting of EU finance ministers in Wroclaw which will now be consumed by the crisis.International pressure on Merkel and other European leaders surged, with the US, China, Russia and others demanding they get a grip. In a display of Washington's alarm, the US Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, is to take part in the Wroclaw meetings .The American fear is that a Greek collapse would trigger a renewed European banking crisis which would spill over into the US, a reverse of what happened in 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers was exported across the Atlantic. A fresh crisis could plunge America back into recession and damage Barack Obama's re-election hopes.The US markets reacted to the news from Europe with another jittery day., but the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up more than 140 points having fallen more than a 100 earlier in the day.Damon Vickers, a Seattle-based hedge fund manager, said the jitters were likely to continue. \"This is anxiousness, fear, it's 2008 all over again. That crisis was about banks and the consumer, this is about countries,\" he said. \"The sooner we get this over with the better, then we can move on,\" he said.John Canally, economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial, said investors were torn between the \"fear that we are going to see a collapse in the euro and a country is going to fail and the belief that everything is going to be OK.\" He said all eyes were now on the meeting of European finance ministers this Friday and the US Federal Reserve next week. \"The markets want to see a bold policy move in Europe,\" he said. \"If they don't see that, this will continue.\"Similar fears are gripping the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. A Greek collapse would impact severely on French banks eight months before Nicolas Sarkozy faces a second-term presidential election.Another leader under pressure, Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, has won a vote of confidence, paving the way for his austerity package to be voted through. The governing coalition has been fighting over the details of the fiscal consolidation plan for weeks but Berlusconi mustered enough of a majority to win the vote.At a teleconference Greek prime minister George Papandreou told Merkel and Sarkozy his country was determined to meet all obligations agreed with international lenders in exchange for an EU/IMF bailout. All three leaders have a vested interest in playing for time over Greece despite the sense that it is running out.\"The president and the prime minister have repeated in unison France's determination to do whatever it takes to rescue Greece,\" said the French government spokeswoman, Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse.Officials from the European commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund returned to Athens to try to get the Greek rescue package back on track.According to senior EU diplomats, this month the three officials departed from Athens \"in despair\" at the Greek government's failure to honour the stiff terms of the bailout deal.In July, eurozone leaders pledged a second \u20ac109bn bailout for Greece, to increase the bailout pot, the European Financial Stability Facility, and to empower it to replace the European Central Bank (ECB) in buying up stricken government bonds.But the plans have run into problems. The level of involvement by Greece's private creditors in rolling over debt remains lower than foreseen. The 17 countries of the eurozone have to ratify the new scheme promptly, but ratification has been delayed in Austria, Slovakia, Finland and possibly Slovenia, and run into rebellion among Merkel's coalition partners.While Barroso talked up the prospect of eurobonds on Wednesday, Germany's economics minister and liberals' leader, Philipp R\u00f6sler, ruled them out. P\u00e9cresse in Paris said there would not be a quick fix. \"Eurobonds are for us the end of a process of consolidation in the eurozone because sharing debt also requires the convergence of our budget policies.\"In Bratislava, Richard Sul\u00edk, the Eurosceptic speaker of parliament and leader of one of four parties in the ruling coalition, said the bailout fund was a bigger threat to the euro than Greece.\"It has often happened that a city within a country goes bankrupt, and that does not have consequences for the currency. We must let Greece go into bankruptcy,\" he told Austrian radio. \"The rescue plan tries to overcome the debt crisis with new debt. We are saying that this is equally a threat to the euro.\"That echoed growing calls among political leaders across eurozone creditor countries. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was the first eurozone head of government formally to propose recently new arrangements enabling fiscal recalcitrants to be expelled from the single currency.Barroso said: \"Solid, feasible and concrete proposals have been made and agreed upon.

Now a judge on The Voice of Poland, the controversy surrounding Darski has highlighted shifting values in Polish society.Despite being found not guilty last month, the judge ruling that the Bible-ripping act was legitimate artistic expression, Darski has seen a campaign launched against him by a group of conservative Catholics. Indeed, while Polish law remains hardline on blasphemy , with article 196 of the penal code making \"offending religious feelings\" a crime carrying a maximum two-year prison sentence, it has only tended to be applied at the intervention of rightwing politicians. Ryszard Nowak \u2013 a former Law and Justice party MP, and chairman of the committee for the defence against sects \u2013 spearheaded the original case against Darski, as well as naming Behemoth in a blacklist of \"dangerous\" bands distributed to Polish government departments back in 2007.But the fact that The Voice of Poland is aired by the public television network TVP has brought out new critics. Bishop Wies\u0142aw Mering of the northern Polish diocese of W\u0142oc\u0142awek issued a pastoral letter at the beginning of this month condemning Darski as \"a blasphemer, satanist and lover of evil incarnate [who] will have free use of the public television screen to spread his poisonous teachings\", and threatening a licence-fee boycott.Meanwhile, the Association of Catholic Journalists has launched a petition to get Darski removed from the show, and Bishop Grzegorz Kaszak of Sosnowiec has called for active opposition to the singer .TVP, and Darski himself, must be thrilled with all the publicity. But Bishop Mering and others take Darski too seriously in depicting him as a proselytising devil-worshipper. Behemoth owe much of their aesthetic to the black metal scene that emerged in Norway in the late 80s, at the heart of which, says sociologist and metal culture specialist Keith Kahn-Harris, \"lies virulent opposition to religion, particularly Christianity\".This scene has been associated with satanism, fascist ideology, church burnings and a string of violent crimes, but Behemoth's views are somewhat less virulent. Their statement that their 2007 album, The Apostasy, was so named as the word's \"basic meaning is 'to go against religion', and with Poland being one of the top religious countries in the world, Behemoth strives to convey that being religious is not the key to happiness\" was rather mild. And Darski has made frequent suggestions that his \"satanism\" is more about a general anti-establishment individualism than any theistic idea. Indeed, some opponents have dubbed the likes of Darski \"Sunday satanists\".Yet whatever the confusion over what metal culture really represents, it is clear that this row is about more than just religious offence.Last week Darski appeared on the cover of Polish Newsweek swathed in the Polish flag, with the headline: God, Horror, Fatherland. Here was an interrogation of what Polishness might mean, and while Darski's religious disrespect is condemned by people on both sides of the political divide, as an articulate, prosperous, educated young person, he symbolises something of the new Poland. Meanwhile, the church whose fortunes have been so intertwined with that of the nation it serves has lost much of its traditional role as consoler and, often, guardian of liberty in the face of oppression.With Poland only just entering its third decade as a free nation after the communist era, and among the newest members of the EU, a renegotiation of what it means to be Polish, and the place of religion in that national identity, seems to be an ongoing process.With a blasphemy case against Darski's former fianc\u00e9e, the pop star Dorota Rabczewska, still ongoing, and Mering confirming on his website on Thursday that a licence-fee boycott will be going ahead, this row, and all that it might mean for Poland, shows no sign of being resolved.", "tags": ["Poland", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Metal", "Christianity", "Music", "Europe", "Culture", "World news"], "title": "A Sunday satanist or the voice of new Poland? | Sophia Deboick"},{"date": "2011-09-12T15:03:36Z", "country": "poland", "content": "With the next major round of global warming talks now less than 10 weeks away, the European Union's preparations are being led by Poland, a nation which is dependent for 95% of its electricity on dirty coal and, I was told today, has 90 shale gas applications under consideration.So can Poland, current holders of the rotating EU presidency, truly represent the EU's ambition to tackle climate change, when it has been the principle obstacle to greater ambition within the bloc?Who better to answer this that the Polish minister for climate change, Joanna Mackowiak Pandera, and her senior advisor, Tomasz Chruszczow, whom I met today in London.\"Durban is the last call to maintain the global instrument on climate policy,\" Mackowiak Pandera began, before going on to show that at the very least she is across her brief, discussing details of the Kyoto protocol, the Green Fund, technology transfer, monitoring, recording and verification (MRV).But how can Poland be a serious negotiator for the EU with China, India, the US and others, when it has blocked higher carbon cuts in Brussels, I asked? Here, Chruszczow stepped in: \"You must not make the mistake of confusing the aims of the EU [under our presidency] and our domestic arrangements on how to meet our targets.\"That would indeed be a scary mistake, given Mackowiak Pandera;'s assessment of the role of coal and gas in Polish energy policy. \"For sure coal is harmful but we see it as a strategic source of energy. We have a source of coal for 300 years,\" she said. \"Poland is 95% dependent on coal. We have to search for new technologies, clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage.\"If there seems any chance that Poland is going to ease up on its coal burning, it looks like shale gas would take its place. \"There is a great expectation that shale gas will help us reach our climate goals,\" Mackowiak Pandera said, notwithstanding the debate on whether shale really is a much lower carbon fuel than coal. She then told me something I had not heard before: \"There are 90 permit requests for shale gas in Poland. The initial research is very promising for us.\"To put that in context, the UK has one shale gas site being explored, which so far has produce nothing bar perhaps a small earthquake. France has banned shale gas exploration.Regarding the impact of shale gas drilling, she said, Poland had very strict environmental impact assessment requirements, before adding that \"every energy extraction method is damaging\", such as \"where to site wind farms, for example, without damaging fauna\". That's a very odd comparison, in my view.Nonetheless, Mackowiak Pandera and Chruszczow were very clear-eyed on what is required in Durban to prevent the UN negotiations drifting into meaninglessness: avoiding the death of the only existing legal agreement, the Kyoto protocol, making real the promises of the last summit in Cancun and making new progress in delivering climate cash to poorer nations and on the role of private investment. But can coal-dependent Poland be a convincing negotiator for the EU, the political bloc which has led the world in its action on cutting greenhouse gas emissions? Mackowiak Pandera insists Poland is \"credible\" in this regard.Perhaps a more fundamental question is does it matter who holds the EU presidency? At the Copenhagen summit, amid 120 world leaders, it was Merkel, Sarkozy and Brown who sat by Obama and tried to wrangle a deal, not the then-EU presidents Sweden. And can you remember who led the EU in Cancun in 2010 (clue: Tintin.) We will be in a better position to answer these questions after 10 October, when the EU's environment ministers meet to agree their negotiating position for Durban. A strong, ambitious platform would show the EU, responsible for just 13% of global emissions, can in fact leverage its leadership to move the US and China. That pair of carbon colossuses are, says Chruszczow, \"hiding behind each others' backs and saying 'no, you have to go first'.\"A weak platform would not only signal gloom for the EU's ability to function, but also for the entire climate change negotiations.", "tags": ["Global climate talks", "Poland", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Fracking", "Gas", "Climate change", "European Union", "Green politics"], "title": "Can Poland lead on coal, shale gas and Europe's climate negotiations? | Damian Carrington"},{"date": "2011-08-02T10:00:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Last week, the Polish government finally released a report into the 2010 plane catastrophe, which killed President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski and 95 others.

Inflation ran out of control. Key export markets vanished. We had to build a modern democracy and a thriving market economy from scratch, while disentangling ourselves from the Warsaw pact.With huge efforts \u2013 and generous help from our European partners \u2013 we have succeeded. Poland's economy is growing at more than 4% a year. We are now the sixth largest economy in Europe, and one of the top 20 economies in the world. Poland is the only EU member to have maintained positive growth through the recent economic storms.It's no surprise that Eurobarometer finds Poles expressing strong confidence in the EU. All our success would not have been possible without the collective investment in institutional stability and solidarity that the EU has delivered.But it is not enough to be optimistic and positive. We also must be realistic. The EU does face painful decisions in the months and years to come. Poland will not accept that the answer lies in less solidarity, or \"less integration\". That is the sure path to disintegration, leaving us all worse off \u2013 and with new divisions.Poland is not yet a member of the eurozone, but it is our strategic commitment to join when the conditions are right. We see the euro as a vital national interest, and will play our part, as president, in getting the right decisions taken.Too many of Europe's rules and regulations were designed for very different times. We'll be pressing the case for smarter integration, to release the full potential of the single market and make Europe competitive. An EU-wide common sales contract, cheaper roaming services and a better EU patent regime would transform the way we all do business across Europe.National governments are facing hard financial constraints, so Europe must use its resources more wisely, but with no less ambition. The \"Europe 2020\" strategy requires a budget that maintains Europe's investment in a common future and makes the common agricultural policy more efficient. Europe needs smarter energy policies that reconcile production, supply and distribution with environmental concerns.The wider context is dramatic. As we haggle over our internal problems, hundreds of millions of people look to the EU for help and hope. Countries in the Balkans and in eastern Europe are banging on Europe's door. Democratic movements for change have emerged across the world. These changes are not easy. The human cost can be high. Warsaw is the seat of the EU's borders agency, Frontex. We want to empower the agency to help support member states when migration pressures get acute, as in the southern Mediterranean today.In short, Europe will make a strategic mistake if it retreats into unhappy introspection. Poland takes very seriously the recent stark warnings from Washington about Europe's unsatisfactory contribution to shared defence burdens.Part of the answer to the security challenges facing Europe lies in maintaining steadfast openness to new members, and to the core principle that integration is the best security. Our presidency should see Croatia's accession negotiations completed, and new progress made with Turkey and Iceland.Poland naturally wants to see progress on Europe's own unfinished business. We will work to set up a new framework for co-operation between the EU and Russia, its largest neighbour. We also want to see the EU-Ukraine association agreement signed, paving the way for a free trade area. We will push to advance Association Agreement talks with Moldova. And we'll do what we can to help Belarus, now slumping into severe difficulties after years of oppressive mismanagement.Poland made strong steady strides towards its current success thanks to outside engagement. We in turn want to develop and contribute to the new structures and policies Europe needs in these turbulent times, not least the emerging External Action Service led by Catherine Ashton. In January this year Poland launched the idea of a new European Endowment for Democracy. This would focus European efforts to help our neighbours in eastern Europe and north Africa, reaching out to civil society and reforming governments alike with practical and efficient support.These presidency policy initiatives all show that Poland is keeping optimistic faith with the European ideal.Thirty years ago the Gdansk ship-workers led the way and changed the world, as millions of Poles joined the Solidarity movement to insist on their basic democratic rights and freedoms. The Polish presidency wants to help the EU draw strength from the ambition and patient wisdom of that movement. Poland itself is an EU success story.By investing in solidarity a growing, open and secure Europe delivers spectacular results, and sets an example to other countries and regions now starting their own transitions.As prime minister Donald Tusk said last year on receiving the Charlemagne prize: \"We Poles really believe in Europe.\" We will invigorate Europe with our faith.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "European Union", "UK news"], "title": "For Poland, European integration is not a crisis.

Crucially, my European colleagues need to accept the remorseless logic of monetary union that leads from a single currency to greater fiscal integration.\"He said excessive debt across the world was the \"root cause\" of worsening economic situations, adding: \"What started as a debt crisis in the banking sector in 2008 has now turned into a wider crisis of sovereign, banking and private sector debt. And Britain cannot blame the rest of the world for these debts, for we were one of the biggest contributors to them.\"He said his \"decisive action\" to introduce an emergency budget last summer \"on our own terms\" had put the UK \"ahead of the curve\" in the challenging economic times.Osborne also used his speech to court business leaders to help the government face down \"the forces of stagnation\" resisting reforms he said were necessary to allow businesses to generate growth.Telling the audience they were the \"real engine of growth\", he said the government was working \"flat out to help your businesses not only survive but thrive\".But he claimed that while the government was doing all it could to help the sector succeed, including reducing business taxes and \"burdensome red tape\", special interest groups were trying to prevent ministers from pushing through changes designed to aid recovery.Citing the controversy over proposals to shake up planning legislation, Osborne said the presumption in favour of \"sustainable development\", which could help businesses and create jobs, had \"even been opposed by the Telegraph\".He said he wanted the business community to give \"loud and clear support\" for proposals to reduce more than 1,000 pages of planning regulations to 50 to make it easier for them to develop their businesses.On the growing lobby opposing some of the planning reforms, which includes some of his Conservative colleagues, he said: \"Don't underestimate our determination to win this argument.\"", "tags": ["George Osborne", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Eurozone crisis", "European banks", "Economics", "Business", "Euro", "European Union", "World news", "UK news"], "title": "Eurozone crisis: time to find a solution is short, says Osborne"},{"date": "2011-09-14T21:38:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Europe's struggle to come good on pledges to rescue Greece from bankruptcy and save its single currency has descended into confusion amid political feuding and parliamentary setbacks across the eurozone.Angela Merkel's coalition in Germany faced rows about whether Greece should be allowed to fail; a parliamentary committee in Austria delayed a vote to ratify plans for a stronger bailout fund; and Slovakia's Eurosceptic parliamentary speaker demanded that Greece be allowed to go bust, making clear that he would seek to undermine the plan hatched at a eurozone summit in July in Brussels.Amid the cacophony, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, head of the European commission, voiced exasperation at the failure of EU national leaders to keep their promises and talked up the benefits of eurobonds, a pooling of eurozone government debt.The Polish finance minister said the survival of the EU was at stake. \"Europe is in danger,\" Jacek Rostowski told the European parliament in Strasbourg. \"If the euro area breaks up, the European Union will not be able to survive.\"Poland currently holds the EU presidency and Rostowski faces a tough challenge on Friday when he chairs a meeting of EU finance ministers in Wroclaw which will now be consumed by the crisis.International pressure on Merkel and other European leaders surged, with the US, China, Russia and others demanding they get a grip. In a display of Washington's alarm, the US Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, is to take part in the Wroclaw meetings .The American fear is that a Greek collapse would trigger a renewed European banking crisis which would spill over into the US, a reverse of what happened in 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers was exported across the Atlantic. A fresh crisis could plunge America back into recession and damage Barack Obama's re-election hopes.The US markets reacted to the news from Europe with another jittery day., but the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up more than 140 points having fallen more than a 100 earlier in the day.Damon Vickers, a Seattle-based hedge fund manager, said the jitters were likely to continue. \"This is anxiousness, fear, it's 2008 all over again. That crisis was about banks and the consumer, this is about countries,\" he said. \"The sooner we get this over with the better, then we can move on,\" he said.John Canally, economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial, said investors were torn between the \"fear that we are going to see a collapse in the euro and a country is going to fail and the belief that everything is going to be OK.\" He said all eyes were now on the meeting of European finance ministers this Friday and the US Federal Reserve next week. \"The markets want to see a bold policy move in Europe,\" he said. \"If they don't see that, this will continue.\"Similar fears are gripping the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. A Greek collapse would impact severely on French banks eight months before Nicolas Sarkozy faces a second-term presidential election.Another leader under pressure, Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, has won a vote of confidence, paving the way for his austerity package to be voted through. The governing coalition has been fighting over the details of the fiscal consolidation plan for weeks but Berlusconi mustered enough of a majority to win the vote.At a teleconference Greek prime minister George Papandreou told Merkel and Sarkozy his country was determined to meet all obligations agreed with international lenders in exchange for an EU/IMF bailout. All three leaders have a vested interest in playing for time over Greece despite the sense that it is running out.\"The president and the prime minister have repeated in unison France's determination to do whatever it takes to rescue Greece,\" said the French government spokeswoman, Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse.Officials from the European commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund returned to Athens to try to get the Greek rescue package back on track.According to senior EU diplomats, this month the three officials departed from Athens \"in despair\" at the Greek government's failure to honour the stiff terms of the bailout deal.In July, eurozone leaders pledged a second \u20ac109bn bailout for Greece, to increase the bailout pot, the European Financial Stability Facility, and to empower it to replace the European Central Bank (ECB) in buying up stricken government bonds.But the plans have run into problems. The level of involvement by Greece's private creditors in rolling over debt remains lower than foreseen. The 17 countries of the eurozone have to ratify the new scheme promptly, but ratification has been delayed in Austria, Slovakia, Finland and possibly Slovenia, and run into rebellion among Merkel's coalition partners.While Barroso talked up the prospect of eurobonds on Wednesday, Germany's economics minister and liberals' leader, Philipp R\u00f6sler, ruled them out. P\u00e9cresse in Paris said there would not be a quick fix. \"Eurobonds are for us the end of a process of consolidation in the eurozone because sharing debt also requires the convergence of our budget policies.\"In Bratislava, Richard Sul\u00edk, the Eurosceptic speaker of parliament and leader of one of four parties in the ruling coalition, said the bailout fund was a bigger threat to the euro than Greece.\"It has often happened that a city within a country goes bankrupt, and that does not have consequences for the currency. We must let Greece go into bankruptcy,\" he told Austrian radio. \"The rescue plan tries to overcome the debt crisis with new debt. We are saying that this is equally a threat to the euro.\"That echoed growing calls among political leaders across eurozone creditor countries. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was the first eurozone head of government formally to propose recently new arrangements enabling fiscal recalcitrants to be expelled from the single currency.Barroso said: \"Solid, feasible and concrete proposals have been made and agreed upon.

In his role as Poland's chief negotiator, he managed to close 17 out of 30 negotiation chapters, including those concerning social affairs and employment, energy, the EU's external relations and economic and monetary union. A reputable negotiator, he surrounded himself in office with a\u00a0team of young people, for whom he was a mentor and a guide through EU politics. Later, many of them were to become Poland's first generation of\u00a0eurocrats in Brussels.His involvement in Poland's integration with the EU dated back to 1989, when he became the country's ambassador to the European Communities. During his term, Poland signed an association agreement with the EC, in 1991, and applied for membership of the EU three years later.In the summer of 2004, when Poland and the other nine new member states participated in the European elections for the first time, Ku\u0142akowski secured a seat in the European parliament. He and three other Polish MEPs were elected on the ticket of the centre-right Unia Wolnosci (Union of Liberty) party and joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group.Ku\u0142akowski was one of the most active MEPs from Poland, serving as vice-chair of the delegation to the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly in 2007-08. He was active on employment and social affairs, and promoted the opening of western labour markets to new member states.He was born in Myszk\u00f3w, southern Poland, to a Polish father and a Belgian mother. The family later settled in Warsaw. In 1944 he participated in the Warsaw uprising, against German occupation, serving as a courier for the resistance. His father and sister were killed during the war, and in 1946 he and his mother emigrated to Belgium.Ku\u0142akowski graduated from the Catholic University of Leuven with a degree in law in 1953. He became involved with the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (IFCTU) and was appointed a member of\u00a0its general secretariat in 1954. He later became secretary, and then secretary general, of the European organisation of\u00a0the IFCTU. He served as\u00a0secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation in the mid-1970s. From 1976 to 1989, he was secretary general of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), as the IFCTU was renamed in 1968.During his term at the helm of\u00a0the WCL, Ku\u0142akowski approached the leaders of communist Poland's independent trade union Solidarity, who welcomed him as a spokesman for their cause. He negotiated with Latin American and African dictatorships to advocate Solidarity in the west. His flat in Brussels was dubbed the \"little embassy\" by Polish opposition members, as Ku\u0142akowski was effective in lobbying in favour of those seeking to make their voice heard in the west. One of these activists, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, became Poland's first democratic prime minister in 1989, after the Communist party and Solidarity launched talks.When Mazowiecki asked him to become Poland's ambassador to the EC, Ku\u0142akowski agreed and renounced his Belgian citizenship. He headed the Polish representation in Brussels from 1990 to 1996. His profound knowledge of the EU was useful in 1998, when he was appointed secretary of state and chief negotiator with the EU by the prime minister, Jerzy Buzek. He served at this post until 2001, when the government lost the elections. The negotiations between Poland and the EU were concluded by the succeeding government, which built on\u00a0Ku\u0142akowski's work.Ku\u0142akowski did not seek re-election as an MEP in 2009, as his health was deteriorating rapidly. He is survived by his wife, Zofia, and his daughters, Elzbieta, Krystyna and Barbara.\u2022 Jan Jerzy Ku\u0142akowski, politician and diplomat, born 25 August 1930; died 25 June 2011", "tags": ["Poland", "European Union"], "title": "Jan Ku\u0142akowski obituary"},{"date": "2011-09-24T13:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A TV talent show has became the focus of a national row in Poland, with the parliamentary commission for culture and the media dramatically condemning one of the show's judges as a \"satanist who publicly offends Christian values\".Adam \"Nergal\" Darski, singer and guitarist in blackened death metal band Behemoth, became a hate figure when he was charged with blasphemy offences for ripping up a Bible on stage at a concert in his hometown of Gdynia, northern Poland, in 2007. Now a judge on The Voice of Poland, the controversy surrounding Darski has highlighted shifting values in Polish society.Despite being found not guilty last month, the judge ruling that the Bible-ripping act was legitimate artistic expression, Darski has seen a campaign launched against him by a group of conservative Catholics. Indeed, while Polish law remains hardline on blasphemy , with article 196 of the penal code making \"offending religious feelings\" a crime carrying a maximum two-year prison sentence, it has only tended to be applied at the intervention of rightwing politicians. Ryszard Nowak \u2013 a former Law and Justice party MP, and chairman of the committee for the defence against sects \u2013 spearheaded the original case against Darski, as well as naming Behemoth in a blacklist of \"dangerous\" bands distributed to Polish government departments back in 2007.But the fact that The Voice of Poland is aired by the public television network TVP has brought out new critics. Bishop Wies\u0142aw Mering of the northern Polish diocese of W\u0142oc\u0142awek issued a pastoral letter at the beginning of this month condemning Darski as \"a blasphemer, satanist and lover of evil incarnate [who] will have free use of the public television screen to spread his poisonous teachings\", and threatening a licence-fee boycott.Meanwhile, the Association of Catholic Journalists has launched a petition to get Darski removed from the show, and Bishop Grzegorz Kaszak of Sosnowiec has called for active opposition to the singer .TVP, and Darski himself, must be thrilled with all the publicity. But Bishop Mering and others take Darski too seriously in depicting him as a proselytising devil-worshipper. Behemoth owe much of their aesthetic to the black metal scene that emerged in Norway in the late 80s, at the heart of which, says sociologist and metal culture specialist Keith Kahn-Harris, \"lies virulent opposition to religion, particularly Christianity\".This scene has been associated with satanism, fascist ideology, church burnings and a string of violent crimes, but Behemoth's views are somewhat less virulent. Their statement that their 2007 album, The Apostasy, was so named as the word's \"basic meaning is 'to go against religion', and with Poland being one of the top religious countries in the world, Behemoth strives to convey that being religious is not the key to happiness\" was rather mild. And Darski has made frequent suggestions that his \"satanism\" is more about a general anti-establishment individualism than any theistic idea. Indeed, some opponents have dubbed the likes of Darski \"Sunday satanists\".Yet whatever the confusion over what metal culture really represents, it is clear that this row is about more than just religious offence.Last week Darski appeared on the cover of Polish Newsweek swathed in the Polish flag, with the headline: God, Horror, Fatherland. Here was an interrogation of what Polishness might mean, and while Darski's religious disrespect is condemned by people on both sides of the political divide, as an articulate, prosperous, educated young person, he symbolises something of the new Poland. Meanwhile, the church whose fortunes have been so intertwined with that of the nation it serves has lost much of its traditional role as consoler and, often, guardian of liberty in the face of oppression.With Poland only just entering its third decade as a free nation after the communist era, and among the newest members of the EU, a renegotiation of what it means to be Polish, and the place of religion in that national identity, seems to be an ongoing process.With a blasphemy case against Darski's former fianc\u00e9e, the pop star Dorota Rabczewska, still ongoing, and Mering confirming on his website on Thursday that a licence-fee boycott will be going ahead, this row, and all that it might mean for Poland, shows no sign of being resolved.", "tags": ["Poland", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Metal", "Christianity", "Music", "Europe", "Culture", "World news"], "title": "A Sunday satanist or the voice of new Poland? | Sophia Deboick"},{"date": "2011-09-12T15:03:36Z", "country": "poland", "content": "With the next major round of global warming talks now less than 10 weeks away, the European Union's preparations are being led by Poland, a nation which is dependent for 95% of its electricity on dirty coal and, I was told today, has 90 shale gas applications under consideration.So can Poland, current holders of the rotating EU presidency, truly represent the EU's ambition to tackle climate change, when it has been the principle obstacle to greater ambition within the bloc?Who better to answer this that the Polish minister for climate change, Joanna Mackowiak Pandera, and her senior advisor, Tomasz Chruszczow, whom I met today in London.\"Durban is the last call to maintain the global instrument on climate policy,\" Mackowiak Pandera began, before going on to show that at the very least she is across her brief, discussing details of the Kyoto protocol, the Green Fund, technology transfer, monitoring, recording and verification (MRV).But how can Poland be a serious negotiator for the EU with China, India, the US and others, when it has blocked higher carbon cuts in Brussels, I asked? Here, Chruszczow stepped in: \"You must not make the mistake of confusing the aims of the EU [under our presidency] and our domestic arrangements on how to meet our targets.\"That would indeed be a scary mistake, given Mackowiak Pandera;'s assessment of the role of coal and gas in Polish energy policy. \"For sure coal is harmful but we see it as a strategic source of energy. We have a source of coal for 300 years,\" she said. \"Poland is 95% dependent on coal. We have to search for new technologies, clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage.\"If there seems any chance that Poland is going to ease up on its coal burning, it looks like shale gas would take its place. \"There is a great expectation that shale gas will help us reach our climate goals,\" Mackowiak Pandera said, notwithstanding the debate on whether shale really is a much lower carbon fuel than coal. She then told me something I had not heard before: \"There are 90 permit requests for shale gas in Poland. The initial research is very promising for us.\"To put that in context, the UK has one shale gas site being explored, which so far has produce nothing bar perhaps a small earthquake. France has banned shale gas exploration.Regarding the impact of shale gas drilling, she said, Poland had very strict environmental impact assessment requirements, before adding that \"every energy extraction method is damaging\", such as \"where to site wind farms, for example, without damaging fauna\". That's a very odd comparison, in my view.Nonetheless, Mackowiak Pandera and Chruszczow were very clear-eyed on what is required in Durban to prevent the UN negotiations drifting into meaninglessness: avoiding the death of the only existing legal agreement, the Kyoto protocol, making real the promises of the last summit in Cancun and making new progress in delivering climate cash to poorer nations and on the role of private investment. But can coal-dependent Poland be a convincing negotiator for the EU, the political bloc which has led the world in its action on cutting greenhouse gas emissions? Mackowiak Pandera insists Poland is \"credible\" in this regard.Perhaps a more fundamental question is does it matter who holds the EU presidency? At the Copenhagen summit, amid 120 world leaders, it was Merkel, Sarkozy and Brown who sat by Obama and tried to wrangle a deal, not the then-EU presidents Sweden. And can you remember who led the EU in Cancun in 2010 (clue: Tintin.) We will be in a better position to answer these questions after 10 October, when the EU's environment ministers meet to agree their negotiating position for Durban. A strong, ambitious platform would show the EU, responsible for just 13% of global emissions, can in fact leverage its leadership to move the US and China. That pair of carbon colossuses are, says Chruszczow, \"hiding behind each others' backs and saying 'no, you have to go first'.\"A weak platform would not only signal gloom for the EU's ability to function, but also for the entire climate change negotiations.", "tags": ["Global climate talks", "Poland", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Fracking", "Gas", "Climate change", "European Union", "Green politics"], "title": "Can Poland lead on coal, shale gas and Europe's climate negotiations? | Damian Carrington"},{"date": "2011-08-02T10:00:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Last week, the Polish government finally released a report into the 2010 plane catastrophe, which killed President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski and 95 others. It blames the accident mainly on the poor training of the pilots, and has since triggered the resignation of the Polish defence minister. Is that the end of the issue? Not a chance.The debate regarding the Smolensk catastrophe long ago stopped revolving around the 96 people who lost their lives that day and the circumstances in which it occurred. Rather, the tragic event sparked off sociopolitical reactions, which have exposed and enhanced the deep cultural divisions existing within Polish society.When Poles heard that a plane carrying the first couple, the country's top military commanders and leading politicians had crashed fatally in Russia while heading to the 70th anniversary ceremony of the Katyn massacre, their instinctive reaction was to rally around each other in a memorable demonstration of national unity.Supporters and critics of Lech Kaczy\u0144ski headed towards the presidential palace in Warsaw, singing songs, holding hands and lighting candles. For a few days, Poland was united. Three days, to be precise. Once they had passed, it was announced the Kaczy\u0144skis would be entombed in Krakow's Wawel Cathedral, the resting place of Polish historical leaders. Many Poles were furious, insisting Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's achievements didn't warrant a burial alongside Poland's greatest.They rejected as \"nonsense\" the arguments of the archbishop of Krakow, Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, who said the late president had \"died a heroic death because he was flying to Katyn to honour Polish martyrs in the name of the whole nation\".Some, including the solidarity legend Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, even went as far as saying that the plane crash was Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's own fault, as he had no doubt put pressure on the pilots to land in spite of adverse weather conditions, in order to get his photo opportunity at the Katyn ceremony. This in turn enraged supporters of the late president.While the immediate reaction to the catastrophe showed that national identity and symbols are important to Poles, the ensuing events also revealed how strongly they differ when it comes to the values around which this identity should be built.Supporters of the late president and the party he co-founded, Law and Justice (PiS), have a very clear vision on the issue. It is a vision shaped by values that can be described as nationalistic, messianistic and Catholic-centered.For them, the Smolensk catastrophe was no coincidence, but another historical sacrifice for the nation, similar to the failed 1944 Warsaw uprising or the 1940 Katyn massacre. They consider these experiences unique to Poland and all historically linked recognition of which is the litmus test for Polish patriotism. This group makes up at least a third of the Polish population.A second group \u2013 the majority \u2013 disagrees with this definition of patriotism but is not as cohesive in its views and doesn't have its own uniform opinion on what modern-day Polish patriotism should resemble. Many of them reject the celebration of events such as the 1944 Warsaw uprising, deeming it unpragmatic. \"A senseless loss of lives, after all it was doomed to fail due to overwhelming German firepower,\" they argue. These Poles see what is labelled \"the Polish martyrdom mentality\" as an obstacle to Poland being able to flow in the political and intellectual mainstream of Europe and they are ashamed that such an image of the country has been created abroad.What really binds them together is the fear of the \"martyr group\", currently led by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of PiS and twin brother of the late president, running Poland. That's the main reason they support the prime minister, Donald Tusk, and his Civic Platform (PO) party, considering them the only force strong enough to keep the \"fanatics\" at bay.Poland is not alone in having strong cultural divisions within its society, the existence of which is not a danger in of itself. What is worrying is the lack of tolerance these groups exhibit for each other. Both have their own political and literary elites who find it hard to conceal their contempt for the other side.Jaros\u0142aw Rymkiewicz, a famous poet and intellectual guru of the Kaczy\u0144ski camp, said recently that the Polish nation has always been made up of two groups: patriots and collaborators. Then there is Stefan Niesio\u0142owski, deputy speaker of parliament from PO, who once said \"the Kaczy\u0144skis are the source of all evil, especially Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\". Such rhetoric doesn't give one much hope for dialogue.George W Bush once famously said \"you are either with us or against us\". The emotions triggered by the Smolensk catastrophe have led most Poles to openly declare which side they are on, thus voluntarily putting themselves in a box.Politicians are quite happy to have people thinking in a box as they are then much more predictable and easier to manipulate. The truth is that the Smolensk catastrophe has benefitted the two major parties in Poland and they will continue exploiting the divisions it exposed and deepened for as long as Poles allow them to.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "Poland is still coming to terms with the Smolensk air disaster | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2011-07-02T11:00:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "On 1 July Poland takes over the presidency of the European Union for the first time.Inheriting the presidency in mid-2011 looks like a mixed blessing.What has gone wrong?

We also must be realistic. The EU does face painful decisions in the months and years to come. Poland will not accept that the answer lies in less solidarity, or \"less integration\". That is the sure path to disintegration, leaving us all worse off \u2013 and with new divisions.Poland is not yet a member of the eurozone, but it is our strategic commitment to join when the conditions are right. We see the euro as a vital national interest, and will play our part, as president, in getting the right decisions taken.Too many of Europe's rules and regulations were designed for very different times. We'll be pressing the case for smarter integration, to release the full potential of the single market and make Europe competitive. An EU-wide common sales contract, cheaper roaming services and a better EU patent regime would transform the way we all do business across Europe.National governments are facing hard financial constraints, so Europe must use its resources more wisely, but with no less ambition. The \"Europe 2020\" strategy requires a budget that maintains Europe's investment in a common future and makes the common agricultural policy more efficient. Europe needs smarter energy policies that reconcile production, supply and distribution with environmental concerns.The wider context is dramatic. As we haggle over our internal problems, hundreds of millions of people look to the EU for help and hope. Countries in the Balkans and in eastern Europe are banging on Europe's door. Democratic movements for change have emerged across the world. These changes are not easy. The human cost can be high. Warsaw is the seat of the EU's borders agency, Frontex. We want to empower the agency to help support member states when migration pressures get acute, as in the southern Mediterranean today.In short, Europe will make a strategic mistake if it retreats into unhappy introspection. Poland takes very seriously the recent stark warnings from Washington about Europe's unsatisfactory contribution to shared defence burdens.Part of the answer to the security challenges facing Europe lies in maintaining steadfast openness to new members, and to the core principle that integration is the best security. Our presidency should see Croatia's accession negotiations completed, and new progress made with Turkey and Iceland.Poland naturally wants to see progress on Europe's own unfinished business. We will work to set up a new framework for co-operation between the EU and Russia, its largest neighbour. We also want to see the EU-Ukraine association agreement signed, paving the way for a free trade area. We will push to advance Association Agreement talks with Moldova. And we'll do what we can to help Belarus, now slumping into severe difficulties after years of oppressive mismanagement.Poland made strong steady strides towards its current success thanks to outside engagement. We in turn want to develop and contribute to the new structures and policies Europe needs in these turbulent times, not least the emerging External Action Service led by Catherine Ashton. In January this year Poland launched the idea of a new European Endowment for Democracy. This would focus European efforts to help our neighbours in eastern Europe and north Africa, reaching out to civil society and reforming governments alike with practical and efficient support.These presidency policy initiatives all show that Poland is keeping optimistic faith with the European ideal.Thirty years ago the Gdansk ship-workers led the way and changed the world, as millions of Poles joined the Solidarity movement to insist on their basic democratic rights and freedoms. The Polish presidency wants to help the EU draw strength from the ambition and patient wisdom of that movement. Poland itself is an EU success story.By investing in solidarity a growing, open and secure Europe delivers spectacular results, and sets an example to other countries and regions now starting their own transitions.As prime minister Donald Tusk said last year on receiving the Charlemagne prize: \"We Poles really believe in Europe.\" We will invigorate Europe with our faith.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "European Union", "UK news"], "title": "For Poland, European integration is not a crisis.

Crucially, my European colleagues need to accept the remorseless logic of monetary union that leads from a single currency to greater fiscal integration.\"He said excessive debt across the world was the \"root cause\" of worsening economic situations, adding: \"What started as a debt crisis in the banking sector in 2008 has now turned into a wider crisis of sovereign, banking and private sector debt. And Britain cannot blame the rest of the world for these debts, for we were one of the biggest contributors to them.\"He said his \"decisive action\" to introduce an emergency budget last summer \"on our own terms\" had put the UK \"ahead of the curve\" in the challenging economic times.Osborne also used his speech to court business leaders to help the government face down \"the forces of stagnation\" resisting reforms he said were necessary to allow businesses to generate growth.Telling the audience they were the \"real engine of growth\", he said the government was working \"flat out to help your businesses not only survive but thrive\".But he claimed that while the government was doing all it could to help the sector succeed, including reducing business taxes and \"burdensome red tape\", special interest groups were trying to prevent ministers from pushing through changes designed to aid recovery.Citing the controversy over proposals to shake up planning legislation, Osborne said the presumption in favour of \"sustainable development\", which could help businesses and create jobs, had \"even been opposed by the Telegraph\".He said he wanted the business community to give \"loud and clear support\" for proposals to reduce more than 1,000 pages of planning regulations to 50 to make it easier for them to develop their businesses.On the growing lobby opposing some of the planning reforms, which includes some of his Conservative colleagues, he said: \"Don't underestimate our determination to win this argument.\"", "tags": ["George Osborne", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Eurozone crisis", "European banks", "Economics", "Business", "Euro", "European Union", "World news", "UK news"], "title": "Eurozone crisis: time to find a solution is short, says Osborne"},{"date": "2011-09-14T21:38:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Europe's struggle to come good on pledges to rescue Greece from bankruptcy and save its single currency has descended into confusion amid political feuding and parliamentary setbacks across the eurozone.Angela Merkel's coalition in Germany faced rows about whether Greece should be allowed to fail; a parliamentary committee in Austria delayed a vote to ratify plans for a stronger bailout fund; and Slovakia's Eurosceptic parliamentary speaker demanded that Greece be allowed to go bust, making clear that he would seek to undermine the plan hatched at a eurozone summit in July in Brussels.Amid the cacophony, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, head of the European commission, voiced exasperation at the failure of EU national leaders to keep their promises and talked up the benefits of eurobonds, a pooling of eurozone government debt.The Polish finance minister said the survival of the EU was at stake. \"Europe is in danger,\" Jacek Rostowski told the European parliament in Strasbourg. \"If the euro area breaks up, the European Union will not be able to survive.\"Poland currently holds the EU presidency and Rostowski faces a tough challenge on Friday when he chairs a meeting of EU finance ministers in Wroclaw which will now be consumed by the crisis.International pressure on Merkel and other European leaders surged, with the US, China, Russia and others demanding they get a grip. In a display of Washington's alarm, the US Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, is to take part in the Wroclaw meetings .The American fear is that a Greek collapse would trigger a renewed European banking crisis which would spill over into the US, a reverse of what happened in 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers was exported across the Atlantic. A fresh crisis could plunge America back into recession and damage Barack Obama's re-election hopes.The US markets reacted to the news from Europe with another jittery day., but the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up more than 140 points having fallen more than a 100 earlier in the day.Damon Vickers, a Seattle-based hedge fund manager, said the jitters were likely to continue. \"This is anxiousness, fear, it's 2008 all over again. That crisis was about banks and the consumer, this is about countries,\" he said. \"The sooner we get this over with the better, then we can move on,\" he said.John Canally, economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial, said investors were torn between the \"fear that we are going to see a collapse in the euro and a country is going to fail and the belief that everything is going to be OK.\" He said all eyes were now on the meeting of European finance ministers this Friday and the US Federal Reserve next week. \"The markets want to see a bold policy move in Europe,\" he said. \"If they don't see that, this will continue.\"Similar fears are gripping the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. A Greek collapse would impact severely on French banks eight months before Nicolas Sarkozy faces a second-term presidential election.Another leader under pressure, Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, has won a vote of confidence, paving the way for his austerity package to be voted through. The governing coalition has been fighting over the details of the fiscal consolidation plan for weeks but Berlusconi mustered enough of a majority to win the vote.At a teleconference Greek prime minister George Papandreou told Merkel and Sarkozy his country was determined to meet all obligations agreed with international lenders in exchange for an EU/IMF bailout. All three leaders have a vested interest in playing for time over Greece despite the sense that it is running out.\"The president and the prime minister have repeated in unison France's determination to do whatever it takes to rescue Greece,\" said the French government spokeswoman, Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse.Officials from the European commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund returned to Athens to try to get the Greek rescue package back on track.According to senior EU diplomats, this month the three officials departed from Athens \"in despair\" at the Greek government's failure to honour the stiff terms of the bailout deal.In July, eurozone leaders pledged a second \u20ac109bn bailout for Greece, to increase the bailout pot, the European Financial Stability Facility, and to empower it to replace the European Central Bank (ECB) in buying up stricken government bonds.But the plans have run into problems. The level of involvement by Greece's private creditors in rolling over debt remains lower than foreseen. The 17 countries of the eurozone have to ratify the new scheme promptly, but ratification has been delayed in Austria, Slovakia, Finland and possibly Slovenia, and run into rebellion among Merkel's coalition partners.While Barroso talked up the prospect of eurobonds on Wednesday, Germany's economics minister and liberals' leader, Philipp R\u00f6sler, ruled them out. P\u00e9cresse in Paris said there would not be a quick fix. \"Eurobonds are for us the end of a process of consolidation in the eurozone because sharing debt also requires the convergence of our budget policies.\"In Bratislava, Richard Sul\u00edk, the Eurosceptic speaker of parliament and leader of one of four parties in the ruling coalition, said the bailout fund was a bigger threat to the euro than Greece.\"It has often happened that a city within a country goes bankrupt, and that does not have consequences for the currency. We must let Greece go into bankruptcy,\" he told Austrian radio. \"The rescue plan tries to overcome the debt crisis with new debt. We are saying that this is equally a threat to the euro.\"That echoed growing calls among political leaders across eurozone creditor countries. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was the first eurozone head of government formally to propose recently new arrangements enabling fiscal recalcitrants to be expelled from the single currency.Barroso said: \"Solid, feasible and concrete proposals have been made and agreed upon.

In his role as Poland's chief negotiator, he managed to close 17 out of 30 negotiation chapters, including those concerning social affairs and employment, energy, the EU's external relations and economic and monetary union. A reputable negotiator, he surrounded himself in office with a\u00a0team of young people, for whom he was a mentor and a guide through EU politics. Later, many of them were to become Poland's first generation of\u00a0eurocrats in Brussels.His involvement in Poland's integration with the EU dated back to 1989, when he became the country's ambassador to the European Communities. During his term, Poland signed an association agreement with the EC, in 1991, and applied for membership of the EU three years later.In the summer of 2004, when Poland and the other nine new member states participated in the European elections for the first time, Ku\u0142akowski secured a seat in the European parliament. He and three other Polish MEPs were elected on the ticket of the centre-right Unia Wolnosci (Union of Liberty) party and joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group.Ku\u0142akowski was one of the most active MEPs from Poland, serving as vice-chair of the delegation to the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly in 2007-08. He was active on employment and social affairs, and promoted the opening of western labour markets to new member states.He was born in Myszk\u00f3w, southern Poland, to a Polish father and a Belgian mother. The family later settled in Warsaw. In 1944 he participated in the Warsaw uprising, against German occupation, serving as a courier for the resistance. His father and sister were killed during the war, and in 1946 he and his mother emigrated to Belgium.Ku\u0142akowski graduated from the Catholic University of Leuven with a degree in law in 1953. He became involved with the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (IFCTU) and was appointed a member of\u00a0its general secretariat in 1954. He later became secretary, and then secretary general, of the European organisation of\u00a0the IFCTU. He served as\u00a0secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation in the mid-1970s. From 1976 to 1989, he was secretary general of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), as the IFCTU was renamed in 1968.During his term at the helm of\u00a0the WCL, Ku\u0142akowski approached the leaders of communist Poland's independent trade union Solidarity, who welcomed him as a spokesman for their cause. He negotiated with Latin American and African dictatorships to advocate Solidarity in the west. His flat in Brussels was dubbed the \"little embassy\" by Polish opposition members, as Ku\u0142akowski was effective in lobbying in favour of those seeking to make their voice heard in the west. One of these activists, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, became Poland's first democratic prime minister in 1989, after the Communist party and Solidarity launched talks.When Mazowiecki asked him to become Poland's ambassador to the EC, Ku\u0142akowski agreed and renounced his Belgian citizenship. He headed the Polish representation in Brussels from 1990 to 1996. His profound knowledge of the EU was useful in 1998, when he was appointed secretary of state and chief negotiator with the EU by the prime minister, Jerzy Buzek. He served at this post until 2001, when the government lost the elections. The negotiations between Poland and the EU were concluded by the succeeding government, which built on\u00a0Ku\u0142akowski's work.Ku\u0142akowski did not seek re-election as an MEP in 2009, as his health was deteriorating rapidly.

Now a judge on The Voice of Poland, the controversy surrounding Darski has highlighted shifting values in Polish society.Despite being found not guilty last month, the judge ruling that the Bible-ripping act was legitimate artistic expression, Darski has seen a campaign launched against him by a group of conservative Catholics. Indeed, while Polish law remains hardline on blasphemy , with article 196 of the penal code making \"offending religious feelings\" a crime carrying a maximum two-year prison sentence, it has only tended to be applied at the intervention of rightwing politicians. Ryszard Nowak \u2013 a former Law and Justice party MP, and chairman of the committee for the defence against sects \u2013 spearheaded the original case against Darski, as well as naming Behemoth in a blacklist of \"dangerous\" bands distributed to Polish government departments back in 2007.But the fact that The Voice of Poland is aired by the public television network TVP has brought out new critics. Bishop Wies\u0142aw Mering of the northern Polish diocese of W\u0142oc\u0142awek issued a pastoral letter at the beginning of this month condemning Darski as \"a blasphemer, satanist and lover of evil incarnate [who] will have free use of the public television screen to spread his poisonous teachings\", and threatening a licence-fee boycott.Meanwhile, the Association of Catholic Journalists has launched a petition to get Darski removed from the show, and Bishop Grzegorz Kaszak of Sosnowiec has called for active opposition to the singer .TVP, and Darski himself, must be thrilled with all the publicity. But Bishop Mering and others take Darski too seriously in depicting him as a proselytising devil-worshipper. Behemoth owe much of their aesthetic to the black metal scene that emerged in Norway in the late 80s, at the heart of which, says sociologist and metal culture specialist Keith Kahn-Harris, \"lies virulent opposition to religion, particularly Christianity\".This scene has been associated with satanism, fascist ideology, church burnings and a string of violent crimes, but Behemoth's views are somewhat less virulent. Their statement that their 2007 album, The Apostasy, was so named as the word's \"basic meaning is 'to go against religion', and with Poland being one of the top religious countries in the world, Behemoth strives to convey that being religious is not the key to happiness\" was rather mild. And Darski has made frequent suggestions that his \"satanism\" is more about a general anti-establishment individualism than any theistic idea. Indeed, some opponents have dubbed the likes of Darski \"Sunday satanists\".Yet whatever the confusion over what metal culture really represents, it is clear that this row is about more than just religious offence.Last week Darski appeared on the cover of Polish Newsweek swathed in the Polish flag, with the headline: God, Horror, Fatherland. Here was an interrogation of what Polishness might mean, and while Darski's religious disrespect is condemned by people on both sides of the political divide, as an articulate, prosperous, educated young person, he symbolises something of the new Poland. Meanwhile, the church whose fortunes have been so intertwined with that of the nation it serves has lost much of its traditional role as consoler and, often, guardian of liberty in the face of oppression.With Poland only just entering its third decade as a free nation after the communist era, and among the newest members of the EU, a renegotiation of what it means to be Polish, and the place of religion in that national identity, seems to be an ongoing process.With a blasphemy case against Darski's former fianc\u00e9e, the pop star Dorota Rabczewska, still ongoing, and Mering confirming on his website on Thursday that a licence-fee boycott will be going ahead, this row, and all that it might mean for Poland, shows no sign of being resolved.", "tags": ["Poland", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Metal", "Christianity", "Music", "Europe", "Culture", "World news"], "title": "A Sunday satanist or the voice of new Poland? | Sophia Deboick"},{"date": "2011-09-12T15:03:36Z", "country": "poland", "content": "With the next major round of global warming talks now less than 10 weeks away, the European Union's preparations are being led by Poland, a nation which is dependent for 95% of its electricity on dirty coal and, I was told today, has 90 shale gas applications under consideration.So can Poland, current holders of the rotating EU presidency, truly represent the EU's ambition to tackle climate change, when it has been the principle obstacle to greater ambition within the bloc?Who better to answer this that the Polish minister for climate change, Joanna Mackowiak Pandera, and her senior advisor, Tomasz Chruszczow, whom I met today in London.\"Durban is the last call to maintain the global instrument on climate policy,\" Mackowiak Pandera began, before going on to show that at the very least she is across her brief, discussing details of the Kyoto protocol, the Green Fund, technology transfer, monitoring, recording and verification (MRV).But how can Poland be a serious negotiator for the EU with China, India, the US and others, when it has blocked higher carbon cuts in Brussels, I asked? Here, Chruszczow stepped in: \"You must not make the mistake of confusing the aims of the EU [under our presidency] and our domestic arrangements on how to meet our targets.\"That would indeed be a scary mistake, given Mackowiak Pandera;'s assessment of the role of coal and gas in Polish energy policy. \"For sure coal is harmful but we see it as a strategic source of energy. We have a source of coal for 300 years,\" she said. \"Poland is 95% dependent on coal. We have to search for new technologies, clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage.\"If there seems any chance that Poland is going to ease up on its coal burning, it looks like shale gas would take its place. \"There is a great expectation that shale gas will help us reach our climate goals,\" Mackowiak Pandera said, notwithstanding the debate on whether shale really is a much lower carbon fuel than coal. She then told me something I had not heard before: \"There are 90 permit requests for shale gas in Poland. The initial research is very promising for us.\"To put that in context, the UK has one shale gas site being explored, which so far has produce nothing bar perhaps a small earthquake. France has banned shale gas exploration.Regarding the impact of shale gas drilling, she said, Poland had very strict environmental impact assessment requirements, before adding that \"every energy extraction method is damaging\", such as \"where to site wind farms, for example, without damaging fauna\". That's a very odd comparison, in my view.Nonetheless, Mackowiak Pandera and Chruszczow were very clear-eyed on what is required in Durban to prevent the UN negotiations drifting into meaninglessness: avoiding the death of the only existing legal agreement, the Kyoto protocol, making real the promises of the last summit in Cancun and making new progress in delivering climate cash to poorer nations and on the role of private investment. But can coal-dependent Poland be a convincing negotiator for the EU, the political bloc which has led the world in its action on cutting greenhouse gas emissions? Mackowiak Pandera insists Poland is \"credible\" in this regard.Perhaps a more fundamental question is does it matter who holds the EU presidency? At the Copenhagen summit, amid 120 world leaders, it was Merkel, Sarkozy and Brown who sat by Obama and tried to wrangle a deal, not the then-EU presidents Sweden. And can you remember who led the EU in Cancun in 2010 (clue: Tintin.) We will be in a better position to answer these questions after 10 October, when the EU's environment ministers meet to agree their negotiating position for Durban. A strong, ambitious platform would show the EU, responsible for just 13% of global emissions, can in fact leverage its leadership to move the US and China. That pair of carbon colossuses are, says Chruszczow, \"hiding behind each others' backs and saying 'no, you have to go first'.\"A weak platform would not only signal gloom for the EU's ability to function, but also for the entire climate change negotiations.", "tags": ["Global climate talks", "Poland", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Fracking", "Gas", "Climate change", "European Union", "Green politics"], "title": "Can Poland lead on coal, shale gas and Europe's climate negotiations? | Damian Carrington"},{"date": "2011-08-02T10:00:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Last week, the Polish government finally released a report into the 2010 plane catastrophe, which killed President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski and 95 others. It blames the accident mainly on the poor training of the pilots, and has since triggered the resignation of the Polish defence minister. Is that the end of the issue? Not a chance.The debate regarding the Smolensk catastrophe long ago stopped revolving around the 96 people who lost their lives that day and the circumstances in which it occurred. Rather, the tragic event sparked off sociopolitical reactions, which have exposed and enhanced the deep cultural divisions existing within Polish society.When Poles heard that a plane carrying the first couple, the country's top military commanders and leading politicians had crashed fatally in Russia while heading to the 70th anniversary ceremony of the Katyn massacre, their instinctive reaction was to rally around each other in a memorable demonstration of national unity.Supporters and critics of Lech Kaczy\u0144ski headed towards the presidential palace in Warsaw, singing songs, holding hands and lighting candles. For a few days, Poland was united. Three days, to be precise. Once they had passed, it was announced the Kaczy\u0144skis would be entombed in Krakow's Wawel Cathedral, the resting place of Polish historical leaders. Many Poles were furious, insisting Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's achievements didn't warrant a burial alongside Poland's greatest.They rejected as \"nonsense\" the arguments of the archbishop of Krakow, Cardinal Stanis\u0142aw Dziwisz, who said the late president had \"died a heroic death because he was flying to Katyn to honour Polish martyrs in the name of the whole nation\".Some, including the solidarity legend Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, even went as far as saying that the plane crash was Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's own fault, as he had no doubt put pressure on the pilots to land in spite of adverse weather conditions, in order to get his photo opportunity at the Katyn ceremony. This in turn enraged supporters of the late president.While the immediate reaction to the catastrophe showed that national identity and symbols are important to Poles, the ensuing events also revealed how strongly they differ when it comes to the values around which this identity should be built.Supporters of the late president and the party he co-founded, Law and Justice (PiS), have a very clear vision on the issue. It is a vision shaped by values that can be described as nationalistic, messianistic and Catholic-centered.For them, the Smolensk catastrophe was no coincidence, but another historical sacrifice for the nation, similar to the failed 1944 Warsaw uprising or the 1940 Katyn massacre. They consider these experiences unique to Poland and all historically linked recognition of which is the litmus test for Polish patriotism. This group makes up at least a third of the Polish population.A second group \u2013 the majority \u2013 disagrees with this definition of patriotism but is not as cohesive in its views and doesn't have its own uniform opinion on what modern-day Polish patriotism should resemble. Many of them reject the celebration of events such as the 1944 Warsaw uprising, deeming it unpragmatic. \"A senseless loss of lives, after all it was doomed to fail due to overwhelming German firepower,\" they argue. These Poles see what is labelled \"the Polish martyrdom mentality\" as an obstacle to Poland being able to flow in the political and intellectual mainstream of Europe and they are ashamed that such an image of the country has been created abroad.What really binds them together is the fear of the \"martyr group\", currently led by Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, leader of PiS and twin brother of the late president, running Poland. That's the main reason they support the prime minister, Donald Tusk, and his Civic Platform (PO) party, considering them the only force strong enough to keep the \"fanatics\" at bay.Poland is not alone in having strong cultural divisions within its society, the existence of which is not a danger in of itself. What is worrying is the lack of tolerance these groups exhibit for each other. Both have their own political and literary elites who find it hard to conceal their contempt for the other side.Jaros\u0142aw Rymkiewicz, a famous poet and intellectual guru of the Kaczy\u0144ski camp, said recently that the Polish nation has always been made up of two groups: patriots and collaborators. Then there is Stefan Niesio\u0142owski, deputy speaker of parliament from PO, who once said \"the Kaczy\u0144skis are the source of all evil, especially Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\". Such rhetoric doesn't give one much hope for dialogue.George W Bush once famously said \"you are either with us or against us\". The emotions triggered by the Smolensk catastrophe have led most Poles to openly declare which side they are on, thus voluntarily putting themselves in a box.Politicians are quite happy to have people thinking in a box as they are then much more predictable and easier to manipulate. The truth is that the Smolensk catastrophe has benefitted the two major parties in Poland and they will continue exploiting the divisions it exposed and deepened for as long as Poles allow them to.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "Poland is still coming to terms with the Smolensk air disaster | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2011-07-02T11:00:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "On 1 July Poland takes over the presidency of the European Union for the first time.Inheriting the presidency in mid-2011 looks like a mixed blessing.What has gone wrong? Why is there so much talk of an EU crisis? Some people have a blunt, noisy answer: \"Too much Europe!\" EU structures and policies are said to be creating more problems than they are solving: over-complex institutions, over-ambitious integration (the eurozone, above all), over-centralisation of decision-making. We see a quite new and disturbing decline in confidence at the very heart of European solidarity as it has developed since the second world war.We can't choose the problems that life throws at us. We do decide how we face them. And for Poland, European integration is not a crisis. It's an inspiration.Twenty-two years ago, when communism ended, Poland's GDP shrank by 12%. Inflation ran out of control. Key export markets vanished. We had to build a modern democracy and a thriving market economy from scratch, while disentangling ourselves from the Warsaw pact.With huge efforts \u2013 and generous help from our European partners \u2013 we have succeeded. Poland's economy is growing at more than 4% a year. We are now the sixth largest economy in Europe, and one of the top 20 economies in the world. Poland is the only EU member to have maintained positive growth through the recent economic storms.It's no surprise that Eurobarometer finds Poles expressing strong confidence in the EU. All our success would not have been possible without the collective investment in institutional stability and solidarity that the EU has delivered.But it is not enough to be optimistic and positive. We also must be realistic. The EU does face painful decisions in the months and years to come. Poland will not accept that the answer lies in less solidarity, or \"less integration\". That is the sure path to disintegration, leaving us all worse off \u2013 and with new divisions.Poland is not yet a member of the eurozone, but it is our strategic commitment to join when the conditions are right. We see the euro as a vital national interest, and will play our part, as president, in getting the right decisions taken.Too many of Europe's rules and regulations were designed for very different times. We'll be pressing the case for smarter integration, to release the full potential of the single market and make Europe competitive. An EU-wide common sales contract, cheaper roaming services and a better EU patent regime would transform the way we all do business across Europe.National governments are facing hard financial constraints, so Europe must use its resources more wisely, but with no less ambition. The \"Europe 2020\" strategy requires a budget that maintains Europe's investment in a common future and makes the common agricultural policy more efficient. Europe needs smarter energy policies that reconcile production, supply and distribution with environmental concerns.The wider context is dramatic. As we haggle over our internal problems, hundreds of millions of people look to the EU for help and hope. Countries in the Balkans and in eastern Europe are banging on Europe's door. Democratic movements for change have emerged across the world. These changes are not easy. The human cost can be high. Warsaw is the seat of the EU's borders agency, Frontex. We want to empower the agency to help support member states when migration pressures get acute, as in the southern Mediterranean today.In short, Europe will make a strategic mistake if it retreats into unhappy introspection. Poland takes very seriously the recent stark warnings from Washington about Europe's unsatisfactory contribution to shared defence burdens.Part of the answer to the security challenges facing Europe lies in maintaining steadfast openness to new members, and to the core principle that integration is the best security. Our presidency should see Croatia's accession negotiations completed, and new progress made with Turkey and Iceland.Poland naturally wants to see progress on Europe's own unfinished business. We will work to set up a new framework for co-operation between the EU and Russia, its largest neighbour. We also want to see the EU-Ukraine association agreement signed, paving the way for a free trade area. We will push to advance Association Agreement talks with Moldova. And we'll do what we can to help Belarus, now slumping into severe difficulties after years of oppressive mismanagement.Poland made strong steady strides towards its current success thanks to outside engagement. We in turn want to develop and contribute to the new structures and policies Europe needs in these turbulent times, not least the emerging External Action Service led by Catherine Ashton. In January this year Poland launched the idea of a new European Endowment for Democracy. This would focus European efforts to help our neighbours in eastern Europe and north Africa, reaching out to civil society and reforming governments alike with practical and efficient support.These presidency policy initiatives all show that Poland is keeping optimistic faith with the European ideal.Thirty years ago the Gdansk ship-workers led the way and changed the world, as millions of Poles joined the Solidarity movement to insist on their basic democratic rights and freedoms. The Polish presidency wants to help the EU draw strength from the ambition and patient wisdom of that movement. Poland itself is an EU success story.By investing in solidarity a growing, open and secure Europe delivers spectacular results, and sets an example to other countries and regions now starting their own transitions.As prime minister Donald Tusk said last year on receiving the Charlemagne prize: \"We Poles really believe in Europe.\" We will invigorate Europe with our faith.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "European Union", "UK news"], "title": "For Poland, European integration is not a crisis.

Crucially, my European colleagues need to accept the remorseless logic of monetary union that leads from a single currency to greater fiscal integration.\"He said excessive debt across the world was the \"root cause\" of worsening economic situations, adding: \"What started as a debt crisis in the banking sector in 2008 has now turned into a wider crisis of sovereign, banking and private sector debt. And Britain cannot blame the rest of the world for these debts, for we were one of the biggest contributors to them.\"He said his \"decisive action\" to introduce an emergency budget last summer \"on our own terms\" had put the UK \"ahead of the curve\" in the challenging economic times.Osborne also used his speech to court business leaders to help the government face down \"the forces of stagnation\" resisting reforms he said were necessary to allow businesses to generate growth.Telling the audience they were the \"real engine of growth\", he said the government was working \"flat out to help your businesses not only survive but thrive\".But he claimed that while the government was doing all it could to help the sector succeed, including reducing business taxes and \"burdensome red tape\", special interest groups were trying to prevent ministers from pushing through changes designed to aid recovery.Citing the controversy over proposals to shake up planning legislation, Osborne said the presumption in favour of \"sustainable development\", which could help businesses and create jobs, had \"even been opposed by the Telegraph\".He said he wanted the business community to give \"loud and clear support\" for proposals to reduce more than 1,000 pages of planning regulations to 50 to make it easier for them to develop their businesses.On the growing lobby opposing some of the planning reforms, which includes some of his Conservative colleagues, he said: \"Don't underestimate our determination to win this argument.\"", "tags": ["George Osborne", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Eurozone crisis", "European banks", "Economics", "Business", "Euro", "European Union", "World news", "UK news"], "title": "Eurozone crisis: time to find a solution is short, says Osborne"},{"date": "2011-09-14T21:38:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Europe's struggle to come good on pledges to rescue Greece from bankruptcy and save its single currency has descended into confusion amid political feuding and parliamentary setbacks across the eurozone.Angela Merkel's coalition in Germany faced rows about whether Greece should be allowed to fail; a parliamentary committee in Austria delayed a vote to ratify plans for a stronger bailout fund; and Slovakia's Eurosceptic parliamentary speaker demanded that Greece be allowed to go bust, making clear that he would seek to undermine the plan hatched at a eurozone summit in July in Brussels.Amid the cacophony, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, head of the European commission, voiced exasperation at the failure of EU national leaders to keep their promises and talked up the benefits of eurobonds, a pooling of eurozone government debt.The Polish finance minister said the survival of the EU was at stake. \"Europe is in danger,\" Jacek Rostowski told the European parliament in Strasbourg. \"If the euro area breaks up, the European Union will not be able to survive.\"Poland currently holds the EU presidency and Rostowski faces a tough challenge on Friday when he chairs a meeting of EU finance ministers in Wroclaw which will now be consumed by the crisis.International pressure on Merkel and other European leaders surged, with the US, China, Russia and others demanding they get a grip. In a display of Washington's alarm, the US Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, is to take part in the Wroclaw meetings .The American fear is that a Greek collapse would trigger a renewed European banking crisis which would spill over into the US, a reverse of what happened in 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers was exported across the Atlantic. A fresh crisis could plunge America back into recession and damage Barack Obama's re-election hopes.The US markets reacted to the news from Europe with another jittery day., but the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up more than 140 points having fallen more than a 100 earlier in the day.Damon Vickers, a Seattle-based hedge fund manager, said the jitters were likely to continue. \"This is anxiousness, fear, it's 2008 all over again. That crisis was about banks and the consumer, this is about countries,\" he said. \"The sooner we get this over with the better, then we can move on,\" he said.John Canally, economist and investment strategist at LPL Financial, said investors were torn between the \"fear that we are going to see a collapse in the euro and a country is going to fail and the belief that everything is going to be OK.\" He said all eyes were now on the meeting of European finance ministers this Friday and the US Federal Reserve next week. \"The markets want to see a bold policy move in Europe,\" he said. \"If they don't see that, this will continue.\"Similar fears are gripping the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. A Greek collapse would impact severely on French banks eight months before Nicolas Sarkozy faces a second-term presidential election.Another leader under pressure, Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, has won a vote of confidence, paving the way for his austerity package to be voted through. The governing coalition has been fighting over the details of the fiscal consolidation plan for weeks but Berlusconi mustered enough of a majority to win the vote.At a teleconference Greek prime minister George Papandreou told Merkel and Sarkozy his country was determined to meet all obligations agreed with international lenders in exchange for an EU/IMF bailout. All three leaders have a vested interest in playing for time over Greece despite the sense that it is running out.\"The president and the prime minister have repeated in unison France's determination to do whatever it takes to rescue Greece,\" said the French government spokeswoman, Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse.Officials from the European commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund returned to Athens to try to get the Greek rescue package back on track.According to senior EU diplomats, this month the three officials departed from Athens \"in despair\" at the Greek government's failure to honour the stiff terms of the bailout deal.In July, eurozone leaders pledged a second \u20ac109bn bailout for Greece, to increase the bailout pot, the European Financial Stability Facility, and to empower it to replace the European Central Bank (ECB) in buying up stricken government bonds.But the plans have run into problems. The level of involvement by Greece's private creditors in rolling over debt remains lower than foreseen. The 17 countries of the eurozone have to ratify the new scheme promptly, but ratification has been delayed in Austria, Slovakia, Finland and possibly Slovenia, and run into rebellion among Merkel's coalition partners.While Barroso talked up the prospect of eurobonds on Wednesday, Germany's economics minister and liberals' leader, Philipp R\u00f6sler, ruled them out. P\u00e9cresse in Paris said there would not be a quick fix. \"Eurobonds are for us the end of a process of consolidation in the eurozone because sharing debt also requires the convergence of our budget policies.\"In Bratislava, Richard Sul\u00edk, the Eurosceptic speaker of parliament and leader of one of four parties in the ruling coalition, said the bailout fund was a bigger threat to the euro than Greece.\"It has often happened that a city within a country goes bankrupt, and that does not have consequences for the currency. We must let Greece go into bankruptcy,\" he told Austrian radio. \"The rescue plan tries to overcome the debt crisis with new debt. We are saying that this is equally a threat to the euro.\"That echoed growing calls among political leaders across eurozone creditor countries. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was the first eurozone head of government formally to propose recently new arrangements enabling fiscal recalcitrants to be expelled from the single currency.Barroso said: \"Solid, feasible and concrete proposals have been made and agreed upon.

In his role as Poland's chief negotiator, he managed to close 17 out of 30 negotiation chapters, including those concerning social affairs and employment, energy, the EU's external relations and economic and monetary union. A reputable negotiator, he surrounded himself in office with a\u00a0team of young people, for whom he was a mentor and a guide through EU politics. Later, many of them were to become Poland's first generation of\u00a0eurocrats in Brussels.His involvement in Poland's integration with the EU dated back to 1989, when he became the country's ambassador to the European Communities. During his term, Poland signed an association agreement with the EC, in 1991, and applied for membership of the EU three years later.In the summer of 2004, when Poland and the other nine new member states participated in the European elections for the first time, Ku\u0142akowski secured a seat in the European parliament. He and three other Polish MEPs were elected on the ticket of the centre-right Unia Wolnosci (Union of Liberty) party and joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group.Ku\u0142akowski was one of the most active MEPs from Poland, serving as vice-chair of the delegation to the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly in 2007-08. He was active on employment and social affairs, and promoted the opening of western labour markets to new member states.He was born in Myszk\u00f3w, southern Poland, to a Polish father and a Belgian mother. The family later settled in Warsaw. In 1944 he participated in the Warsaw uprising, against German occupation, serving as a courier for the resistance. His father and sister were killed during the war, and in 1946 he and his mother emigrated to Belgium.Ku\u0142akowski graduated from the Catholic University of Leuven with a degree in law in 1953. He became involved with the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions (IFCTU) and was appointed a member of\u00a0its general secretariat in 1954. He later became secretary, and then secretary general, of the European organisation of\u00a0the IFCTU. He served as\u00a0secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation in the mid-1970s. From 1976 to 1989, he was secretary general of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), as the IFCTU was renamed in 1968.During his term at the helm of\u00a0the WCL, Ku\u0142akowski approached the leaders of communist Poland's independent trade union Solidarity, who welcomed him as a spokesman for their cause. He negotiated with Latin American and African dictatorships to advocate Solidarity in the west. His flat in Brussels was dubbed the \"little embassy\" by Polish opposition members, as Ku\u0142akowski was effective in lobbying in favour of those seeking to make their voice heard in the west. One of these activists, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, became Poland's first democratic prime minister in 1989, after the Communist party and Solidarity launched talks.When Mazowiecki asked him to become Poland's ambassador to the EC, Ku\u0142akowski agreed and renounced his Belgian citizenship. He headed the Polish representation in Brussels from 1990 to 1996. His profound knowledge of the EU was useful in 1998, when he was appointed secretary of state and chief negotiator with the EU by the prime minister, Jerzy Buzek. He served at this post until 2001, when the government lost the elections. The negotiations between Poland and the EU were concluded by the succeeding government, which built on\u00a0Ku\u0142akowski's work.Ku\u0142akowski did not seek re-election as an MEP in 2009, as his health was deteriorating rapidly.

It is unfortunate that most of the headlines dwell on the plight of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain because much of the rest of Europe is making steady progress toward developing a more sustainable economic model.Germany has emerged as a global economic leader, with solid growth rates and unemployment declining to its lowest level in decades (about 6%, according to OECD harmonised figures, compared to 9.3% and 9.2% for the EU and US respectively). The Nordic countries of Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark all have seen steady growth. Sweden, viewed as \"socialist\" by many in the US media, in particular has been a bright spot, seeing growth of over 4% in 2010 with solid growth predicted in 2011 and 2012 as well. Sweden and Germany have defied the experts' predictions, and are a reminder of Europe's capacity for pleasant surprises. France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and others also have shown strong signs of recovery.The news of course is buzzing with fears over governments drowning in debt, whether in Greece or in the US. But the fact is Europe is not as much underwater as the US. Compare the current debt averages, in which EU debt amounts to 73% of gross domestic product while US debt is 102% (latest US treasury figures). The US national debt has skyrocketed due not only to the economic collapse but also to excessive military spending and out-of-control healthcare costs. While the EU debt is still higher than the target of 60% of GDP, US debt will exceed the size of the national economy for the first time since the second world war.Nevertheless, President Barack Obama joined the Republicans in Congress to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the richest 2% of Americans, which the president had vowed to end. Yet inequality in America is increasing dramatically, the 400 wealthiest Americans now having $1.4tn (\u00a3878bn) in wealth, which is greater than the gross domestic product for the entire country of India (with more than a billion people).In a momentous reversal, \"socialist\" Europe is the place that now is emphasising budget discipline. Yet at the same time Europe is also endeavouring to preserve the best of its social supports for families and workers. (Meanwhile the US is having a devil of a time figuring out how to provide healthcare for the 47\u00a0million Americans without it). The US also has a huge trade deficit, both because it imports too much and no longer produces enough that the rest of the world wants to buy. Europe, in the meantime, has become the largest trading partner with both the US and China, with more Fortune 500 companies than America and China combined.Poland is a great example of what is going right in Europe, and why it doesn't make sense to obsess too much on the countries in a weaker position. The EU's sixth most populous nation, with an economy larger than Ireland, Greece or Portugal, it has avoided a recession altogether during this economic collapse. Many economists have compared Poland favourably to Ireland in the 1990s, during the Celtic Tiger's glory days (though so far no problems have been found with Polish banks). Foreign investors are taking a liking to what they see, attracted by stable growth and 38 million people with modest levels of household debt.The amount of EU structural funds is substantial, \u20ac347bn (\u00a3306bn) over seven years, most of it targeted to eastern and central European member states. The American economist Paul Krugman has harshly criticised Europe for not providing enough government spending to stimulate its economy, but these structural funds have done much to jumpstart economies in the targeted regions.Eastern Europe is also showing signs of revival. Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine, which suffered double-digit plunges in economic output last year, have begun to grow again. Like Poland, these economies have benefited from the strong economy in neighbouring Germany, with German exports to the region jumping by 20%. Turkey, also, has proven its economic mettle, growing at a China-like pace, with trade to Europe continuing to increase. There are a few worry spots, especially the small economies of Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania, but for the most part the \"west to east to west\" conveyor belt that had rolled so industriously prior to the economic collapse seems to be reviving.So many economic green shoots sprouting across the continent puts the plight of the famous four in a broader perspective. Especially since Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain comprise such a small share of the EU economy, it makes little sense to become too obsessed with their situation. Each of them, for different reasons, have put themselves between a rock and a hard place. Certainly the other European member states should lend a helping hand, but at this point there are no easy solutions. It is going to take time and determination to move forward.In the meantime, the success or failure of the European project is not dependent on their fate. That's what the doom and gloom Eurosceptics don't seem to understand.The world is facing some enormous challenges. The world's wealthy nations, not only in Europe but also in the US, Japan and elsewhere, are faced with a fundamental question: how does a modern economy develop itself and foster a decent, middle-class standard of living for its people without relying on fragile asset bubbles, hyper-consumerism (which adds to global warming), and running up huge public and private debt? The world urgently needs a model for fostering steady-state economies for the 21st century. Economic as well as ecological balance and sustainability must become the highest national priorities, indeed the basis for the blueprint of how to develop an economy.Europe's flaws and challenges are very real and should not be minimised, but nor should they be exaggerated or obsessed over. Europe is a work in progress, and it has been taking many correct steps not only to recover from the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression, but to chart a durable path into the future.", "tags": ["Europe", "World news", "Eurozone crisis", "Global recession", "Economics", "US economy", "European Union"], "title": "Don't let the doom merchants obscure the true European picture | Steven Hill"},{"date": "2011-12-23T09:41:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "As part of its EU presidency, Poland played host to last week's EU DevDays. Next month the country's new development co-operation act comes into force. What is Polish aid worth? Where does it go? And what makes Poland's approach different from its neighbours?Currently, none of the four central European Visegr\u00e1d states (Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic and Poland) are on track to reach their EU commitment to donate 0.33% of gross national income (GNI) by 2015. The EU's 2011 accountability report (pdf) shows that to reach the 2015 target, Poland and the Slovak Republic would need to spend five times as much on aid over the next five years as they currently do, Hungary would have to give four times as much, and the Czech Republic would have to triple its aid.Poland's foreign aid spend in 2010 was $377m. That's 0.08% of GNI, considerably less than its international commitment to increase aid to 0.17% by 2010.Despite these figures, last month's Eurobarometer opinion poll on attitudes to development aid (pdf) showed Poles are some of the most supportive of development aid (92%). According to the EU-wide survey, 85% of Europeans find development aid very important or fairly important. This has decreased by four percentage points, from 89%, since the last survey in 2010. In the UK it's 81%. In Hungary support is weaker, at 75%.Since joining the EU in 2004, Poland has rapidly increased its foreign aid. In the run-up to the EU presidency in early 2010, the OECD carried out a review (pdf) that recommended moving to multi-year funding, stronger independent monitoring and evaluation, more professional development opportunities for staff, dialogue with civil society, and a clearer focus on poverty reduction.Several of the OECD recommendations have already been met. For example, Poland's first development co-operation act will come into force next year to strengthen the legal basis for its development aid. Previously, foreign aid was administered across several different agencies, which made it hard to assess its effectiveness.The ministry of foreign affairs' plan for 2012 will focus on three thematic areas: democracy and human rights, global education and volunteer work, and humanitarian aid. Geographically, funding will concentrate on Eastern Partnership countries and on Afghanistan, east Africa, the Palestinian Authority, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.The Zagranica group, a platform for Polish NGOs, produces an annual Aid Watch report (pdf) that rates the government on the quantity and quality of its development aid. Its 2010 review (there is no data yet available for 2011) notes room for improvement on gender, environmental sustainability, international co-operation for development, and a more clearly defined strategy on democracy building.Not surprisingly, Polish development assistance aligns with its foreign policy (it still has troops in Afghanistan) and international obligations (as part of the EU). It also reflects its historical experience (Poland was occupied rather than colonised), its transformation to a market economy and EU member state, as well as geographical proximity (a section of Poland's eastern border now makes up the external EU border with Belarus, Russia and Ukraine).More than 71% of Poland's development budget was spent on its contribution to the EU development budget, and a further 3% on other multilateral aid contributions (via international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, for example). This leaves a little more than a quarter of the budget for bilateral (country to country) aid.Perhaps most surprisingly, nearly half of Polish bilateral aid in 2010 (47%) went to China, largely due to a loan agreement between the two countries.In 2010 Polish aid went to around 80 countries. Following an established trend. A significant part was given to European countries, mainly Belarus and Ukraine. Funds to Africa, however, are decreasing. In 2010 the value of aid to Africa was three times lower than in 2009 and four times lower than in 2008.From 2011 Poland will also contribute to the European Development Fund (primarily for African, Caribbean and Pacific countries), so far it has contributed only to the EU's overall aid budget.

The EU's 2011 accountability report (pdf) shows that to reach the 2015 target, Poland and the Slovak Republic would need to spend five times as much on aid over the next five years as they currently do, Hungary would have to give four times as much, and the Czech Republic would have to triple its aid.Poland's foreign aid spend in 2010 was $377m. That's 0.08% of GNI, considerably less than its international commitment to increase aid to 0.17% by 2010.Despite these figures, last month's Eurobarometer opinion poll on attitudes to development aid (pdf) showed Poles are some of the most supportive of development aid (92%). According to the EU-wide survey, 85% of Europeans find development aid very important or fairly important. This has decreased by four percentage points, from 89%, since the last survey in 2010. In the UK it's 81%. In Hungary support is weaker, at 75%.Since joining the EU in 2004, Poland has rapidly increased its foreign aid. In the run-up to the EU presidency in early 2010, the OECD carried out a review (pdf) that recommended moving to multi-year funding, stronger independent monitoring and evaluation, more professional development opportunities for staff, dialogue with civil society, and a clearer focus on poverty reduction.Several of the OECD recommendations have already been met. For example, Poland's first development co-operation act will come into force next year to strengthen the legal basis for its development aid. Previously, foreign aid was administered across several different agencies, which made it hard to assess its effectiveness.The ministry of foreign affairs' plan for 2012 will focus on three thematic areas: democracy and human rights, global education and volunteer work, and humanitarian aid. Geographically, funding will concentrate on Eastern Partnership countries and on Afghanistan, east Africa, the Palestinian Authority, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.The Zagranica group, a platform for Polish NGOs, produces an annual Aid Watch report (pdf) that rates the government on the quantity and quality of its development aid. Its 2010 review (there is no data yet available for 2011) notes room for improvement on gender, environmental sustainability, international co-operation for development, and a more clearly defined strategy on democracy building.Not surprisingly, Polish development assistance aligns with its foreign policy (it still has troops in Afghanistan) and international obligations (as part of the EU). It also reflects its historical experience (Poland was occupied rather than colonised), its transformation to a market economy and EU member state, as well as geographical proximity (a section of Poland's eastern border now makes up the external EU border with Belarus, Russia and Ukraine).More than 71% of Poland's development budget was spent on its contribution to the EU development budget, and a further 3% on other multilateral aid contributions (via international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, for example). This leaves a little more than a quarter of the budget for bilateral (country to country) aid.Perhaps most surprisingly, nearly half of Polish bilateral aid in 2010 (47%) went to China, largely due to a loan agreement between the two countries.In 2010 Polish aid went to around 80 countries.

Janusz Palikot, its wealthy founder, made his money selling vodka before becoming a Civic Platform MP. His attacks on the powerful Roman Catholic Church and championing of causes such as gay rights, legalisation of soft drugs, and liberalisation of Poland's strict abortion laws, struck a chord among young voters.\"Palikot is going to be difficult opposition for Tusk \u2013 a big challenger,\" said Nowak. \"He will be talking a lot about modernisation and questioning the speed of current reforms, something no other party has really been doing in recent years.\"A PR whizz, Palikot looks to have eaten away at support for the post-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), which won only about 8.2% of the vote.Lech Walesa, Poland's former president and leader of the Solidarity trade union in communist times, said Palikot had successfully tapped into issues neglected by other parties. \"Palikot had a clearer message ... and people want a simpler, clear message,\" Walesa told TVN24 television.Financial markets welcomed Tusk's victory as a guarantee of political and economic stability in the EU's largest eastern member state amid the deepening eurozone crisis. \"From the point of view of the markets, this is very good news.

Today, the Arab spring continues to remind us that others still yearn for freedom and a better future. And as we look to the future, governance, democracy and human rights will form a central part of our vision for EU development policy.\"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso, president of the European Commission, continued this theme. Speaking at the close of day one, he argued that the world needs \"joint, global solutions\".\"One year on from the start of the democratic uprisings in north Africa and the Middle East, the theme of this year's event is even more crucial,\" said Barroso. \"It is essential to address the links between political change and socio-economic progress, which I believe are mutually dependent and reinforcing.\"The excitement surrounding events in north Africa and the Middle East was evident from the list of speakers. Beji Caid-Essebsi, Tunisia's interim prime minister, gave a special address on day one, and was followed on Friday by Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of Libya's national transitional council. Other panellists included Kamel Jendoubi, president of Tunisia's electoral commision; women's rights activist and senior adviser for international development in Libya, Farida Allaghi; and, perhaps most pertinently, Rami Abdurrahman, founder of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.In January, Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland's foreign affairs minister, launched the European Endowment for Democracy. The scheme, which has gained support from the European Commission, operates outside the normal EU budget, with member states contributing voluntarily. The fund will support democracy, building civil society and capacity among grassroots organisations, especially those undergoing transformation as a result of elections. It will be interesting to see who contributes, and how the fund works in practice over the next year.Poland is proud of its journey from aid recipient to donor since joining the EU in 2004. Its development co-operation policy concentrates on humanitarian aid and support for democracy. It also supports global development education.The focus on democratic governance has been part of Poland's development story from the outset. Krzysztof Stanowski, the outgoing state under-secretary for development co-operation within the foreign affairs ministry, links domestic support for development aid directly to Poland's own path to democracy, saying: \"79% of Polish [people] support provision of foreign aid. Everybody understands what solidarity means.\"Civil society representatives are more cautious, however, pointing out that foreign aid is not an established branch of Poland's foreign policy, and inisting that the country's transformation mustn't be turned into a decontextualised fairytale. As Monika Matus \u2013 one of the authors of the Polish AidWatch report and a policy officer for the Zagranica group, consisting of more than 60 Polish NGOs \u2013 points out: \"Many people and politicians here would struggle to explain what 'development co-operation' or 'development education' are.\"Support for aid comes from a sense of moral obligation, adds Matus. \"We received aid, and the fact that we weren't colonisers but occupied ourselves makes it even more important that we should give.\" She also points out that Poland's foreign ministry is not oblivious to the trade benefits other member states get for every euro they put into the European Development Fund.The Zagranica group welcomes the progress of the past year but highlights room for improvement in delivery. Poland's new legal act on development co-operation, which comes into force in January 2012 following an eight-year fight by civil society organisations (CSOs), finally makes explicit who is accountable to whom in development, and enshrines the right of CSOs to be consulted on policy and be part of the programme council. Crucially, it also gives the green light for funding beyond a year, a limitation which had previously placed development projects on an uncertain footing, risking their sustainability.However, Matus regrets the bill's failure to mention policy coherence, which NGOs fear could reduce the effectiveness of Polish aid if good intentions in one area of government hamper progress in other areas of implementation (for instance, if trade policy conflicts with manufacturing workers' conditions). CSOs also argue poverty eradication, rather than the promotion of democratic transformation, should have been the bill's first principle.Wrapping up day one, Stanowski celebrated the \"inspiring words about democratic support\" he'd heard, which he said had extra resonance in Warsaw, \"especially on the 30th anniversary of the imposition of martial law [13 December, 1981], which happened here but which we succeeded in \u2026 overcoming.\"", "tags": ["Global development", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Arab and Middle East unrest"], "title": "Events in north Africa strike a familiar chord with Poland | Lucy Lamble"},{"date": "2011-12-23T09:41:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "As part of its EU presidency, Poland played host to last week's EU DevDays.

He can't present a bold vision for the future because there are so many uncertainties right now, but what he has been able to do is quietly shepherd Poland through turbulent times,\" said Nowak, who believes Tusk was helped enormously by the somewhat anachronistic behaviour of Kacyznski on the campaign trail.\"Jaroslaw Kaczynski was practising politics from the 19th century, fighting with Germany and Russia and going on about Smolensk,\" he said, a reference to the plane crash in 2010 that killed Kaczynski's twin brother Lech, a former Polish president. The PiS leader has repeatedly suggested the crash was a conspiracy between the Russians and Tusk's government.Tusk's apparent victory appears to be a reward for presiding over four years of impressive economic growth, a feat attributed to an inflow of EU funds and a large domestic market of 38 million people that maintained an appetite for consumption.The big surprise in Sunday's election was the 9.9% share of the vote apparently won by a new liberal grouping, Palikot's Movement, formed by a renegade from Tusk's party. Janusz Palikot, its wealthy founder, made his money selling vodka before becoming a Civic Platform MP. His attacks on the powerful Roman Catholic Church and championing of causes such as gay rights, legalisation of soft drugs, and liberalisation of Poland's strict abortion laws, struck a chord among young voters.\"Palikot is going to be difficult opposition for Tusk \u2013 a big challenger,\" said Nowak. \"He will be talking a lot about modernisation and questioning the speed of current reforms, something no other party has really been doing in recent years.\"A PR whizz, Palikot looks to have eaten away at support for the post-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), which won only about 8.2% of the vote.Lech Walesa, Poland's former president and leader of the Solidarity trade union in communist times, said Palikot had successfully tapped into issues neglected by other parties. \"Palikot had a clearer message ... and people want a simpler, clear message,\" Walesa told TVN24 television.Financial markets welcomed Tusk's victory as a guarantee of political and economic stability in the EU's largest eastern member state amid the deepening eurozone crisis. \"From the point of view of the markets, this is very good news. Investors feared that we could see a coalition made up of three parties,\" Ernest Pytlarczyk, chief economist at BRE Bank, told Reuters.Civic Platform's victory ends a string of defeats for ruling parties in elections in EU member states this year, including in Portugal, Latvia, Denmark and Ireland.The party has pledged more cautious reforms aimed at reining in the public debt and budget deficit. It also wants to continue a privatisation programme set to bring in 15bn zlotys (\u00a33bn) for state coffers in 2011 and to pursue closer ties with Poland's EU partners.The result is a personal triumph for Tusk, 54, a pragmatic liberal conservative from Poland's Baltic coast, who was involved in the Solidarity movement. Tusk, whose country holds the EU presidency until the end of this year, favours closer European integration and says joining the euro remains a goal for Poland despite the eurozone crisis. He enjoys good personal ties with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and has maintained a cautious rapprochement with Russia, despite strains over the Smolensk air disaster.Jaroslaw Kaczynski's calls for a halt to privatisation, for higher taxes on the wealthy and for a more combative stance in dealings with the EU unsettled investors.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "European Union", "Euro", "Business", "Euro", "Economics", "Donald Tusk"], "title": "Poland re-elects PM Donald Tusk"},{"date": "2011-12-16T17:48:10Z", "country": "poland", "content": "This year's EU DevDays event, organised by the European Commission and Poland, current holder of the revolving EU presidency, reflects both the recent history and aspirations of the host nation and the way the Arab spring has coloured 2011.Andris Piebalgs, European commissioner for development, said in his opening speech at the Copernicus Science Centre in Warsaw: \"Not so long ago, Poland and the other Soviet bloc countries emerged from the totalitarian shadows onto the road to democratic transition and EU membership. Today, the Arab spring continues to remind us that others still yearn for freedom and a better future. And as we look to the future, governance, democracy and human rights will form a central part of our vision for EU development policy.\"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso, president of the European Commission, continued this theme. Speaking at the close of day one, he argued that the world needs \"joint, global solutions\".\"One year on from the start of the democratic uprisings in north Africa and the Middle East, the theme of this year's event is even more crucial,\" said Barroso. \"It is essential to address the links between political change and socio-economic progress, which I believe are mutually dependent and reinforcing.\"The excitement surrounding events in north Africa and the Middle East was evident from the list of speakers. Beji Caid-Essebsi, Tunisia's interim prime minister, gave a special address on day one, and was followed on Friday by Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of Libya's national transitional council. Other panellists included Kamel Jendoubi, president of Tunisia's electoral commision; women's rights activist and senior adviser for international development in Libya, Farida Allaghi; and, perhaps most pertinently, Rami Abdurrahman, founder of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.In January, Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland's foreign affairs minister, launched the European Endowment for Democracy. The scheme, which has gained support from the European Commission, operates outside the normal EU budget, with member states contributing voluntarily. The fund will support democracy, building civil society and capacity among grassroots organisations, especially those undergoing transformation as a result of elections. It will be interesting to see who contributes, and how the fund works in practice over the next year.Poland is proud of its journey from aid recipient to donor since joining the EU in 2004. Its development co-operation policy concentrates on humanitarian aid and support for democracy. It also supports global development education.The focus on democratic governance has been part of Poland's development story from the outset. Krzysztof Stanowski, the outgoing state under-secretary for development co-operation within the foreign affairs ministry, links domestic support for development aid directly to Poland's own path to democracy, saying: \"79% of Polish [people] support provision of foreign aid. Everybody understands what solidarity means.\"Civil society representatives are more cautious, however, pointing out that foreign aid is not an established branch of Poland's foreign policy, and inisting that the country's transformation mustn't be turned into a decontextualised fairytale. As Monika Matus \u2013 one of the authors of the Polish AidWatch report and a policy officer for the Zagranica group, consisting of more than 60 Polish NGOs \u2013 points out: \"Many people and politicians here would struggle to explain what 'development co-operation' or 'development education' are.\"Support for aid comes from a sense of moral obligation, adds Matus. \"We received aid, and the fact that we weren't colonisers but occupied ourselves makes it even more important that we should give.\" She also points out that Poland's foreign ministry is not oblivious to the trade benefits other member states get for every euro they put into the European Development Fund.The Zagranica group welcomes the progress of the past year but highlights room for improvement in delivery. Poland's new legal act on development co-operation, which comes into force in January 2012 following an eight-year fight by civil society organisations (CSOs), finally makes explicit who is accountable to whom in development, and enshrines the right of CSOs to be consulted on policy and be part of the programme council. Crucially, it also gives the green light for funding beyond a year, a limitation which had previously placed development projects on an uncertain footing, risking their sustainability.However, Matus regrets the bill's failure to mention policy coherence, which NGOs fear could reduce the effectiveness of Polish aid if good intentions in one area of government hamper progress in other areas of implementation (for instance, if trade policy conflicts with manufacturing workers' conditions). CSOs also argue poverty eradication, rather than the promotion of democratic transformation, should have been the bill's first principle.Wrapping up day one, Stanowski celebrated the \"inspiring words about democratic support\" he'd heard, which he said had extra resonance in Warsaw, \"especially on the 30th anniversary of the imposition of martial law [13 December, 1981], which happened here but which we succeeded in \u2026 overcoming.\"", "tags": ["Global development", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Arab and Middle East unrest"], "title": "Events in north Africa strike a familiar chord with Poland | Lucy Lamble"},{"date": "2011-11-17T15:22:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland's classical music and jazz scenes may be enormously influential, but the country's pop acts have traditionally made little impression internationally. With isolated exceptions such as Blog 27 \u2013 a pair of 13-year-old rappers whose 2005 album LOL is fondly remembered in Japan to this day \u2013 few Polish stars have significantly troubled the foreign charts. The lack of overseas success shouldn't be mistaken for a sign of limited horizons or shortage of quality. Poland's domestic pop scene spans everything from dancehall to slick retro soul and can boast a handful of the most engaging artists the region has to offer.With English lyrics and expensive videos, the performer most likely to find an audience outside Poland may be Dorota \"Doda\" Rabczewska. Famous since 16 as singer with metal act Virgin, her recent solo work has seen her repositioned as a central European answer to Lady Gaga. Although the peroxide hair, challenging fashion sense and ongoing fight against criminal charges of blasphemy suggest she has the fundamentals ticked off, the music still needs work. At home, her popularity has been eclipsed by Czech Republic-born Ewa Farna whose Ewakuacja (see clip above) has a claim to being the biggest single of 2011. Her muscular power ballads share more than a trace of DNA with Evanescence but they're belted out with stirring vigour.The most interesting stars, however, are those whose influences are much harder to piece together.\u00a0What marks Poland out from many of its\u00a0neighbours is the presence of an unconventional streak running through the heart of the mainstream. The UK's \"wonky pop\" bandwagon may be creaking under the weight of Eliza Doolittle's grating whimsy and the foghorn bombast of Florence Welch but there's still a place at the top of Poland's charts for exciting, off-kilter music aimed at a mass audience.The movement's poster girl is Monika Brodka, one of a growing number of artists across Europe making a mockery of the idea that no good can come of Pop Idol and its cousins. Her fearsome natural talent has always been apparent but didn't find its full expression until third album, Granda. Drawing on electro, rock and roots music, but remaining resolutely pop in its approach and execution, the record has a vitality and adventurousness that puts most of Poland's alt-rock acts to shame.Lead single W Pi\u0119ciu Smakach, a song about memory, sense of place and Vietnamese noodle soup, has an enthralling hum and clatter but it is her voice, arching in the chorus like Kate Bush, which marks it out as truly exceptional.Set to replicate Brodka's combination of critical acclaim and popular success is Iza Lach, dubbed \"Poland's Lily Allen\" but exploring territory closer to Goldfrapp or the slow-burning electro-pop of compatriot Kasia Stankiewicz. Her woozy, introspective new album Krzyk is one of the most beguiling records of the year so far. It's difficult to imagine either singer being embraced so warmly without the pioneering groundwork done by Katarzyna Nosowska, Poland's queen of the commercial avant garde. An unpredictable combination of theatrical pop and forward-thinking electronica, her most recent album 8 spent the bulk of October at No 1. The single Nomada, like Thom Yorke's Eraser expanded from two dimensions to three, is extraordinary. With the growth of a new Polish diaspora, the country's music is\u00a0easier to access than ever. Mail-order services\u00a0catering to ex-pats\u00a0deliver CDs across the world and major new releases, such as Granda and\u00a0Krzyk, are increasingly available on\u00a0Amazon and iTunes in the UK. Polish\u00a0pop\u00a0may have to wait for\u00a0its major international breakthrough but there's no need for us to miss out now.", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "title": "Pop musik: the sound of the charts in \u2026 Poland"},{"date": "2012-03-02T09:38:50Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Apple's stock market value has hit $500bn, the Daily Star tells its readers, only the sixth company in history to soar past the half a trillion dollars mark.

This was the only EU economy to avoid contraction in the dark days of 2009, leading the prime minister to describe Polish economic growth (albeit at a modest 1.6%) as a \"green island\" amid the red sea of recession elsewhere in the union.Demand at home cushioned the economy when exports declined, and this has helped Poles feel they would succeed in weathering the global crisis where others had so patently failed. But attitudes towards joining the euro, once seen as the badge of a successful economy, are changing as the turmoil in Europe continues.The Polish economy is still growing. There has been massive public investment due to the European football championship that Poland is co-hosting this year, made possible by the vast amount of funding the country gets from Brussels. And the weakening zloty, which suffered last year when traders became increasingly nervous about the worsening debt situation in Greece and other eurozone members, has helped to keep exports ticking over.Whether this trend can continue obviously depends a great deal on the ongoing attempts to sew up the hole in Greece's leaky wallet. Most important from Poland's point of view, though, is not whether Greece defaults on its debt or is forced to leave the eurozone, but what effect the whole mess will have on Germany.More than a quarter of Poland's exports go to its western neighbour, and the two countries are woven together on myriad levels. There are plenty of diehard anti-Germans in Poland, but even more who own small businesses and who know that Poland's economic wellbeing is to a great extent dependent on that of Europe's largest economy \u2013 and by extension, of the eurozone as a whole.As Radek Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, said in a recent speech in Berlin, the biggest danger for Poland today is \"not terrorism, it's not the Taliban, and it's certainly not German tanks. It's not even Russian missiles which President Medvedev has just threatened to deploy on the EU's border. The biggest threat to the security and prosperity of Poland would be the collapse of the eurozone.\"Domestic economic policy also plays a role, of course. Here opinions are split into two fiercely opposed camps: those in the government who say Poland is on track for economic nirvana, and those predicting Armageddon.Krzysztof Rybinski, a former deputy governor of the central bank and one of the government's sharpest critics, has said that 2011 was the last good year for the Polish economy and that things will go downhill from the second half of 2012, for want of decent reforms in the face of an economic slowdown, an ageing population and a looming energy crisis. People should prepare for lean years ahead, he believes.Poles either seem to be listening to detractors like Rybinski, or not have much respect for the opinions of their political leaders (a phenomenon that has a long history in Poland), or have been watching the riots in Athens and Madrid on TV. A recent study by Polish polling organisation CBOS showed that 81% of Poles think the euro crisis is likely to threaten them and their families personally, which is perhaps not surprising, considering the fact that unemployment is high.Agricultural workers are particularly nervous because the prime minister has pledged to bring their social security and pensions scheme into line with the national system, thus cutting their already very modest benefits. And popular support for adopting the euro is lower than ever, with another CBOS poll finding that 60% of Poles are opposed to the idea.Poland, like its fellow post-communist neighbours, agreed in its EU accession treaty to adopt the euro once it meets the conditions for doing so (Britain and Denmark are the only EU states to have an official opt-out clause). There is no deadline for adoption, though, and since the Polish government was forced to drop its previous target of 2011 after the prime minister announced it, with spectacularly bad timing, just days before the Lehman Brothers collapse, it has not set a new date. Now, of course, that seems not to be a sign of laziness in meeting the adoption criteria, but eminently sensible.The finance minister says primly whenever asked that Poland does want to be in the eurozone, but that it must first put its house in order. The truth is, in fact, that Poland is nowhere near to meeting the conditions for adoption, with its budget deficit way above the 3%-of-GDP limit and inflation too high, not to mention the volatility of its currency.

This was the only EU economy to avoid contraction in the dark days of 2009, leading the prime minister to describe Polish economic growth (albeit at a modest 1.6%) as a \"green island\" amid the red sea of recession elsewhere in the union.Demand at home cushioned the economy when exports declined, and this has helped Poles feel they would succeed in weathering the global crisis where others had so patently failed. But attitudes towards joining the euro, once seen as the badge of a successful economy, are changing as the turmoil in Europe continues.The Polish economy is still growing. There has been massive public investment due to the European football championship that Poland is co-hosting this year, made possible by the vast amount of funding the country gets from Brussels. And the weakening zloty, which suffered last year when traders became increasingly nervous about the worsening debt situation in Greece and other eurozone members, has helped to keep exports ticking over.Whether this trend can continue obviously depends a great deal on the ongoing attempts to sew up the hole in Greece's leaky wallet. Most important from Poland's point of view, though, is not whether Greece defaults on its debt or is forced to leave the eurozone, but what effect the whole mess will have on Germany.More than a quarter of Poland's exports go to its western neighbour, and the two countries are woven together on myriad levels. There are plenty of diehard anti-Germans in Poland, but even more who own small businesses and who know that Poland's economic wellbeing is to a great extent dependent on that of Europe's largest economy \u2013 and by extension, of the eurozone as a whole.As Radek Sikorski, Poland's foreign minister, said in a recent speech in Berlin, the biggest danger for Poland today is \"not terrorism, it's not the Taliban, and it's certainly not German tanks. It's not even Russian missiles which President Medvedev has just threatened to deploy on the EU's border. The biggest threat to the security and prosperity of Poland would be the collapse of the eurozone.\"Domestic economic policy also plays a role, of course. Here opinions are split into two fiercely opposed camps: those in the government who say Poland is on track for economic nirvana, and those predicting Armageddon.Krzysztof Rybinski, a former deputy governor of the central bank and one of the government's sharpest critics, has said that 2011 was the last good year for the Polish economy and that things will go downhill from the second half of 2012, for want of decent reforms in the face of an economic slowdown, an ageing population and a looming energy crisis. People should prepare for lean years ahead, he believes.Poles either seem to be listening to detractors like Rybinski, or not have much respect for the opinions of their political leaders (a phenomenon that has a long history in Poland), or have been watching the riots in Athens and Madrid on TV. A recent study by Polish polling organisation CBOS showed that 81% of Poles think the euro crisis is likely to threaten them and their families personally, which is perhaps not surprising, considering the fact that unemployment is high.Agricultural workers are particularly nervous because the prime minister has pledged to bring their social security and pensions scheme into line with the national system, thus cutting their already very modest benefits. And popular support for adopting the euro is lower than ever, with another CBOS poll finding that 60% of Poles are opposed to the idea.Poland, like its fellow post-communist neighbours, agreed in its EU accession treaty to adopt the euro once it meets the conditions for doing so (Britain and Denmark are the only EU states to have an official opt-out clause). There is no deadline for adoption, though, and since the Polish government was forced to drop its previous target of 2011 after the prime minister announced it, with spectacularly bad timing, just days before the Lehman Brothers collapse, it has not set a new date. Now, of course, that seems not to be a sign of laziness in meeting the adoption criteria, but eminently sensible.The finance minister says primly whenever asked that Poland does want to be in the eurozone, but that it must first put its house in order. The truth is, in fact, that Poland is nowhere near to meeting the conditions for adoption, with its budget deficit way above the 3%-of-GDP limit and inflation too high, not to mention the volatility of its currency.

She left Poland to find work before her suspended sentence had expired because her father bought her a flight ticket to Britain. She is no longer taking drugs, the courts have been told, and is employed in the UK.Her case has been taken up by Fair Trials International, which is campaigning to reform the use of EAWs, warning that they are often served disproportionately for minor offences.Poland, where prosecutors exercise no discretion over whether to pursue individuals, issues more than any other EU state. In 2009/10 it sent the UK 2,403 EAWs; the next largest was Germany, which issued the UK with 235 arrest warrants.Extradition requests have been sent out from Warsaw for minor offenders such as individuals going overdrawn on bank accounts, piglet thieves and cake snatchers. The Home Office has asked Poland to change its procedures.\"Extradition should be reserved for the most serious cases,\" said Jago Russell, chief executive of Fair Trials International, \"but under the EU's fast-track system, thousands of people are now being extradited every year often for the most petty crimes.\"This can have disastrous human costs for people like Natalia and places a massive and unjustified strain on the courts and police. We hope the European court of human rights takes a stand against extradition for minor crimes when it finally hears this shocking case.\"Gorczowska, who works at a food processing factory in Norfolk, said: \"My son, Nathan, is only one year old. It's important he stays with me. My father works a nightshift, so he won't be able to look after him.\"There's no one else to care for him so I will have to give him to the local authority if I go. But I don't want that. When I left Poland I told my probation officer and he didn't say anything. Now I have been told the Polish authorities want to send me to prison.\"I had a horrible life in Poland and was around bad people. I don't want to go back. I will lose my job, my child, my house \u2013 everything. The police came to arrest me at work before Christmas. I was driven to London and spent a night in a police cell.\"Now I have to wear a tag and can't go out between 6pm and 5am. I don't know why they are doing this to me. I haven't killed anyone. I haven't killed anyone. It was a small offence. In this country the punishment would have been much less.\"Gorczowska has been in trouble with the law in Britain once, following a case in 2010 involving her ex-boyfriend, in which she says she was forced to hand over an address. She pleaded guilty to a joint enterprise offence of affray and intimidating a witness and was given a nine-month suspended sentence.Michael Evans, head of the extradition department at solicitors Kaim Todner, which represents her, said Natalia had been granted a temporary stay by the ECHR on the grounds that deportation would undermine her rights to a family life under Article 8 of the European convention on human rights.\"[The ECHR] has said that she should not be removed on the basis of her circumstances and her right to family life,\" Evans said. \"She has led a drug-free life. The amphetamine possession charge was when she was a teenager; it was for personal use.\"If she was removed the child would have to be given up to local authority care. The case is an example of the disproportionate use of extradition.\"A Home Office spokesman said: \"We have pressed other countries in the EU to use the European arrest warrants proportionately. We are looking at the working of the EAW and will shortly give our response to the review by Sir Scott Baker about extradition arrangements.\"\u2022 This article was corrected on 26 March 2012 because he referred to Lord Justice Scott Baker, who has now retired", "tags": ["Extradition", "UK criminal justice", "Law", "UK news", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Norfolk"], "title": "Polish single mother in Norfolk fears losing young son in extradition row"},{"date": "2012-07-30T15:58:32Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Mitt Romney is to round off his campaign to boost his presidential foreign policy credentials by returning to a cold war symbol of anti-Soviet triumph and western-backed liberty in Poland.Following a gaffe-strewn visit to Britain, where he queried the Olympic host's fitness to stage the Games, and after stirring controversy in Israel by calling Jerusalem the Israeli capital and seeming to back unilateral Israeli strikes against Iran, the Republican White House contender arrived on Monday in Poland, where he is to deliver a setpiece speech on democracy and freedom.The speech on the \"values of liberty\" at Warsaw University on Tuesday is expected to seek to rekindle the flames of US cold war righteousness by featuring a strong attack on Russia and President Vladimir Putin's rollback of democratic gains, while also criticising the US president, Barack Obama, for allegedly sacrificing the interests and security of central European democracy in favour of realpolitik with the Kremlin.Romney has previously described Russia as America's \"No 1 geopolitical foe\", in contrast with Obama, who has sought to press \"the reset button\" in relations with Moscow.Romney arrived on Monday in Gdansk, Solidarity's birthplace, where Soviet communism was punctured 32 years ago.

This time he said: Oh yeah? At least I'm not a perpetrator of torture.McCain was asked about it on Fox and Friends.\"I'm always glad to get comments four years later.

Barney Frank (D-Mass.), who sits on the committee, told the Washington Blade on Monday that the 15-member panel unanimously backed the inclusion of a marriage equality plank after a national hearing over the weekend in Minneapolis, in which several witnesses testified in favor of such language.\u201cI was part of a unanimous decision to include it,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThere was a unanimous decision in the drafting committee to include it in the platform, which I supported, but everybody was for it.\u201dThere will be a gay marriage platform plank at the DNC.

Abortions provided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement? For undocumented workers? You mean like in makeshift clinics in Laredo or something? I wasn't aware that that was happening!In fact Barbara Gonzalez, an ICE spokeswoman, tells the AP that that is not happening, and that it has never happened: the agency has not paid for any abortion services since its 2003 creation.But the House has passed a bill to make it illegal anyway. As a rider to the Homeland Security budget, no less. The AP reports:The measure, proposed by Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., would block ICE from using agency funding to provide abortion services for detainees except in the case of rape, incest or if there life of the mother would be endangered.The provision was attached to a $46 billion Homeland Security spending bill approved on a party-line 234-182 vote. It has little chance of surviving in the Democratic-controlled Senate.Barbara Gonzalez, an ICE spokeswoman, said the agency has not paid for abortion services since its 2003 creation.There should be a law that you can't outlaw something until it happens at least once. Because to do so is not legislating, it's politicking. 2.37pm BST Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has had enough of Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe's climate change denial \u2013 and now Sanders is doing something about it. Our environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg has the story:Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders is preparing a takedown of the Republicans' biggest climate change contrarian on Monday afternoon, hoping this summer's extreme drought will break through the party's wall of denial.Sanders is due to makes his speech on the Senate floor from 3pm onwards, and will use the remarks to refute five of Inhofe's latest assertions about climate change.\u201cThe bottom line here is, when Senator Inhofe says global warming is a hoax, he is just dead-wrong according to the vast majority of climate scientists,\u201d Sanders will say according to a draft of the speech.Inhofe has for years been the Republicans' leading opponent of climate science and environmental regulations. But Sanders will say it would be a mistake to dismiss his views, because of his leadership in the Republican party:\"Many who take climate science seriously dismiss Senator Inhofe. I believe that is a huge mistake. Let me remind all of my colleagues and the American people that Senator Inhofe was once the Chairman of the Environment Committee, and if the Republicans take control of the Senate in 2013, he will regain that position. Senator Inhofe is the Republican leader on environmental issues and global warming. For better or worse, when Senator Inhofe speaks, the Republican Party follows his lead. Therefore, it is extremely important that we take his views seriously.\u201dDemocrats plan to take the fight to Republicans even further this week with Barbara Boxer calling a hearing on climate change at the Senate environmental and public works committee.The Republican-controlled House committee has refused 15 requests from Democrats for a hearing on climate change. 2.37pm BST Politico has a slide show of Mitt Romney's Poland trip.  2.37pm BST The Romneys visit a monument in Gdansk, Poland, dedicated to shipyard workers who died in a 1970 strike against the Communist government.

While we wait, let's look at President Obama's history of gaffes there, as rounded up by Charlie Spiering in the Washington Examiner. Here are two entries in a list of seven:May 2012: Obama refers to \u201cPolish Death Camps\u201dWhile awarding a prestigious Medal of Freedom to Jan Karski, a famous Polish resistance fighter from World War II, President Obama bungled his speech by referring to the Nazi death camps in occupied Poland as \u201cPolish Death Camps.\u201dApril 2010: President Obama goes golfing during presidential funeralWhen Polish President Kaczynski was killed in a plane crash in April of 2010, President Obama made plans to attend the funeral for the Polish president, but trip was canceled due to a hazardous volcanic ash cloud over Europe.Many Polish-Americans were angered, however, as President Obama instead went golfing while the funeral took place without him in Poland. 2.37pm BST Management meets the union leader.The Gov with former President Lech Walesa. twitter.com/dgjackson/stat\u2026 2.37pm BST In case you missed it over the weekend: Bill Clinton is to play a headliner role at this year's Democratic national convention:Obama personally asked Clinton to speak at the convention and place Obama's name in nomination, and Clinton enthusiastically accepted, officials said on Sunday. .In contrast, the Republican party can't afford to let either George W. Bush or Dick Cheney get anywhere near their convention. To do so would be to invite comparisons between Romney's policies \u2013 particularly his support for tax cuts for the wealthiest \u2013 and Bush's. At which point voters might remember what the Bush presidency did to the country.Whatever you think of Mitt Romney, you have to admit that he's fighting his way forward against considerable odds. He's a member of a party whose best hope for its legacy is that the padlock on the trap door holding that legacy in the basement doesn't come loose. 2.37pm BST The Romneys in Gdansk.Mitt, Ann and Josh Romney lay a wreath at the Westerplatte memorial in Gdansk.

Romney's remarks.\"The context appears to be that when Romney chalked the disparity up to \"culture,\" he was more insistent about pressing the point than most media reports captured. His full remarks here. Partial:...culture makes all the difference. Culture makes all the difference. And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things. 2.37pm BST In characterizing Israel's economic superiority to the Palestinians, Romney said this:As you come here and you see the GDP per capita, for instance, in Israel which is about $21,000 dollars, and compare that with the GDP per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority, which is more like $10,000 per capita, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality.Romney seems to have no grasp of the situation in Gaza and the West Bank. He thinks they're failing economically because of some kind of culture gap.And he thinks Palestinians produce $10,000 per capita.The AP corrects:The economic disparity between the Israelis and the Palestinians is actually much greater than Romney stated. Israel had a per capita gross domestic product of about $31,000 in 2011, while the West Bank and Gaza had a per capita GDP of just over $1,500, according to the World Bank. 2.37pm BST Palestinian officials reacted in anger to Mitt Romney's assertion that the gap between Israeli and Palestinian economic prospects owed to superior Israeli culture and the hand of Providence.Romney's analysis failed to touch on other potential factors such as decades of war and siege and checkpoints that seal the territories from the outside world.\"It is a racist statement and this man doesn't realize that the Palestinian economy cannot reach its potential because there is an Israeli occupation,\" said Saeb Erekat, a senior aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\"It seems to me this man lacks information, knowledge, vision and understanding of this region and its people,\" Erekat added. \"He also lacks knowledge about the Israelis themselves.

Romney's remarks.\"The context appears to be that when Romney chalked the disparity up to \"culture,\" he was more insistent about pressing the point than most media reports captured. His full remarks here. Partial:...culture makes all the difference. Culture makes all the difference. And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things. 2.37pm BST In characterizing Israel's economic superiority to the Palestinians, Romney said this:As you come here and you see the GDP per capita, for instance, in Israel which is about $21,000 dollars, and compare that with the GDP per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority, which is more like $10,000 per capita, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality.Romney seems to have no grasp of the situation in Gaza and the West Bank. He thinks they're failing economically because of some kind of culture gap.And he thinks Palestinians produce $10,000 per capita.The AP corrects:The economic disparity between the Israelis and the Palestinians is actually much greater than Romney stated.

Mitt Romney's merry world tour toddles on today with a visit to Poland. Here's a summary of where things stand:\u2022 At a weekend fundraiser in Israel, Romney observed that Israel is much healthier economically than \"the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority.\" What accounts for the difference? \"...the power of at least culture and a few other things,\" he said. He cited a climate of innovation, the Jewish history of thriving in adversity and the \"hand of providence.\"\u2022 Romney said America's \"highest national security priority\" should be making sure that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon. \u2022 President Obama is to make a quick trip this evening to New York City for a fundraiser.

It said the intent was to demonstrate a resolute stand with places that share America's values \u2013 a hint at the Republican contender's claim that Obama has let down Washington's friends abroad while offering grovelling apologies to its enemies.In London Romney's meetings with the prime minister, David Cameron, his deputy, Nick Clegg, and the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, will permit him for the first time to project himself as a politician capable of reaching beyond his limited political experience as a state governor.Romney will also meet the chancellor, George Osborne \u2013 a chance to ally himself with an economic strategy of deep cuts to public spending.The Republican contender plans to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympics, providing an opportunity to remind US voters of his claim to have saved the 2002 Salt Lake City winter Games from meltdown.His trip to Israel is the most likely to have political impact back home, not least as Romney attempts to rally conservative Christian evangelical voters who are strong supporters of Israel but sceptical about his Mormon faith.Romney's team said he was going to \"learn and listen\". But the Obama campaign is piling pressure on Romney to clarify his criticisms of the president's approach to Iran's nuclear programme. It has homed in on Romney's claim that Obama is not strong enough in confronting Tehran and too weak in failing to promise unconditional support for Israel if it attacks Iran.Colin Kahl, a former defence department official in the Obama administration, challenged Romney for failing to explain what he would do that is different to the White House's approach of putting an emphasis on sanctions and diplomacy while saying the use of force remains a final option.\"This isn't the time for anyone to be playing politics with our policy in the region,\" Kahl said. \"If Romney thinks it's time to use military action against Iran and abandon diplomacy this early, I think he owes it to the American people to actually say so.\"That may be a hard subject to avoid in Jerusalem. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, will be looking for support on his Iran policy, which is rooted in deep scepticism that sanctions and diplomacy will work. Israel says there is a rapidly shrinking window in which to carry out an effective military attack against Tehran's nuclear facilities. But there is little evidence of an appetite among most US voters for a conflict with Iran.Romney has also derided Obama's testy relationship with Netanyahu as endangering Israel's security. He has criticised the president for public differences with the Israeli leader over the expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.Support for Netanyahu on the settlements and the lack of progress on an agreement with the Palestinians will play well with Christian evangelicals in the US but is not likely to do much to enhance Romney's foreign policy credentials more broadly.There is little doubt that the Israeli prime minister would prefer to see Romney in the White House. They have known each other since the 1970s when they both worked at the Boston Consulting Group.But it remains to be seen if Netanyahu will risk further alienating Obama with tacit shows of support for Romney without being confident of a Republican victory.Romney has also attempted to portray Obama as weak over the president's plan to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan in 2014 and for his response to the uprising in Syria.The Republican candidate said Obama was right to call for the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, to quit but the president had not done enough to force it, relying on international diplomatic pressure and allowing Russia to block stronger action.\"I think from the very beginning we misread the setting in Syria,\" Romney told CNBC. \"America should have come out very aggressively from the very beginning and said Assad must go\u00a0\u2026 the world looks for American leadership and American strength.\"Michele Flournoy, a former undersecretary of defence in the Obama administration, challenged Romney to say how he would address these complex foreign policy issues.\"We face a number of challenges going forward and they can't be faced with political talking points and platitudes and criticising your opponent,\" she said. \"They really require serious people with serious ideas and people who understand the complexity of the world we live in. Romney hasn't really told us yet how we would confront these challenges.\"The Republican camp quickly hit back.\"In no region of the world is our country's influence any stronger than it was four years ago,\" said Romney's spokesman, Ryan Williams. \"President Obama has failed to restore our economy, is weakening our military with devastating defence cuts, and has diminished our moral authority.\"Romney ends his tour in Poland at the invitation of its former president, Lech Walesa, a founder of the Solidarity movement that brought down the country's communist government.", "tags": ["Mitt Romney", "US elections 2012", "Republicans", "US foreign policy", "US politics", "US news", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "UK news"], "title": "Mitt Romney under pressure to define foreign policy on overseas tour"},{"date": "2012-07-30T15:58:32Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Mitt Romney is to round off his campaign to boost his presidential foreign policy credentials by returning to a cold war symbol of anti-Soviet triumph and western-backed liberty in Poland.Following a gaffe-strewn visit to Britain, where he queried the Olympic host's fitness to stage the Games, and after stirring controversy in Israel by calling Jerusalem the Israeli capital and seeming to back unilateral Israeli strikes against Iran, the Republican White House contender arrived on Monday in Poland, where he is to deliver a setpiece speech on democracy and freedom.The speech on the \"values of liberty\" at Warsaw University on Tuesday is expected to seek to rekindle the flames of US cold war righteousness by featuring a strong attack on Russia and President Vladimir Putin's rollback of democratic gains, while also criticising the US president, Barack Obama, for allegedly sacrificing the interests and security of central European democracy in favour of realpolitik with the Kremlin.Romney has previously described Russia as America's \"No 1 geopolitical foe\", in contrast with Obama, who has sought to press \"the reset button\" in relations with Moscow.Romney arrived on Monday in Gdansk, Solidarity's birthplace, where Soviet communism was punctured 32 years ago. The Republican contender was invited by Lech Walesa, the ex-shipyard electrician, former Solidarity leader and unsuccessful post-communist Polish president. In Gdansk, where affection for US Republican cold warriors is strong and which is home to a Ronald Reagan park featuring a statue of the former president, Romney also met the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, a native of the port city.Romney is expected to seek to use the visit to Gdansk and Warsaw to canvass for the votes of the big Polish diaspora in the US and more broadly for the support of those of east European origin in the US.Despite the emphasis on the west's cold war victory and Poland and Solidarity's pivotal roles in the revolutions of 1989, Romney will find himself in a country that is quickly moving on, less receptive to US rhetoric, seeing its key alliances in the European Union, and dismayed that its traditional attachment to American values and outlook are taken for granted in Washington.The only country in the EU to escape recession since the financial and then the euro crises erupted in 2008, Poland is thriving at a time of universal European gloom, using a new-found confidence to build European alliances to encourage democratic reforms in neighbouring Ukraine and Belarus and to contest Putin's proprietorial policies towards parts of the former Soviet Union.Romney is to see the Polish foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, a previously Americanophile politician who increasingly sees the Polish national interest best served by new European security structures.\"The aim of Sikorski's meeting will be to get to know Mitt Romney's position on US foreign policy. Global and regional challenges of key global importance in the near future will also be discussed,\" said the Polish foreign ministry.An Oxford graduate married to an American and previously employed at a neo-conservative US thinktank, Sikorski's earlier ardent anglophilia and pro-Americanism have been tempered by disappointment with the Obama administration over the US visa waiver policy for Poles, under-appreciation of Polish military contributions in Iraq and Afghanistan, the dilution of US missile defence plans in central Europe, and US policy towards Putin.The disenchantment with Washington is unlikely to be reversed by a charm offensive and a more hawkish line from Romney. Instead, the Poles are keener to boost European foreign and security policy capacities, using their EU presidency last year to try to push common EU defence policies and running into a British brick wall.With Sweden, Italy and Spain, the Poles have just launched an initiative for a more robust European foreign policy.", "tags": ["Mitt Romney", "Poland", "US elections 2012", "Russia", "US politics", "US news", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "Mitt Romney to rekindle cold war spirit with speech in Poland attacking Russia"},{"date": "2012-07-30T14:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": " 2.37pm BST We're going to wrap up our live blog politics coverage for the day.

Usually when his visionary (as in seeing things others don't) selection of Palin is challenged, McCain shrugs off the criticism, says he stands by his choice, says Palin is doing a great job. This time he said: Oh yeah? At least I'm not a perpetrator of torture.McCain was asked about it on Fox and Friends.\"I'm always glad to get comments four years later. Look, I respect the vice president,\" McCain said on \"Fox & Friends\" Monday. \"He and I had strong disagreements as to whether we should torture people or not. I don't think we should have.\" 2.37pm BST One good reason for the Democrats to invite former President Bill Clinton to their convention: his popularity is at record levels, according to a new Gallup poll.66% of poll respondents \u2013 both Democrats and Republicans \u2013 said they have a favorable opinion of the Man from Hope, his highest number since his inauguration in 1993.(h/t: @jesserodriguez) 2.37pm BST An actual ad in a Senate (that's national, not state) campaign.

Romney's remarks.\"The context appears to be that when Romney chalked the disparity up to \"culture,\" he was more insistent about pressing the point than most media reports captured. His full remarks here. Partial:...culture makes all the difference. Culture makes all the difference. And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things. 2.37pm BST In characterizing Israel's economic superiority to the Palestinians, Romney said this:As you come here and you see the GDP per capita, for instance, in Israel which is about $21,000 dollars, and compare that with the GDP per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority, which is more like $10,000 per capita, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality.Romney seems to have no grasp of the situation in Gaza and the West Bank. He thinks they're failing economically because of some kind of culture gap.And he thinks Palestinians produce $10,000 per capita.The AP corrects:The economic disparity between the Israelis and the Palestinians is actually much greater than Romney stated. Israel had a per capita gross domestic product of about $31,000 in 2011, while the West Bank and Gaza had a per capita GDP of just over $1,500, according to the World Bank. 2.37pm BST Palestinian officials reacted in anger to Mitt Romney's assertion that the gap between Israeli and Palestinian economic prospects owed to superior Israeli culture and the hand of Providence.Romney's analysis failed to touch on other potential factors such as decades of war and siege and checkpoints that seal the territories from the outside world.\"It is a racist statement and this man doesn't realize that the Palestinian economy cannot reach its potential because there is an Israeli occupation,\" said Saeb Erekat, a senior aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\"It seems to me this man lacks information, knowledge, vision and understanding of this region and its people,\" Erekat added. \"He also lacks knowledge about the Israelis themselves.

Mitt Romney's merry world tour toddles on today with a visit to Poland. Here's a summary of where things stand:\u2022 At a weekend fundraiser in Israel, Romney observed that Israel is much healthier economically than \"the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority.\" What accounts for the difference? \"...the power of at least culture and a few other things,\" he said. He cited a climate of innovation, the Jewish history of thriving in adversity and the \"hand of providence.\"\u2022 Romney said America's \"highest national security priority\" should be making sure that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon. \u2022 President Obama is to make a quick trip this evening to New York City for a fundraiser.

It said the intent was to demonstrate a resolute stand with places that share America's values \u2013 a hint at the Republican contender's claim that Obama has let down Washington's friends abroad while offering grovelling apologies to its enemies.In London Romney's meetings with the prime minister, David Cameron, his deputy, Nick Clegg, and the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, will permit him for the first time to project himself as a politician capable of reaching beyond his limited political experience as a state governor.Romney will also meet the chancellor, George Osborne \u2013 a chance to ally himself with an economic strategy of deep cuts to public spending.The Republican contender plans to attend the opening ceremony of the Olympics, providing an opportunity to remind US voters of his claim to have saved the 2002 Salt Lake City winter Games from meltdown.His trip to Israel is the most likely to have political impact back home, not least as Romney attempts to rally conservative Christian evangelical voters who are strong supporters of Israel but sceptical about his Mormon faith.Romney's team said he was going to \"learn and listen\". But the Obama campaign is piling pressure on Romney to clarify his criticisms of the president's approach to Iran's nuclear programme. It has homed in on Romney's claim that Obama is not strong enough in confronting Tehran and too weak in failing to promise unconditional support for Israel if it attacks Iran.Colin Kahl, a former defence department official in the Obama administration, challenged Romney for failing to explain what he would do that is different to the White House's approach of putting an emphasis on sanctions and diplomacy while saying the use of force remains a final option.\"This isn't the time for anyone to be playing politics with our policy in the region,\" Kahl said. \"If Romney thinks it's time to use military action against Iran and abandon diplomacy this early, I think he owes it to the American people to actually say so.\"That may be a hard subject to avoid in Jerusalem. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, will be looking for support on his Iran policy, which is rooted in deep scepticism that sanctions and diplomacy will work. Israel says there is a rapidly shrinking window in which to carry out an effective military attack against Tehran's nuclear facilities. But there is little evidence of an appetite among most US voters for a conflict with Iran.Romney has also derided Obama's testy relationship with Netanyahu as endangering Israel's security. He has criticised the president for public differences with the Israeli leader over the expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.Support for Netanyahu on the settlements and the lack of progress on an agreement with the Palestinians will play well with Christian evangelicals in the US but is not likely to do much to enhance Romney's foreign policy credentials more broadly.There is little doubt that the Israeli prime minister would prefer to see Romney in the White House. They have known each other since the 1970s when they both worked at the Boston Consulting Group.But it remains to be seen if Netanyahu will risk further alienating Obama with tacit shows of support for Romney without being confident of a Republican victory.Romney has also attempted to portray Obama as weak over the president's plan to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan in 2014 and for his response to the uprising in Syria.The Republican candidate said Obama was right to call for the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, to quit but the president had not done enough to force it, relying on international diplomatic pressure and allowing Russia to block stronger action.\"I think from the very beginning we misread the setting in Syria,\" Romney told CNBC. \"America should have come out very aggressively from the very beginning and said Assad must go\u00a0\u2026 the world looks for American leadership and American strength.\"Michele Flournoy, a former undersecretary of defence in the Obama administration, challenged Romney to say how he would address these complex foreign policy issues.\"We face a number of challenges going forward and they can't be faced with political talking points and platitudes and criticising your opponent,\" she said. \"They really require serious people with serious ideas and people who understand the complexity of the world we live in. Romney hasn't really told us yet how we would confront these challenges.\"The Republican camp quickly hit back.\"In no region of the world is our country's influence any stronger than it was four years ago,\" said Romney's spokesman, Ryan Williams. \"President Obama has failed to restore our economy, is weakening our military with devastating defence cuts, and has diminished our moral authority.\"Romney ends his tour in Poland at the invitation of its former president, Lech Walesa, a founder of the Solidarity movement that brought down the country's communist government.", "tags": ["Mitt Romney", "US elections 2012", "Republicans", "US foreign policy", "US politics", "US news", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "UK news"], "title": "Mitt Romney under pressure to define foreign policy on overseas tour"},{"date": "2012-07-31T15:05:19Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Mitt Romney has accused Vladimir Putin of reversing democratic gains and liberties in Russia, holding Poland up as a shining example of the economic, political and democratic benefits of freedom, in a speech at Warsaw University on the values of liberty.Romney rounded off his first campaign venture into foreign policy \u2013 a six-day tour of Britain, Israel and Poland \u2013 with a performance free of the gaffes and controversies that dogged earlier legs of his trip.His entourage, however, became embroiled in mudslinging in Warsaw with accompanying US journalists who complained that in six days they had been able to ask the likely presidential contender only three questions \u2013 and none about the rows Romney triggered in Israel.As Romney walked in Warsaw after paying tribute at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, he was peppered with shouted questions: \"Governor Romney, are you concerned about some of the mishaps of your trip?\" \"Do you have a statement for the Palestinians?\" \"What about your gaffes?\" \"Governor Romney, just a few questions sir, you haven't taken but three questions on this trip from the press.\"Rick Gorka, Romney's spokesman, turned on the travelling reporters and said: \"Kiss my ass. This is a holy site for the Polish people. Show some respect.\" He then told another journalist to \"shove it\", before apologising a little later.On the British leg of his tour, Romney was accused of insulting his hosts over their Olympic preparations. His later declaration that the superiority of Jewish culture explained Israelis' greater prosperity relative to the Palestinians prompted charges of racism from leading Palestinians.Romney told Fox News on Tuesday that he was not talking specifically about Palestinian culture. He blamed the media for his perceived gaffes, saying reporters were more interested in \"finding something to write\" than in reporting on the economy and national security threats.The Republican presidential candidate, who has previously characterised Russia as America's principal \"geopolitical foe\", bracketed President Putin in his speech with Bashar al-Assad of Syria, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, emphasising clear differences with his campaign opponent, Barack Obama, who famously announced a \"reset\" in relations with Russia early in his term.\"Unfortunately, there are parts of the world today where the desire to be free is met with brutal oppression,\" said Romney.\"Just to the east of here, the people of Belarus suffer under the oppressive weight of dictatorship. The Arab world is undergoing a historic upheaval, one that holds promise, but also risk and uncertainty. A ruthless dictator in Syria has killed thousands of his own people.\"In Latin America, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez leads a movement characterised by authoritarianism and repression. Nations in Africa are fighting to resist the threat of violent radical jihadism. And in Russia, once-promising advances toward a free and open society have faltered.\"Traditionally staunchly pro-American, the Poles' Atlanticist enthusiasm has faded because of Washington's reluctance to waive visa requirements, a perceived failure to appreciate Polish efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, a dilution of plans to station US missile defence facilities in Poland and the Czech Republic, and Obama's gaffe three months ago when he talked of \"Polish death camps\" in reference to Nazi Germany's camps in occupied Poland.Romney, with an eye on both the Roman Catholic and central European diaspora votes in November's US presidential election, praised Poland, while emphasising that its democratic gains went hand in hand with a shrinking of the state. \"There has never been a moment when our peoples felt anything but mutual respect and goodwill, and that is not common in history,\" he told the Poles. \"The highest value Poland honours, to the world's great fortune, is man's innate desire to be free.\"The world should pay close attention to the transformation of Poland's economy. A march toward economic liberty and smaller government has meant a march toward higher living standards, a strong military that defends liberty at home and abroad, and an important and growing role on the international stage.\"Romney was invited to Poland by ex-president and Solidarity trade union leader Lech Walesa.

The tunnels were up to 40 metres deep and wide enough to hold a double-track train line. In the event the Russians invaded so quickly that there was no time to fully man the defences, so they were soon overrun.

So, off I went, to the Polish deli nearby. Polish delis don't exactly make the heart soar. Expat proprietors cater for Poland Past rather than Poland Future. Their customers aren't in search of novelty; they're homesick. This one is like stepping into Fine Fare, circa 1979: it's full of brightly coloured packets to whose contents you need add only boiling water. The fresh goods are mostly brown, and those that aren't, are white, and you've only to look at any of them to feel your thighs double in size. The karpatka \u2013 the Polish equivalent of a vanilla slice \u2013 is a vast, undulating mattress of custard and puff pastry; the paczki \u2013 jam-filled doughnuts \u2013 are the size of Jupiter. But they do have lots of kielbasa (sausages): the good old kabanosy (best with a hint of caraway), smokey krakowska (with pepper and garlic) and hearty podwawelska (garlic and marjoram) for adding to stew (bigos).I bought a kabanos, which cost me 38p; I scoffed it on the way home. Also, a packet of pierogi, with which I'm mildly obsessed. Pierogi are little semi-circular dumplings; you fry them, the same way you do Japanese gyoza, which they resemble. There are three varieties: chicken and pork, sauerkraut and wild mushrooms, and \u2013 my favourite \u2013 cottage cheese and potato. Serve them with soft, fried onions, and sour cream on the side. They're completely delicious, even the crummy supermarket kind (these ones came wrapped in plastic, and doubtless began their lives on a Warsaw industrial estate).The best pierogi I know are made by Rafael and Iwona at the Pierogi Company, which started out as a stall for homesick Poles on Camden Market, and now wins awards for its dumplings, wobbly and translucent. They also make bigos, and golabki (cabbage parcels stuffed with pork). Order on the internet; they do home delivery. However, the dream is that one day quite soon I will journey east to eat homemade pierogi in some remote medieval village straight from an ancestral oven. This surprisingly vivid fantasy has been fuelled by my favourite new book: In a Polish Country House Kitchen by Anne Applebaum, whom I knew as a Pulitzer-winning writer about all things communist but who is also, I now discover, a cook. Not only that, she is a cook who just happens to be married to Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister.The book's inspiration is the renovated manor that she and Sikorski own in western Pomerania. Bought for a song after the fall of communism, it has its own orchard, greenhouses and kitchen garden; it's basically where Martha Stewart would live if her ancestors hadn't left Poland for New Jersey. I stare enviously at photographs of it, and I think: oh, to be bicycling through the lanes of Poland's slow food revolution and the promise of Anne's sour bread soup warming in her capacious oven. Given her hawkish politics, this is just a little alarming; it seems I'm even more easily bought than I thought. But there's no denying that the recipes are great (there is a whole chapter on pierogi, with suggestions for more modish fillings such as brown butter and truffle), or that Applebaum has done a beautiful job capturing a Poland, bountiful and lush, that is wholly unknown to most of us.

Grodzka, elected an MP in 2011 on the platform of the liberal Palikot's Movement, has been nominated by her party to become the deputy speaker of Poland's lower house of parliament. A parliamentary majority will now be needed to approve her candidacy. But the idea that a man who underwent a sex-change operation could become one of Poland's top officials has sparked controversy.Paradoxically, it is a radical rightwing politician who deserves the credit for Grodzka's historic nomination. On 25 January, Poland's parliament rejected a bill officially supported by the ruling Civic Platform party, which sanctioned civil unions. Jaros\u0142aw Gowin, the justice minister and a leader of the centre-right Civic Platform's conservative faction, led 45 other party MPs in revolt, rejecting the legislation even though the head of his party, prime minister Donald Tusk, supported it.Gowin and his allies consider civil unions the precursor to gay marriage. But what really sparked outrage in Poland were comments by opposition Law and Justice MP Krystyna Paw\u0142owicz during the debate. Paw\u0142owicz, representing her party, said \"society must not provide a sweet life to unstable, barren relationships from which it gains nothing just because people are connected by sex\". She described homosexual relations as \"hedonistic and auto-destructive for partners and their families\".Soon after, footage emerged of the conservative MP telling her supporters at a meeting that Grodzka \"has the face of a boxer\" and \"it's not enough to stuff yourself with hormones to become a woman\". Many Poles were appalled by these comments.It was in this atmosphere that Janusz Palikot, Grodzka's party boss, proposed her as deputy speaker last week. Now all eyes are on the ruling party. Tusk needs to reverse the damage done to his party in recent weeks. He has always sold Civic Platform as a moderate and modernist party but that image took a hit when his MPs killed the civil unions bill. Tusk also doesn't want Civic Platform to now be perceived as being in the same corner with the likes of Paw\u0142owicz, whose party is vehemently opposed to Grodzka's candidacy. So the ruling party is likely to support Grodzka when push comes to shove.Unfortunately, hostility towards LGBT rights in Poland is not limited to politicians. A poll last week showed 55% of Poles don't like the idea of Grodzka as deputy speaker. Another survey showed 70% oppose civil unions. Of those, 30% say they see no reason to give homosexuals the possibility of establishing formal relationships while 33% say civil unions would lead to gay people being able to adopt children.Even Grodzka's party boss, Palikot, is not free from homophobic sentiment. In 2009, he speculated on his blog about the sexual preferences of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski, the conservative Law and Justice leader and identical twin brother of the late president Lech Kaczynski, who never married and has no children. \"Is Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski a man or a woman?\" he asked, adding that \"with identical twins, one of them is often a homosexual\".As for Grodzka, even her opponents admit she is intelligent and respectful. There's nothing controversial about her politics or persona. The problem they have with her is obviously her sex change.As a whole, modern-day Poland is still a conservative, homogenous society, uncomfortable with minorities \u2013 be they sexual, ethnic or religious. Ninety-five per cent of Poles are Roman Catholic while less than 0.1% of Poland's inhabitants are non-white. Polish society is used to dealing with people whose physical appearance and world views fall within certain parameters.

Samples of Irish ingredients had tested negative. There was no evidence Silvercrest deliberately used horsemeat in its production, said Coveney. It had also said it would now use only Irish and UK suppliers.Tesco withdrew all products supplied by Silvercrest when a survey of beefburgers by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) showed 29% horse DNA relative to beef content in one of the samples.It said in a statement quoted in Irish media that the source of horse DNA identified by the Irish government correlated with the results of its own investigations at the plant. It would give detailed consideration to all the findings, it said. The supermarket, which apologised to customers after the original contamination, had to apologise again last week when burgers that were supposed to be off the shelves were found on sale in one of its Oxford branches.Tests at the Dalepak plant near Northallerton for the UK's Food Standards Agency last week found no traces of either horse or pork DNA, found in the initial FSAI sampling. Waitrose, among the companies with burger lines made there, has decided to restock its shelves. Dalepak never suspended production during the scare.ABP, which has a food plant in Poznan, Poland, said this was not the source of the contaminated meat and none of its plants processed horsemeat. It said there would be new management at Silvercrest and the company had started a new DNA testing regime for contamination by equine and other sources in addition to legal food safety requirements.", "tags": ["Food safety", "The meat industry", "Poland", "Ireland", "Supermarkets", "Europe", "World news", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Food", "Farming", "Environment", "Retail industry", "Business", "Food & drink industry", "Meat", "UK news", "Horsemeat scandal"], "title": "Horsemeat in burgers traced to Polish suppliers"},{"date": "2013-02-16T21:30:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "When I heard that Polish is now England's second most widely spoken language, I had a Proustian moment.

The tunnels were up to 40 metres deep and wide enough to hold a double-track train line. In the event the Russians invaded so quickly that there was no time to fully man the defences, so they were soon overrun. See the surface ruins\u00a0free of charge, or go on tours (in Polish and German only) with caving guides.

Grodzka, elected an MP in 2011 on the platform of the liberal Palikot's Movement, has been nominated by her party to become the deputy speaker of Poland's lower house of parliament. A parliamentary majority will now be needed to approve her candidacy. But the idea that a man who underwent a sex-change operation could become one of Poland's top officials has sparked controversy.Paradoxically, it is a radical rightwing politician who deserves the credit for Grodzka's historic nomination. On 25 January, Poland's parliament rejected a bill officially supported by the ruling Civic Platform party, which sanctioned civil unions. Jaros\u0142aw Gowin, the justice minister and a leader of the centre-right Civic Platform's conservative faction, led 45 other party MPs in revolt, rejecting the legislation even though the head of his party, prime minister Donald Tusk, supported it.Gowin and his allies consider civil unions the precursor to gay marriage. But what really sparked outrage in Poland were comments by opposition Law and Justice MP Krystyna Paw\u0142owicz during the debate. Paw\u0142owicz, representing her party, said \"society must not provide a sweet life to unstable, barren relationships from which it gains nothing just because people are connected by sex\". She described homosexual relations as \"hedonistic and auto-destructive for partners and their families\".Soon after, footage emerged of the conservative MP telling her supporters at a meeting that Grodzka \"has the face of a boxer\" and \"it's not enough to stuff yourself with hormones to become a woman\". Many Poles were appalled by these comments.It was in this atmosphere that Janusz Palikot, Grodzka's party boss, proposed her as deputy speaker last week. Now all eyes are on the ruling party. Tusk needs to reverse the damage done to his party in recent weeks. He has always sold Civic Platform as a moderate and modernist party but that image took a hit when his MPs killed the civil unions bill. Tusk also doesn't want Civic Platform to now be perceived as being in the same corner with the likes of Paw\u0142owicz, whose party is vehemently opposed to Grodzka's candidacy. So the ruling party is likely to support Grodzka when push comes to shove.Unfortunately, hostility towards LGBT rights in Poland is not limited to politicians. A poll last week showed 55% of Poles don't like the idea of Grodzka as deputy speaker. Another survey showed 70% oppose civil unions. Of those, 30% say they see no reason to give homosexuals the possibility of establishing formal relationships while 33% say civil unions would lead to gay people being able to adopt children.Even Grodzka's party boss, Palikot, is not free from homophobic sentiment. In 2009, he speculated on his blog about the sexual preferences of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski, the conservative Law and Justice leader and identical twin brother of the late president Lech Kaczynski, who never married and has no children. \"Is Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski a man or a woman?\" he asked, adding that \"with identical twins, one of them is often a homosexual\".As for Grodzka, even her opponents admit she is intelligent and respectful. There's nothing controversial about her politics or persona. The problem they have with her is obviously her sex change.As a whole, modern-day Poland is still a conservative, homogenous society, uncomfortable with minorities \u2013 be they sexual, ethnic or religious. Ninety-five per cent of Poles are Roman Catholic while less than 0.1% of Poland's inhabitants are non-white. Polish society is used to dealing with people whose physical appearance and world views fall within certain parameters. Difference is sometimes approached with scepticism or even hostility.A deputy speaker Grodzka could start to change that: it could help open the eyes of some people in this country to the fact that the world is not made up solely of people who look, think and feel like them.", "tags": ["Transgender", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "LGBT rights", "Sexuality", "Society"], "title": "A transsexual deputy speaker could open people's eyes in Poland | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2013-01-27T12:08:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Polish suppliers were responsible for the horsemeat in beefburgers scandal which hit supermarkets including Tesco, the Irish government has revealed.Tests in recent days showed raw material imported by an Irish processing plant from Poland had up to 20% equine DNA.

Grodzka, elected an MP in 2011 on the platform of the liberal Palikot's Movement, has been nominated by her party to become the deputy speaker of Poland's lower house of parliament. A parliamentary majority will now be needed to approve her candidacy. But the idea that a man who underwent a sex-change operation could become one of Poland's top officials has sparked controversy.Paradoxically, it is a radical rightwing politician who deserves the credit for Grodzka's historic nomination. On 25 January, Poland's parliament rejected a bill officially supported by the ruling Civic Platform party, which sanctioned civil unions. Jaros\u0142aw Gowin, the justice minister and a leader of the centre-right Civic Platform's conservative faction, led 45 other party MPs in revolt, rejecting the legislation even though the head of his party, prime minister Donald Tusk, supported it.Gowin and his allies consider civil unions the precursor to gay marriage. But what really sparked outrage in Poland were comments by opposition Law and Justice MP Krystyna Paw\u0142owicz during the debate. Paw\u0142owicz, representing her party, said \"society must not provide a sweet life to unstable, barren relationships from which it gains nothing just because people are connected by sex\". She described homosexual relations as \"hedonistic and auto-destructive for partners and their families\".Soon after, footage emerged of the conservative MP telling her supporters at a meeting that Grodzka \"has the face of a boxer\" and \"it's not enough to stuff yourself with hormones to become a woman\". Many Poles were appalled by these comments.It was in this atmosphere that Janusz Palikot, Grodzka's party boss, proposed her as deputy speaker last week. Now all eyes are on the ruling party. Tusk needs to reverse the damage done to his party in recent weeks. He has always sold Civic Platform as a moderate and modernist party but that image took a hit when his MPs killed the civil unions bill. Tusk also doesn't want Civic Platform to now be perceived as being in the same corner with the likes of Paw\u0142owicz, whose party is vehemently opposed to Grodzka's candidacy. So the ruling party is likely to support Grodzka when push comes to shove.Unfortunately, hostility towards LGBT rights in Poland is not limited to politicians. A poll last week showed 55% of Poles don't like the idea of Grodzka as deputy speaker. Another survey showed 70% oppose civil unions. Of those, 30% say they see no reason to give homosexuals the possibility of establishing formal relationships while 33% say civil unions would lead to gay people being able to adopt children.Even Grodzka's party boss, Palikot, is not free from homophobic sentiment. In 2009, he speculated on his blog about the sexual preferences of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski, the conservative Law and Justice leader and identical twin brother of the late president Lech Kaczynski, who never married and has no children. \"Is Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski a man or a woman?\" he asked, adding that \"with identical twins, one of them is often a homosexual\".As for Grodzka, even her opponents admit she is intelligent and respectful. There's nothing controversial about her politics or persona. The problem they have with her is obviously her sex change.As a whole, modern-day Poland is still a conservative, homogenous society, uncomfortable with minorities \u2013 be they sexual, ethnic or religious. Ninety-five per cent of Poles are Roman Catholic while less than 0.1% of Poland's inhabitants are non-white. Polish society is used to dealing with people whose physical appearance and world views fall within certain parameters. Difference is sometimes approached with scepticism or even hostility.A deputy speaker Grodzka could start to change that: it could help open the eyes of some people in this country to the fact that the world is not made up solely of people who look, think and feel like them.", "tags": ["Transgender", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "LGBT rights", "Sexuality", "Society"], "title": "A transsexual deputy speaker could open people's eyes in Poland | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2013-01-27T12:08:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Polish suppliers were responsible for the horsemeat in beefburgers scandal which hit supermarkets including Tesco, the Irish government has revealed.Tests in recent days showed raw material imported by an Irish processing plant from Poland had up to 20% equine DNA. Products made for Tesco, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland were implicated in the initial scare this month caused by food standards checks late last year.Other UK chains withdrew products made at Silvercrest, County Monaghan, and Dalepak Hambleton in north Yorkshire, both owned by the Irish-based ABP Food Group. Burger King also stopped using burgers made at Silvercrest, which suspended production more than a week ago and is now being deep cleaned.More than 10m beefburgers are thought to have been removed from sale because of the scare, although authorities in the UK and Ireland have repeatedly said they posed no threat to human health.Simon Coveney, the Irish food and agriculture minister, said he was sure Poland was the source of the contamination. \"Significant quantities\" of horse DNA had been found in three burgers and the imported ingredient during more than 140 tests on primary products and ingredients. Samples of Irish ingredients had tested negative. There was no evidence Silvercrest deliberately used horsemeat in its production, said Coveney. It had also said it would now use only Irish and UK suppliers.Tesco withdrew all products supplied by Silvercrest when a survey of beefburgers by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) showed 29% horse DNA relative to beef content in one of the samples.It said in a statement quoted in Irish media that the source of horse DNA identified by the Irish government correlated with the results of its own investigations at the plant. It would give detailed consideration to all the findings, it said. The supermarket, which apologised to customers after the original contamination, had to apologise again last week when burgers that were supposed to be off the shelves were found on sale in one of its Oxford branches.Tests at the Dalepak plant near Northallerton for the UK's Food Standards Agency last week found no traces of either horse or pork DNA, found in the initial FSAI sampling. Waitrose, among the companies with burger lines made there, has decided to restock its shelves. Dalepak never suspended production during the scare.ABP, which has a food plant in Poznan, Poland, said this was not the source of the contaminated meat and none of its plants processed horsemeat.

The meat used in Tesco burgers found to contain up to 29% horse DNA had instead come from Poland.However, ABP Food Group, owners of the Silvercrest plant in Ireland, revealed that Tesco would continue sourcing fresh beef from other ABP companies.Tesco said the findings from its investigations concurred with those of the Irish government, and that it would now start its own system of comprehensive DNA testing.Beefburgers on sale in Spain were the latest to come under scrutiny on Wednesday, when tests commissioned by a Spanish consumer organisation found two out of 20 samples were contaminated with horse DNA. Tesco, Iceland, Lidl and Aldi were among supermarkets identified a fortnight ago as having products with equine DNA in them by Irish food safety authorities, although not all the products implicated had been on sale in Britain.Other supermarkets took their burgers off the shelves as a precaution. Tesco's supplier, Silvercrest in County Monaghan, which normally makes 200m burgers a year for different clients, was one of three food processors identified. The Silvercrest plant has been shut down for deep cleaning, the management has been changed and the Irish government is going to supervise the processor's operations indefinitely.Investigations at the only UK plant owned by ABP \u2013 Dalepak Hambleton in North Yorkshire \u2013 are continuing, although it is still in operation.Tim Smith, Tesco's technical director, said: \"We now understand \u2013 with as much certainty as possible \u2013 what happened. The evidence tells us that our frozen burger supplier, Silvercrest, used meat in our products that did not come from the list of approved suppliers we gave them.\"Nor was the meat from the UK or Ireland, despite our instruction that only beef from the UK and Ireland should be used in our frozen beefburgers. Consequently we have decided not to take products from that supplier in future.\"Smith said Tesco was ultimately responsible for the food it sold. \"We will not take anything for granted after this incident. It has shown that, in spite of our stringent tests, checks and controls there remained a small possibility that something could go wrong and it did. We want to stop it ever happening again, so we are taking action to reduce that possibility still further.\"To underpin the strong measures already in place, we will now introduce a comprehensive system of DNA testing across our meat products. This will identify any deviation from our high standards.\"ABP said it had let customers down and apologised. Paul Finnerty, the group's chief executive, said: \"We have learnt important lessons from this incident and we are determined to ensure that this never happens again.\"We have put in place new procedures to audit all our third-party suppliers. We have also established comprehensive DNA testing procedures \u2013 we will become an industry leader in this area,\" said Finnerty, adding the company would not allow the Silvercrest incident \"to overshadow what is a great business\".Poland has been named as the source country for the contamination just as the Warsaw government seeks to improve its own population's confidence and loyalty in homegrown beef. A section in the latest edition of the government newsletter Polish Food is devoted to this drive, which comes as beef production there is expected to fall substantially.In 2012 British imports of fresh and frozen beef from Poland totalled 6,200 tonnes, 3.5 times the amount imported in 2010, although this still represented less than 3% of all imports. Ireland imported just 849 tonnes last year, less than 4% of all imports.Eblex, the organisation responsible for marketing the English beef and sheep industries, says Poland lacks a specialist beef industry. Instead, young bulls are almost entirely produced from dairy calves.In a private member's debate in Westminster Hall on Wednesday, the Labour MP for Croydon North, Steve Reed, questioned whether the UK's Food Standards Agency was still fit for purpose.He said that the government had carved up its responsibilities between the environment and health departments and cut its budget, which, along with \"swingeing\" cuts to local authority budgets for trading standards, had left food safety and labelling controls fragmented.Defra minister David Heath said that although the amount of food sampling carried out by local authorities had fallen, tests were more sophisticated. He admitted the number of food safety officers had fallen by 6% between 2010 and 2012.The minister told MPs that the agency was looking in detail now at how horsemeat from the UK contaminated with the drug phenylbutazone, which is banned in the human food chain, came to be exported to and consumed in other European countries.Asked if he could reassure the public that contaminated horsemeat had not re-entered the UK food chain from Europe, he said that the department would re-examine how horse passports operated.The government has been criticised for abolishing the National Equine Database, but Heath said that was a \"red herring\", since it had never provided information on whether horses were fit for the human food chain.", "tags": ["Tesco", "Supermarkets", "Business", "Retail industry", "The meat industry", "Food", "Farming", "Environment", "UK news", "Ireland", "Europe", "World news", "Poland", "Food safety", "Food & drink", "Food & drink industry", "Meat", "Horsemeat scandal"], "title": "Tesco drops Irish supplier over horsemeat scandal"},{"date": "2013-02-16T21:30:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "When I heard that Polish is now England's second most widely spoken language, I had a Proustian moment. To be specific, I\u00a0thought: mmm, sausages. I'm pretty sure that a long, skinny kabanos \u2013 they come folded in two, like whips, or meaty liquorice \u2013 was the first foreign food I\u00a0ever ate. I have my father to thank for this. He would not watch the FA Cup, or any other Important Sporting Event, without a few slices at his side. It was a ritual: he had a certain knife he liked to use (an Opinel), and a particular receptacle in which the rounds had to be placed (a small, brown bowl that he referred to bafflingly as a \"pottle\"). In those days, Sheffield seriously wanted for posh shops selling foreign foods, but there was, thanks to the war, quite a sizeable Polish community, and there were a few places where you could buy Polish jam, sausages and dill pickles. I\u00a0was an adult before I liked dill pickles, but I loved smoked sausages right from the start.Once the thought \u2013 mmm, sausages \u2013 was in my head, I had to have one. So, off I went, to the Polish deli nearby. Polish delis don't exactly make the heart soar. Expat proprietors cater for Poland Past rather than Poland Future. Their customers aren't in search of novelty; they're homesick. This one is like stepping into Fine Fare, circa 1979: it's full of brightly coloured packets to whose contents you need add only boiling water. The fresh goods are mostly brown, and those that aren't, are white, and you've only to look at any of them to feel your thighs double in size. The karpatka \u2013 the Polish equivalent of a vanilla slice \u2013 is a vast, undulating mattress of custard and puff pastry; the paczki \u2013 jam-filled doughnuts \u2013 are the size of Jupiter. But they do have lots of kielbasa (sausages): the good old kabanosy (best with a hint of caraway), smokey krakowska (with pepper and garlic) and hearty podwawelska (garlic and marjoram) for adding to stew (bigos).I bought a kabanos, which cost me 38p; I scoffed it on the way home. Also, a packet of pierogi, with which I'm mildly obsessed. Pierogi are little semi-circular dumplings; you fry them, the same way you do Japanese gyoza, which they resemble. There are three varieties: chicken and pork, sauerkraut and wild mushrooms, and \u2013 my favourite \u2013 cottage cheese and potato. Serve them with soft, fried onions, and sour cream on the side. They're completely delicious, even the crummy supermarket kind (these ones came wrapped in plastic, and doubtless began their lives on a Warsaw industrial estate).The best pierogi I know are made by Rafael and Iwona at the Pierogi Company, which started out as a stall for homesick Poles on Camden Market, and now wins awards for its dumplings, wobbly and translucent. They also make bigos, and golabki (cabbage parcels stuffed with pork). Order on the internet; they do home delivery. However, the dream is that one day quite soon I will journey east to eat homemade pierogi in some remote medieval village straight from an ancestral oven. This surprisingly vivid fantasy has been fuelled by my favourite new book: In a Polish Country House Kitchen by Anne Applebaum, whom I knew as a Pulitzer-winning writer about all things communist but who is also, I now discover, a cook. Not only that, she is a cook who just happens to be married to Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister.The book's inspiration is the renovated manor that she and Sikorski own in western Pomerania. Bought for a song after the fall of communism, it has its own orchard, greenhouses and kitchen garden; it's basically where Martha Stewart would live if her ancestors hadn't left Poland for New Jersey. I stare enviously at photographs of it, and I think: oh, to be bicycling through the lanes of Poland's slow food revolution and the promise of Anne's sour bread soup warming in her capacious oven. Given her hawkish politics, this is just a little alarming; it seems I'm even more easily bought than I thought. But there's no denying that the recipes are great (there is a whole chapter on pierogi, with suggestions for more modish fillings such as brown butter and truffle), or that Applebaum has done a beautiful job capturing a Poland, bountiful and lush, that is wholly unknown to most of us.

Grodzka, elected an MP in 2011 on the platform of the liberal Palikot's Movement, has been nominated by her party to become the deputy speaker of Poland's lower house of parliament. A parliamentary majority will now be needed to approve her candidacy. But the idea that a man who underwent a sex-change operation could become one of Poland's top officials has sparked controversy.Paradoxically, it is a radical rightwing politician who deserves the credit for Grodzka's historic nomination. On 25 January, Poland's parliament rejected a bill officially supported by the ruling Civic Platform party, which sanctioned civil unions. Jaros\u0142aw Gowin, the justice minister and a leader of the centre-right Civic Platform's conservative faction, led 45 other party MPs in revolt, rejecting the legislation even though the head of his party, prime minister Donald Tusk, supported it.Gowin and his allies consider civil unions the precursor to gay marriage. But what really sparked outrage in Poland were comments by opposition Law and Justice MP Krystyna Paw\u0142owicz during the debate. Paw\u0142owicz, representing her party, said \"society must not provide a sweet life to unstable, barren relationships from which it gains nothing just because people are connected by sex\". She described homosexual relations as \"hedonistic and auto-destructive for partners and their families\".Soon after, footage emerged of the conservative MP telling her supporters at a meeting that Grodzka \"has the face of a boxer\" and \"it's not enough to stuff yourself with hormones to become a woman\". Many Poles were appalled by these comments.It was in this atmosphere that Janusz Palikot, Grodzka's party boss, proposed her as deputy speaker last week. Now all eyes are on the ruling party. Tusk needs to reverse the damage done to his party in recent weeks. He has always sold Civic Platform as a moderate and modernist party but that image took a hit when his MPs killed the civil unions bill. Tusk also doesn't want Civic Platform to now be perceived as being in the same corner with the likes of Paw\u0142owicz, whose party is vehemently opposed to Grodzka's candidacy. So the ruling party is likely to support Grodzka when push comes to shove.Unfortunately, hostility towards LGBT rights in Poland is not limited to politicians. A poll last week showed 55% of Poles don't like the idea of Grodzka as deputy speaker. Another survey showed 70% oppose civil unions. Of those, 30% say they see no reason to give homosexuals the possibility of establishing formal relationships while 33% say civil unions would lead to gay people being able to adopt children.Even Grodzka's party boss, Palikot, is not free from homophobic sentiment. In 2009, he speculated on his blog about the sexual preferences of Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski, the conservative Law and Justice leader and identical twin brother of the late president Lech Kaczynski, who never married and has no children. \"Is Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski a man or a woman?\" he asked, adding that \"with identical twins, one of them is often a homosexual\".As for Grodzka, even her opponents admit she is intelligent and respectful. There's nothing controversial about her politics or persona. The problem they have with her is obviously her sex change.As a whole, modern-day Poland is still a conservative, homogenous society, uncomfortable with minorities \u2013 be they sexual, ethnic or religious. Ninety-five per cent of Poles are Roman Catholic while less than 0.1% of Poland's inhabitants are non-white. Polish society is used to dealing with people whose physical appearance and world views fall within certain parameters. Difference is sometimes approached with scepticism or even hostility.A deputy speaker Grodzka could start to change that: it could help open the eyes of some people in this country to the fact that the world is not made up solely of people who look, think and feel like them.", "tags": ["Transgender", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "LGBT rights", "Sexuality", "Society"], "title": "A transsexual deputy speaker could open people's eyes in Poland | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2013-01-27T12:08:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Polish suppliers were responsible for the horsemeat in beefburgers scandal which hit supermarkets including Tesco, the Irish government has revealed.Tests in recent days showed raw material imported by an Irish processing plant from Poland had up to 20% equine DNA. Products made for Tesco, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland were implicated in the initial scare this month caused by food standards checks late last year.Other UK chains withdrew products made at Silvercrest, County Monaghan, and Dalepak Hambleton in north Yorkshire, both owned by the Irish-based ABP Food Group. Burger King also stopped using burgers made at Silvercrest, which suspended production more than a week ago and is now being deep cleaned.More than 10m beefburgers are thought to have been removed from sale because of the scare, although authorities in the UK and Ireland have repeatedly said they posed no threat to human health.Simon Coveney, the Irish food and agriculture minister, said he was sure Poland was the source of the contamination. \"Significant quantities\" of horse DNA had been found in three burgers and the imported ingredient during more than 140 tests on primary products and ingredients. Samples of Irish ingredients had tested negative. There was no evidence Silvercrest deliberately used horsemeat in its production, said Coveney. It had also said it would now use only Irish and UK suppliers.Tesco withdrew all products supplied by Silvercrest when a survey of beefburgers by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) showed 29% horse DNA relative to beef content in one of the samples.It said in a statement quoted in Irish media that the source of horse DNA identified by the Irish government correlated with the results of its own investigations at the plant. It would give detailed consideration to all the findings, it said. The supermarket, which apologised to customers after the original contamination, had to apologise again last week when burgers that were supposed to be off the shelves were found on sale in one of its Oxford branches.Tests at the Dalepak plant near Northallerton for the UK's Food Standards Agency last week found no traces of either horse or pork DNA, found in the initial FSAI sampling. Waitrose, among the companies with burger lines made there, has decided to restock its shelves. Dalepak never suspended production during the scare.ABP, which has a food plant in Poznan, Poland, said this was not the source of the contaminated meat and none of its plants processed horsemeat. It said there would be new management at Silvercrest and the company had started a new DNA testing regime for contamination by equine and other sources in addition to legal food safety requirements.", "tags": ["Food safety", "The meat industry", "Poland", "Ireland", "Supermarkets", "Europe", "World news", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Food", "Farming", "Environment", "Retail industry", "Business", "Food & drink industry", "Meat", "UK news", "Horsemeat scandal"], "title": "Horsemeat in burgers traced to Polish suppliers"},{"date": "2013-01-12T07:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The swimming stage puts many would-be triathletes off \u2013 which is where the duathlon comes in.

The meat used in Tesco burgers found to contain up to 29% horse DNA had instead come from Poland.However, ABP Food Group, owners of the Silvercrest plant in Ireland, revealed that Tesco would continue sourcing fresh beef from other ABP companies.Tesco said the findings from its investigations concurred with those of the Irish government, and that it would now start its own system of comprehensive DNA testing.Beefburgers on sale in Spain were the latest to come under scrutiny on Wednesday, when tests commissioned by a Spanish consumer organisation found two out of 20 samples were contaminated with horse DNA. Tesco, Iceland, Lidl and Aldi were among supermarkets identified a fortnight ago as having products with equine DNA in them by Irish food safety authorities, although not all the products implicated had been on sale in Britain.Other supermarkets took their burgers off the shelves as a precaution. Tesco's supplier, Silvercrest in County Monaghan, which normally makes 200m burgers a year for different clients, was one of three food processors identified. The Silvercrest plant has been shut down for deep cleaning, the management has been changed and the Irish government is going to supervise the processor's operations indefinitely.Investigations at the only UK plant owned by ABP \u2013 Dalepak Hambleton in North Yorkshire \u2013 are continuing, although it is still in operation.Tim Smith, Tesco's technical director, said: \"We now understand \u2013 with as much certainty as possible \u2013 what happened. The evidence tells us that our frozen burger supplier, Silvercrest, used meat in our products that did not come from the list of approved suppliers we gave them.\"Nor was the meat from the UK or Ireland, despite our instruction that only beef from the UK and Ireland should be used in our frozen beefburgers. Consequently we have decided not to take products from that supplier in future.\"Smith said Tesco was ultimately responsible for the food it sold. \"We will not take anything for granted after this incident. It has shown that, in spite of our stringent tests, checks and controls there remained a small possibility that something could go wrong and it did. We want to stop it ever happening again, so we are taking action to reduce that possibility still further.\"To underpin the strong measures already in place, we will now introduce a comprehensive system of DNA testing across our meat products. This will identify any deviation from our high standards.\"ABP said it had let customers down and apologised. Paul Finnerty, the group's chief executive, said: \"We have learnt important lessons from this incident and we are determined to ensure that this never happens again.\"We have put in place new procedures to audit all our third-party suppliers. We have also established comprehensive DNA testing procedures \u2013 we will become an industry leader in this area,\" said Finnerty, adding the company would not allow the Silvercrest incident \"to overshadow what is a great business\".Poland has been named as the source country for the contamination just as the Warsaw government seeks to improve its own population's confidence and loyalty in homegrown beef. A section in the latest edition of the government newsletter Polish Food is devoted to this drive, which comes as beef production there is expected to fall substantially.In 2012 British imports of fresh and frozen beef from Poland totalled 6,200 tonnes, 3.5 times the amount imported in 2010, although this still represented less than 3% of all imports. Ireland imported just 849 tonnes last year, less than 4% of all imports.Eblex, the organisation responsible for marketing the English beef and sheep industries, says Poland lacks a specialist beef industry. Instead, young bulls are almost entirely produced from dairy calves.In a private member's debate in Westminster Hall on Wednesday, the Labour MP for Croydon North, Steve Reed, questioned whether the UK's Food Standards Agency was still fit for purpose.He said that the government had carved up its responsibilities between the environment and health departments and cut its budget, which, along with \"swingeing\" cuts to local authority budgets for trading standards, had left food safety and labelling controls fragmented.Defra minister David Heath said that although the amount of food sampling carried out by local authorities had fallen, tests were more sophisticated. He admitted the number of food safety officers had fallen by 6% between 2010 and 2012.The minister told MPs that the agency was looking in detail now at how horsemeat from the UK contaminated with the drug phenylbutazone, which is banned in the human food chain, came to be exported to and consumed in other European countries.Asked if he could reassure the public that contaminated horsemeat had not re-entered the UK food chain from Europe, he said that the department would re-examine how horse passports operated.The government has been criticised for abolishing the National Equine Database, but Heath said that was a \"red herring\", since it had never provided information on whether horses were fit for the human food chain.", "tags": ["Tesco", "Supermarkets", "Business", "Retail industry", "The meat industry", "Food", "Farming", "Environment", "UK news", "Ireland", "Europe", "World news", "Poland", "Food safety", "Food & drink", "Food & drink industry", "Meat", "Horsemeat scandal"], "title": "Tesco drops Irish supplier over horsemeat scandal"},{"date": "2013-01-28T08:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The Nam Song river near Vang Vieng in Laos has become infamous for wild, floating backpackers' parties, which have sadly resulted in accidents and deaths.

Around 579,000 Polish-born people have moved to live in the UK \u2013 all during the lifetime of today's 18-year-old university applicants.But will the increasing ties between Poles and Brits encourage more school-leavers to travel eastwards to study?Poland \u2013 hardly a top choice for international students \u2013 is currently trying to rebrand itself as Europe's new educational destination. It has long lagged behind other countries in terms of attracting students from abroad. At the moment foreign students account for only 1.39% of those attending Polish universities, with most of these students coming from Ukraine, Belarus and Norway.The number of British students enrolling at Polish universities is growing, but it remains small. In 2006-07 only 72 studied there, a figure which stood at 164 in 2010-11.Many institutions, such as Lazarski University, are making new efforts to cater to foreign students by offering degrees in English at both undergraduate and graduate level. The country's bargain courses are a major attraction for young people abroad. Juan Mart\u00edn, an Argentinian studying English at a university in Poznan tells me he came to Poland for his degree \"because it's cheap, much cheaper than in Argentina\".Mart\u00edn has a point. While students at English universities will fork out \u00a39k for a year's study, an entire degree at a Polish university could cost as little as \u00a33,017.I go to a private university, which costs me \u00a31,000 a year for tuition. However, all good students, including those from abroad, can get a scholarship. Last year I was awarded a \u00a32,000 bursary, which covered the tuition fee twice over.Living costs are also significantly lower. The University of Edinburgh calculates that the average UK student will need \u00a3150 per week for living expenses \u2013 this includes food, accommodation and essentials, such as bus fare, but not entertainment. This is equivalent to around 750 Polish zlotys: enough to cover a month's rent for a lavish en-suite room in a hall of residence.But what is student life like in Poland? In the UK students live on or near campus, they get involved in the students' union, they join societies and do regular sports. Student life in Poland focuses on learning. All students have a full timetable, attending classes for their subject specialisation, seminars provided by other subjects in the faculty and lectures on general education \u2013 a bit like in America. All the grades count, so students study very hard.Most Polish universities don't have a students' union with bars and clubs, so student-only nights are run during the week by the city's clubs.When the country joined the EU in 2004 it was reported to have been hit by a brain drain, with many young people moving abroad.

In return for a modest monthly salary of around 4,000 zloty (\u00a3800) \u2013 around 25% above the average Polish wage \u2013 she now produces a set number of works for them each month.\"More than two decades after the end of communism, we're still not very good at promotion of artists, and the art gallery scene can be very brutal,\" said Szprynger. \"But now I've not only got someone promoting me but I'm freed up to concentrate exclusively on my art, while they place me fairly and squarely in the art market and for the first time I can imagine a future for myself as an artist.\"Szprynger's obvious hope is that at the end of her five-year contract, prices for her works will have retained their value or that she can at the very least continue to make a respectable living from her art.She refers to what is known in Polish art circles as \"Efekt Sasnal\" \u2013 referring to the painter Wilhelm Sasnal, currently the most expensive living Polish artist, whose works typically sell for several hundred thousand dollars at international auction, who rose to prominence after being \"discovered\" by Saatchi. The 2009 Turbine Hall debut of the Warsaw-born sculptor Miroslaw Balka also serves as huge inspiration, and prompted interest in Polish art to soar, she added.But some on the Polish art scene have accused Abbey House of skewing the market by hiking prices to unrealistic levels, and talk of a bubble that will ultimately burst, damaging the artists. The auction house insists it is quite simply patronising a worthy set of young creatives and shaping a market for them that has barely existed until now, but is steadily on the rise.\"It's important for artists to at least have the chance to make a living from their art, rather than seeing something go at auction for a trifle,\" said Jakub Kokoszka, one of the founders of Abbey House. \"Until now too few have had that opportunity.\" The result is that many artists have left Poland.He points to the numbers of Poles increasingly keen to leave an inheritance for their children \"after years under communism when you were lucky if you ended up with a silver sugar bowl or a wardrobe\", who are taking a keen interest in art, as well as the strong sense of patriotism that is driving growing numbers to take a closer look at modern Polish artists.The 2013 report on art and finance by the professional service firm Deloitte dedicated an entire section to the Polish art market, with its analysts suggesting that increasingly affluent Poles were slowly returning to the prewar tradition of art collecting.Skate's, a New-York-based arts market research company, recently estimated that the country's \"innovative and quickly growing art market\" is now worth an annual $100m (\u00a366m).\"The problem has been that Poles, still enjoying the relatively newfound fruits of capitalism, have preferred to buy a car, or a second car, or a watch, than a piece of art, but that's now slowly changing,\" said Boguslav Deptula, a leading Polish art critic and the co-curator of the Polish Art Now exhibition at Saatchi. \"They realise you can buy a nice drawing to put on your wall for the same price you might pay for a pair of fancy shoes.\"According to Julia Michalska, editor at the Art Newspaper, Poland's expanding commercial gallery scene in cities such as Warsaw, Lodz, Krakow and Poznan is \"catering to the country's substantial middle-class collector base\" that has come out of the recession relatively unscathed.\"As the local art market grows, more artists are staying in Poland, which means that more profits will remain in the country, though artist flight is still a major problem,\" she said.Unfavourable conditions for artists, apart from the hitherto low art prices, include hard-to-obtain studio space and high rents. That in turn, though, has given the gallery scene what Michalska described as a \"very urban feel\", with galleries forced to look for creative solutions and locating themselves in old communist high-rise blocks, in factories, hotel rooms, even fire stations.And, say culture buffs, the artistic renaissance, thanks in large part to the country's flourishing economy, has led to a cultural renaissance on many other levels. They point to projects in Warsaw by star architects such as Daniel Libeskind, Zaha Hadid and Norman Foster, two recent major exhibitions of JMW Turner and Andy Warhol which attracted a huge audience, as well as the newly opened expansion of a wing of 20th- and 21st-century Polish art at the National Museum's Gallery of Modern Art.Back in Szprynger's spacious flat with its majestic views over Warsaw, she and several of her young artist colleagues who will exhibit with her at the Saatchi sum up their sense of both fortune and fear.\"The Polish art world is very hermetic but my hope is as the market expands as more people become interested in art it will become a more open place,\" said Maciej Wieczerzak, 27, who gave up his day job at an advertising agency to concentrate on his Goya-inspired graphic art which he paints in his studio in a former beauty salon in the town of Mielec, 186 miles south of Warsaw. His works have so far earned up to \u00a36,000, his biggest patron being a Warsaw businesswoman.But the backlash had already begun. Agata Kleczkowska, 25, a recent graduate of Warsaw's Academy of Arts who has drawn attention for her magic-realism-inspired figurative animal portraits which deliberately teeter on the edge of kitsch, said she was horrified by the hype that followed when recently a German businessman bought her portrait of a howling reindeer against a psychedelic background for 160,000 zloty (\u00a332,000), a staggering price by Polish standards.\"It was a very scary moment. I was quite happy to withdraw into my small flat with my dogs, while all around me critics were saying: 'That's too much, she's too young.' Hardly anyone said: 'Maybe it was worth it if someone's willing to pay that,'\" she said. \"I noticed then how much envy there is in the art world and what a harsh place it can be.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Art", "Europe", "World news", "Art and design", "Culture"], "title": "Poland enjoys artistic renaissance 24 years after communism"},{"date": "2013-04-02T09:37:52Z", "country": "poland", "content": "From its gingerbread treats to restaurants and pubs, Polish culture has become a part of British life.

Around 579,000 Polish-born people have moved to live in the UK \u2013 all during the lifetime of today's 18-year-old university applicants.But will the increasing ties between Poles and Brits encourage more school-leavers to travel eastwards to study?Poland \u2013 hardly a top choice for international students \u2013 is currently trying to rebrand itself as Europe's new educational destination. It has long lagged behind other countries in terms of attracting students from abroad. At the moment foreign students account for only 1.39% of those attending Polish universities, with most of these students coming from Ukraine, Belarus and Norway.The number of British students enrolling at Polish universities is growing, but it remains small. In 2006-07 only 72 studied there, a figure which stood at 164 in 2010-11.Many institutions, such as Lazarski University, are making new efforts to cater to foreign students by offering degrees in English at both undergraduate and graduate level. The country's bargain courses are a major attraction for young people abroad. Juan Mart\u00edn, an Argentinian studying English at a university in Poznan tells me he came to Poland for his degree \"because it's cheap, much cheaper than in Argentina\".Mart\u00edn has a point. While students at English universities will fork out \u00a39k for a year's study, an entire degree at a Polish university could cost as little as \u00a33,017.I go to a private university, which costs me \u00a31,000 a year for tuition. However, all good students, including those from abroad, can get a scholarship. Last year I was awarded a \u00a32,000 bursary, which covered the tuition fee twice over.Living costs are also significantly lower. The University of Edinburgh calculates that the average UK student will need \u00a3150 per week for living expenses \u2013 this includes food, accommodation and essentials, such as bus fare, but not entertainment. This is equivalent to around 750 Polish zlotys: enough to cover a month's rent for a lavish en-suite room in a hall of residence.But what is student life like in Poland? In the UK students live on or near campus, they get involved in the students' union, they join societies and do regular sports. Student life in Poland focuses on learning. All students have a full timetable, attending classes for their subject specialisation, seminars provided by other subjects in the faculty and lectures on general education \u2013 a bit like in America. All the grades count, so students study very hard.Most Polish universities don't have a students' union with bars and clubs, so student-only nights are run during the week by the city's clubs.When the country joined the EU in 2004 it was reported to have been hit by a brain drain, with many young people moving abroad. While it is true many young people did move abroad \u2013 more than half of those who left were aged between 24 and 35 \u2013 many highly-qualified people remain. Poland has no shortage of doctors and engineers. Higher education is highly valued in Poland and around 80% of graduates go on to study to master's level.Poland is also fast-emerging as the Silicon Valley of central Europe. Companies such as Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, IBM, Motorola, Siemens have chosen to open offices there.Even during the short amount of time I have known Poland, I've watched it modernise and develop vibrant cities. Perhaps it is only a matter of time before it becomes a first choice for Brits studying abroad.\u2022 This article was amended on 2 April 2013.

Taking place in the picturesque southern Polish city of Krakow, the festival is staged in former palaces \u2013 such as the Pod Baranami cinema and Kino ARS just off the main square \u2013 and, to a lesser extent, at all seven of the city's other art-house cinemas. This year's festival will also offer rooftop screenings, \"for those who like extreme sports\", according to the artistic director. By attracting more sponsors and by vastly improving organisation and publicity, Off Plus Camera has developed rapidly under the auspices of festival director, Szymon Miszczak; artistic director, Ania Trzebiatowska (who formerly worked on BBC's Arena); and Poland's brilliant young film-critic, Micha\u0142 Oleszczyk.This year's sixth festival promises to be the best yet, with more than 100 films, 300 screenings and 200 festival guests. Categories include Black American Cinema (from Shaft to Jackie Brown), New Italian Cinema (Bellocchio's Dormant Beauty stars), Polish feature films and shorts, Faces of Crisis (including Ektoras Lygizos' Boy Eating the Bird's Food) and Dark Stars Rising (Andy Warhol's Dracula and William Lustig's Maniac, among them). Above all, 12 directors \u2013 including Shane Carruth with Upstream Color, Daniel Hoesl with Soldate Jeannette, and Michael Noer with Northwest \u2013 will be competing for the international dramatic competition Making Way with a $100,000 (\u00a365,000) prize.

In return for a modest monthly salary of around 4,000 zloty (\u00a3800) \u2013 around 25% above the average Polish wage \u2013 she now produces a set number of works for them each month.\"More than two decades after the end of communism, we're still not very good at promotion of artists, and the art gallery scene can be very brutal,\" said Szprynger. \"But now I've not only got someone promoting me but I'm freed up to concentrate exclusively on my art, while they place me fairly and squarely in the art market and for the first time I can imagine a future for myself as an artist.\"Szprynger's obvious hope is that at the end of her five-year contract, prices for her works will have retained their value or that she can at the very least continue to make a respectable living from her art.She refers to what is known in Polish art circles as \"Efekt Sasnal\" \u2013 referring to the painter Wilhelm Sasnal, currently the most expensive living Polish artist, whose works typically sell for several hundred thousand dollars at international auction, who rose to prominence after being \"discovered\" by Saatchi. The 2009 Turbine Hall debut of the Warsaw-born sculptor Miroslaw Balka also serves as huge inspiration, and prompted interest in Polish art to soar, she added.But some on the Polish art scene have accused Abbey House of skewing the market by hiking prices to unrealistic levels, and talk of a bubble that will ultimately burst, damaging the artists. The auction house insists it is quite simply patronising a worthy set of young creatives and shaping a market for them that has barely existed until now, but is steadily on the rise.\"It's important for artists to at least have the chance to make a living from their art, rather than seeing something go at auction for a trifle,\" said Jakub Kokoszka, one of the founders of Abbey House. \"Until now too few have had that opportunity.\" The result is that many artists have left Poland.He points to the numbers of Poles increasingly keen to leave an inheritance for their children \"after years under communism when you were lucky if you ended up with a silver sugar bowl or a wardrobe\", who are taking a keen interest in art, as well as the strong sense of patriotism that is driving growing numbers to take a closer look at modern Polish artists.The 2013 report on art and finance by the professional service firm Deloitte dedicated an entire section to the Polish art market, with its analysts suggesting that increasingly affluent Poles were slowly returning to the prewar tradition of art collecting.Skate's, a New-York-based arts market research company, recently estimated that the country's \"innovative and quickly growing art market\" is now worth an annual $100m (\u00a366m).\"The problem has been that Poles, still enjoying the relatively newfound fruits of capitalism, have preferred to buy a car, or a second car, or a watch, than a piece of art, but that's now slowly changing,\" said Boguslav Deptula, a leading Polish art critic and the co-curator of the Polish Art Now exhibition at Saatchi. \"They realise you can buy a nice drawing to put on your wall for the same price you might pay for a pair of fancy shoes.\"According to Julia Michalska, editor at the Art Newspaper, Poland's expanding commercial gallery scene in cities such as Warsaw, Lodz, Krakow and Poznan is \"catering to the country's substantial middle-class collector base\" that has come out of the recession relatively unscathed.\"As the local art market grows, more artists are staying in Poland, which means that more profits will remain in the country, though artist flight is still a major problem,\" she said.Unfavourable conditions for artists, apart from the hitherto low art prices, include hard-to-obtain studio space and high rents. That in turn, though, has given the gallery scene what Michalska described as a \"very urban feel\", with galleries forced to look for creative solutions and locating themselves in old communist high-rise blocks, in factories, hotel rooms, even fire stations.And, say culture buffs, the artistic renaissance, thanks in large part to the country's flourishing economy, has led to a cultural renaissance on many other levels. They point to projects in Warsaw by star architects such as Daniel Libeskind, Zaha Hadid and Norman Foster, two recent major exhibitions of JMW Turner and Andy Warhol which attracted a huge audience, as well as the newly opened expansion of a wing of 20th- and 21st-century Polish art at the National Museum's Gallery of Modern Art.Back in Szprynger's spacious flat with its majestic views over Warsaw, she and several of her young artist colleagues who will exhibit with her at the Saatchi sum up their sense of both fortune and fear.\"The Polish art world is very hermetic but my hope is as the market expands as more people become interested in art it will become a more open place,\" said Maciej Wieczerzak, 27, who gave up his day job at an advertising agency to concentrate on his Goya-inspired graphic art which he paints in his studio in a former beauty salon in the town of Mielec, 186 miles south of Warsaw. His works have so far earned up to \u00a36,000, his biggest patron being a Warsaw businesswoman.But the backlash had already begun. Agata Kleczkowska, 25, a recent graduate of Warsaw's Academy of Arts who has drawn attention for her magic-realism-inspired figurative animal portraits which deliberately teeter on the edge of kitsch, said she was horrified by the hype that followed when recently a German businessman bought her portrait of a howling reindeer against a psychedelic background for 160,000 zloty (\u00a332,000), a staggering price by Polish standards.\"It was a very scary moment. I was quite happy to withdraw into my small flat with my dogs, while all around me critics were saying: 'That's too much, she's too young.' Hardly anyone said: 'Maybe it was worth it if someone's willing to pay that,'\" she said. \"I noticed then how much envy there is in the art world and what a harsh place it can be.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Art", "Europe", "World news", "Art and design", "Culture"], "title": "Poland enjoys artistic renaissance 24 years after communism"},{"date": "2013-04-28T18:30:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "I once had a Polish friend who turned down my offer of a limited-edition, orange-flavoured Kit Kat on the grounds that it was \"far too communist\".Pressed further, he explained that the only (cheap, low-quality) chocolate available to him as a child had its taste masked by orange flavouring.

She introduced the nursery to eTwinning in 2011 when she started an online partnership with a school in Olsztyn, Poland. The Once Upon A Time project involved the two schools sharing six stories and related activities using the British Council's TwinSpace technology. The project won an eTwinning National Award and was runner up at the European awards in 2012. Here, she explains how it was done.How did you hear about eTwinning?From my sister. She's a teacher in Poland with a class of four-year-old children and she called me and asked if we could do a project together. I agreed and suggested that we did something around story telling.How did the project work?We chose six stories. Three were classics \u2013 Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella and Goldilocks \u2013 which both schools worked on, and each school chose three more (different) stories. So each story became our topic for the week. All activities that week were related to the story.So for Cinderella we talked about time, the children made clocks. We looked at shoes, different sizes of shoes, different kinds of shoes. For mark-making we made invitations for the ball and went to the post office to post the invitations. The children made biscuits for the ball, and got dressed up for a party. All areas of our early years curriculum were covered.And how did you connect with the Polish school?We used TwinSpace, which I didn't find easy to start with, but I got lots of help from the eTwinning National Support Service and so I learned how to upload presentations, pictures, and video clips. I also kept a blog to share what we had done that day, what was difficult and what was easy, what we could have done differently. At the end of the project we met using Skype. That was the biggest fun as the children were waving and shouting hello. We got the children to learn a few words of Polish \u2013 animal names \u2013 and the Polish children learned a few words of English.What skills did the project help the children to learn?When we assessed the children at the end of term we found that in the area of communication, language and literacy all pupils except one had achieved above the expected level.And what about the staff?We learned how important communication is at story time. We made it quality time and gave the children more space to process the information that we were giving them, and more time to be able to answer our questions.What about your own professional development?I've learned so much and am now passing it on to others. Because we were nominated for a European eTwinning Award I went to Berlin where I was offered the role of eTwinning ambassador. This means I share my experience and knowledge with other teachers. I know that teachers are a bit afraid of projects like eTwinning as they think it means extra work, but I found it helped me focus and made lesson planning much easier.Content on this page was provided by the British Council and eTwinning \u2013 supporters of the Guardian Teacher Network's Language learning \u2013 in focus week.", "tags": ["British Council partner zone", "Teacher Network"], "title": "How I started an online partnership with a school in Poland"},{"date": "2013-04-02T09:37:52Z", "country": "poland", "content": "From its gingerbread treats to restaurants and pubs, Polish culture has become a part of British life.

They point to projects in Warsaw by star architects such as Daniel Libeskind, Zaha Hadid and Norman Foster, two recent major exhibitions of JMW Turner and Andy Warhol which attracted a huge audience, as well as the newly opened expansion of a wing of 20th- and 21st-century Polish art at the National Museum's Gallery of Modern Art.Back in Szprynger's spacious flat with its majestic views over Warsaw, she and several of her young artist colleagues who will exhibit with her at the Saatchi sum up their sense of both fortune and fear.\"The Polish art world is very hermetic but my hope is as the market expands as more people become interested in art it will become a more open place,\" said Maciej Wieczerzak, 27, who gave up his day job at an advertising agency to concentrate on his Goya-inspired graphic art which he paints in his studio in a former beauty salon in the town of Mielec, 186 miles south of Warsaw.

She's a teacher in Poland with a class of four-year-old children and she called me and asked if we could do a project together. I agreed and suggested that we did something around story telling.How did the project work?We chose six stories. Three were classics \u2013 Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella and Goldilocks \u2013 which both schools worked on, and each school chose three more (different) stories. So each story became our topic for the week. All activities that week were related to the story.So for Cinderella we talked about time, the children made clocks. We looked at shoes, different sizes of shoes, different kinds of shoes. For mark-making we made invitations for the ball and went to the post office to post the invitations. The children made biscuits for the ball, and got dressed up for a party. All areas of our early years curriculum were covered.And how did you connect with the Polish school?We used TwinSpace, which I didn't find easy to start with, but I got lots of help from the eTwinning National Support Service and so I learned how to upload presentations, pictures, and video clips. I also kept a blog to share what we had done that day, what was difficult and what was easy, what we could have done differently. At the end of the project we met using Skype. That was the biggest fun as the children were waving and shouting hello. We got the children to learn a few words of Polish \u2013 animal names \u2013 and the Polish children learned a few words of English.What skills did the project help the children to learn?When we assessed the children at the end of term we found that in the area of communication, language and literacy all pupils except one had achieved above the expected level.And what about the staff?We learned how important communication is at story time. We made it quality time and gave the children more space to process the information that we were giving them, and more time to be able to answer our questions.What about your own professional development?I've learned so much and am now passing it on to others.

Around 579,000 Polish-born people have moved to live in the UK \u2013 all during the lifetime of today's 18-year-old university applicants.But will the increasing ties between Poles and Brits encourage more school-leavers to travel eastwards to study?Poland \u2013 hardly a top choice for international students \u2013 is currently trying to rebrand itself as Europe's new educational destination. It has long lagged behind other countries in terms of attracting students from abroad. At the moment foreign students account for only 1.39% of those attending Polish universities, with most of these students coming from Ukraine, Belarus and Norway.The number of British students enrolling at Polish universities is growing, but it remains small. In 2006-07 only 72 studied there, a figure which stood at 164 in 2010-11.Many institutions, such as Lazarski University, are making new efforts to cater to foreign students by offering degrees in English at both undergraduate and graduate level. The country's bargain courses are a major attraction for young people abroad. Juan Mart\u00edn, an Argentinian studying English at a university in Poznan tells me he came to Poland for his degree \"because it's cheap, much cheaper than in Argentina\".Mart\u00edn has a point. While students at English universities will fork out \u00a39k for a year's study, an entire degree at a Polish university could cost as little as \u00a33,017.I go to a private university, which costs me \u00a31,000 a year for tuition. However, all good students, including those from abroad, can get a scholarship. Last year I was awarded a \u00a32,000 bursary, which covered the tuition fee twice over.Living costs are also significantly lower. The University of Edinburgh calculates that the average UK student will need \u00a3150 per week for living expenses \u2013 this includes food, accommodation and essentials, such as bus fare, but not entertainment. This is equivalent to around 750 Polish zlotys: enough to cover a month's rent for a lavish en-suite room in a hall of residence.But what is student life like in Poland? In the UK students live on or near campus, they get involved in the students' union, they join societies and do regular sports. Student life in Poland focuses on learning. All students have a full timetable, attending classes for their subject specialisation, seminars provided by other subjects in the faculty and lectures on general education \u2013 a bit like in America. All the grades count, so students study very hard.Most Polish universities don't have a students' union with bars and clubs, so student-only nights are run during the week by the city's clubs.When the country joined the EU in 2004 it was reported to have been hit by a brain drain, with many young people moving abroad. While it is true many young people did move abroad \u2013 more than half of those who left were aged between 24 and 35 \u2013 many highly-qualified people remain. Poland has no shortage of doctors and engineers. Higher education is highly valued in Poland and around 80% of graduates go on to study to master's level.Poland is also fast-emerging as the Silicon Valley of central Europe. Companies such as Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, IBM, Motorola, Siemens have chosen to open offices there.Even during the short amount of time I have known Poland, I've watched it modernise and develop vibrant cities. Perhaps it is only a matter of time before it becomes a first choice for Brits studying abroad.\u2022 This article was amended on 2 April 2013.

Taking place in the picturesque southern Polish city of Krakow, the festival is staged in former palaces \u2013 such as the Pod Baranami cinema and Kino ARS just off the main square \u2013 and, to a lesser extent, at all seven of the city's other art-house cinemas. This year's festival will also offer rooftop screenings, \"for those who like extreme sports\", according to the artistic director. By attracting more sponsors and by vastly improving organisation and publicity, Off Plus Camera has developed rapidly under the auspices of festival director, Szymon Miszczak; artistic director, Ania Trzebiatowska (who formerly worked on BBC's Arena); and Poland's brilliant young film-critic, Micha\u0142 Oleszczyk.This year's sixth festival promises to be the best yet, with more than 100 films, 300 screenings and 200 festival guests. Categories include Black American Cinema (from Shaft to Jackie Brown), New Italian Cinema (Bellocchio's Dormant Beauty stars), Polish feature films and shorts, Faces of Crisis (including Ektoras Lygizos' Boy Eating the Bird's Food) and Dark Stars Rising (Andy Warhol's Dracula and William Lustig's Maniac, among them). Above all, 12 directors \u2013 including Shane Carruth with Upstream Color, Daniel Hoesl with Soldate Jeannette, and Michael Noer with Northwest \u2013 will be competing for the international dramatic competition Making Way with a $100,000 (\u00a365,000) prize. The four-person jury includes the UK's John Rhys-Davies and Ruth Meyers, and is chaired by one of Poland's leading directors, Lech Majewski. A panel of international critics will select their favourite film, while a new Off CameraPro Industry section will offer 12 workshops run by industry professionals, and aimed at directors, producers and distributors. Melissa Leo will accept the special Against the Current award.Throw in well-attended nightly parties at lovely venues, a lavish closing gala and buffet, a special guest in the guise of actor and film-maker Josh Hartnett, not to mention the opportunity of wandering around this beautiful city between screenings, and you'll begin to see why Off Plus Camera is set to become an unmissable event on the European festival circuit.", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Poland holidays"], "title": "Festival radar: Off Plus Camera, Krakow, Poland"},{"date": "2013-06-02T13:06:05Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Tending the plants on the rooftop terrace garden of her studio in a former army housing block in central Warsaw, Anna Szprynger is taking a well-earned a break from her meticulous line drawings.Despite critical acclaim, the artist made paltry sums for the first few years of her career, able to survive only thanks to money scraped together by her father.\"The trouble is after so many years of dictatorship that there is no tradition of an art market in Poland,\" said the 30-year-old. \"People respect you if you're an artist, but they expect you to lead the existence of a starving pauper and they don't tend to buy the art.\"But now international art critics are increasingly turning their attention to Poland, and talking about Warsaw as the new artistic hub of central Europe with the enthusiasm and excitement once reserved solely for Berlin.Recently one of Szprynger's geometric line drawings sold for 30,000 zloty (\u00a36,000), to the CEO of a Polish construction company, a sum she admitted finding \"embarrassingly high\" and a markup of around 75 times what her works were selling for just a couple of years ago.The auction house that sold the work, Abbey House, puts the price hike down to the fact that the art market is now growing at around 20-30% a year, as disposable income rises and the hunger for Polish art is expanding.On Monday, Szprynger will experience another milestone in her nascent career when her art goes on show at the Saatchi Gallery in London along with that of 14 other Polish artists.Seven of them, including Szprynger, represent a new wave of young Polish artists making their mark on the country's modern art scene which, while having been free from the shackles of communism for the past 24 years, has nevertheless until now been sorely constrained by Poland's lack of a mature art market.Szprynger found herself thrust into the limelight after Abbey House, a fine art auctioneer startup in Warsaw, took her under its wing in 2010. In return for a modest monthly salary of around 4,000 zloty (\u00a3800) \u2013 around 25% above the average Polish wage \u2013 she now produces a set number of works for them each month.\"More than two decades after the end of communism, we're still not very good at promotion of artists, and the art gallery scene can be very brutal,\" said Szprynger. \"But now I've not only got someone promoting me but I'm freed up to concentrate exclusively on my art, while they place me fairly and squarely in the art market and for the first time I can imagine a future for myself as an artist.\"Szprynger's obvious hope is that at the end of her five-year contract, prices for her works will have retained their value or that she can at the very least continue to make a respectable living from her art.She refers to what is known in Polish art circles as \"Efekt Sasnal\" \u2013 referring to the painter Wilhelm Sasnal, currently the most expensive living Polish artist, whose works typically sell for several hundred thousand dollars at international auction, who rose to prominence after being \"discovered\" by Saatchi. The 2009 Turbine Hall debut of the Warsaw-born sculptor Miroslaw Balka also serves as huge inspiration, and prompted interest in Polish art to soar, she added.But some on the Polish art scene have accused Abbey House of skewing the market by hiking prices to unrealistic levels, and talk of a bubble that will ultimately burst, damaging the artists. The auction house insists it is quite simply patronising a worthy set of young creatives and shaping a market for them that has barely existed until now, but is steadily on the rise.\"It's important for artists to at least have the chance to make a living from their art, rather than seeing something go at auction for a trifle,\" said Jakub Kokoszka, one of the founders of Abbey House. \"Until now too few have had that opportunity.\" The result is that many artists have left Poland.He points to the numbers of Poles increasingly keen to leave an inheritance for their children \"after years under communism when you were lucky if you ended up with a silver sugar bowl or a wardrobe\", who are taking a keen interest in art, as well as the strong sense of patriotism that is driving growing numbers to take a closer look at modern Polish artists.The 2013 report on art and finance by the professional service firm Deloitte dedicated an entire section to the Polish art market, with its analysts suggesting that increasingly affluent Poles were slowly returning to the prewar tradition of art collecting.Skate's, a New-York-based arts market research company, recently estimated that the country's \"innovative and quickly growing art market\" is now worth an annual $100m (\u00a366m).\"The problem has been that Poles, still enjoying the relatively newfound fruits of capitalism, have preferred to buy a car, or a second car, or a watch, than a piece of art, but that's now slowly changing,\" said Boguslav Deptula, a leading Polish art critic and the co-curator of the Polish Art Now exhibition at Saatchi. \"They realise you can buy a nice drawing to put on your wall for the same price you might pay for a pair of fancy shoes.\"According to Julia Michalska, editor at the Art Newspaper, Poland's expanding commercial gallery scene in cities such as Warsaw, Lodz, Krakow and Poznan is \"catering to the country's substantial middle-class collector base\" that has come out of the recession relatively unscathed.\"As the local art market grows, more artists are staying in Poland, which means that more profits will remain in the country, though artist flight is still a major problem,\" she said.Unfavourable conditions for artists, apart from the hitherto low art prices, include hard-to-obtain studio space and high rents.

She wanted cosmetic surgery to make her feel normal.She had been 22 stone (140kg) and morbidly obese, and lost about half her bodyweight after stomach stapling, dropping from a dress size 28 to 14. But it was no longer just her clothes that did not fit, it was also her skin.\"It was like wearing a sumo wrestler suit,\" she said. \"I felt like an old woman. It doesn't do your confidence any good at all.\"Laura, 37, (not her real name) did not think it was appropriate to approach the NHS, so she turned to the internet, looking for clinics that would offer her a tummy tuck.She browsed websites and chatted to people on Facebook. She decided to go to Wroclaw in Poland for the operation.Laura is one of the growing band of cosmetic surgery tourists who fly to cities served by cheap airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair for operations at hospitals and clinics.They go to the Czech Republic and Tunisia, as well as Poland, paying about half the price they would have paid for private surgery in the UK, with flights and accommodation included.Research from Leeds University, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and due to be released next week, offers insights into cosmetic surgery tourism. Professor Ruth Holliday and her team expected to find disaster stories and admit they were surprised.Most of the patients they spoke to were satisfied with their surgery because they had changed something about their appearance that had troubled them for years.And they were administrators, nurses, hotel porters, hairdressers, students, police officers and teachers on modest incomes.\"I'm not trying to be some kind of supermodel. I'm just trying to feel normal, able to wear swimming costumes without people staring at my legs,\" said Laura, who has five children and works in the care industry.She has since had further surgery: a breast uplift and liposuction on her thighs.Even those enhancing their looks rather than undergoing \"repair work\", as Laura described it, had a rationale beyond vanity, said Holliday.\"For the young, white, working-class woman, getting a boob job is a way of gaining status for people who don't have any status,\" she said.\"They are trying to add value to their body. It is quite marketable in a way if you are a receptionist or selling coffee to the public.\"Most in her study said they just wanted to look normal and had spent five to 10 years thinking about getting surgery, and researching where to go. But it can still be a shock: one patient who travelled for surgery to Tunisia lay awake all night in terror.\"I only slept one night, because of the morphine and because of the anaesthetic, and I was hallucinating as well.\"And I was so uptight and paranoid about the cleanliness, and because I was so hungry, all I thought was: 'Oh my god, if I don't die of starvation in Tunisia, I am going to die of an infection,'\" the patient told the team.\"I didn't eat, I didn't sleep, I had one eye open every minute. I had had a lot of drugs, I had had a lot of surgery, but I would definitely go back \u2026 because I know the surgeon. I wouldn't want to risk a different surgeon.\"Surgery tourists go to the Czech Republic for weight loss treatment (because the NHS queues are too long), to Belgium for breast augmentation, to Poland for tummy tucks and to Budapest for teeth, Holliday's team found. And they make their choice often by word of mouth.\"Surgeons want you to choose them according to their academic credentials and qualifications, but these things are not comprehensible to most patients,\" said Holliday.\"They choose them in the same way that you choose a tradesman like a plasterer \u2013 on the recommendation of their friends.\"Internet forums and Facebook groups are crucial to this process. Would-be patients browse before and after pictures from those who have made the trip and discuss the merits of different surgeons.Agents, often former patients themselves, book flights, accommodation and surgeons and guide people through the process.Angela Chouaib set up her agency, Secret Surgery, after her own experience. Like Laura, she lost 10 stone following bariatric surgery and found herself living in \"a deflated fat suit\".\"You lose your body confidence. You can't exercise again. Your relationship and work are suffering,\" she said. The wait for NHS surgery to remove the excess skin was two years.Chouaib has travelled and worked abroad. Her last job was in the City in \"a very senior level environmental consultancy\". She did extensive research before electing to go to Poland, including checking qualifications, accreditation and what Polish people had said about the hospital she chose.Now she helps other people choose their surgeon and book the trip. \"I can work with any surgeon I want to,\" she said.\"I don't work on a retainer basis. The client pays me the booking fee. I arrange it all for them like a travel agent would, booking the consultation and surgery date.\"Some have considered UK clinics first and are put off by the price. Some said they were treated \"like a walking chequebook\", the research found.Chouaib said that in countries outside the EU, \"there is a higher level of surgeon and better hospitals than you could afford in the UK\".Yet things do go wrong. Of the 103 patients who gave detailed accounts of their experiences to Holliday's team \u2013 who also interviewed surgeons, agents and others involved \u2013 16.5% said they experienced complications and 8.7% needed further treatment, such as for infections, when they got home. There is little scope for legal redress for those who travel abroad.\"These patients make their journeys because they are deeply unhappy with a body part they feel needs to be corrected and because they cannot afford surgery at home,\" said Holliday.\"If their surgery goes wrong or they have a bad experience in their destination, they are blamed for making a poor choice and become an 'unacceptable burden' on the NHS.\"In other words the responsibility for the risks involved are transferred on to patients. While their surgical journeys are often later reimagined as 'adventures', and surgical outcomes are experienced positively, most people would probably choose to avoid these adventures by staying at home for their healthcare and being cared for by experts whose interest is only medical and not financial.\"", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Health", "Society", "UK news", "Cosmetic surgery"], "title": "Cosmetic surgery tourism on rise as satisfied customers spread the word"},{"date": "2013-09-13T14:13:55Z", "country": "poland", "content": "On 11 September an \"autumn of discontent\" started in Poland.

As parliamentary elections loom ever closer, PiS are declaring social policies which are in direct opposition to those of the government. During a recent economic forum in Krynica, Kaczynski declared that a future PiS government would prioritise the raising of taxes on employers and would raise the minimum wage.All of the liberal press in Poland, from Wyborcza to the English-language Warsaw Voice, reacted critically to this, as if it were a subversive coup. \"Kaczynski offends businessmen\" was the headline of one of the articles, complaining that he behaved like a guest at a party criticising the culinary tastes of the hosts.

When four skeletons were found with their skulls placed between their legs, speculation followed that these were suspected vampires that had been prevented from rising from the grave through the once-ritualistic local practice of decapitation.\"It's very difficult to tell when these burials were carried out,\" Dr Jacek Pierzak, the lead archaeologist, told the Dziennik Zachodni newspaper. Early indications, he said, suggested the grave could be dated to the 16th century. Other clues possibly suggesting a vampire burial included the skeleton's lack of any personal items, such as jewellery. Meanwhile, other local newspaper reports noted that an alternative theory suggested they were not vampires, but victims of an execution at a known nearby gallows.Whatever the truth \u2013 the Guardian adopts a firmly sceptical position on the undead \u2013 the discovery of so-called vampire graves is not uncommon across eastern Europe. Last year, archaeologists in Bulgaria found two medieval skeletons with iron rods driven through their chest. According to Bozhidar Dimitrov, who runs the National History Museum in Sofia, about 100 such skeletons have been uncovered in Bulgaria, with the gruesome practice known across the Balkans, where fear of vampires has been at its strongest over the centuries.The root of the vampire legend goes right back to ancient Egypt and Greece, says Dr Tim Beasley-Murray, a senior lecturer at UCL's School of Slavonic and East European studies who teaches on a course entitled Vampires, Society and Culture: Transylvania and Beyond. The myth, he says, then spread up through the Balkans into eastern Europe where it proved fertile during the pre-Christian era: \"There is a strong Slavic belief in spirits. Romanian folklore has vampiric figures such as the moroi and strigoi. The word 'mora' means nightmare. But these are common to many cultures. We often see bird- or owl-like figures that swoop down and feed on you.\"But beyond the specific dread of vampires, there has long been a fear of the dead rising up to terrorise the living. In 2008, archaeologists found a 4,000-year-old grave in Mikulovice in the Czech Republic in which the skeleton had been weighed down at the head and the chest by two large stones. \"Remains treated in this way are now considered as vampiric,\" Radko Sedlacek, the director of the East Bohemia Museum, told reporters at the time. \"The dead man's contemporaries were afraid that he might leave his grave and return to the world.\"", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Archaeology", "Science"], "title": "What is the meaning of the 'vampire graves' unearthed in Poland?"},{"date": "2013-12-03T13:15:53Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Lawyers for two men subject to extraordinary rendition by the CIA told the European court of human rights (ECHR) on Tuesday that Poland, which permitted a secret \"black\" site to operate on its territory, should be held responsible for their torture.The two-day hearing at Strasbourg was the first time a European country has been taken to court for allowing US agencies to carry out \"enhanced\" interrogation and \"waterboarding\" programmes.

China, India, Venezuela and others are also accused of reneging on commitments made over the past two years to set out a plan for a new global deal that would be signed at a conference in Paris in late 2015.The row threatens to derail the long-running process towards a new global deal. At stake is whether the Warsaw talks end with a clear timetable for countries to set out their emissions reduction targets before the crunch meeting in Paris. Those targets need to be defined by each country in time for them to be assessed by the other participants, and to ensure they are ambitious enough.At the back of delegates' minds is the lesson of disastrous Copenhagen talks in 2009, when many of the crucial negotiations over targets, financing for poor countries and other crucial points were settled late, leaving too little negotiating time to forge a treaty. If the national targets are not set in good time, Paris could be yet another failure in the 20-year process, and the future of the UN talks would be in doubt.\"Without a timetable set out, we have no leverage to make sure that countries have to come together to work on this before Paris,\" said one high-level EU official.Ed Davey, the energy secretary, likened it to revising for an exam. \"When I was a student preparing for my GCSEs, I started well before the exams - you need to do the homework. And we need a process where that homework can be marked.\"Ruth Davis, political director at Greenpeace, said the point was critical: \"'Many governments have signalled their willingness to table new targets in 2014, as well as make contributions to the Green Climate Fund.

This part of Poland is famously unhurried, and full of surprises. Over 600km south of the Baltic, this is a land of snowy, Brueghel-esque scenes; sleighs, monasteries, cupolas, huge wooden manor houses \u2013 like galleons \u2013 and a rolling landscape of whiteness.

And, anyway, they sleep now. Come back in spring.\"It's a tempting offer. Everything about our Polish week exceeded expectations \u2013 as a family holiday it's hard to beat. I've always liked the sound of Krakow, with its huge 13th-century square, and its ancient churches, but we also decided to slot in some skiing. This was more imponderable. Although the prices were encouraging (a fraction of France's), the skiing was mysterious. How would our resort, Zakopane, cope with our range of talents: the expert (my wife), the novice (Lucy, aged eight) and the haphazard (me)?We soon realised that, whatever the skiing was like, Zakopane was charming. Although it has swanky bars and ski shops, it's essentially a very old mountain town. Most of it is made of tree trunks (parts dating from the early 1800s), and even the scrap-dealer still has a sledge. This is the place to buy an enormous sheepskin (\u00a325), or a vast cake of smoked ewe's milk cheese (\u00a31).Lucy loved it, as any child would. The locals \u2013 called \"highlanders'\" here \u2013 use any excuse (eg church) to dress up in costume, and can often be seen in their black hats, sea-shells and narrow, white-felt trousers. Even our hotel, the Litwor, felt pleasingly old-fashioned, although it had a vast fish-tank above the pool that glowed like a planet.The system for skiing seemed a bit odd at first. Each day, we'd take a taxi (\u00a35) or a bus (75p) out to a different ski area. Some didn't open until 9.30am, and then we'd hire what we needed for the day. Like Zakopane, it was all vaguely charming (I once saw a horse and cart, collecting firewood beside a green run). Out on the runs, all of us were happy (\"This,\" announced Lucy, \"is the best fun I've ever had!\"). Harenda, Nosal and Szymoszkowa were perfect for a family like ours, encompassing beginners and the doggedly incompetent. Although \u2013 for my wife \u2013 there was only one area offering a true adrenaline fix (Kasprowy Wierch), here was an ideal opportunity to master the snowboard. None of this was going to break an arm or a leg, and nor was it going to cost one. It'll be hard to go back to paying top-dollar elsewhere after the prices here (daily ski-pass \u00a312; skis and boots \u00a35 a day; lessons \u00a315 per hour). Even a good, slap-up, log-cabin lunch came in at a fiver (mulled wine \u00a32; spag bol \u00a33). I loved these places, all slightly trollish with their log fires and antlers. In Zakopane, there's a pleasing selection of restaurants with open fires and hearty dishes. If you want something urban, try Dobra Kasza Nasza, where grilled chicken and a shot costs around \u00a36. Or to see highlanders in their costumes hefting huge platters of meat, go to Owczarnia, with spare ribs at around \u00a38. I am also surprised by how many Poles ski with tiny dogs tucked into their jackets.After this, Krakow did little to dispel the fairytale aura. At first sight, it's like a city that's risen from the pages of a children's book. Dominating everything is a castle (the Wawel), that looks like a meeting of towers from all over Narnia. Beyond it is a great sprawl of Gothic and Baroque; dungeons and underground eateries; old groceries; huge chocolate shops (with bunnies the size of spaniels); and a footbridge to which lovers have attached thousands of padlocks. Grand, hobbity, and slightly eccentric, there is, quite literally, something for all the family.It would've taken months to explore it all. We did, however, find the lecture halls of Copernicus and Pope John Paul II, and the house (at 14 Szeroka) where Helena Rubinstein was born. We also found ourselves before da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine, in the castle.But there is a darker, sadder side to Krakow. In 1941, the Nazis had descended on Kazimierz, a district that had been Jewish since 1495. Even today, parts of Kazimierz feel ownerless and derelict, and the resurrection of the synagogues is largely architectural. Of those marched away (amongst them, Roman Polanski, aged eight), some 60,000, or 25% of Krakow's population, perished. You can still see the ghetto across the river, where \u2013 for a while \u2013 some of them lived. But it isn't all run down: an interesting reconstruction of a Jewish eatery can be found at Dawno Temu Na Kazimierzu on ul. Szeroka 1. And amongst the little factories, one (at 4 Lipowa) is now a startling new museum \u2013 and will always be known to the world as Schindler's Ark.Before leaving, we made two forays from Krakow. The first, to Auschwitz (70km to the west), was an experience so affecting that \u2013 weeks on \u2013 I still think about it every day. The second took us deep underground, to a happier time in Poland's story. In the 1280s, rock salt was discovered at Wieliczka, and a mine began. Now, seven centuries later, there are over 240km of tunnels, and we saw around 1% in an afternoon. It was a magnificent walk, past underground lakes and through cathedrals of salt. You could almost feel Lucy's young imagination being gently stretched. There was also a\u00a0comforting sensation of wealth and fantasy restored.So would we return to Poland? Each of us felt our appetite for this remarkable country was merely whetted. So I'm sure we'll be back, if not in time for the bears' first breakfast.\u2022 The trip was provided by Baltic Travel (0845 6800 642, baltictravelcompany.com). The seven\u2013day City and Snow trip costs from \u00a3785pp based on two people sharing, including flights from London or Liverppol to Krakow, transfers, two nights hotel accommodation in Krakow and four in Zakopane and breakfasts, but not lift passes and ski rental equipment.

I am also surprised by how many Poles ski with tiny dogs tucked into their jackets.After this, Krakow did little to dispel the fairytale aura. At first sight, it's like a city that's risen from the pages of a children's book. Dominating everything is a castle (the Wawel), that looks like a meeting of towers from all over Narnia. Beyond it is a great sprawl of Gothic and Baroque; dungeons and underground eateries; old groceries; huge chocolate shops (with bunnies the size of spaniels); and a footbridge to which lovers have attached thousands of padlocks. Grand, hobbity, and slightly eccentric, there is, quite literally, something for all the family.It would've taken months to explore it all. We did, however, find the lecture halls of Copernicus and Pope John Paul II, and the house (at 14 Szeroka) where Helena Rubinstein was born. We also found ourselves before da Vinci's Lady with an Ermine, in the castle.But there is a darker, sadder side to Krakow. In 1941, the Nazis had descended on Kazimierz, a district that had been Jewish since 1495. Even today, parts of Kazimierz feel ownerless and derelict, and the resurrection of the synagogues is largely architectural. Of those marched away (amongst them, Roman Polanski, aged eight), some 60,000, or 25% of Krakow's population, perished. You can still see the ghetto across the river, where \u2013 for a while \u2013 some of them lived. But it isn't all run down: an interesting reconstruction of a Jewish eatery can be found at Dawno Temu Na Kazimierzu on ul. Szeroka 1. And amongst the little factories, one (at 4 Lipowa) is now a startling new museum \u2013 and will always be known to the world as Schindler's Ark.Before leaving, we made two forays from Krakow. The first, to Auschwitz (70km to the west), was an experience so affecting that \u2013 weeks on \u2013 I still think about it every day. The second took us deep underground, to a happier time in Poland's story. In the 1280s, rock salt was discovered at Wieliczka, and a mine began. Now, seven centuries later, there are over 240km of tunnels, and we saw around 1% in an afternoon. It was a magnificent walk, past underground lakes and through cathedrals of salt. You could almost feel Lucy's young imagination being gently stretched. There was also a\u00a0comforting sensation of wealth and fantasy restored.So would we return to Poland? Each of us felt our appetite for this remarkable country was merely whetted. So I'm sure we'll be back, if not in time for the bears' first breakfast.\u2022 The trip was provided by Baltic Travel (0845 6800 642, baltictravelcompany.com). The seven\u2013day City and Snow trip costs from \u00a3785pp based on two people sharing, including flights from London or Liverppol to Krakow, transfers, two nights hotel accommodation in Krakow and four in Zakopane and breakfasts, but not lift passes and ski rental equipment.

It protects coal. For two years now they have been doing everything possible not to implement an EU directive which would give renewables a chance to develop.\"\"We are in a sad way,\" says Bartlomiej Susik, a spokesman for Projekt Solartechnik, which has built but not commissioned an 800KW solar farm on 2 hectares (4.94 acres) of farmland in central Poland. \"We are going through bad times. All investment in renewables stopped two years ago, except for the big state utilities. Renewable energy is seen as competition for them, and the government does not want independent power producers.\"Without government help, solar power in Poland is twice as expensive as subsidised coal. \"In Germany, where they have cut subsidies, we could pay back our loans in seven years. It will take longer here,\" adds Susik.\"Coal is votes,\" says former Warsaw MP and environment committee member Krzysztof Tyszkiewicz. \"Coal is dominant in the economy. Many politicians have close ties to the coal industry. Politicians don't think about the environment because people don't.\"The scale of the political problem is enormous, he says. Civic Platform, the largest party in government, and Law and Justice, the largest opposition party, both officially support the carbon lobby; the two parties have many MPs from mining regions. The main opposition parties are also broadly opposed to wind energy and in favour of fracking.WWF Poland calculates that, since 1990, the state-owned coal industry has been subsidised by more than $25bn, while the private renewable industry has next to nothing. \"Barriers are placed in front of anyone wanting to develop renewables,\" says Tobiasz Adamczewski, WWF Poland's climate and energy spokesman.Thermal power, generated with homegrown coal lignite and coal imported from the US, Ukraine and Russia, produces 31,425 megawatts (MW) of electricity, while the collective total for renewables is just 5,177MW. In fact, nearly 50% of the power classed as renewable comes from co-firing \u2013 burning coal and wood together \u2013 which many say is not strictly renewable.Green energy companies look enviously over the border to Germany, where billions have been spent on developing small-scale renewable solar and wind power. While Germany plans 80-100% renewable electricity by 2050, critics say Poland is likely to find it almost impossible to reach its modest 15% target.\"We see a clear practice of favoured support for the state-owned energy companies. This [aid] is clearly prohibited under EU law,\" says Jacek Bladesk, a director of Geo-Renewables, which in 2011 built a 22MW windfarm near Rawa Mazowiecka in central Poland.\"We have no renewable success story in Poland. We burn forests and coal. It's a sad story,\" says Bladesk.Poland unashamedly says it plans to develop coal power over renewable energy sources, and is ready for a showdown with Brussels, which has taken it to the European courts to force it to set more ambitious targets. Warsaw has delayed translating a renewable directive into Polish law on three occasions.The government wants to spend more than $2.7bn on building a giant coal-fired station at Opole, which is technically illegal because the site has not been assessed for its readiness to capture CO2 emissions.If Opole is built, say campaigners, it will emit more than 1.5bn tons of carbon dioxide over the next 55 years and could single-handedly prevent Poland from meeting its renewable targets.But coal is not sustainable for much longer in Poland, says Adamczewski. As the price of renewables falls, it will need ever-larger subsidies from state-owned power companies to sustain its dominance. In addition, the EU no longer allows state aid for coalmines, and tighter European commission emissions controls will require Poland to shut down 5 gigawatts of old polluting coal-fired plants within a few years.The noose is tightening, says Adamczewski. Poland is trying to expand its coal sector, but it cannot remain the dirty man of Europe much longer.", "tags": ["Global development", "Environmental sustainability", "The future of development", "Environment", "Sustainable development", "Coal", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Renewable energy", "Climate change", "COP 19: UN climate change conference | Warsaw"], "title": "Poland as a venue for UN climate talks?

Political freedom led to the country becoming the 22nd largest globally by GDP. Before political liberalisation in 1989, Polish consumers had limited choice when it came to buying products. Nearly everything was developed by public sector organisations driven by politics. These organisations had 30-year business plans which were based on political ideals rather than market research or customer demand. Consumers ended up with homogenous products that didn't really meet their tastes.Western products were inaccessible unless Poles travelled abroad, and even then were unaffordable for most people. This is one of the reasons why Polish consumers now have such high demand for western brands. Not only do Polish consumers want the brands, they have the finance to back up the demand.Research from KPMG shows wealthy Poles spend 18% of their income on luxury goods, and aspirational Poles spend 13% on luxury goods. The total spend in Poland in 2012 on luxury goods was 36.8bn zloty (around \u00a37.2bn), up by over 10% since 2011. This figure is expected to keep rising, hitting 46.4bn zloty by 2015. The Poles' budget for spending is going up.As a second generation Pole, every time I visit Poland I'm struck by how quickly the country is developing both economically and culturally. Visiting 15 years ago, it was still difficult to find western products; now, it's quite the reverse, with shelves stacked full of familiar western brands like Wilkinson Sword and Head and Shoulders.British brands in PolandMany British brands have already made major inroads in Poland. The country is the largest Central European market for Tesco, which has more than 400 stores and \u00a32bn turnover in Poland.It's not just big businesses that can take advantage of exporting to Poland. Statistics show that Poland is a major importer of goods, including manufactured products, chemicals and machinery. That means the country is importing more value of goods than countries like Saudi Arabia, Sweden and Portugal.What to consider for Polish export successSo if you're thinking of targeting Poland, what do you need to consider? Well, first you need to consider the trends in Poland. What type of products are in high demand? What is there untapped demand for? These factors will determine who is successful and who is less so.There's good news for e-commerce retailers. Research suggests that Poland is ranked among the top 20 most attractive markets globally for retail brands. The fast developing tastes and stable economy mean that if retail is your business, Poland is a great country to target. With internet penetration of 65% in Poland, there are more than 24 million internet users in Poland. That potential can be accessed by simply translating and localising your website for the Polish market.Another good sector to target is the Polish pharmaceutical market, which is the seventh largest in Europe. The modernisation of healthcare in Poland means that the pharmaceutical industry is likely to keep growing, making it a key focus for UKTI and UK exporters.According to ING, by 2017, Poland's biggest imports will be chemicals, fuels, office telecom and electrical equipment. These products together account for 36% of total imports of Poland, and illustrate the variety of products that Poland imports.

His spokesman said this week the remarks were \"perfectly fair\".But in a press conference on Tuesday, Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, said he would veto any attempt by Cameron to change EU laws on the issue \"today, tomorrow and forever\".He added: \"No one has the right to single out Poles as a special group that is abusing or taking advantage.\"Amid growing tensions, Cameron spoke on the phone to Tusk last night to reiterate his position that the benefit system for EU migrants should be reviewed and reformed. It is understood the tone of the conversation was robust on both sides but there were no raised voices. The issue of a Tesco boycott was not raised during the exchange.A Downing Street spokesman said: \"On EU free movement, the prime minister made clear his longstanding view, reiterated in recent days, that the lack of transitional controls for new EU member states in 2004 was the wrong approach and had put pressure on local communities, and that we need to address the impact on countries' benefits systems, including for example paying child benefit to families living abroad.\"The prime minister emphasised that this was a pan-EU issue relevant to all member states and people should engage with the substance of the PM's proposals. Moving forward, they agreed to hold further bilateral discussions on how the UK and Poland can work together to better manage the impact of intra-EU migration on social security systems.\"A number of Polish politicians have joined the debate in recent days, with Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, arguing that Polish immigrants contributed twice as much to the British state as they claimed in benefits. Poland's ambassador to the UK, Witold Sobk\u00f3w, told Cameron not to stigmatise his countrymen as benefit cheats.Tesco told Reuters the company deals in \"retail, not politics\".", "tags": ["Poland", "Immigration and asylum", "David Cameron", "European Union", "Politics", "UK news", "Europe", "World news", "Benefits", "Society"], "title": "Polish politician calls for Tesco boycott over migrant benefits row"},{"date": "2014-03-30T11:00:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Before I read this book I thought that it could have a bit of humour because of the word weird in the title.

The SFO refused to confirm or deny that it was investigating the matter.The allegations, if proved, would breach the UK's Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and could result in GSK being ordered to pay large fines.Analysts at Panmure Gordon said: \"In isolation, the events in Poland are trivial but evidence is building up of sharp practices in many areas of GSK's organisation which will impact sentiment significantly.\" GSK's shares dropped 1% to \u00a315.43.GSK admitted on Monday that it had brought in private detectives to investigate the Polish claims in 2011 and \"found evidence of inappropriate communication in contravention of GSK policy by a single employee. The employee concerned was reprimanded and disciplined in 2011.\"The company said it was continuing to investigate the claims and was \"co-operating fully with the CBA\". However, GSK failed to inform the public or its shareholders of the Polish investigation until Monday despite chief executive Sir Andrew Witty promising to reform the organisation in the wake of the \"shameful\" and \"deeply disappointing\" allegations in China.GSK only revealed details of the allegations following the Panorama investigation, broadcast on BBC1 on Monday.In the Panorama programme Jarek Wisniewski, a former GSK sales representative in the Polish region of Lodz, said GSK staff paid doctors to give speeches which did not take place. \"We pay agreement for a speech, we pay \u00a3100 but we expect more than 100 prescriptions for this drug.\"Wisniewski said his regional manager told them to do it, and that he blew the whistle to GSK. He said this resulted in his being sidelined at work and eventually sacked.The public prosecutor for Lodz said: \"We have evidence to claim in more than a dozen cases it was a camouflaged form of a bribe. In return for the financial gains the doctors would favour the product proposed by the pharmaceutical company and they prescribed that medicine.\"GSK refused to explain why it did not publicly disclose the allegations before being questioned by Panorama. \"We disclose significant cases in our annual report where they have the potential to have a material impact on the company,\" a spokesman said. The report lists a total of 161 staff violations of sales and marketing practices, resulting in 48 people being sacked or leaving the company and 113 formal warnings. In total, 375 employees were sacked or left voluntarily as a result of misconduct.In December, Witty promised that GSK would stop making any payments to doctors. \"We recognise that we have an important role to play in providing doctors with information about our medicines, but this must be done clearly, transparently and without any perception of conflict of interest,\" he said.In 2012, GSK paid a record $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) in fines to settle claims that bribed US doctors into prescribing antidepressants for non-approved uses.", "tags": ["GlaxoSmithKline", "Pharmaceuticals industry", "Business", "Corporate governance", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Bribery Act", "Law", "BBC"], "title": "GlaxoSmithKline accused of bribing doctors in Poland"},{"date": "2014-06-04T19:15:39Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Revolutions don't happen under conditions of total oppression.

Small wonder then that some nine out of 10 Poles support their country's membership of the EU, according to a survey last month .But it is not just Poland's economy that has changed; it's the country's citizens as well. Young Poles today travel and study all over Europe, taking part in exchange programmes or just simply packing up their bags and heading for the nearest airport. Many have now personally interacted with folk from different countries and races or know people from their families who have. This was not always the case.When I first arrived in Warsaw as a student in 1995, most Poles had had little or no contact with the outside world. Communism had ended only a few years before. It was common for non-white foreigners to get called nasty names in public. The country was going through a painful economic transformation, times were tough and its frustrated citizens were often coarse and gruff in their behaviour.But a decade in the EU and a decidedly more prosperous environment has helped to civilise Poles, much as prosperity tends to do everywhere. Nowadays, foreigners of all hues can walk the streets at night without fear of attack by skinheads, as was the case too often in the chaotic 1990s.Poles have also grown more confident of themselves and their country. Many have stopped viewing their nation as the eternal victim. A collective inferiority complex, shaped historically by the loss of independence and foreign oppression, is slowly eroding, although it will still take some time to disappear altogether.It would be silly to claim that Poland has become a land of milk and honey for all and sundry. If that were the case, 2 million Poles would not have emigrated, mostly to the UK, after accession.Unemployment, at almost 14%, remains stubbornly high and would surely be higher if so many had not left. Poland exports its furniture, food, cosmetics and unemployment, so goes the joke in Warsaw. For those who do have a job, wages remain low compared to \"old\" Europe, one of the main reasons the country is a darling of western multinationals.On the social front, there are grumbles from the more conservative members of the commentariat who say Polish traditions are being eroded by the influence of nihilistic western pop-culture. While these critics have no qualms taking EU cash, they are derisive of some of the public attitudes expected in a member state, things such as respect for LGBT-rights, gender equality (there is no such thing as discrimination against women in Poland, they say) and rightwingers' favourite bogeyman \u2013 political correctness.Some yearn for the days when you could say \"faggot\", \"nigger\" or \"kike\" in public without anybody making an unnecessary fuss. Today, the persecuted wail, their \"freedom of speech\" is being stifled.But this cultural backlash is to be expected in a country that is one of the most ethnically and culturally homogenous in the world, being 99.9% white and 95% Roman Catholic.

To stand up against authoritarian rule, people need some fresh air \u2013 at least a few inches of freedom to think and organise. In Poland 25 years ago one free newspaper and a few trade unions started an avalanche. But there was one more trigger: common and deeply disturbing experience of mass surveillance.The rule was simple: if you were not with us, you were against us.Everybody was under some form of surveillance. Secret police installed spies on every corner and in every house: neighbours spied on neighbours; workmates spied on one another. It didn't matter if mistakes were made. Mass surveillance under communist regimes was not about intelligence \u2013 it was about breaking people and making them obedient.Today Poland is celebrating 25 years of a \"free and democratic\" state. We would like to believe that it's no longer a young democracy, that our legal and political institutions have gained the sort of maturity that is expected from adults: reasoned policies based on evidence, a sense of responsibility for those who depend on the state for legal protection, full recognition of human rights. And we have all that \u2013 on paper.In the aftermath of recent disclosures \u2013 that Poland cooperated with US intelligence and delivered up vast amounts of telecommunications data (possibly on its own citizens) \u2013 the 25th anniversary of our \"freedom\" feels bittersweet. How is it possible that Polish citizens haven't heard a word of explanation from their elected representatives with regard to Snowden's allegations? We still don't know the answers to basic questions: what was the purpose of Polish-US cooperation; who were the targets?It is true that democracy and the rule of law cannot be achieved all at once. But there are things that cannot be accepted in a democratic regime; red lines that, once crossed, undermine the very essence of what \"rule of the people, for the people\" should be about. How many of these red lines have been crossed by the Polish government in their cooperation with US intelligence?Snowden's leaks left us in little doubt that the secret cooperation of intelligence services is not about fighting terrorism. The mass surveillance of innocent citizens turned out to be a rule, not an exception. It also became evident that European governments \u2013 including Poland \u2013 cooperated in this effort. Targeting innocent citizens and collecting data \"just in case\" recalls the times when the secret police wanted to break people more than it wanted information. And yet our elected representatives pretend that public security remains a plausible explanation.The power balance between citizens and their elected representatives has been disturbed to the extent that both political and legal accountability simply don't work. Polish law does not provide any mechanisms that might force the intelligence community and government to subject their decisions to any form of civic control. The only argument that we hear is \"for the sake of your security, we cannot give you any details\".This is not the answer. Democracy does not exist without accountability.Therefore Poland should move towards deep, systemic reform of its intelligence agencies. In particular, an external oversight mechanism should be created and access to telecommunication data limited (at the moment all nine intelligence agencies can use such data without any authorisation, for any purpose that fits their statutory duties). It is also high time to demand from the United States not just a serious response to Snowden's allegations but an end to all mass surveillance programmes.Finally, checks and balances cannot work without transparency. Therefore the main obstacle we face in demanding greater accountability is secrecy. Most Polish decision-makers argue that activities related to national security should be kept secret by default. This reasoning makes any form of supervision over the intelligence community extremely difficult. Governments have seized power to which they are not legally entitled.

First and foremost, there's the cash: the country received \u00a356bn in development funds between 2007 and 2013, money that was used to build hundreds of kilometres of highways and express roads as well as youth sports facilities, modern sewerage systems, kindergartens and pre-schools.Add to that the \u00a360bn earmarked for Warsaw in the EU's 2014-20 budget and the country will have enjoyed a windfall equivalent to roughly double the value of the Marshall Plan, calculated in today's dollar figures. And that does not take into account the tens of billions of pounds that Polish farmers continue to receive in agricultural subsidies from Brussels. What we are witnessing is, without doubt, one of the largest wealth transfers between nations in modern history.Then there is the boost the Polish economy has enjoyed thanks to its booming exports, which mostly head to other EU countries.

The second world war haunted R\u00f3\u017cewicz until his death, but so did the moral obligation to write about it because, as he wrote in I Did Espy a Marvellous Monster: \"At home a job / awaited me: / To create poetry after Auschwitz.\" His first two volumes of poetry, Anxiety (1947) and The Red Glove (1948), were revolutionary in creating a new idiom to express the horrors he had witnessed. What he wrote was so different from prewar Polish poetry that he was credited with creating a new prosodic system in Polish verse affecting not only the poets who came after him but established poets too. The writer Seamus Heaney called him one of the great European poets of the 20th century.R\u00f3\u017cewicz's poems were ascetic, without metre, rhyme or metaphors, stripped bare of any rhetorical posturing and ornamentation or anything that could be considered aesthetically pleasing, to reflect the loss of absolute moral and cultural norms after the war. They attempted to answer the essential question of how to live in a post-Holocaust world. In what is probably his best-known poem, The Survivor, R\u00f3\u017cewicz wrote: \"Virtue and crime weigh the same I've seen it: in a man who was both criminal and virtuous.\"His later poems became a form of internal dialogue that worked in \"non-poetical\" elements including press clippings, references to his interest in visual art, and quotations from philosophers or writers such as Camus, Saint Augustine, Dostoevsky, Fran\u00e7oise Sagan and Federico Fellini. In this way, he mirrored the contradictions of the postwar world, as in his longer poem from 1963 entitled Falling, about the upward and sideways elements in the life of modern humanity. He concludes: \"In the past one fell and was raised vertically, now one falls horizontally.\"Equally revolutionary and experimental was his drama, especially his seminal The Card Index (1961), the first of 15 published plays. Sometimes considered indebted to the theatre of the absurd, R\u00f3\u017cewicz's play was, in fact, a dialogue with Beckett's nihilism. It revolutionised Polish theatre, not by imitating reality but, rather, by creating what he called \"a self-contained reality on stage\". The open structure of his plays defied the established theatrical conventions in using a nameless character, an anti-hero who mostly lies in bed and does nothing; episodes that do not advance any specific storyline; and a lack of psychological characterisation. All this prompted a discussion on the postwar generation paralysed by war, and its later participation in Stalinism.The Card Index was followed by The Witnesses or Our Little Stabilisation (1962) and The Old Woman Broods (1968), plays in which even words were no any longer seen as a necessary part of a drama, while still affirming R\u00f3\u017cewicz's talent as a modern prophet who discusses many essential issues, such as the destruction of the natural environment, visualised as trash passing through the window of a coffee shop.Born in the small town of Radomsko into the family of a court clerk, R\u00f3\u017cewicz had two brothers, Janusz and Stanislaw. The boys' education was interrupted by the war, and Janusz, who was also a poet, helped Tadeusz to enlist in the Home Army, the underground resistance movement in occupied Poland. Janusz was executed by the Germans. For two years, Tadeusz fought in a guerrilla unit in occupied Poland, writing his first poems.With his work translated into more than 40 languages and awarded many prizes, R\u00f3\u017cewicz was seen as a great humanist and a moral authority, despite his unquestionable pessimism. In 1999, he published a collection of poems, family documents, photos and essays entitled Mother Departs, for which he received the Nike prize, the most eminent Polish literary award. He dedicated it to his mother, Stafania, who came from a Jewish family that had earlier converted to Christianity.R\u00f3\u017cewicz saw himself as an atheist. In Word After Word (1994) he wrote:It's time time is running out what am I to take with meto the other shorenothing so is thisall mumyes son  this is all \u2026 ... so this is the whole lifeyes the whole lifeR\u00f3\u017cewicz is survived by his wife, Wies\u0142awa, whom he married in 1949, and their sons Kamil and Jan.\u2022 Tadeusz R\u00f3\u017cewicz, poet, born 9 October 1921; died 24 April 2014", "tags": ["Poetry", "Books", "Theatre", "Second world war", "Poland"], "title": "Tadeusz R\u00f3\u017cewicz obituary"},{"date": "2014-06-04T19:15:39Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Revolutions don't happen under conditions of total oppression.

First and foremost, there's the cash: the country received \u00a356bn in development funds between 2007 and 2013, money that was used to build hundreds of kilometres of highways and express roads as well as youth sports facilities, modern sewerage systems, kindergartens and pre-schools.Add to that the \u00a360bn earmarked for Warsaw in the EU's 2014-20 budget and the country will have enjoyed a windfall equivalent to roughly double the value of the Marshall Plan, calculated in today's dollar figures. And that does not take into account the tens of billions of pounds that Polish farmers continue to receive in agricultural subsidies from Brussels. What we are witnessing is, without doubt, one of the largest wealth transfers between nations in modern history.Then there is the boost the Polish economy has enjoyed thanks to its booming exports, which mostly head to other EU countries. A year before accession, Poland generated an annual GDP of \u00a3130bn; by 2013, that figure had grown to \u00a3305bn. Meanwhile, GDP per capita has risen from 44% of the EU average on accession to 67% today and is forecast to reach 74% by 2020. Small wonder then that some nine out of 10 Poles support their country's membership of the EU, according to a survey last month .But it is not just Poland's economy that has changed; it's the country's citizens as well. Young Poles today travel and study all over Europe, taking part in exchange programmes or just simply packing up their bags and heading for the nearest airport. Many have now personally interacted with folk from different countries and races or know people from their families who have. This was not always the case.When I first arrived in Warsaw as a student in 1995, most Poles had had little or no contact with the outside world. Communism had ended only a few years before. It was common for non-white foreigners to get called nasty names in public. The country was going through a painful economic transformation, times were tough and its frustrated citizens were often coarse and gruff in their behaviour.But a decade in the EU and a decidedly more prosperous environment has helped to civilise Poles, much as prosperity tends to do everywhere. Nowadays, foreigners of all hues can walk the streets at night without fear of attack by skinheads, as was the case too often in the chaotic 1990s.Poles have also grown more confident of themselves and their country. Many have stopped viewing their nation as the eternal victim. A collective inferiority complex, shaped historically by the loss of independence and foreign oppression, is slowly eroding, although it will still take some time to disappear altogether.It would be silly to claim that Poland has become a land of milk and honey for all and sundry. If that were the case, 2 million Poles would not have emigrated, mostly to the UK, after accession.Unemployment, at almost 14%, remains stubbornly high and would surely be higher if so many had not left. Poland exports its furniture, food, cosmetics and unemployment, so goes the joke in Warsaw. For those who do have a job, wages remain low compared to \"old\" Europe, one of the main reasons the country is a darling of western multinationals.On the social front, there are grumbles from the more conservative members of the commentariat who say Polish traditions are being eroded by the influence of nihilistic western pop-culture. While these critics have no qualms taking EU cash, they are derisive of some of the public attitudes expected in a member state, things such as respect for LGBT-rights, gender equality (there is no such thing as discrimination against women in Poland, they say) and rightwingers' favourite bogeyman \u2013 political correctness.Some yearn for the days when you could say \"faggot\", \"nigger\" or \"kike\" in public without anybody making an unnecessary fuss.

The second world war haunted R\u00f3\u017cewicz until his death, but so did the moral obligation to write about it because, as he wrote in I Did Espy a Marvellous Monster: \"At home a job / awaited me: / To create poetry after Auschwitz.\" His first two volumes of poetry, Anxiety (1947) and The Red Glove (1948), were revolutionary in creating a new idiom to express the horrors he had witnessed. What he wrote was so different from prewar Polish poetry that he was credited with creating a new prosodic system in Polish verse affecting not only the poets who came after him but established poets too. The writer Seamus Heaney called him one of the great European poets of the 20th century.R\u00f3\u017cewicz's poems were ascetic, without metre, rhyme or metaphors, stripped bare of any rhetorical posturing and ornamentation or anything that could be considered aesthetically pleasing, to reflect the loss of absolute moral and cultural norms after the war. They attempted to answer the essential question of how to live in a post-Holocaust world. In what is probably his best-known poem, The Survivor, R\u00f3\u017cewicz wrote: \"Virtue and crime weigh the same I've seen it: in a man who was both criminal and virtuous.\"His later poems became a form of internal dialogue that worked in \"non-poetical\" elements including press clippings, references to his interest in visual art, and quotations from philosophers or writers such as Camus, Saint Augustine, Dostoevsky, Fran\u00e7oise Sagan and Federico Fellini. In this way, he mirrored the contradictions of the postwar world, as in his longer poem from 1963 entitled Falling, about the upward and sideways elements in the life of modern humanity. He concludes: \"In the past one fell and was raised vertically, now one falls horizontally.\"Equally revolutionary and experimental was his drama, especially his seminal The Card Index (1961), the first of 15 published plays. Sometimes considered indebted to the theatre of the absurd, R\u00f3\u017cewicz's play was, in fact, a dialogue with Beckett's nihilism. It revolutionised Polish theatre, not by imitating reality but, rather, by creating what he called \"a self-contained reality on stage\". The open structure of his plays defied the established theatrical conventions in using a nameless character, an anti-hero who mostly lies in bed and does nothing; episodes that do not advance any specific storyline; and a lack of psychological characterisation. All this prompted a discussion on the postwar generation paralysed by war, and its later participation in Stalinism.The Card Index was followed by The Witnesses or Our Little Stabilisation (1962) and The Old Woman Broods (1968), plays in which even words were no any longer seen as a necessary part of a drama, while still affirming R\u00f3\u017cewicz's talent as a modern prophet who discusses many essential issues, such as the destruction of the natural environment, visualised as trash passing through the window of a coffee shop.Born in the small town of Radomsko into the family of a court clerk, R\u00f3\u017cewicz had two brothers, Janusz and Stanislaw. The boys' education was interrupted by the war, and Janusz, who was also a poet, helped Tadeusz to enlist in the Home Army, the underground resistance movement in occupied Poland. Janusz was executed by the Germans. For two years, Tadeusz fought in a guerrilla unit in occupied Poland, writing his first poems.With his work translated into more than 40 languages and awarded many prizes, R\u00f3\u017cewicz was seen as a great humanist and a moral authority, despite his unquestionable pessimism. In 1999, he published a collection of poems, family documents, photos and essays entitled Mother Departs, for which he received the Nike prize, the most eminent Polish literary award. He dedicated it to his mother, Stafania, who came from a Jewish family that had earlier converted to Christianity.R\u00f3\u017cewicz saw himself as an atheist. In Word After Word (1994) he wrote:It's time time is running out what am I to take with meto the other shorenothing so is thisall mumyes son  this is all \u2026 ... so this is the whole lifeyes the whole lifeR\u00f3\u017cewicz is survived by his wife, Wies\u0142awa, whom he married in 1949, and their sons Kamil and Jan.\u2022 Tadeusz R\u00f3\u017cewicz, poet, born 9 October 1921; died 24 April 2014", "tags": ["Poetry", "Books", "Theatre", "Second world war", "Poland"], "title": "Tadeusz R\u00f3\u017cewicz obituary"},{"date": "2014-04-09T21:28:21Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Computing multinational Hewlett-Packard (HP) is to pay US regulators $108m to settle a corruption scandal involving employees at subsidiaries in three countries, who were charged with bribing government officials to win and retain lucrative public contracts.The case piles further pressure on the HP boss, Meg Whitman, who is already managing the fallout from her company's disastrous acquisition of the British software group Autonomy, while losing ground commercially to Samsung, Apple and Chinese rival Lenovo.Corruption was unearthed in relation to contracts worth $40m to install IT equipment at the national police headquarters in Poland, \u20ac35m of work for government prosecutors in Russia, and a deal to supply Mexico's state-owned petroleum company.The investigation has involved regulators in Poland and Germany, the US Department of Justice (DoJ), its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the FBI. A parallel criminal case has now been announced by the DoJ.In Poland, prosecutors on Wednesday charged a former HP executive, named in accordance with local law only as Tomasz Z, with handing over cash, computers and audio and video equipment worth more than $600,000 to the head of IT at the country's police headquarters.Meanwhile the SEC said HP's subsidiary in Russia had also paid more than $2m through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multimillion-dollar contract with the federal prosecutor's office. The corruption is said to have occurred from 2000 to 2007.In Mexico, as part of a bid to win a software sale to the state petroleum company, an HP subsidiary paid more than $1m in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, and the money, referred to internally as an \"influencer fee\", is said to have been funnelled to one of those officials.Kara Brockmeyer, of the SEC enforcement division, said: \"Hewlett-Packard lacked the internal controls to stop a pattern of illegal payments to win business in Mexico and Eastern Europe. The company's books and records reflected the payments as legitimate commissions and expenses.\"Companies have a fundamental obligation to ensure that their internal controls are both reasonably designed and appropriately implemented across their entire business operations, and they should take a hard look at the agents conducting business on their behalf.\"US regulators have launched a wide-ranging probe into the behaviour of US IT companies abroad. IBM said last year it was under investigation in Poland and four other countries, and the company paid $10m, also in 2013, to settle a corruption case involving China and South Korea. Cisco said last month the company and its resellers in Russia, eastern Europe and central Asia are being investigated.Poland has been pursuing allegations of corruption against a group of multinational IT companies, covering a period from 2007 to 2009.The probe is now drawing to a head, with officials saying on Wednesday that 41 people, including IT company executives, government officials and former police officers, had been charged with almost 70 offences.The interior minister, Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, took to the radio to hail a \"breakthrough moment in Poland when a great international company acknowledges its corrupt activities in Poland\".Under the US's Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal to bribe foreign government officials, HP or individuals involved in the case could be subject to penalties of up to $725,000 per violation and the company could be forced to hand back any profits. If found guilty of criminal offences, the penalty could rise to $25m per violation.John Schultz, an executive vice-president and general counsel at HP, said: \"The misconduct described in the settlement was limited to a small number of people who are no longer employed by the company.

To stand up against authoritarian rule, people need some fresh air \u2013 at least a few inches of freedom to think and organise. In Poland 25 years ago one free newspaper and a few trade unions started an avalanche. But there was one more trigger: common and deeply disturbing experience of mass surveillance.The rule was simple: if you were not with us, you were against us.Everybody was under some form of surveillance. Secret police installed spies on every corner and in every house: neighbours spied on neighbours; workmates spied on one another. It didn't matter if mistakes were made. Mass surveillance under communist regimes was not about intelligence \u2013 it was about breaking people and making them obedient.Today Poland is celebrating 25 years of a \"free and democratic\" state. We would like to believe that it's no longer a young democracy, that our legal and political institutions have gained the sort of maturity that is expected from adults: reasoned policies based on evidence, a sense of responsibility for those who depend on the state for legal protection, full recognition of human rights. And we have all that \u2013 on paper.In the aftermath of recent disclosures \u2013 that Poland cooperated with US intelligence and delivered up vast amounts of telecommunications data (possibly on its own citizens) \u2013 the 25th anniversary of our \"freedom\" feels bittersweet. How is it possible that Polish citizens haven't heard a word of explanation from their elected representatives with regard to Snowden's allegations? We still don't know the answers to basic questions: what was the purpose of Polish-US cooperation; who were the targets?It is true that democracy and the rule of law cannot be achieved all at once. But there are things that cannot be accepted in a democratic regime; red lines that, once crossed, undermine the very essence of what \"rule of the people, for the people\" should be about. How many of these red lines have been crossed by the Polish government in their cooperation with US intelligence?Snowden's leaks left us in little doubt that the secret cooperation of intelligence services is not about fighting terrorism. The mass surveillance of innocent citizens turned out to be a rule, not an exception. It also became evident that European governments \u2013 including Poland \u2013 cooperated in this effort. Targeting innocent citizens and collecting data \"just in case\" recalls the times when the secret police wanted to break people more than it wanted information. And yet our elected representatives pretend that public security remains a plausible explanation.The power balance between citizens and their elected representatives has been disturbed to the extent that both political and legal accountability simply don't work. Polish law does not provide any mechanisms that might force the intelligence community and government to subject their decisions to any form of civic control. The only argument that we hear is \"for the sake of your security, we cannot give you any details\".This is not the answer. Democracy does not exist without accountability.Therefore Poland should move towards deep, systemic reform of its intelligence agencies. In particular, an external oversight mechanism should be created and access to telecommunication data limited (at the moment all nine intelligence agencies can use such data without any authorisation, for any purpose that fits their statutory duties). It is also high time to demand from the United States not just a serious response to Snowden's allegations but an end to all mass surveillance programmes.Finally, checks and balances cannot work without transparency. Therefore the main obstacle we face in demanding greater accountability is secrecy. Most Polish decision-makers argue that activities related to national security should be kept secret by default. This reasoning makes any form of supervision over the intelligence community extremely difficult. Governments have seized power to which they are not legally entitled.

The second world war haunted R\u00f3\u017cewicz until his death, but so did the moral obligation to write about it because, as he wrote in I Did Espy a Marvellous Monster: \"At home a job / awaited me: / To create poetry after Auschwitz.\" His first two volumes of poetry, Anxiety (1947) and The Red Glove (1948), were revolutionary in creating a new idiom to express the horrors he had witnessed. What he wrote was so different from prewar Polish poetry that he was credited with creating a new prosodic system in Polish verse affecting not only the poets who came after him but established poets too. The writer Seamus Heaney called him one of the great European poets of the 20th century.R\u00f3\u017cewicz's poems were ascetic, without metre, rhyme or metaphors, stripped bare of any rhetorical posturing and ornamentation or anything that could be considered aesthetically pleasing, to reflect the loss of absolute moral and cultural norms after the war. They attempted to answer the essential question of how to live in a post-Holocaust world. In what is probably his best-known poem, The Survivor, R\u00f3\u017cewicz wrote: \"Virtue and crime weigh the same I've seen it: in a man who was both criminal and virtuous.\"His later poems became a form of internal dialogue that worked in \"non-poetical\" elements including press clippings, references to his interest in visual art, and quotations from philosophers or writers such as Camus, Saint Augustine, Dostoevsky, Fran\u00e7oise Sagan and Federico Fellini. In this way, he mirrored the contradictions of the postwar world, as in his longer poem from 1963 entitled Falling, about the upward and sideways elements in the life of modern humanity. He concludes: \"In the past one fell and was raised vertically, now one falls horizontally.\"Equally revolutionary and experimental was his drama, especially his seminal The Card Index (1961), the first of 15 published plays. Sometimes considered indebted to the theatre of the absurd, R\u00f3\u017cewicz's play was, in fact, a dialogue with Beckett's nihilism. It revolutionised Polish theatre, not by imitating reality but, rather, by creating what he called \"a self-contained reality on stage\". The open structure of his plays defied the established theatrical conventions in using a nameless character, an anti-hero who mostly lies in bed and does nothing; episodes that do not advance any specific storyline; and a lack of psychological characterisation. All this prompted a discussion on the postwar generation paralysed by war, and its later participation in Stalinism.The Card Index was followed by The Witnesses or Our Little Stabilisation (1962) and The Old Woman Broods (1968), plays in which even words were no any longer seen as a necessary part of a drama, while still affirming R\u00f3\u017cewicz's talent as a modern prophet who discusses many essential issues, such as the destruction of the natural environment, visualised as trash passing through the window of a coffee shop.Born in the small town of Radomsko into the family of a court clerk, R\u00f3\u017cewicz had two brothers, Janusz and Stanislaw. The boys' education was interrupted by the war, and Janusz, who was also a poet, helped Tadeusz to enlist in the Home Army, the underground resistance movement in occupied Poland. Janusz was executed by the Germans. For two years, Tadeusz fought in a guerrilla unit in occupied Poland, writing his first poems.With his work translated into more than 40 languages and awarded many prizes, R\u00f3\u017cewicz was seen as a great humanist and a moral authority, despite his unquestionable pessimism. In 1999, he published a collection of poems, family documents, photos and essays entitled Mother Departs, for which he received the Nike prize, the most eminent Polish literary award. He dedicated it to his mother, Stafania, who came from a Jewish family that had earlier converted to Christianity.R\u00f3\u017cewicz saw himself as an atheist. In Word After Word (1994) he wrote:It's time time is running out what am I to take with meto the other shorenothing so is thisall mumyes son  this is all \u2026 ... so this is the whole lifeyes the whole lifeR\u00f3\u017cewicz is survived by his wife, Wies\u0142awa, whom he married in 1949, and their sons Kamil and Jan.\u2022 Tadeusz R\u00f3\u017cewicz, poet, born 9 October 1921; died 24 April 2014", "tags": ["Poetry", "Books", "Theatre", "Second world war", "Poland"], "title": "Tadeusz R\u00f3\u017cewicz obituary"},{"date": "2014-04-09T21:28:21Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Computing multinational Hewlett-Packard (HP) is to pay US regulators $108m to settle a corruption scandal involving employees at subsidiaries in three countries, who were charged with bribing government officials to win and retain lucrative public contracts.The case piles further pressure on the HP boss, Meg Whitman, who is already managing the fallout from her company's disastrous acquisition of the British software group Autonomy, while losing ground commercially to Samsung, Apple and Chinese rival Lenovo.Corruption was unearthed in relation to contracts worth $40m to install IT equipment at the national police headquarters in Poland, \u20ac35m of work for government prosecutors in Russia, and a deal to supply Mexico's state-owned petroleum company.The investigation has involved regulators in Poland and Germany, the US Department of Justice (DoJ), its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the FBI. A parallel criminal case has now been announced by the DoJ.In Poland, prosecutors on Wednesday charged a former HP executive, named in accordance with local law only as Tomasz Z, with handing over cash, computers and audio and video equipment worth more than $600,000 to the head of IT at the country's police headquarters.Meanwhile the SEC said HP's subsidiary in Russia had also paid more than $2m through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multimillion-dollar contract with the federal prosecutor's office. The corruption is said to have occurred from 2000 to 2007.In Mexico, as part of a bid to win a software sale to the state petroleum company, an HP subsidiary paid more than $1m in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, and the money, referred to internally as an \"influencer fee\", is said to have been funnelled to one of those officials.Kara Brockmeyer, of the SEC enforcement division, said: \"Hewlett-Packard lacked the internal controls to stop a pattern of illegal payments to win business in Mexico and Eastern Europe. The company's books and records reflected the payments as legitimate commissions and expenses.\"Companies have a fundamental obligation to ensure that their internal controls are both reasonably designed and appropriately implemented across their entire business operations, and they should take a hard look at the agents conducting business on their behalf.\"US regulators have launched a wide-ranging probe into the behaviour of US IT companies abroad. IBM said last year it was under investigation in Poland and four other countries, and the company paid $10m, also in 2013, to settle a corruption case involving China and South Korea. Cisco said last month the company and its resellers in Russia, eastern Europe and central Asia are being investigated.Poland has been pursuing allegations of corruption against a group of multinational IT companies, covering a period from 2007 to 2009.The probe is now drawing to a head, with officials saying on Wednesday that 41 people, including IT company executives, government officials and former police officers, had been charged with almost 70 offences.The interior minister, Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, took to the radio to hail a \"breakthrough moment in Poland when a great international company acknowledges its corrupt activities in Poland\".Under the US's Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal to bribe foreign government officials, HP or individuals involved in the case could be subject to penalties of up to $725,000 per violation and the company could be forced to hand back any profits. If found guilty of criminal offences, the penalty could rise to $25m per violation.John Schultz, an executive vice-president and general counsel at HP, said: \"The misconduct described in the settlement was limited to a small number of people who are no longer employed by the company.

In the wake of Vodafone's disclosures, first published in the Guardian on Friday, it announced that it would extend its disclosures to every other market where it operates and where it is legal.A spokeswoman for Deutsche Telekom, which has 140 million customers worldwide, said: \"Deutsche Telekom has initially focused on Germany when it comes to disclosure of government requests. We are currently checking if and to what extent our national companies can disclose information. We intend to publish something similar to Vodafone.\"Bosses of the world's biggest mobile networks, many of which have headquarters in Europe, are gathering for an industry conference in Shanghai this weekend, and the debate is expected to centre on whether they should join Deutsche and Vodafone in using transparency to push back against the use of their technology for government surveillance.Mobile companies, unlike social networks, cannot operate without a government-issued licence, and have previously been reluctant to discuss the extent of their cooperation with national security and law enforcement agencies.But Vodafone broke cover on Friday by confirming that in around half a dozen of the markets in which it operates, governments in Europe and outside have installed their own secret listening equipment on its network and those of other operators.Under this direct access system, wires suck up traffic at key points in the network, allowing unfettered access to the content of phone conversations and text messages, and in some cases delivering live data about the location of customers.They allow surveillance without the usual warrants, and it means the phone company cannot know how many people are being targeted and what the justification is for any snooping.Vodafone will formally table its Law Enforcement Disclosure report, which sets out country by country the laws that oblige it to help governments spy on citizens, at the GSMA industry group conference in Shanghai.Disclosure may pose a dilemma for Orange, formerly France Telecom. Like Deutsche it is still partially state-owned, and French newspaper Le Monde reported this year that the company had deep links with its domestic intelligence agency.A spokesperson for Orange said: \"Orange respects the laws and regulations of every country in which it is present. Naturally, this means that the group rigorously adheres to the legal framework with regards to all surveillance requests emanating from state authorities across its footprint.\"The newspaper confirmed, using files obtained by Snowden, that Orange had collaborated with the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Ext\u00e9rieure (DGSE) to break encryption codes, and that the agency was allowed free and total access to all traffic on its network.Campaign group Access asked Orange at its annual meeting this year to begin publishing data on warrant numbers, and has called on all operators to do so. The biggest European companies, including Spain's Telef\u00f3nica, Portugal Telecom and Telecom Italia, operate in many of the same markets for which Vodafone has published its numbers.\"Working together, operators can make a clear stand against unfettered surveillance,\" said Access policy counsel Peter Micek. \"Competition on transparency is something we would welcome. It's not going to happen overnight, but I think Vodafone has made a great headstart for the sector and it is incumbent on the rest of the field to follow up quickly.\"\"Europe has a strong charter of fundamental rights, and those rights apply online as they do offline. There is a strong basis for Europe to act in a concernted manner to end practices like direct access.\"", "tags": ["Surveillance", "Germany", "Telecommunications industry", "Vodafone", "Business", "Europe", "World news", "Edward Snowden", "NSA"], "title": "Deutsche Telekom to follow Vodafone in revealing surveillance"},{"date": "2014-06-04T19:15:39Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Revolutions don't happen under conditions of total oppression. To stand up against authoritarian rule, people need some fresh air \u2013 at least a few inches of freedom to think and organise. In Poland 25 years ago one free newspaper and a few trade unions started an avalanche. But there was one more trigger: common and deeply disturbing experience of mass surveillance.The rule was simple: if you were not with us, you were against us.Everybody was under some form of surveillance. Secret police installed spies on every corner and in every house: neighbours spied on neighbours; workmates spied on one another. It didn't matter if mistakes were made. Mass surveillance under communist regimes was not about intelligence \u2013 it was about breaking people and making them obedient.Today Poland is celebrating 25 years of a \"free and democratic\" state. We would like to believe that it's no longer a young democracy, that our legal and political institutions have gained the sort of maturity that is expected from adults: reasoned policies based on evidence, a sense of responsibility for those who depend on the state for legal protection, full recognition of human rights. And we have all that \u2013 on paper.In the aftermath of recent disclosures \u2013 that Poland cooperated with US intelligence and delivered up vast amounts of telecommunications data (possibly on its own citizens) \u2013 the 25th anniversary of our \"freedom\" feels bittersweet. How is it possible that Polish citizens haven't heard a word of explanation from their elected representatives with regard to Snowden's allegations? We still don't know the answers to basic questions: what was the purpose of Polish-US cooperation; who were the targets?It is true that democracy and the rule of law cannot be achieved all at once. But there are things that cannot be accepted in a democratic regime; red lines that, once crossed, undermine the very essence of what \"rule of the people, for the people\" should be about. How many of these red lines have been crossed by the Polish government in their cooperation with US intelligence?Snowden's leaks left us in little doubt that the secret cooperation of intelligence services is not about fighting terrorism. The mass surveillance of innocent citizens turned out to be a rule, not an exception. It also became evident that European governments \u2013 including Poland \u2013 cooperated in this effort. Targeting innocent citizens and collecting data \"just in case\" recalls the times when the secret police wanted to break people more than it wanted information. And yet our elected representatives pretend that public security remains a plausible explanation.The power balance between citizens and their elected representatives has been disturbed to the extent that both political and legal accountability simply don't work. Polish law does not provide any mechanisms that might force the intelligence community and government to subject their decisions to any form of civic control. The only argument that we hear is \"for the sake of your security, we cannot give you any details\".This is not the answer. Democracy does not exist without accountability.Therefore Poland should move towards deep, systemic reform of its intelligence agencies. In particular, an external oversight mechanism should be created and access to telecommunication data limited (at the moment all nine intelligence agencies can use such data without any authorisation, for any purpose that fits their statutory duties). It is also high time to demand from the United States not just a serious response to Snowden's allegations but an end to all mass surveillance programmes.Finally, checks and balances cannot work without transparency. Therefore the main obstacle we face in demanding greater accountability is secrecy. Most Polish decision-makers argue that activities related to national security should be kept secret by default. This reasoning makes any form of supervision over the intelligence community extremely difficult. Governments have seized power to which they are not legally entitled. How much more power are we prepared to give away before we conclude that our much-cherished democracy is merely a facade?", "tags": ["Poland", "Surveillance", "The NSA files", "NSA", "Communism", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "How free is Poland? | Katarzyna Szymielewicz"},{"date": "2014-05-01T15:16:10Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Of the 10 mostly post-communist countries that joined the European Union exactly a decade ago today, none has benefited more from membership than Poland. First and foremost, there's the cash: the country received \u00a356bn in development funds between 2007 and 2013, money that was used to build hundreds of kilometres of highways and express roads as well as youth sports facilities, modern sewerage systems, kindergartens and pre-schools.Add to that the \u00a360bn earmarked for Warsaw in the EU's 2014-20 budget and the country will have enjoyed a windfall equivalent to roughly double the value of the Marshall Plan, calculated in today's dollar figures. And that does not take into account the tens of billions of pounds that Polish farmers continue to receive in agricultural subsidies from Brussels. What we are witnessing is, without doubt, one of the largest wealth transfers between nations in modern history.Then there is the boost the Polish economy has enjoyed thanks to its booming exports, which mostly head to other EU countries. A year before accession, Poland generated an annual GDP of \u00a3130bn; by 2013, that figure had grown to \u00a3305bn. Meanwhile, GDP per capita has risen from 44% of the EU average on accession to 67% today and is forecast to reach 74% by 2020. Small wonder then that some nine out of 10 Poles support their country's membership of the EU, according to a survey last month .But it is not just Poland's economy that has changed; it's the country's citizens as well. Young Poles today travel and study all over Europe, taking part in exchange programmes or just simply packing up their bags and heading for the nearest airport. Many have now personally interacted with folk from different countries and races or know people from their families who have. This was not always the case.When I first arrived in Warsaw as a student in 1995, most Poles had had little or no contact with the outside world. Communism had ended only a few years before. It was common for non-white foreigners to get called nasty names in public. The country was going through a painful economic transformation, times were tough and its frustrated citizens were often coarse and gruff in their behaviour.But a decade in the EU and a decidedly more prosperous environment has helped to civilise Poles, much as prosperity tends to do everywhere. Nowadays, foreigners of all hues can walk the streets at night without fear of attack by skinheads, as was the case too often in the chaotic 1990s.Poles have also grown more confident of themselves and their country. Many have stopped viewing their nation as the eternal victim. A collective inferiority complex, shaped historically by the loss of independence and foreign oppression, is slowly eroding, although it will still take some time to disappear altogether.It would be silly to claim that Poland has become a land of milk and honey for all and sundry. If that were the case, 2 million Poles would not have emigrated, mostly to the UK, after accession.Unemployment, at almost 14%, remains stubbornly high and would surely be higher if so many had not left. Poland exports its furniture, food, cosmetics and unemployment, so goes the joke in Warsaw. For those who do have a job, wages remain low compared to \"old\" Europe, one of the main reasons the country is a darling of western multinationals.On the social front, there are grumbles from the more conservative members of the commentariat who say Polish traditions are being eroded by the influence of nihilistic western pop-culture. While these critics have no qualms taking EU cash, they are derisive of some of the public attitudes expected in a member state, things such as respect for LGBT-rights, gender equality (there is no such thing as discrimination against women in Poland, they say) and rightwingers' favourite bogeyman \u2013 political correctness.Some yearn for the days when you could say \"faggot\", \"nigger\" or \"kike\" in public without anybody making an unnecessary fuss. Today, the persecuted wail, their \"freedom of speech\" is being stifled.But this cultural backlash is to be expected in a country that is one of the most ethnically and culturally homogenous in the world, being 99.9% white and 95% Roman Catholic. What counts is that Polish mainstream society has adapted to western standards in public behaviour admirably quickly.All in all, most Poles, conservative and progressive, would agree it would be difficult to point to a decade in Poland's troubled history that has been as benevolent for the country as the last one.", "tags": ["Poland", "European Union", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "How the EU transformed Poland | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2014-04-14T19:55:46Z", "country": "poland", "content": " GlaxoSmithKline, the British drug company embroiled in bribery scandals in China and Iraq, has been accused of bribing doctors in Poland in the latest corruption furore to hit the business.The company, which has made a series of public promises to \"root out corruption wherever it exists\" following allegations that it bribed doctors with \u00a3320m worth of cash and sexual favours in China, admitted on Monday that a GSK employee was disciplined in relation to the Polish allegations.GSK, which has repeatedly trumpeted its \"zero tolerance\" corruption policy as it battles to salvage its corporate reputation, only acknowledged the Polish allegations \u2013 which date back to 2010-12 \u2013 after an investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme.Poland's fraud squad, the central anti-corruption bureau, on Monday said 13 people had been charged in connection with allegations of doctors being bribed to promote GSK's asthma drug Seretide.The UK's Serious Fraud Office is also understood to be looking at the claims. \"We are aware of the case,\" a SFO source said. The SFO refused to confirm or deny that it was investigating the matter.The allegations, if proved, would breach the UK's Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and could result in GSK being ordered to pay large fines.Analysts at Panmure Gordon said: \"In isolation, the events in Poland are trivial but evidence is building up of sharp practices in many areas of GSK's organisation which will impact sentiment significantly.\" GSK's shares dropped 1% to \u00a315.43.GSK admitted on Monday that it had brought in private detectives to investigate the Polish claims in 2011 and \"found evidence of inappropriate communication in contravention of GSK policy by a single employee. The employee concerned was reprimanded and disciplined in 2011.\"The company said it was continuing to investigate the claims and was \"co-operating fully with the CBA\". However, GSK failed to inform the public or its shareholders of the Polish investigation until Monday despite chief executive Sir Andrew Witty promising to reform the organisation in the wake of the \"shameful\" and \"deeply disappointing\" allegations in China.GSK only revealed details of the allegations following the Panorama investigation, broadcast on BBC1 on Monday.In the Panorama programme Jarek Wisniewski, a former GSK sales representative in the Polish region of Lodz, said GSK staff paid doctors to give speeches which did not take place. \"We pay agreement for a speech, we pay \u00a3100 but we expect more than 100 prescriptions for this drug.\"Wisniewski said his regional manager told them to do it, and that he blew the whistle to GSK. He said this resulted in his being sidelined at work and eventually sacked.The public prosecutor for Lodz said: \"We have evidence to claim in more than a dozen cases it was a camouflaged form of a bribe. In return for the financial gains the doctors would favour the product proposed by the pharmaceutical company and they prescribed that medicine.\"GSK refused to explain why it did not publicly disclose the allegations before being questioned by Panorama. \"We disclose significant cases in our annual report where they have the potential to have a material impact on the company,\" a spokesman said. The report lists a total of 161 staff violations of sales and marketing practices, resulting in 48 people being sacked or leaving the company and 113 formal warnings. In total, 375 employees were sacked or left voluntarily as a result of misconduct.In December, Witty promised that GSK would stop making any payments to doctors. \"We recognise that we have an important role to play in providing doctors with information about our medicines, but this must be done clearly, transparently and without any perception of conflict of interest,\" he said.In 2012, GSK paid a record $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) in fines to settle claims that bribed US doctors into prescribing antidepressants for non-approved uses.", "tags": ["GlaxoSmithKline", "Pharmaceuticals industry", "Business", "Corporate governance", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Bribery Act", "Law", "BBC"], "title": "GlaxoSmithKline accused of bribing doctors in Poland"},{"date": "2014-06-22T10:43:45Z", "country": "poland", "content": "David Cameron would be able to negotiate major reforms to Britain's EU membership terms even if the prime minister was defeated over the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker as the next European commission president, Poland has said.As an unstoppable momentum appeared to be building up behind Juncker, as centre-left EU leaders endorsed him ahead of an EU summit later this week, the Polish foreign minister said Britain could win support for \"sensible\" reforms.Radek Sikorski, an ally of the Tories who was a member of the Oxford Bullingdon Club at the same time as Boris Johnson, said Juncker should be appointed because he was the candidate of the main EPP grouping which came first in the European elections.

All this prompted a discussion on the postwar generation paralysed by war, and its later participation in Stalinism.The Card Index was followed by The Witnesses or Our Little Stabilisation (1962) and The Old Woman Broods (1968), plays in which even words were no any longer seen as a necessary part of a drama, while still affirming R\u00f3\u017cewicz's talent as a modern prophet who discusses many essential issues, such as the destruction of the natural environment, visualised as trash passing through the window of a coffee shop.Born in the small town of Radomsko into the family of a court clerk, R\u00f3\u017cewicz had two brothers, Janusz and Stanislaw. The boys' education was interrupted by the war, and Janusz, who was also a poet, helped Tadeusz to enlist in the Home Army, the underground resistance movement in occupied Poland. Janusz was executed by the Germans. For two years, Tadeusz fought in a guerrilla unit in occupied Poland, writing his first poems.With his work translated into more than 40 languages and awarded many prizes, R\u00f3\u017cewicz was seen as a great humanist and a moral authority, despite his unquestionable pessimism. In 1999, he published a collection of poems, family documents, photos and essays entitled Mother Departs, for which he received the Nike prize, the most eminent Polish literary award. He dedicated it to his mother, Stafania, who came from a Jewish family that had earlier converted to Christianity.R\u00f3\u017cewicz saw himself as an atheist.

A parallel criminal case has now been announced by the DoJ.In Poland, prosecutors on Wednesday charged a former HP executive, named in accordance with local law only as Tomasz Z, with handing over cash, computers and audio and video equipment worth more than $600,000 to the head of IT at the country's police headquarters.Meanwhile the SEC said HP's subsidiary in Russia had also paid more than $2m through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multimillion-dollar contract with the federal prosecutor's office. The corruption is said to have occurred from 2000 to 2007.In Mexico, as part of a bid to win a software sale to the state petroleum company, an HP subsidiary paid more than $1m in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, and the money, referred to internally as an \"influencer fee\", is said to have been funnelled to one of those officials.Kara Brockmeyer, of the SEC enforcement division, said: \"Hewlett-Packard lacked the internal controls to stop a pattern of illegal payments to win business in Mexico and Eastern Europe. The company's books and records reflected the payments as legitimate commissions and expenses.\"Companies have a fundamental obligation to ensure that their internal controls are both reasonably designed and appropriately implemented across their entire business operations, and they should take a hard look at the agents conducting business on their behalf.\"US regulators have launched a wide-ranging probe into the behaviour of US IT companies abroad. IBM said last year it was under investigation in Poland and four other countries, and the company paid $10m, also in 2013, to settle a corruption case involving China and South Korea. Cisco said last month the company and its resellers in Russia, eastern Europe and central Asia are being investigated.Poland has been pursuing allegations of corruption against a group of multinational IT companies, covering a period from 2007 to 2009.The probe is now drawing to a head, with officials saying on Wednesday that 41 people, including IT company executives, government officials and former police officers, had been charged with almost 70 offences.The interior minister, Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, took to the radio to hail a \"breakthrough moment in Poland when a great international company acknowledges its corrupt activities in Poland\".Under the US's Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal to bribe foreign government officials, HP or individuals involved in the case could be subject to penalties of up to $725,000 per violation and the company could be forced to hand back any profits. If found guilty of criminal offences, the penalty could rise to $25m per violation.John Schultz, an executive vice-president and general counsel at HP, said: \"The misconduct described in the settlement was limited to a small number of people who are no longer employed by the company.

In the wake of Vodafone's disclosures, first published in the Guardian on Friday, it announced that it would extend its disclosures to every other market where it operates and where it is legal.A spokeswoman for Deutsche Telekom, which has 140 million customers worldwide, said: \"Deutsche Telekom has initially focused on Germany when it comes to disclosure of government requests. We are currently checking if and to what extent our national companies can disclose information. We intend to publish something similar to Vodafone.\"Bosses of the world's biggest mobile networks, many of which have headquarters in Europe, are gathering for an industry conference in Shanghai this weekend, and the debate is expected to centre on whether they should join Deutsche and Vodafone in using transparency to push back against the use of their technology for government surveillance.Mobile companies, unlike social networks, cannot operate without a government-issued licence, and have previously been reluctant to discuss the extent of their cooperation with national security and law enforcement agencies.But Vodafone broke cover on Friday by confirming that in around half a dozen of the markets in which it operates, governments in Europe and outside have installed their own secret listening equipment on its network and those of other operators.Under this direct access system, wires suck up traffic at key points in the network, allowing unfettered access to the content of phone conversations and text messages, and in some cases delivering live data about the location of customers.They allow surveillance without the usual warrants, and it means the phone company cannot know how many people are being targeted and what the justification is for any snooping.Vodafone will formally table its Law Enforcement Disclosure report, which sets out country by country the laws that oblige it to help governments spy on citizens, at the GSMA industry group conference in Shanghai.Disclosure may pose a dilemma for Orange, formerly France Telecom. Like Deutsche it is still partially state-owned, and French newspaper Le Monde reported this year that the company had deep links with its domestic intelligence agency.A spokesperson for Orange said: \"Orange respects the laws and regulations of every country in which it is present. Naturally, this means that the group rigorously adheres to the legal framework with regards to all surveillance requests emanating from state authorities across its footprint.\"The newspaper confirmed, using files obtained by Snowden, that Orange had collaborated with the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Ext\u00e9rieure (DGSE) to break encryption codes, and that the agency was allowed free and total access to all traffic on its network.Campaign group Access asked Orange at its annual meeting this year to begin publishing data on warrant numbers, and has called on all operators to do so. The biggest European companies, including Spain's Telef\u00f3nica, Portugal Telecom and Telecom Italia, operate in many of the same markets for which Vodafone has published its numbers.\"Working together, operators can make a clear stand against unfettered surveillance,\" said Access policy counsel Peter Micek. \"Competition on transparency is something we would welcome. It's not going to happen overnight, but I think Vodafone has made a great headstart for the sector and it is incumbent on the rest of the field to follow up quickly.\"\"Europe has a strong charter of fundamental rights, and those rights apply online as they do offline. There is a strong basis for Europe to act in a concernted manner to end practices like direct access.\"", "tags": ["Surveillance", "Germany", "Telecommunications industry", "Vodafone", "Business", "Europe", "World news", "Edward Snowden", "NSA"], "title": "Deutsche Telekom to follow Vodafone in revealing surveillance"},{"date": "2014-04-25T01:44:50Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Jack Walker left his keys in Poland. Almost 70 years later his grandson Peter Walker went back and, to his great surprise, managed to find them.As a prisoner of war in the second world war Jack was, in his grandson\u2019s words, \u201ca bit of an artful dodger\u201d. After being captured by the Germans in April 1941 while serving with a hospital unit in Greece, the Sydneysider was sent to a POW camp in the northern Polish town of Torun.But Jack, who is now 91, quickly became known for his lockpicking skills and mischievous qualities, and carried with him a set of twisted wire keys fit for the purpose. Left largely to their own devices, Jack and a few other adventurous POWs would sneak around the camp pilfering supplies.\u201cThey would steal potatoes, coal, anything to supplement their quite meagre rations. They even made a still and hid it somewhere in the fort,\u201d Peter said.When Jack was freed he hid the keys in the windowsill of his room so they wouldn\u2019t be found. The story of the keys captured his grandson\u2019s attention, who decided last July that he wanted to try to find them.\u201cI thought if I\u2019ve got an opportunity I might head over to Poland and see if I can do a bit of investigation about my grandfather\u2019s POW camp,\u201d Peter said.\u201cI went to see my grandfather, who\u2019s still pretty sharp, and we just talked through the details of his experience. He had been put in contact with a series of historians, so he put me in contact with one of the guys.\u201dAnd so, along with a local tour guide, Pavel Bukowski, Peter began the journey to Torun, armed with only the location of the camp and his grandfather\u2019s 70-year-old memories.The German army took Torun on 7 September 1939 and annexed the city. A series of forts bordered the town, which were used as the POW camps and called Stalag XX-A. Thousands of allied prisoners were held in these forts, including Jack, who was kept prisoner there until 1943.Jack had been held in Fort 15. When Peter got there, he found to his surprise that it was still largely intact. The fortifications were still standing and most of the buildings were stable. An inebriated guard was easily bribed on entry, giving them full access to the grounds.Using Jack\u2019s instructions, they entered his old room and found the window where Jack said he had hidden the keys, but they were disappointed by what they found. The windows had been boarded up many years before, blocking access to the window sill.\u201cWe were disappointed when we got there, because we had got all this way and had discovered the building was still standing,\u201d Peter said.But the tour guide, Bukowski, was not to be dissuaded. He walked outside the building and discovered a small manhole \u2013 just big enough to fit a torso \u2013 outside the bedroom wall.\u201cWhen we reached down we rifled around and came up with a set of twisted bits of wire, but that\u2019s effectively what my grandfather had been using,\u201d Peter said.\u201cI smuggled one of them back in and my grandfather reckons it\u2019s the actual key he would have used,\u201d he said.Peter returned to Sydney to show the keys to his grandfather, who now lives in a retirement village in the southern Sydney suburb of Oatley. The forgotten memories, the sights and sounds, slowly came back to him.\u201cYou can imagine someone who has had these memories for 70 years could be confronted by the photos again. It was more like he was trying to calculate and calibrate things,\u201d Peter said.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t tearful really, but what it looked like was almost like you were watching a 19-year-old peering out from a 91-year-old\u2019s eyes.\u201dThe key sits proudly now on the wall of a room in Peter\u2019s father\u2019s house in Oatley, where the family have lived for many years.Afterwards, Jack wrote his grandson a brief letter thanking him for taking the journey. While the keys were important, it gave his grandfather something of far greater value.\u201cWhile you were there, I felt as though I was there with you. They were exciting and sometimes worrying times, but have now had a safe mental revival which has taught me to hate wars, respect other people and their way of life.

To stand up against authoritarian rule, people need some fresh air \u2013 at least a few inches of freedom to think and organise. In Poland 25 years ago one free newspaper and a few trade unions started an avalanche. But there was one more trigger: common and deeply disturbing experience of mass surveillance.The rule was simple: if you were not with us, you were against us.Everybody was under some form of surveillance. Secret police installed spies on every corner and in every house: neighbours spied on neighbours; workmates spied on one another. It didn't matter if mistakes were made. Mass surveillance under communist regimes was not about intelligence \u2013 it was about breaking people and making them obedient.Today Poland is celebrating 25 years of a \"free and democratic\" state. We would like to believe that it's no longer a young democracy, that our legal and political institutions have gained the sort of maturity that is expected from adults: reasoned policies based on evidence, a sense of responsibility for those who depend on the state for legal protection, full recognition of human rights. And we have all that \u2013 on paper.In the aftermath of recent disclosures \u2013 that Poland cooperated with US intelligence and delivered up vast amounts of telecommunications data (possibly on its own citizens) \u2013 the 25th anniversary of our \"freedom\" feels bittersweet. How is it possible that Polish citizens haven't heard a word of explanation from their elected representatives with regard to Snowden's allegations? We still don't know the answers to basic questions: what was the purpose of Polish-US cooperation; who were the targets?It is true that democracy and the rule of law cannot be achieved all at once. But there are things that cannot be accepted in a democratic regime; red lines that, once crossed, undermine the very essence of what \"rule of the people, for the people\" should be about. How many of these red lines have been crossed by the Polish government in their cooperation with US intelligence?Snowden's leaks left us in little doubt that the secret cooperation of intelligence services is not about fighting terrorism. The mass surveillance of innocent citizens turned out to be a rule, not an exception. It also became evident that European governments \u2013 including Poland \u2013 cooperated in this effort. Targeting innocent citizens and collecting data \"just in case\" recalls the times when the secret police wanted to break people more than it wanted information. And yet our elected representatives pretend that public security remains a plausible explanation.The power balance between citizens and their elected representatives has been disturbed to the extent that both political and legal accountability simply don't work. Polish law does not provide any mechanisms that might force the intelligence community and government to subject their decisions to any form of civic control. The only argument that we hear is \"for the sake of your security, we cannot give you any details\".This is not the answer. Democracy does not exist without accountability.Therefore Poland should move towards deep, systemic reform of its intelligence agencies. In particular, an external oversight mechanism should be created and access to telecommunication data limited (at the moment all nine intelligence agencies can use such data without any authorisation, for any purpose that fits their statutory duties). It is also high time to demand from the United States not just a serious response to Snowden's allegations but an end to all mass surveillance programmes.Finally, checks and balances cannot work without transparency. Therefore the main obstacle we face in demanding greater accountability is secrecy. Most Polish decision-makers argue that activities related to national security should be kept secret by default. This reasoning makes any form of supervision over the intelligence community extremely difficult. Governments have seized power to which they are not legally entitled. How much more power are we prepared to give away before we conclude that our much-cherished democracy is merely a facade?", "tags": ["Poland", "Surveillance", "The NSA files", "NSA", "Communism", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "How free is Poland? | Katarzyna Szymielewicz"},{"date": "2014-05-01T15:16:10Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Of the 10 mostly post-communist countries that joined the European Union exactly a decade ago today, none has benefited more from membership than Poland. First and foremost, there's the cash: the country received \u00a356bn in development funds between 2007 and 2013, money that was used to build hundreds of kilometres of highways and express roads as well as youth sports facilities, modern sewerage systems, kindergartens and pre-schools.Add to that the \u00a360bn earmarked for Warsaw in the EU's 2014-20 budget and the country will have enjoyed a windfall equivalent to roughly double the value of the Marshall Plan, calculated in today's dollar figures. And that does not take into account the tens of billions of pounds that Polish farmers continue to receive in agricultural subsidies from Brussels. What we are witnessing is, without doubt, one of the largest wealth transfers between nations in modern history.Then there is the boost the Polish economy has enjoyed thanks to its booming exports, which mostly head to other EU countries. A year before accession, Poland generated an annual GDP of \u00a3130bn; by 2013, that figure had grown to \u00a3305bn. Meanwhile, GDP per capita has risen from 44% of the EU average on accession to 67% today and is forecast to reach 74% by 2020. Small wonder then that some nine out of 10 Poles support their country's membership of the EU, according to a survey last month .But it is not just Poland's economy that has changed; it's the country's citizens as well. Young Poles today travel and study all over Europe, taking part in exchange programmes or just simply packing up their bags and heading for the nearest airport. Many have now personally interacted with folk from different countries and races or know people from their families who have. This was not always the case.When I first arrived in Warsaw as a student in 1995, most Poles had had little or no contact with the outside world. Communism had ended only a few years before. It was common for non-white foreigners to get called nasty names in public. The country was going through a painful economic transformation, times were tough and its frustrated citizens were often coarse and gruff in their behaviour.But a decade in the EU and a decidedly more prosperous environment has helped to civilise Poles, much as prosperity tends to do everywhere. Nowadays, foreigners of all hues can walk the streets at night without fear of attack by skinheads, as was the case too often in the chaotic 1990s.Poles have also grown more confident of themselves and their country. Many have stopped viewing their nation as the eternal victim. A collective inferiority complex, shaped historically by the loss of independence and foreign oppression, is slowly eroding, although it will still take some time to disappear altogether.It would be silly to claim that Poland has become a land of milk and honey for all and sundry. If that were the case, 2 million Poles would not have emigrated, mostly to the UK, after accession.Unemployment, at almost 14%, remains stubbornly high and would surely be higher if so many had not left. Poland exports its furniture, food, cosmetics and unemployment, so goes the joke in Warsaw. For those who do have a job, wages remain low compared to \"old\" Europe, one of the main reasons the country is a darling of western multinationals.On the social front, there are grumbles from the more conservative members of the commentariat who say Polish traditions are being eroded by the influence of nihilistic western pop-culture. While these critics have no qualms taking EU cash, they are derisive of some of the public attitudes expected in a member state, things such as respect for LGBT-rights, gender equality (there is no such thing as discrimination against women in Poland, they say) and rightwingers' favourite bogeyman \u2013 political correctness.Some yearn for the days when you could say \"faggot\", \"nigger\" or \"kike\" in public without anybody making an unnecessary fuss. Today, the persecuted wail, their \"freedom of speech\" is being stifled.But this cultural backlash is to be expected in a country that is one of the most ethnically and culturally homogenous in the world, being 99.9% white and 95% Roman Catholic. What counts is that Polish mainstream society has adapted to western standards in public behaviour admirably quickly.All in all, most Poles, conservative and progressive, would agree it would be difficult to point to a decade in Poland's troubled history that has been as benevolent for the country as the last one.", "tags": ["Poland", "European Union", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "How the EU transformed Poland | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2014-04-14T19:55:46Z", "country": "poland", "content": " GlaxoSmithKline, the British drug company embroiled in bribery scandals in China and Iraq, has been accused of bribing doctors in Poland in the latest corruption furore to hit the business.The company, which has made a series of public promises to \"root out corruption wherever it exists\" following allegations that it bribed doctors with \u00a3320m worth of cash and sexual favours in China, admitted on Monday that a GSK employee was disciplined in relation to the Polish allegations.GSK, which has repeatedly trumpeted its \"zero tolerance\" corruption policy as it battles to salvage its corporate reputation, only acknowledged the Polish allegations \u2013 which date back to 2010-12 \u2013 after an investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme.Poland's fraud squad, the central anti-corruption bureau, on Monday said 13 people had been charged in connection with allegations of doctors being bribed to promote GSK's asthma drug Seretide.The UK's Serious Fraud Office is also understood to be looking at the claims. \"We are aware of the case,\" a SFO source said. The SFO refused to confirm or deny that it was investigating the matter.The allegations, if proved, would breach the UK's Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and could result in GSK being ordered to pay large fines.Analysts at Panmure Gordon said: \"In isolation, the events in Poland are trivial but evidence is building up of sharp practices in many areas of GSK's organisation which will impact sentiment significantly.\" GSK's shares dropped 1% to \u00a315.43.GSK admitted on Monday that it had brought in private detectives to investigate the Polish claims in 2011 and \"found evidence of inappropriate communication in contravention of GSK policy by a single employee. The employee concerned was reprimanded and disciplined in 2011.\"The company said it was continuing to investigate the claims and was \"co-operating fully with the CBA\". However, GSK failed to inform the public or its shareholders of the Polish investigation until Monday despite chief executive Sir Andrew Witty promising to reform the organisation in the wake of the \"shameful\" and \"deeply disappointing\" allegations in China.GSK only revealed details of the allegations following the Panorama investigation, broadcast on BBC1 on Monday.In the Panorama programme Jarek Wisniewski, a former GSK sales representative in the Polish region of Lodz, said GSK staff paid doctors to give speeches which did not take place. \"We pay agreement for a speech, we pay \u00a3100 but we expect more than 100 prescriptions for this drug.\"Wisniewski said his regional manager told them to do it, and that he blew the whistle to GSK. He said this resulted in his being sidelined at work and eventually sacked.The public prosecutor for Lodz said: \"We have evidence to claim in more than a dozen cases it was a camouflaged form of a bribe. In return for the financial gains the doctors would favour the product proposed by the pharmaceutical company and they prescribed that medicine.\"GSK refused to explain why it did not publicly disclose the allegations before being questioned by Panorama. \"We disclose significant cases in our annual report where they have the potential to have a material impact on the company,\" a spokesman said. The report lists a total of 161 staff violations of sales and marketing practices, resulting in 48 people being sacked or leaving the company and 113 formal warnings. In total, 375 employees were sacked or left voluntarily as a result of misconduct.In December, Witty promised that GSK would stop making any payments to doctors. \"We recognise that we have an important role to play in providing doctors with information about our medicines, but this must be done clearly, transparently and without any perception of conflict of interest,\" he said.In 2012, GSK paid a record $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) in fines to settle claims that bribed US doctors into prescribing antidepressants for non-approved uses.", "tags": ["GlaxoSmithKline", "Pharmaceuticals industry", "Business", "Corporate governance", "Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Bribery Act", "Law", "BBC"], "title": "GlaxoSmithKline accused of bribing doctors in Poland"},{"date": "2014-06-22T10:43:45Z", "country": "poland", "content": "David Cameron would be able to negotiate major reforms to Britain's EU membership terms even if the prime minister was defeated over the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker as the next European commission president, Poland has said.As an unstoppable momentum appeared to be building up behind Juncker, as centre-left EU leaders endorsed him ahead of an EU summit later this week, the Polish foreign minister said Britain could win support for \"sensible\" reforms.Radek Sikorski, an ally of the Tories who was a member of the Oxford Bullingdon Club at the same time as Boris Johnson, said Juncker should be appointed because he was the candidate of the main EPP grouping which came first in the European elections. Sikorski said it was \"unfortunate\" that Cameron had been unable to influence the appointment of Juncker after he withdrew the Tories from the EPP, which is the main centre-right group in the European parliament.Sikorski, whose Civic Platform party is a member of the EPP, told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: \"If the Tories were part of the EPP he could have made that argument [against Juncker] at the Dublin summit when the EPP chose its candidate. He may well have prevailed. But the EPP made its choice, won the election and here it is.

The second world war haunted R\u00f3\u017cewicz until his death, but so did the moral obligation to write about it because, as he wrote in I Did Espy a Marvellous Monster: \"At home a job / awaited me: / To create poetry after Auschwitz.\" His first two volumes of poetry, Anxiety (1947) and The Red Glove (1948), were revolutionary in creating a new idiom to express the horrors he had witnessed. What he wrote was so different from prewar Polish poetry that he was credited with creating a new prosodic system in Polish verse affecting not only the poets who came after him but established poets too. The writer Seamus Heaney called him one of the great European poets of the 20th century.R\u00f3\u017cewicz's poems were ascetic, without metre, rhyme or metaphors, stripped bare of any rhetorical posturing and ornamentation or anything that could be considered aesthetically pleasing, to reflect the loss of absolute moral and cultural norms after the war. They attempted to answer the essential question of how to live in a post-Holocaust world. In what is probably his best-known poem, The Survivor, R\u00f3\u017cewicz wrote: \"Virtue and crime weigh the same I've seen it: in a man who was both criminal and virtuous.\"His later poems became a form of internal dialogue that worked in \"non-poetical\" elements including press clippings, references to his interest in visual art, and quotations from philosophers or writers such as Camus, Saint Augustine, Dostoevsky, Fran\u00e7oise Sagan and Federico Fellini. In this way, he mirrored the contradictions of the postwar world, as in his longer poem from 1963 entitled Falling, about the upward and sideways elements in the life of modern humanity. He concludes: \"In the past one fell and was raised vertically, now one falls horizontally.\"Equally revolutionary and experimental was his drama, especially his seminal The Card Index (1961), the first of 15 published plays. Sometimes considered indebted to the theatre of the absurd, R\u00f3\u017cewicz's play was, in fact, a dialogue with Beckett's nihilism. It revolutionised Polish theatre, not by imitating reality but, rather, by creating what he called \"a self-contained reality on stage\". The open structure of his plays defied the established theatrical conventions in using a nameless character, an anti-hero who mostly lies in bed and does nothing; episodes that do not advance any specific storyline; and a lack of psychological characterisation. All this prompted a discussion on the postwar generation paralysed by war, and its later participation in Stalinism.The Card Index was followed by The Witnesses or Our Little Stabilisation (1962) and The Old Woman Broods (1968), plays in which even words were no any longer seen as a necessary part of a drama, while still affirming R\u00f3\u017cewicz's talent as a modern prophet who discusses many essential issues, such as the destruction of the natural environment, visualised as trash passing through the window of a coffee shop.Born in the small town of Radomsko into the family of a court clerk, R\u00f3\u017cewicz had two brothers, Janusz and Stanislaw. The boys' education was interrupted by the war, and Janusz, who was also a poet, helped Tadeusz to enlist in the Home Army, the underground resistance movement in occupied Poland. Janusz was executed by the Germans. For two years, Tadeusz fought in a guerrilla unit in occupied Poland, writing his first poems.With his work translated into more than 40 languages and awarded many prizes, R\u00f3\u017cewicz was seen as a great humanist and a moral authority, despite his unquestionable pessimism. In 1999, he published a collection of poems, family documents, photos and essays entitled Mother Departs, for which he received the Nike prize, the most eminent Polish literary award. He dedicated it to his mother, Stafania, who came from a Jewish family that had earlier converted to Christianity.R\u00f3\u017cewicz saw himself as an atheist.

A parallel criminal case has now been announced by the DoJ.In Poland, prosecutors on Wednesday charged a former HP executive, named in accordance with local law only as Tomasz Z, with handing over cash, computers and audio and video equipment worth more than $600,000 to the head of IT at the country's police headquarters.Meanwhile the SEC said HP's subsidiary in Russia had also paid more than $2m through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multimillion-dollar contract with the federal prosecutor's office. The corruption is said to have occurred from 2000 to 2007.In Mexico, as part of a bid to win a software sale to the state petroleum company, an HP subsidiary paid more than $1m in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, and the money, referred to internally as an \"influencer fee\", is said to have been funnelled to one of those officials.Kara Brockmeyer, of the SEC enforcement division, said: \"Hewlett-Packard lacked the internal controls to stop a pattern of illegal payments to win business in Mexico and Eastern Europe. The company's books and records reflected the payments as legitimate commissions and expenses.\"Companies have a fundamental obligation to ensure that their internal controls are both reasonably designed and appropriately implemented across their entire business operations, and they should take a hard look at the agents conducting business on their behalf.\"US regulators have launched a wide-ranging probe into the behaviour of US IT companies abroad. IBM said last year it was under investigation in Poland and four other countries, and the company paid $10m, also in 2013, to settle a corruption case involving China and South Korea. Cisco said last month the company and its resellers in Russia, eastern Europe and central Asia are being investigated.Poland has been pursuing allegations of corruption against a group of multinational IT companies, covering a period from 2007 to 2009.The probe is now drawing to a head, with officials saying on Wednesday that 41 people, including IT company executives, government officials and former police officers, had been charged with almost 70 offences.The interior minister, Bartlomiej Sienkiewicz, took to the radio to hail a \"breakthrough moment in Poland when a great international company acknowledges its corrupt activities in Poland\".Under the US's Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it illegal to bribe foreign government officials, HP or individuals involved in the case could be subject to penalties of up to $725,000 per violation and the company could be forced to hand back any profits. If found guilty of criminal offences, the penalty could rise to $25m per violation.John Schultz, an executive vice-president and general counsel at HP, said: \"The misconduct described in the settlement was limited to a small number of people who are no longer employed by the company. HP fully cooperated with both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the investigation of these matters.\"", "tags": ["Hewlett-Packard", "Business", "Securities and Exchange Commission", "Regulators", "FBI", "US news", "World news", "Poland", "Europe", "Russia", "Mexico", "Americas"], "title": "Hewlett-Packard to pay $108m to settle scandal over bribery of public officials"},{"date": "2014-06-06T18:09:50Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Germany's biggest telecoms company is to follow Vodafone in disclosing for the first time the number of surveillance requests it receives from governments around the world.Deutsche Telekom, which owns half of Britain's EE mobile network and operates in 14 countries including the US, Spain and Poland, has already published surveillance data for its home nation \u2013 one of the countries that have reacted most angrily to the Edward Snowden revelations. In the wake of Vodafone's disclosures, first published in the Guardian on Friday, it announced that it would extend its disclosures to every other market where it operates and where it is legal.A spokeswoman for Deutsche Telekom, which has 140 million customers worldwide, said: \"Deutsche Telekom has initially focused on Germany when it comes to disclosure of government requests. We are currently checking if and to what extent our national companies can disclose information. We intend to publish something similar to Vodafone.\"Bosses of the world's biggest mobile networks, many of which have headquarters in Europe, are gathering for an industry conference in Shanghai this weekend, and the debate is expected to centre on whether they should join Deutsche and Vodafone in using transparency to push back against the use of their technology for government surveillance.Mobile companies, unlike social networks, cannot operate without a government-issued licence, and have previously been reluctant to discuss the extent of their cooperation with national security and law enforcement agencies.But Vodafone broke cover on Friday by confirming that in around half a dozen of the markets in which it operates, governments in Europe and outside have installed their own secret listening equipment on its network and those of other operators.Under this direct access system, wires suck up traffic at key points in the network, allowing unfettered access to the content of phone conversations and text messages, and in some cases delivering live data about the location of customers.They allow surveillance without the usual warrants, and it means the phone company cannot know how many people are being targeted and what the justification is for any snooping.Vodafone will formally table its Law Enforcement Disclosure report, which sets out country by country the laws that oblige it to help governments spy on citizens, at the GSMA industry group conference in Shanghai.Disclosure may pose a dilemma for Orange, formerly France Telecom. Like Deutsche it is still partially state-owned, and French newspaper Le Monde reported this year that the company had deep links with its domestic intelligence agency.A spokesperson for Orange said: \"Orange respects the laws and regulations of every country in which it is present. Naturally, this means that the group rigorously adheres to the legal framework with regards to all surveillance requests emanating from state authorities across its footprint.\"The newspaper confirmed, using files obtained by Snowden, that Orange had collaborated with the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Ext\u00e9rieure (DGSE) to break encryption codes, and that the agency was allowed free and total access to all traffic on its network.Campaign group Access asked Orange at its annual meeting this year to begin publishing data on warrant numbers, and has called on all operators to do so. The biggest European companies, including Spain's Telef\u00f3nica, Portugal Telecom and Telecom Italia, operate in many of the same markets for which Vodafone has published its numbers.\"Working together, operators can make a clear stand against unfettered surveillance,\" said Access policy counsel Peter Micek. \"Competition on transparency is something we would welcome. It's not going to happen overnight, but I think Vodafone has made a great headstart for the sector and it is incumbent on the rest of the field to follow up quickly.\"\"Europe has a strong charter of fundamental rights, and those rights apply online as they do offline. There is a strong basis for Europe to act in a concernted manner to end practices like direct access.\"", "tags": ["Surveillance", "Germany", "Telecommunications industry", "Vodafone", "Business", "Europe", "World news", "Edward Snowden", "NSA"], "title": "Deutsche Telekom to follow Vodafone in revealing surveillance"},{"date": "2014-04-25T01:44:50Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Jack Walker left his keys in Poland. Almost 70 years later his grandson Peter Walker went back and, to his great surprise, managed to find them.As a prisoner of war in the second world war Jack was, in his grandson\u2019s words, \u201ca bit of an artful dodger\u201d. After being captured by the Germans in April 1941 while serving with a hospital unit in Greece, the Sydneysider was sent to a POW camp in the northern Polish town of Torun.But Jack, who is now 91, quickly became known for his lockpicking skills and mischievous qualities, and carried with him a set of twisted wire keys fit for the purpose. Left largely to their own devices, Jack and a few other adventurous POWs would sneak around the camp pilfering supplies.\u201cThey would steal potatoes, coal, anything to supplement their quite meagre rations. They even made a still and hid it somewhere in the fort,\u201d Peter said.When Jack was freed he hid the keys in the windowsill of his room so they wouldn\u2019t be found. The story of the keys captured his grandson\u2019s attention, who decided last July that he wanted to try to find them.\u201cI thought if I\u2019ve got an opportunity I might head over to Poland and see if I can do a bit of investigation about my grandfather\u2019s POW camp,\u201d Peter said.\u201cI went to see my grandfather, who\u2019s still pretty sharp, and we just talked through the details of his experience. He had been put in contact with a series of historians, so he put me in contact with one of the guys.\u201dAnd so, along with a local tour guide, Pavel Bukowski, Peter began the journey to Torun, armed with only the location of the camp and his grandfather\u2019s 70-year-old memories.The German army took Torun on 7 September 1939 and annexed the city. A series of forts bordered the town, which were used as the POW camps and called Stalag XX-A. Thousands of allied prisoners were held in these forts, including Jack, who was kept prisoner there until 1943.Jack had been held in Fort 15. When Peter got there, he found to his surprise that it was still largely intact. The fortifications were still standing and most of the buildings were stable. An inebriated guard was easily bribed on entry, giving them full access to the grounds.Using Jack\u2019s instructions, they entered his old room and found the window where Jack said he had hidden the keys, but they were disappointed by what they found. The windows had been boarded up many years before, blocking access to the window sill.\u201cWe were disappointed when we got there, because we had got all this way and had discovered the building was still standing,\u201d Peter said.But the tour guide, Bukowski, was not to be dissuaded. He walked outside the building and discovered a small manhole \u2013 just big enough to fit a torso \u2013 outside the bedroom wall.\u201cWhen we reached down we rifled around and came up with a set of twisted bits of wire, but that\u2019s effectively what my grandfather had been using,\u201d Peter said.\u201cI smuggled one of them back in and my grandfather reckons it\u2019s the actual key he would have used,\u201d he said.Peter returned to Sydney to show the keys to his grandfather, who now lives in a retirement village in the southern Sydney suburb of Oatley. The forgotten memories, the sights and sounds, slowly came back to him.\u201cYou can imagine someone who has had these memories for 70 years could be confronted by the photos again. It was more like he was trying to calculate and calibrate things,\u201d Peter said.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t tearful really, but what it looked like was almost like you were watching a 19-year-old peering out from a 91-year-old\u2019s eyes.\u201dThe key sits proudly now on the wall of a room in Peter\u2019s father\u2019s house in Oatley, where the family have lived for many years.Afterwards, Jack wrote his grandson a brief letter thanking him for taking the journey. While the keys were important, it gave his grandfather something of far greater value.\u201cWhile you were there, I felt as though I was there with you. They were exciting and sometimes worrying times, but have now had a safe mental revival which has taught me to hate wars, respect other people and their way of life.

Control freak. That\u2019s going to be reported in the Guardian: \u2018Jessie Ware, domestic prisoner\u2019.\u201d She\u2019s joking, but when we meet in her flat in south London to chat over caffeine-free tea, her usually easy-going demeanour is tinged with an undercurrent of mania. It\u2019s not surprising her nearest and dearest are trying to keep her away from any stimulants; a later misunderstanding about a caramel wafer leads to an outburst worthy of an East End gangster. But it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s on edge: as well as trying to organise her impending wedding in Greece (her mum calls during our interview with news on the venue: \u201cI bet that\u2019s my mum \u2026 It\u2019s my fucking mum! Sam, get it!\u201d), there\u2019s also the matter of her forthcoming second album, Tough Love, a mix of refined soul and crystalline pop.This juxtaposition between the artist (gregarious, deliciously foul-mouthed, prone to a good gossip) and the art (delicate, melancholic, sophisticated) is what makes Ware interesting. Cocooned in a loving relationship and on the cusp of marriage, she seems blissfully happy, yet Tough Love is littered with broken relationships. \u201cI\u2019m in a really happy stage of my life, but it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t write about things that affect me or that I relate to from the past,\u201d she says. \u201cSongwriting is about storytelling.\u201dHer new single, the weepy, gospel-tinged Say You Love, for example, was apparently not written with anyone in mind, but subconsciously dealt with the two years when she and Sam had split up. This lyrical focus on the bad times might have something to do with the fact that the mushy love songs she\u2019s written specifically for him tend to be the ones he dislikes. \u201cHe\u2019s never a fan of the ones I\u2019ve written about him,\u201d she laughs, legs tucked up beneath her chin. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Babe, I\u2019ve written you this song.\u2019 Nothing. One new song, You & I (Forever), is me celebrating the memory of the fact that he\u2019s proposed to me and that we\u2019ll be together for ever.\u201d She smiles, but then, and this is a very Jessie Ware thing to do, quickly adds: \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come across as saccharine.\u201dIt\u2019s telling that the creation of both Tough Love and her Mercury-nominated debut, Devotion, were marked by Ware\u2019s surprising lack of self-confidence. An early session for Devotion was curtailed after she burst into tears during an improvised singsong around the piano, while Tough Love featured a similar episode with a member of pop-songwriting royalty she asks me not to name. \u201cThe guy asked me to sit in the middle of the room while he played the piano and he told me to just sing and I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t do that,\u2019 and he said: \u2018No, just sing and I\u2019ll play.\u2019 I went in the other room and it reminded me of when I started writing the first album. I got a lump in my throat and was like: \u2018Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry.\u2019 I hate it. It felt like I was auditioning and soon as I\u2019m auditioning it gets scary.\u201dThis lack of confidence is surprising, I tell her, not least because her debut album peaked in the top five (\u201cIt was a slow week, I think,\u201d she counters) and Tough Love\u2019s featherlight title track and first single became her first UK top 40 single earlier this year. Again, her answer is self-deprecating: \u201cI mean, we say \u2018top 40\u2019 because 34 doesn\u2019t sound so good,\u201d she cackles, dunking a biscuit. \u201cBut no, it tells me my fans are really backing me. I felt very apologetic at the beginning. I felt like I had to earn this relationship and I\u2019m flabbergasted that that was the song that got me into the top 40, but I\u2019m not complaining.\u201dIn a pop world full of cloying ambition and singers swinging around naked on demolition equipment to get people\u2019s attention, the sense that Ware herself can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s all really happening is heartwarming. Ask her if she\u2019s ambitious enough to try to conquer the US, like fellow heart-on-their-sleeve crooners Sam Smith and Adele, and she\u2019ll say, that while it would be nice, she\u2019s keen to get the people in the UK to like her first. \u201cAs long as I can carry on touring and having a career, then I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says. During a recent festival appearance in Finland, a last-minute change in lineup meant she was bumped up the bill. Again, the response isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d imagine from the likes of Jessie J. \u201cI said: \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be on the main stage because no one\u2019s going to be there,\u2019 and my sound guy was just like: \u2018Jessie, shut up, just fucking enjoy it,\u2019 and then I did enjoy it.\u201d While it\u2019s great to have big brash pop stars who are keen to kick down every proverbial door to get where they need to be, Ware feels like a throwback to the likes of Sade or Annie Lennox, creators of classic, universal pop songs about love and heartbreak, delivered with genuine warmth.Nearly 30, and with a debut album released when she was 27 \u2013 practically geriatric in pop terms \u2013 her route to stardom feels almost accidental. The daughter of a news reporter, she studied to become a journalist, briefly working as a sportswriter at the Daily Mirror and then at the Jewish Chronicle, before realising that her love of being nosy couldn\u2019t hide the fact that, as she puts it, she \u201cwasn\u2019t very good at writing\u201d. Asked by her old schoolfriend Jack Pe\u00f1ate to sing backing vocals for him on tour, she met the artist and producer SBTRKT, who asked her to sing on the appropriately titled Nervous. That, in turn, started a working relationship with Red Bull Studios, which offered her a more relaxed environment in which to work on Devotion. \u201cBasically, Red Bull Studios asked me to do Nervous at their Notting Hill carnival party and after that I recorded [debut single] Strangest Feeling at their studio. I still find the idea of writing and recording songs fucking petrifying. It got a bit easier the second time round, but at their studio it\u2019s not intimidating. It\u2019s the most warm and inviting environment.\u201dWith half of Tough Love recorded at Red Bull Studios\u2019 London basement, and partly with their current in-house producer Julio Bashmore, Ware recently embarked on a remix project that involved visiting five of their studios across the world and getting five different producers \u2013 ranging from garage newcomer Preditah to Russian DJ Nina Kraviz \u2013 to remix the multilayered Keep On Lying. \u201cI just knew [Keep On Lying] would exist on the record as an album track but I wanted it to have a bit more of a spotlight on it,\u201d she explains. \u201cBashmore and I worked on it at their studios. He\u2019s the producer in residence there for a year and so I think it was a nice way of being able to thank them.\u201dExpressing gratitude towards an offshoot of a multinational drinks company, albeit a not-for-profit one, might come across as disingenuous. But after spending time with Ware both in the London studio and in Amsterdam for the Kraviz session, it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t do anything she\u2019s not comfortable with (she once turned down a remix from a diminutive pop superstar on the basis that it was rubbish), and that the people she works and surrounds herself with on a daily basis need to be friends first, collaborators second. So while that early recording session for Tough Love may have been intimidating, the finished album features an impressive roster of collaborators \u2013 including Dev Hynes, Ed Sheeran, Miguel and production duo BenZel, AKA Two Inch Punch and Benny Blanco \u2013 who have since become close friends. In fact, such was Ware\u2019s desire to make her two-day studio session with Miguel as relaxed as possible, she got so drunk celebrating the first day that she could barely muster the energy for the second. \u201cI had the worst hangover,\u201d she sighs, resting her head in her hands as if the memory alone has drained all the blood from her body. \u201cI thought I was dying. Vomiting everywhere. Go to the second session and Miguel\u2019s there and he\u2019s fresh and I\u2019m just pale with mascara all over my face. I was just a mess.\u201dThe incongruity of having someone like Blanco \u2013 who has produced global pop hits for the likes of Rihanna, Maroon 5 and Kesha \u2013 working with a singer formerly prone to double-tracking her vocals in order to bury herself in the mix isn\u2019t lost on Ware. \u201cI joked with Benny and told him: \u2018This is going to be your least successful project ever. It has to be,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve developed a whole new group of friends that you would put in the music bracket, but they are very dear to me. Benny and Ben, who are BenZel, these are people I trust and who I call for advice. And yes, one of them happens to be a massive hitmaker, but I have to feel like there\u2019s a magic and trust with the people I work with.\u201dIt was through Blanco \u2013 whom she met in New York via mutual friends \u2013 that she got to work with Sheeran on the acoustic-led and romcom-ready epic Say You Love Me. It is, you feel, her first shot at a proper hit, a suggestion that causes her eyebrows to shoot up to meet her hairline. \u201cI think it\u2019s a classic, really well-written song,\u201d she mumbles sheepishly. \u201cIt shows another edge to my voice. Working with artists like Miguel and Ed pushed me vocally without them really knowing it. They\u2019re so talented and technically gifted so they\u2019d sing something and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yeah, that sounds wicked,\u2019 and then I\u2019d try it and be like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have to practise that.\u2019 For this album, I\u2019ve definitely found a confidence with using my voice. I think I was scared and hiding my vocal on the first one and I didn\u2019t want too much of an identity \u2013 I wanted it to just be smooth.\u201dAs with Devotion, Tough Love is an album the flits effortlessly between Radio 2-friendly ballads, such as the string-drenched Pieces, to the textured, Miguel-assisted Kind of \u2026 Sometimes \u2026 Maybe and the deliriously loved-up Champagne Kisses (which, she\u2019s keen to point out, isn\u2019t about \u201cexpensive blowies\u201d). It\u2019s a reflection of her ability to effortlessly straddle that previously untouched terrain between Best New Music write-ups on Pitchfork on the one hand and a guest appearances on The X Factor in Poland on the other (\u201cI\u2019m massive in Poland, I get like four bodyguards there,\u201d she laughs).\u201cI fucking loved doing The X Factor,\u201d she says unapologetically, when I suggest other artists might see it as bad for the brand. \u201cFor me, that was fucking brilliant. I think that\u2019s cool. I\u2019m very true to myself and I love pop music. So while I want it to sound relatively cool, I\u2019m not going to deny a massive hook.\u201d\u2022 The single Say You Love Me is out on 29 September, followed by the album Tough Love on 13 October, both on PMR/IslandRosie LoweA textured tapestry of burbling electronics and scattershot drum beats, London-based Rosie Lowe\u2019s fragile 2013 EP Right Thing \u2013 co-produced by Ware collaborator Dave Okumu \u2013 announced an intriguing new talent unafraid to manipulate genre barriers. Producer Paul Epworth was so impressed he signed her to his label Wolf Tone and is working on her debut album, due in early 2015. More melancholic perhaps than Ware\u2019s brand of nu soul, Lowe\u2019s songs tend to draw on her varied musical background \u2013 she sang in jazz bands from the age of 13 \u2013 to create moments of unnerving beauty.KwabsGhanaian-born, London-based Kwabena Sarkodee Adjepong, AKA Kwabs, has also worked with Dave Okumu on the undulating soul of Spirit Fade, a track taken from his debut EP, Wrong or Right. It\u2019s the title track \u2013 produced by the enigmatic Sohn, who\u2019s also worked with nu-soul practitioners Banks and Rhye \u2013 that fully showcases Kwabs\u2019 ability to melt his big soulful voice into the fidgety, electronic textures summoned by his producers. While that early EP overflowed with hooky melodies, its slightly inward-looking standpoint has been exploded on new single Walk, a string-drenched stomper aimed directly at radio playlists.Billie BlackWith influences including a host of jazz greats (she studied at the Guildhall School of Music) to sadface electronic singer James Blake and downcast R&B crooner Sampha, 19-year-old Billie Black makes the kind of breathy, modern soul that sounds simultaneously welcoming and strangely unnerving. I Don\u2019t Need Another Lover, for example, pulls off that Jessie Ware-esque trick of encasing a fairly straightforward love song in a constantly shifting, electronic-tinged setting, while I\u2019ve Waited For You sounds like finger tips tapping skin. A recent collaboration with 18-year-old producer Mura Masa on This Simple Pleasure also showcases how versatile her voice is \u2013 its featherlight tones gliding over more vibrant production.", "tags": ["Jessie Ware", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Soul", "Ed Sheeran", "Culture"], "title": "Jessie Ware on Tough Love, working with Miguel and getting mobbed in Poland"},{"date": "2014-08-01T12:18:48Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Festival name: MFF T-Mobile New Horizons international film festivalLocation: Wroc\u0142aw, Silesia, PolandWebsite: nowehoryzonty.plDates: Annually, 24 July to 3 August, 2014About: Poland\u2019s best-known film festival, New Horizons started life in Sanok in 2001 before moving to Cieszyn on the Polish/Czech border the following year. With an emphasis on films challenging cinematic conventions, the festival soon gained cult status and growing audiences, and, in 2006, moved to the city of Wroc\u0142aw. It proved a perfect match. Ensnared by the River Oder on one side and by the city moat on the other, Wroc\u0142aw has a cool, continental feel and an impressive artistic heritage. What\u2019s more, in 2016 the city will be the European Capital of Culture and the Unesco World Book Capital.  Taking place in the chic nine-screen New Horizons Cinema, this year\u2019s 14th edition of the festival is screening 365 films, including 199 features, with 13 of those in the international competition: Sergio Caballero\u2019s The Distance, Benjam\u00edn Naishtat\u2019s History of Fear, and Lorenz Merz\u2019s Cherry Pie among them. Of the three Polish films in competition, Anka and Wilhelm Sasnal\u2019s Parasite was shown at this year\u2019s Berlinale in Germany.  An intriguing Films on Art competition offers gems from Florian Habicht\u2019s Pulp: a Film about Life, Death & Supermarkets to Jordi Morat\u00f3\u2019s delightful documentary, The Creator of the Jungle, about a man obsessed with making wooden tunnels and towers in scrubland near Barcelona. In the Panorama section of the programme, Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth\u2019s shrewdly photographed Nick Cave autobiopic, 20,000 Days on Earth, has proved a festival smash, as has Guillame Nicloux\u2019s Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq, a mockumentary in which the notoriously adversarial French writer has great fun (as does the audience) sending himself up. Among the Polish films, the dark brilliance of The Caged Swallow by Bartosz Warwas stands out. Add sections on European shorts, New Greek Cinema, a Ken Russell retrospective, a tribute to Cahiers du Cinema, and a nightly screening in the city\u2019s attractive market square, then you begin to appreciate the eclecticism of New Horizons. And it doesn\u2019t end there. Accompanying events provide further offbeat fun: marvel at the exhibition of Andrzej Klimowski\u2019s film posters, then head for Caf\u00e9 Cioran, a bar named after the tenebrous Romanian thinker, and open just one hour from midnight each night, before enjoying an aesthetic breakfast at the Glass and Ceramics gallery. On the final Saturday of the festival, Night of Nadodrze transforms the district\u2019s cafes and ateliers into performance spaces, while the city\u2019s medieval Arsenal hosts the festival club, nightly DJ sets with enough booze\u2019n\u2019food stations to supply the hipster picnics beneath the trees.  In between this dazzling roster of films and events, a free festival bike will help you cross the 100 or more bridges of Poland\u2019s \u201cLittle Venice\u201d. Wroc\u0142aw has clearly established itself as a happening place to be ahead of its big year in 2016, thanks in no small part to this thrillingly diverse festival.", "tags": ["Film industry", "Film", "Culture"], "title": "Festival radar: New Horizons international film festival, Poland"},{"date": "2014-07-31T17:20:44Z", "country": "poland", "content": "In Poland, an apple a day not only keeps the doctor away, it is now a political statement.

He\u2019s the producer in residence there for a year and so I think it was a nice way of being able to thank them.\u201dExpressing gratitude towards an offshoot of a multinational drinks company, albeit a not-for-profit one, might come across as disingenuous. But after spending time with Ware both in the London studio and in Amsterdam for the Kraviz session, it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t do anything she\u2019s not comfortable with (she once turned down a remix from a diminutive pop superstar on the basis that it was rubbish), and that the people she works and surrounds herself with on a daily basis need to be friends first, collaborators second. So while that early recording session for Tough Love may have been intimidating, the finished album features an impressive roster of collaborators \u2013 including Dev Hynes, Ed Sheeran, Miguel and production duo BenZel, AKA Two Inch Punch and Benny Blanco \u2013 who have since become close friends. In fact, such was Ware\u2019s desire to make her two-day studio session with Miguel as relaxed as possible, she got so drunk celebrating the first day that she could barely muster the energy for the second. \u201cI had the worst hangover,\u201d she sighs, resting her head in her hands as if the memory alone has drained all the blood from her body. \u201cI thought I was dying. Vomiting everywhere. Go to the second session and Miguel\u2019s there and he\u2019s fresh and I\u2019m just pale with mascara all over my face. I was just a mess.\u201dThe incongruity of having someone like Blanco \u2013 who has produced global pop hits for the likes of Rihanna, Maroon 5 and Kesha \u2013 working with a singer formerly prone to double-tracking her vocals in order to bury herself in the mix isn\u2019t lost on Ware. \u201cI joked with Benny and told him: \u2018This is going to be your least successful project ever. It has to be,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve developed a whole new group of friends that you would put in the music bracket, but they are very dear to me. Benny and Ben, who are BenZel, these are people I trust and who I call for advice. And yes, one of them happens to be a massive hitmaker, but I have to feel like there\u2019s a magic and trust with the people I work with.\u201dIt was through Blanco \u2013 whom she met in New York via mutual friends \u2013 that she got to work with Sheeran on the acoustic-led and romcom-ready epic Say You Love Me. It is, you feel, her first shot at a proper hit, a suggestion that causes her eyebrows to shoot up to meet her hairline. \u201cI think it\u2019s a classic, really well-written song,\u201d she mumbles sheepishly. \u201cIt shows another edge to my voice. Working with artists like Miguel and Ed pushed me vocally without them really knowing it. They\u2019re so talented and technically gifted so they\u2019d sing something and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yeah, that sounds wicked,\u2019 and then I\u2019d try it and be like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have to practise that.\u2019 For this album, I\u2019ve definitely found a confidence with using my voice. I think I was scared and hiding my vocal on the first one and I didn\u2019t want too much of an identity \u2013 I wanted it to just be smooth.\u201dAs with Devotion, Tough Love is an album the flits effortlessly between Radio 2-friendly ballads, such as the string-drenched Pieces, to the textured, Miguel-assisted Kind of \u2026 Sometimes \u2026 Maybe and the deliriously loved-up Champagne Kisses (which, she\u2019s keen to point out, isn\u2019t about \u201cexpensive blowies\u201d). It\u2019s a reflection of her ability to effortlessly straddle that previously untouched terrain between Best New Music write-ups on Pitchfork on the one hand and a guest appearances on The X Factor in Poland on the other (\u201cI\u2019m massive in Poland, I get like four bodyguards there,\u201d she laughs).\u201cI fucking loved doing The X Factor,\u201d she says unapologetically, when I suggest other artists might see it as bad for the brand. \u201cFor me, that was fucking brilliant. I think that\u2019s cool. I\u2019m very true to myself and I love pop music. So while I want it to sound relatively cool, I\u2019m not going to deny a massive hook.\u201d\u2022 The single Say You Love Me is out on 29 September, followed by the album Tough Love on 13 October, both on PMR/IslandRosie LoweA textured tapestry of burbling electronics and scattershot drum beats, London-based Rosie Lowe\u2019s fragile 2013 EP Right Thing \u2013 co-produced by Ware collaborator Dave Okumu \u2013 announced an intriguing new talent unafraid to manipulate genre barriers. Producer Paul Epworth was so impressed he signed her to his label Wolf Tone and is working on her debut album, due in early 2015. More melancholic perhaps than Ware\u2019s brand of nu soul, Lowe\u2019s songs tend to draw on her varied musical background \u2013 she sang in jazz bands from the age of 13 \u2013 to create moments of unnerving beauty.KwabsGhanaian-born, London-based Kwabena Sarkodee Adjepong, AKA Kwabs, has also worked with Dave Okumu on the undulating soul of Spirit Fade, a track taken from his debut EP, Wrong or Right. It\u2019s the title track \u2013 produced by the enigmatic Sohn, who\u2019s also worked with nu-soul practitioners Banks and Rhye \u2013 that fully showcases Kwabs\u2019 ability to melt his big soulful voice into the fidgety, electronic textures summoned by his producers. While that early EP overflowed with hooky melodies, its slightly inward-looking standpoint has been exploded on new single Walk, a string-drenched stomper aimed directly at radio playlists.Billie BlackWith influences including a host of jazz greats (she studied at the Guildhall School of Music) to sadface electronic singer James Blake and downcast R&B crooner Sampha, 19-year-old Billie Black makes the kind of breathy, modern soul that sounds simultaneously welcoming and strangely unnerving. I Don\u2019t Need Another Lover, for example, pulls off that Jessie Ware-esque trick of encasing a fairly straightforward love song in a constantly shifting, electronic-tinged setting, while I\u2019ve Waited For You sounds like finger tips tapping skin. A recent collaboration with 18-year-old producer Mura Masa on This Simple Pleasure also showcases how versatile her voice is \u2013 its featherlight tones gliding over more vibrant production.", "tags": ["Jessie Ware", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Soul", "Ed Sheeran", "Culture"], "title": "Jessie Ware on Tough Love, working with Miguel and getting mobbed in Poland"},{"date": "2014-09-10T17:32:40Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A decision by Russia to cut gas exports to Poland without warning has rekindled fears about Europe's reliance on Siberian gas at a time of increasing tension between Moscow and the west.The Polish state energy group, PGNiG, said it was trying to find out why volumes had been slashed by up to 24% when it had been exporting gas itself to Ukraine to make up for Russian shortfalls there.Its counterpart in Kiev, Ukrtransgaz, accused Kremlin-controlled Gazprom of penalising Poland and undermining onward gas supplies to Kiev.\"Today Russia started limiting gas supplies to Poland in order to disrupt the reverse (flows) from Poland that we receive ... Poland stopped reverse supplies to Ukraine in the range of 4m cubic metres,\" said Ihor Prokopiv, chief executive of Ukrtransgaz, according to the Russian news agency, RIA.Mutual suspicions are higher than at any point since the collapse of the Soviet Union, following the conflict in Ukraine and western accusations that Russia has augmented the rebellion in the east with its own troops. Moscow denies the claim.Nato last month estimated that more than 1,000 Russian soldiers were operating covertly in Ukraine, as part of a separatist effort to roll back advances by Kiev.Earlier Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said most Russian troops had now been withdrawn. \"According to the latest information I have received from our intelligence, 70% of Russian troops have been moved back across the border,\" he said. \"This further strengthens our hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects.\" Poroshenko said parts of east Ukraine would be given special status. But Ukraine would remain a sovereign and united entity, under a peace deal agreed in Minsk last Friday. But Ukrainians are anticipating a difficult winter ahead, reliant as they are on Russian gas to power their economy and heat their homes.Nick Perry, a British energy consultant, said that it was not surprising that Gazprom's actions had prompted a nervous response. \"Since the 1990s, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has been investigating how Europe would survive if they lost some of its biggest sources of gas for six months. People have been looking at this for a long time.\"But Gazprom sources insisted the shortfall could be attributed to maintenance work that was going on fields and pipelines ahead of the important winter season when demand is at its highest.A statement from the group sidestepped the issue by saying it was pumping gas to all destinations \"according to the resources available for exports and for the continuing pumping to storage facilities in the Russian Federation\".Jonathan Stern, a gas expert at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and a member of the EU-Russia Gas Advisory Council, believed there was more likely a technical, not a political problem.\"If Gazprom wanted to punish the Poles then it would not do so surely when the weather was warm and in breach of its contractual obligations,\" said Stern who met the Russians for a gas summit in Vienna this week. \"The Russians are acutely aware that any (commercial) moves at this time will be interpreted in the worst possible light (by the west).\"But energy has been at the centre of previous conflict. Gazprom cut off gas to Ukraine in June arguing that Kiev had not paid its bills but the move was interpreted in the west as an attempt to destabilise its southerly neighbour. Similar boycotts by Gazprom against Ukraine \u2013 usually in the middle of winter \u2013 have been imposed against Ukraine and others in the past decade.The latest upset comes as the European Union has drawn up deeper sanctions against Russia over its support for separatist rebels who have taken over parts of eastern Ukraine.Slovakia, a major hub for Russia gas exports to Europe, said volumes were steady on Wednesday, and operators in Hungary, Bosnia and Serbia said there was no disruption to their supplies.Igor Gorsky, a spokesman for Gazprom Transgaz Belarus, the Gazprom subsidiary that operates export pipelines via Belarus, said: \"There have been no extraordinary situations from our side, or any maintenance work, which could have an impact on supply volumes.\"Political relations between Warsaw and Moscow are particularly bad. Poland has lobbied the EU hard to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow, and it is to host elements of a new Nato rapid reaction force, created in response to the Russian intevention in Ukrainer.Gazprom supplies a third of Europe's gas and for many EU countries it is the main source of power for homes and industry but the Russian firm is a big revenue earner for the Kremlin and any volume cuts would damage the company and country financially.", "tags": ["Poland", "Gazprom", "Gas", "European Union", "Europe", "World news", "Business", "Ukraine", "Nato", "Energy industry", "Commodities"], "title": "Russia stokes tensions with the west by cutting gas exports to Poland"},{"date": "2014-08-01T12:18:48Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Festival name: MFF T-Mobile New Horizons international film festivalLocation: Wroc\u0142aw, Silesia, PolandWebsite: nowehoryzonty.plDates: Annually, 24 July to 3 August, 2014About: Poland\u2019s best-known film festival, New Horizons started life in Sanok in 2001 before moving to Cieszyn on the Polish/Czech border the following year. With an emphasis on films challenging cinematic conventions, the festival soon gained cult status and growing audiences, and, in 2006, moved to the city of Wroc\u0142aw. It proved a perfect match. Ensnared by the River Oder on one side and by the city moat on the other, Wroc\u0142aw has a cool, continental feel and an impressive artistic heritage. What\u2019s more, in 2016 the city will be the European Capital of Culture and the Unesco World Book Capital.  Taking place in the chic nine-screen New Horizons Cinema, this year\u2019s 14th edition of the festival is screening 365 films, including 199 features, with 13 of those in the international competition: Sergio Caballero\u2019s The Distance, Benjam\u00edn Naishtat\u2019s History of Fear, and Lorenz Merz\u2019s Cherry Pie among them. Of the three Polish films in competition, Anka and Wilhelm Sasnal\u2019s Parasite was shown at this year\u2019s Berlinale in Germany.  An intriguing Films on Art competition offers gems from Florian Habicht\u2019s Pulp: a Film about Life, Death & Supermarkets to Jordi Morat\u00f3\u2019s delightful documentary, The Creator of the Jungle, about a man obsessed with making wooden tunnels and towers in scrubland near Barcelona. In the Panorama section of the programme, Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth\u2019s shrewdly photographed Nick Cave autobiopic, 20,000 Days on Earth, has proved a festival smash, as has Guillame Nicloux\u2019s Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq, a mockumentary in which the notoriously adversarial French writer has great fun (as does the audience) sending himself up. Among the Polish films, the dark brilliance of The Caged Swallow by Bartosz Warwas stands out. Add sections on European shorts, New Greek Cinema, a Ken Russell retrospective, a tribute to Cahiers du Cinema, and a nightly screening in the city\u2019s attractive market square, then you begin to appreciate the eclecticism of New Horizons. And it doesn\u2019t end there. Accompanying events provide further offbeat fun: marvel at the exhibition of Andrzej Klimowski\u2019s film posters, then head for Caf\u00e9 Cioran, a bar named after the tenebrous Romanian thinker, and open just one hour from midnight each night, before enjoying an aesthetic breakfast at the Glass and Ceramics gallery. On the final Saturday of the festival, Night of Nadodrze transforms the district\u2019s cafes and ateliers into performance spaces, while the city\u2019s medieval Arsenal hosts the festival club, nightly DJ sets with enough booze\u2019n\u2019food stations to supply the hipster picnics beneath the trees.  In between this dazzling roster of films and events, a free festival bike will help you cross the 100 or more bridges of Poland\u2019s \u201cLittle Venice\u201d.

On Thursday the business newspaper Puls Biznesu published an editorial entitled \u201cStand against Putin: eat apples, drink cider\u201d after Russia banned apple imports from Poland.Several Poles have since endorsed the campaign on social media, publishing tongue-in-cheek photographs of themselves or others eating apples on Twitter with the hashtag #jedzjablka (#eatapples), including the head of the national security bureau, Stanislaw Koziej, MEP Roza Thun and presenters at national broadcaster Telewizja Polska. A Facebook page called Jedz Jablka Na Zlosc Putinowi (\u201cEat apples to annoy Putin\u201d) also sprang up overnight.The Polish agriculture minister, Marek Sawicki, said in an interview with Polish media that Russian consumers would eventually force Putin\u2019s government to overturn the ban.

Control freak. That\u2019s going to be reported in the Guardian: \u2018Jessie Ware, domestic prisoner\u2019.\u201d She\u2019s joking, but when we meet in her flat in south London to chat over caffeine-free tea, her usually easy-going demeanour is tinged with an undercurrent of mania. It\u2019s not surprising her nearest and dearest are trying to keep her away from any stimulants; a later misunderstanding about a caramel wafer leads to an outburst worthy of an East End gangster. But it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s on edge: as well as trying to organise her impending wedding in Greece (her mum calls during our interview with news on the venue: \u201cI bet that\u2019s my mum \u2026 It\u2019s my fucking mum! Sam, get it!\u201d), there\u2019s also the matter of her forthcoming second album, Tough Love, a mix of refined soul and crystalline pop.This juxtaposition between the artist (gregarious, deliciously foul-mouthed, prone to a good gossip) and the art (delicate, melancholic, sophisticated) is what makes Ware interesting. Cocooned in a loving relationship and on the cusp of marriage, she seems blissfully happy, yet Tough Love is littered with broken relationships. \u201cI\u2019m in a really happy stage of my life, but it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t write about things that affect me or that I relate to from the past,\u201d she says. \u201cSongwriting is about storytelling.\u201dHer new single, the weepy, gospel-tinged Say You Love, for example, was apparently not written with anyone in mind, but subconsciously dealt with the two years when she and Sam had split up. This lyrical focus on the bad times might have something to do with the fact that the mushy love songs she\u2019s written specifically for him tend to be the ones he dislikes. \u201cHe\u2019s never a fan of the ones I\u2019ve written about him,\u201d she laughs, legs tucked up beneath her chin. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Babe, I\u2019ve written you this song.\u2019 Nothing. One new song, You & I (Forever), is me celebrating the memory of the fact that he\u2019s proposed to me and that we\u2019ll be together for ever.\u201d She smiles, but then, and this is a very Jessie Ware thing to do, quickly adds: \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come across as saccharine.\u201dIt\u2019s telling that the creation of both Tough Love and her Mercury-nominated debut, Devotion, were marked by Ware\u2019s surprising lack of self-confidence. An early session for Devotion was curtailed after she burst into tears during an improvised singsong around the piano, while Tough Love featured a similar episode with a member of pop-songwriting royalty she asks me not to name. \u201cThe guy asked me to sit in the middle of the room while he played the piano and he told me to just sing and I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t do that,\u2019 and he said: \u2018No, just sing and I\u2019ll play.\u2019 I went in the other room and it reminded me of when I started writing the first album. I got a lump in my throat and was like: \u2018Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry.\u2019 I hate it. It felt like I was auditioning and soon as I\u2019m auditioning it gets scary.\u201dThis lack of confidence is surprising, I tell her, not least because her debut album peaked in the top five (\u201cIt was a slow week, I think,\u201d she counters) and Tough Love\u2019s featherlight title track and first single became her first UK top 40 single earlier this year. Again, her answer is self-deprecating: \u201cI mean, we say \u2018top 40\u2019 because 34 doesn\u2019t sound so good,\u201d she cackles, dunking a biscuit. \u201cBut no, it tells me my fans are really backing me. I felt very apologetic at the beginning. I felt like I had to earn this relationship and I\u2019m flabbergasted that that was the song that got me into the top 40, but I\u2019m not complaining.\u201dIn a pop world full of cloying ambition and singers swinging around naked on demolition equipment to get people\u2019s attention, the sense that Ware herself can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s all really happening is heartwarming. Ask her if she\u2019s ambitious enough to try to conquer the US, like fellow heart-on-their-sleeve crooners Sam Smith and Adele, and she\u2019ll say, that while it would be nice, she\u2019s keen to get the people in the UK to like her first. \u201cAs long as I can carry on touring and having a career, then I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says. During a recent festival appearance in Finland, a last-minute change in lineup meant she was bumped up the bill. Again, the response isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d imagine from the likes of Jessie J. \u201cI said: \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be on the main stage because no one\u2019s going to be there,\u2019 and my sound guy was just like: \u2018Jessie, shut up, just fucking enjoy it,\u2019 and then I did enjoy it.\u201d While it\u2019s great to have big brash pop stars who are keen to kick down every proverbial door to get where they need to be, Ware feels like a throwback to the likes of Sade or Annie Lennox, creators of classic, universal pop songs about love and heartbreak, delivered with genuine warmth.Nearly 30, and with a debut album released when she was 27 \u2013 practically geriatric in pop terms \u2013 her route to stardom feels almost accidental. The daughter of a news reporter, she studied to become a journalist, briefly working as a sportswriter at the Daily Mirror and then at the Jewish Chronicle, before realising that her love of being nosy couldn\u2019t hide the fact that, as she puts it, she \u201cwasn\u2019t very good at writing\u201d. Asked by her old schoolfriend Jack Pe\u00f1ate to sing backing vocals for him on tour, she met the artist and producer SBTRKT, who asked her to sing on the appropriately titled Nervous. That, in turn, started a working relationship with Red Bull Studios, which offered her a more relaxed environment in which to work on Devotion. \u201cBasically, Red Bull Studios asked me to do Nervous at their Notting Hill carnival party and after that I recorded [debut single] Strangest Feeling at their studio. I still find the idea of writing and recording songs fucking petrifying. It got a bit easier the second time round, but at their studio it\u2019s not intimidating. It\u2019s the most warm and inviting environment.\u201dWith half of Tough Love recorded at Red Bull Studios\u2019 London basement, and partly with their current in-house producer Julio Bashmore, Ware recently embarked on a remix project that involved visiting five of their studios across the world and getting five different producers \u2013 ranging from garage newcomer Preditah to Russian DJ Nina Kraviz \u2013 to remix the multilayered Keep On Lying. \u201cI just knew [Keep On Lying] would exist on the record as an album track but I wanted it to have a bit more of a spotlight on it,\u201d she explains. \u201cBashmore and I worked on it at their studios. He\u2019s the producer in residence there for a year and so I think it was a nice way of being able to thank them.\u201dExpressing gratitude towards an offshoot of a multinational drinks company, albeit a not-for-profit one, might come across as disingenuous.

So while I want it to sound relatively cool, I\u2019m not going to deny a massive hook.\u201d\u2022 The single Say You Love Me is out on 29 September, followed by the album Tough Love on 13 October, both on PMR/IslandRosie LoweA textured tapestry of burbling electronics and scattershot drum beats, London-based Rosie Lowe\u2019s fragile 2013 EP Right Thing \u2013 co-produced by Ware collaborator Dave Okumu \u2013 announced an intriguing new talent unafraid to manipulate genre barriers. Producer Paul Epworth was so impressed he signed her to his label Wolf Tone and is working on her debut album, due in early 2015. More melancholic perhaps than Ware\u2019s brand of nu soul, Lowe\u2019s songs tend to draw on her varied musical background \u2013 she sang in jazz bands from the age of 13 \u2013 to create moments of unnerving beauty.KwabsGhanaian-born, London-based Kwabena Sarkodee Adjepong, AKA Kwabs, has also worked with Dave Okumu on the undulating soul of Spirit Fade, a track taken from his debut EP, Wrong or Right. It\u2019s the title track \u2013 produced by the enigmatic Sohn, who\u2019s also worked with nu-soul practitioners Banks and Rhye \u2013 that fully showcases Kwabs\u2019 ability to melt his big soulful voice into the fidgety, electronic textures summoned by his producers. While that early EP overflowed with hooky melodies, its slightly inward-looking standpoint has been exploded on new single Walk, a string-drenched stomper aimed directly at radio playlists.Billie BlackWith influences including a host of jazz greats (she studied at the Guildhall School of Music) to sadface electronic singer James Blake and downcast R&B crooner Sampha, 19-year-old Billie Black makes the kind of breathy, modern soul that sounds simultaneously welcoming and strangely unnerving. I Don\u2019t Need Another Lover, for example, pulls off that Jessie Ware-esque trick of encasing a fairly straightforward love song in a constantly shifting, electronic-tinged setting, while I\u2019ve Waited For You sounds like finger tips tapping skin. A recent collaboration with 18-year-old producer Mura Masa on This Simple Pleasure also showcases how versatile her voice is \u2013 its featherlight tones gliding over more vibrant production.", "tags": ["Jessie Ware", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Soul", "Ed Sheeran", "Culture"], "title": "Jessie Ware on Tough Love, working with Miguel and getting mobbed in Poland"},{"date": "2014-09-10T17:32:40Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A decision by Russia to cut gas exports to Poland without warning has rekindled fears about Europe's reliance on Siberian gas at a time of increasing tension between Moscow and the west.The Polish state energy group, PGNiG, said it was trying to find out why volumes had been slashed by up to 24% when it had been exporting gas itself to Ukraine to make up for Russian shortfalls there.Its counterpart in Kiev, Ukrtransgaz, accused Kremlin-controlled Gazprom of penalising Poland and undermining onward gas supplies to Kiev.\"Today Russia started limiting gas supplies to Poland in order to disrupt the reverse (flows) from Poland that we receive ... Poland stopped reverse supplies to Ukraine in the range of 4m cubic metres,\" said Ihor Prokopiv, chief executive of Ukrtransgaz, according to the Russian news agency, RIA.Mutual suspicions are higher than at any point since the collapse of the Soviet Union, following the conflict in Ukraine and western accusations that Russia has augmented the rebellion in the east with its own troops. Moscow denies the claim.Nato last month estimated that more than 1,000 Russian soldiers were operating covertly in Ukraine, as part of a separatist effort to roll back advances by Kiev.Earlier Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said most Russian troops had now been withdrawn. \"According to the latest information I have received from our intelligence, 70% of Russian troops have been moved back across the border,\" he said. \"This further strengthens our hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects.\" Poroshenko said parts of east Ukraine would be given special status. But Ukraine would remain a sovereign and united entity, under a peace deal agreed in Minsk last Friday. But Ukrainians are anticipating a difficult winter ahead, reliant as they are on Russian gas to power their economy and heat their homes.Nick Perry, a British energy consultant, said that it was not surprising that Gazprom's actions had prompted a nervous response. \"Since the 1990s, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has been investigating how Europe would survive if they lost some of its biggest sources of gas for six months. People have been looking at this for a long time.\"But Gazprom sources insisted the shortfall could be attributed to maintenance work that was going on fields and pipelines ahead of the important winter season when demand is at its highest.A statement from the group sidestepped the issue by saying it was pumping gas to all destinations \"according to the resources available for exports and for the continuing pumping to storage facilities in the Russian Federation\".Jonathan Stern, a gas expert at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and a member of the EU-Russia Gas Advisory Council, believed there was more likely a technical, not a political problem.\"If Gazprom wanted to punish the Poles then it would not do so surely when the weather was warm and in breach of its contractual obligations,\" said Stern who met the Russians for a gas summit in Vienna this week. \"The Russians are acutely aware that any (commercial) moves at this time will be interpreted in the worst possible light (by the west).\"But energy has been at the centre of previous conflict. Gazprom cut off gas to Ukraine in June arguing that Kiev had not paid its bills but the move was interpreted in the west as an attempt to destabilise its southerly neighbour. Similar boycotts by Gazprom against Ukraine \u2013 usually in the middle of winter \u2013 have been imposed against Ukraine and others in the past decade.The latest upset comes as the European Union has drawn up deeper sanctions against Russia over its support for separatist rebels who have taken over parts of eastern Ukraine.Slovakia, a major hub for Russia gas exports to Europe, said volumes were steady on Wednesday, and operators in Hungary, Bosnia and Serbia said there was no disruption to their supplies.Igor Gorsky, a spokesman for Gazprom Transgaz Belarus, the Gazprom subsidiary that operates export pipelines via Belarus, said: \"There have been no extraordinary situations from our side, or any maintenance work, which could have an impact on supply volumes.\"Political relations between Warsaw and Moscow are particularly bad. Poland has lobbied the EU hard to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow, and it is to host elements of a new Nato rapid reaction force, created in response to the Russian intevention in Ukrainer.Gazprom supplies a third of Europe's gas and for many EU countries it is the main source of power for homes and industry but the Russian firm is a big revenue earner for the Kremlin and any volume cuts would damage the company and country financially.", "tags": ["Poland", "Gazprom", "Gas", "European Union", "Europe", "World news", "Business", "Ukraine", "Nato", "Energy industry", "Commodities"], "title": "Russia stokes tensions with the west by cutting gas exports to Poland"},{"date": "2014-08-31T15:52:24Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The elevation of Donald Tusk to one of the top jobs in Europe marks a coming of age for his native Poland. Ten years after joining the EU, Poland has secured the presidency of the European council and its prime minister has become the fixer for and mediator between Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Matteo Renzi, David Cameron and other European leaders.Tusk has already won the prestigious Charlemagne prize for leadership. The most recent winner, Herman Van Rompuy of Belgium, described Tusk late on Saturday as a \"European statesman\".Quiet, unassuming, firm and politically ruthless, the German-speaking centre-right liberal from Gdansk, the cradle of Poland's anti-communist, anti-Russian revolution, has been one of the EU's most successful and most pro-European prime ministers of recent years at a time when faith in the EU has been tested.The only Polish prime minister to win a second term since the collapse of communism in 1989, he has had a good crisis. Poland was the only EU country not to fall into recession as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, and the ensuing European debt and currency turmoil. Perhaps more importantly, under Tusk's seven years in charge of Poland and with the help of his anglophile foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, the country performed a strategic shift, redefining the country's national interest.Coming into the EU, Poland was a natural ally of Britain: big enough, on the fringes, liberal, free market and, for historical reasons, wary of the Franco-German dominion that ran the EU until the 2004 enlargement.Tusk inherited a Poland that was hostile to Russia and intensely suspicious of Germany, for good historical reasons. The alliance with the UK was reinforced by Britain's championing of Poland's membership against deep-seated west European reservations and by the UK's open-door policy for Polish migrants from 2004 when most others restricted\u00a0immigration.Under Tusk and Sikorski, this has all changed. The keen pro-Americanism waned, leaving a sour taste. Tusk and Sikorski concluded that Britain and David Cameron in particular were making a mess of their tactics and strategy in Europe and with other EU governments.Tusk bonded with Merkel, the EU's first among equals, cemented a close Polish-German alliance, and concluded that Poland's destiny rested on its closest possible European integration, setting it at odds with a UK travelling in the opposite direction.What impact such policies and strategies will have on his stewardship of EU summits is not clear. By definition, the president of the European council is at the mercy of the other leaders. But the agenda-setting and mediation powers that go with the job also allow him to shape to a degree the EU's direction.\"There are three big fundamental issues for the new president \u2013 the economy, Ukraine and the UK question,\" said a senior EU official. \"We may be on the edge of a new cold war with the Russians. There are huge economic challenges. And the UK issue will be very big.\"On all three, Tusk will have strong views. The rapid pace of change in eastern Europe over 20 years in the transition from communism to capitalism puts him on the Cameron reformist side of the economic argument.On Ukraine and Russia, Tusk and Poland have led the hawks in Europe on getting tough with Putin, although he will not be able to take Germany, France or Italy to places they do not want to go.On Britain, it will fall to Tusk to lead negotiations with Cameron, if he remains in power, on a so-called new deal rewriting the British terms of membership. \"The future of the EU is not about making it smaller, about contraction,\" he said after his appointment. \"No reasonable person can imagine the EU without the UK.\"But Tusk will not be the master of that negotiation, rather the messenger for what other EU leaders deem the limits of the possible in accommodating British demands. \"Now the name of the game for Cameron is to get a strong portfolio in the new commission,\" said the official, in reference to the next stage of the jobs-trading in Brussels, the formation, by Jean-Claude Juncker, of a new European commission over the next\u00a0fortnight.Juncker has considerable powers of discretion here. While he has competing national demands to balance, his priority is to construct a team that will secure the needed endorsement of a majority of the European parliament in October. \"Juncker has the leverage now,\" said the official. \"Cameron can only blame himself for making the Conservatives a fringe group. The British are not playing it very strongly. They have drifted too far away.\"The appointment of Tusk's partner, Federica Mogherini, the Italian foreign minister, as EU foreign policy chief, matters less for the simple reason that European foreign policy is still in gestation. Much will depend on what she is able to make of the job.For Matteo Renzi, the new young centre-left Italian prime minister, winning the post is double-edged. Domestically he will sell it as a triumph for Italy, securing one of the most prestigious posts. But the main decisions in Brussels affecting his country will be economic and financial within the European commission. Mogherini will be wrestling with foreign policy crises, clocking up a colossal number of air miles, and will largely be absent when those decisions are taken.", "tags": ["Europe", "Poland", "World news", "Angela Merkel", "Donald Tusk"], "title": "Donald Tusk's rise to European council president is a big moment for Poland"},{"date": "2014-08-01T12:18:48Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Festival name: MFF T-Mobile New Horizons international film festivalLocation: Wroc\u0142aw, Silesia, PolandWebsite: nowehoryzonty.plDates: Annually, 24 July to 3 August, 2014About: Poland\u2019s best-known film festival, New Horizons started life in Sanok in 2001 before moving to Cieszyn on the Polish/Czech border the following year. With an emphasis on films challenging cinematic conventions, the festival soon gained cult status and growing audiences, and, in 2006, moved to the city of Wroc\u0142aw. It proved a perfect match. Ensnared by the River Oder on one side and by the city moat on the other, Wroc\u0142aw has a cool, continental feel and an impressive artistic heritage. What\u2019s more, in 2016 the city will be the European Capital of Culture and the Unesco World Book Capital.  Taking place in the chic nine-screen New Horizons Cinema, this year\u2019s 14th edition of the festival is screening 365 films, including 199 features, with 13 of those in the international competition: Sergio Caballero\u2019s The Distance, Benjam\u00edn Naishtat\u2019s History of Fear, and Lorenz Merz\u2019s Cherry Pie among them. Of the three Polish films in competition, Anka and Wilhelm Sasnal\u2019s Parasite was shown at this year\u2019s Berlinale in Germany.  An intriguing Films on Art competition offers gems from Florian Habicht\u2019s Pulp: a Film about Life, Death & Supermarkets to Jordi Morat\u00f3\u2019s delightful documentary, The Creator of the Jungle, about a man obsessed with making wooden tunnels and towers in scrubland near Barcelona. In the Panorama section of the programme, Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth\u2019s shrewdly photographed Nick Cave autobiopic, 20,000 Days on Earth, has proved a festival smash, as has Guillame Nicloux\u2019s Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq, a mockumentary in which the notoriously adversarial French writer has great fun (as does the audience) sending himself up. Among the Polish films, the dark brilliance of The Caged Swallow by Bartosz Warwas stands out. Add sections on European shorts, New Greek Cinema, a Ken Russell retrospective, a tribute to Cahiers du Cinema, and a nightly screening in the city\u2019s attractive market square, then you begin to appreciate the eclecticism of New Horizons. And it doesn\u2019t end there. Accompanying events provide further offbeat fun: marvel at the exhibition of Andrzej Klimowski\u2019s film posters, then head for Caf\u00e9 Cioran, a bar named after the tenebrous Romanian thinker, and open just one hour from midnight each night, before enjoying an aesthetic breakfast at the Glass and Ceramics gallery. On the final Saturday of the festival, Night of Nadodrze transforms the district\u2019s cafes and ateliers into performance spaces, while the city\u2019s medieval Arsenal hosts the festival club, nightly DJ sets with enough booze\u2019n\u2019food stations to supply the hipster picnics beneath the trees.  In between this dazzling roster of films and events, a free festival bike will help you cross the 100 or more bridges of Poland\u2019s \u201cLittle Venice\u201d.

On Thursday the business newspaper Puls Biznesu published an editorial entitled \u201cStand against Putin: eat apples, drink cider\u201d after Russia banned apple imports from Poland.Several Poles have since endorsed the campaign on social media, publishing tongue-in-cheek photographs of themselves or others eating apples on Twitter with the hashtag #jedzjablka (#eatapples), including the head of the national security bureau, Stanislaw Koziej, MEP Roza Thun and presenters at national broadcaster Telewizja Polska.

Control freak. That\u2019s going to be reported in the Guardian: \u2018Jessie Ware, domestic prisoner\u2019.\u201d She\u2019s joking, but when we meet in her flat in south London to chat over caffeine-free tea, her usually easy-going demeanour is tinged with an undercurrent of mania. It\u2019s not surprising her nearest and dearest are trying to keep her away from any stimulants; a later misunderstanding about a caramel wafer leads to an outburst worthy of an East End gangster. But it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s on edge: as well as trying to organise her impending wedding in Greece (her mum calls during our interview with news on the venue: \u201cI bet that\u2019s my mum \u2026 It\u2019s my fucking mum! Sam, get it!\u201d), there\u2019s also the matter of her forthcoming second album, Tough Love, a mix of refined soul and crystalline pop.This juxtaposition between the artist (gregarious, deliciously foul-mouthed, prone to a good gossip) and the art (delicate, melancholic, sophisticated) is what makes Ware interesting. Cocooned in a loving relationship and on the cusp of marriage, she seems blissfully happy, yet Tough Love is littered with broken relationships. \u201cI\u2019m in a really happy stage of my life, but it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t write about things that affect me or that I relate to from the past,\u201d she says. \u201cSongwriting is about storytelling.\u201dHer new single, the weepy, gospel-tinged Say You Love, for example, was apparently not written with anyone in mind, but subconsciously dealt with the two years when she and Sam had split up. This lyrical focus on the bad times might have something to do with the fact that the mushy love songs she\u2019s written specifically for him tend to be the ones he dislikes. \u201cHe\u2019s never a fan of the ones I\u2019ve written about him,\u201d she laughs, legs tucked up beneath her chin. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Babe, I\u2019ve written you this song.\u2019 Nothing. One new song, You & I (Forever), is me celebrating the memory of the fact that he\u2019s proposed to me and that we\u2019ll be together for ever.\u201d She smiles, but then, and this is a very Jessie Ware thing to do, quickly adds: \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come across as saccharine.\u201dIt\u2019s telling that the creation of both Tough Love and her Mercury-nominated debut, Devotion, were marked by Ware\u2019s surprising lack of self-confidence. An early session for Devotion was curtailed after she burst into tears during an improvised singsong around the piano, while Tough Love featured a similar episode with a member of pop-songwriting royalty she asks me not to name. \u201cThe guy asked me to sit in the middle of the room while he played the piano and he told me to just sing and I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t do that,\u2019 and he said: \u2018No, just sing and I\u2019ll play.\u2019 I went in the other room and it reminded me of when I started writing the first album. I got a lump in my throat and was like: \u2018Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry.\u2019 I hate it. It felt like I was auditioning and soon as I\u2019m auditioning it gets scary.\u201dThis lack of confidence is surprising, I tell her, not least because her debut album peaked in the top five (\u201cIt was a slow week, I think,\u201d she counters) and Tough Love\u2019s featherlight title track and first single became her first UK top 40 single earlier this year. Again, her answer is self-deprecating: \u201cI mean, we say \u2018top 40\u2019 because 34 doesn\u2019t sound so good,\u201d she cackles, dunking a biscuit. \u201cBut no, it tells me my fans are really backing me. I felt very apologetic at the beginning. I felt like I had to earn this relationship and I\u2019m flabbergasted that that was the song that got me into the top 40, but I\u2019m not complaining.\u201dIn a pop world full of cloying ambition and singers swinging around naked on demolition equipment to get people\u2019s attention, the sense that Ware herself can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s all really happening is heartwarming. Ask her if she\u2019s ambitious enough to try to conquer the US, like fellow heart-on-their-sleeve crooners Sam Smith and Adele, and she\u2019ll say, that while it would be nice, she\u2019s keen to get the people in the UK to like her first. \u201cAs long as I can carry on touring and having a career, then I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says. During a recent festival appearance in Finland, a last-minute change in lineup meant she was bumped up the bill. Again, the response isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d imagine from the likes of Jessie J. \u201cI said: \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be on the main stage because no one\u2019s going to be there,\u2019 and my sound guy was just like: \u2018Jessie, shut up, just fucking enjoy it,\u2019 and then I did enjoy it.\u201d While it\u2019s great to have big brash pop stars who are keen to kick down every proverbial door to get where they need to be, Ware feels like a throwback to the likes of Sade or Annie Lennox, creators of classic, universal pop songs about love and heartbreak, delivered with genuine warmth.Nearly 30, and with a debut album released when she was 27 \u2013 practically geriatric in pop terms \u2013 her route to stardom feels almost accidental. The daughter of a news reporter, she studied to become a journalist, briefly working as a sportswriter at the Daily Mirror and then at the Jewish Chronicle, before realising that her love of being nosy couldn\u2019t hide the fact that, as she puts it, she \u201cwasn\u2019t very good at writing\u201d. Asked by her old schoolfriend Jack Pe\u00f1ate to sing backing vocals for him on tour, she met the artist and producer SBTRKT, who asked her to sing on the appropriately titled Nervous. That, in turn, started a working relationship with Red Bull Studios, which offered her a more relaxed environment in which to work on Devotion. \u201cBasically, Red Bull Studios asked me to do Nervous at their Notting Hill carnival party and after that I recorded [debut single] Strangest Feeling at their studio. I still find the idea of writing and recording songs fucking petrifying. It got a bit easier the second time round, but at their studio it\u2019s not intimidating. It\u2019s the most warm and inviting environment.\u201dWith half of Tough Love recorded at Red Bull Studios\u2019 London basement, and partly with their current in-house producer Julio Bashmore, Ware recently embarked on a remix project that involved visiting five of their studios across the world and getting five different producers \u2013 ranging from garage newcomer Preditah to Russian DJ Nina Kraviz \u2013 to remix the multilayered Keep On Lying. \u201cI just knew [Keep On Lying] would exist on the record as an album track but I wanted it to have a bit more of a spotlight on it,\u201d she explains. \u201cBashmore and I worked on it at their studios. He\u2019s the producer in residence there for a year and so I think it was a nice way of being able to thank them.\u201dExpressing gratitude towards an offshoot of a multinational drinks company, albeit a not-for-profit one, might come across as disingenuous. But after spending time with Ware both in the London studio and in Amsterdam for the Kraviz session, it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t do anything she\u2019s not comfortable with (she once turned down a remix from a diminutive pop superstar on the basis that it was rubbish), and that the people she works and surrounds herself with on a daily basis need to be friends first, collaborators second. So while that early recording session for Tough Love may have been intimidating, the finished album features an impressive roster of collaborators \u2013 including Dev Hynes, Ed Sheeran, Miguel and production duo BenZel, AKA Two Inch Punch and Benny Blanco \u2013 who have since become close friends. In fact, such was Ware\u2019s desire to make her two-day studio session with Miguel as relaxed as possible, she got so drunk celebrating the first day that she could barely muster the energy for the second. \u201cI had the worst hangover,\u201d she sighs, resting her head in her hands as if the memory alone has drained all the blood from her body. \u201cI thought I was dying. Vomiting everywhere. Go to the second session and Miguel\u2019s there and he\u2019s fresh and I\u2019m just pale with mascara all over my face. I was just a mess.\u201dThe incongruity of having someone like Blanco \u2013 who has produced global pop hits for the likes of Rihanna, Maroon 5 and Kesha \u2013 working with a singer formerly prone to double-tracking her vocals in order to bury herself in the mix isn\u2019t lost on Ware. \u201cI joked with Benny and told him: \u2018This is going to be your least successful project ever. It has to be,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve developed a whole new group of friends that you would put in the music bracket, but they are very dear to me. Benny and Ben, who are BenZel, these are people I trust and who I call for advice. And yes, one of them happens to be a massive hitmaker, but I have to feel like there\u2019s a magic and trust with the people I work with.\u201dIt was through Blanco \u2013 whom she met in New York via mutual friends \u2013 that she got to work with Sheeran on the acoustic-led and romcom-ready epic Say You Love Me. It is, you feel, her first shot at a proper hit, a suggestion that causes her eyebrows to shoot up to meet her hairline. \u201cI think it\u2019s a classic, really well-written song,\u201d she mumbles sheepishly. \u201cIt shows another edge to my voice. Working with artists like Miguel and Ed pushed me vocally without them really knowing it. They\u2019re so talented and technically gifted so they\u2019d sing something and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yeah, that sounds wicked,\u2019 and then I\u2019d try it and be like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have to practise that.\u2019 For this album, I\u2019ve definitely found a confidence with using my voice. I think I was scared and hiding my vocal on the first one and I didn\u2019t want too much of an identity \u2013 I wanted it to just be smooth.\u201dAs with Devotion, Tough Love is an album the flits effortlessly between Radio 2-friendly ballads, such as the string-drenched Pieces, to the textured, Miguel-assisted Kind of \u2026 Sometimes \u2026 Maybe and the deliriously loved-up Champagne Kisses (which, she\u2019s keen to point out, isn\u2019t about \u201cexpensive blowies\u201d). It\u2019s a reflection of her ability to effortlessly straddle that previously untouched terrain between Best New Music write-ups on Pitchfork on the one hand and a guest appearances on The X Factor in Poland on the other (\u201cI\u2019m massive in Poland, I get like four bodyguards there,\u201d she laughs).\u201cI fucking loved doing The X Factor,\u201d she says unapologetically, when I suggest other artists might see it as bad for the brand. \u201cFor me, that was fucking brilliant. I think that\u2019s cool. I\u2019m very true to myself and I love pop music. So while I want it to sound relatively cool, I\u2019m not going to deny a massive hook.\u201d\u2022 The single Say You Love Me is out on 29 September, followed by the album Tough Love on 13 October, both on PMR/IslandRosie LoweA textured tapestry of burbling electronics and scattershot drum beats, London-based Rosie Lowe\u2019s fragile 2013 EP Right Thing \u2013 co-produced by Ware collaborator Dave Okumu \u2013 announced an intriguing new talent unafraid to manipulate genre barriers. Producer Paul Epworth was so impressed he signed her to his label Wolf Tone and is working on her debut album, due in early 2015. More melancholic perhaps than Ware\u2019s brand of nu soul, Lowe\u2019s songs tend to draw on her varied musical background \u2013 she sang in jazz bands from the age of 13 \u2013 to create moments of unnerving beauty.KwabsGhanaian-born, London-based Kwabena Sarkodee Adjepong, AKA Kwabs, has also worked with Dave Okumu on the undulating soul of Spirit Fade, a track taken from his debut EP, Wrong or Right. It\u2019s the title track \u2013 produced by the enigmatic Sohn, who\u2019s also worked with nu-soul practitioners Banks and Rhye \u2013 that fully showcases Kwabs\u2019 ability to melt his big soulful voice into the fidgety, electronic textures summoned by his producers. While that early EP overflowed with hooky melodies, its slightly inward-looking standpoint has been exploded on new single Walk, a string-drenched stomper aimed directly at radio playlists.Billie BlackWith influences including a host of jazz greats (she studied at the Guildhall School of Music) to sadface electronic singer James Blake and downcast R&B crooner Sampha, 19-year-old Billie Black makes the kind of breathy, modern soul that sounds simultaneously welcoming and strangely unnerving. I Don\u2019t Need Another Lover, for example, pulls off that Jessie Ware-esque trick of encasing a fairly straightforward love song in a constantly shifting, electronic-tinged setting, while I\u2019ve Waited For You sounds like finger tips tapping skin. A recent collaboration with 18-year-old producer Mura Masa on This Simple Pleasure also showcases how versatile her voice is \u2013 its featherlight tones gliding over more vibrant production.", "tags": ["Jessie Ware", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Soul", "Ed Sheeran", "Culture"], "title": "Jessie Ware on Tough Love, working with Miguel and getting mobbed in Poland"},{"date": "2014-09-10T17:32:40Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A decision by Russia to cut gas exports to Poland without warning has rekindled fears about Europe's reliance on Siberian gas at a time of increasing tension between Moscow and the west.The Polish state energy group, PGNiG, said it was trying to find out why volumes had been slashed by up to 24% when it had been exporting gas itself to Ukraine to make up for Russian shortfalls there.Its counterpart in Kiev, Ukrtransgaz, accused Kremlin-controlled Gazprom of penalising Poland and undermining onward gas supplies to Kiev.\"Today Russia started limiting gas supplies to Poland in order to disrupt the reverse (flows) from Poland that we receive ... Poland stopped reverse supplies to Ukraine in the range of 4m cubic metres,\" said Ihor Prokopiv, chief executive of Ukrtransgaz, according to the Russian news agency, RIA.Mutual suspicions are higher than at any point since the collapse of the Soviet Union, following the conflict in Ukraine and western accusations that Russia has augmented the rebellion in the east with its own troops. Moscow denies the claim.Nato last month estimated that more than 1,000 Russian soldiers were operating covertly in Ukraine, as part of a separatist effort to roll back advances by Kiev.Earlier Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said most Russian troops had now been withdrawn. \"According to the latest information I have received from our intelligence, 70% of Russian troops have been moved back across the border,\" he said. \"This further strengthens our hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects.\" Poroshenko said parts of east Ukraine would be given special status. But Ukraine would remain a sovereign and united entity, under a peace deal agreed in Minsk last Friday. But Ukrainians are anticipating a difficult winter ahead, reliant as they are on Russian gas to power their economy and heat their homes.Nick Perry, a British energy consultant, said that it was not surprising that Gazprom's actions had prompted a nervous response. \"Since the 1990s, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has been investigating how Europe would survive if they lost some of its biggest sources of gas for six months. People have been looking at this for a long time.\"But Gazprom sources insisted the shortfall could be attributed to maintenance work that was going on fields and pipelines ahead of the important winter season when demand is at its highest.A statement from the group sidestepped the issue by saying it was pumping gas to all destinations \"according to the resources available for exports and for the continuing pumping to storage facilities in the Russian Federation\".Jonathan Stern, a gas expert at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and a member of the EU-Russia Gas Advisory Council, believed there was more likely a technical, not a political problem.\"If Gazprom wanted to punish the Poles then it would not do so surely when the weather was warm and in breach of its contractual obligations,\" said Stern who met the Russians for a gas summit in Vienna this week. \"The Russians are acutely aware that any (commercial) moves at this time will be interpreted in the worst possible light (by the west).\"But energy has been at the centre of previous conflict. Gazprom cut off gas to Ukraine in June arguing that Kiev had not paid its bills but the move was interpreted in the west as an attempt to destabilise its southerly neighbour. Similar boycotts by Gazprom against Ukraine \u2013 usually in the middle of winter \u2013 have been imposed against Ukraine and others in the past decade.The latest upset comes as the European Union has drawn up deeper sanctions against Russia over its support for separatist rebels who have taken over parts of eastern Ukraine.Slovakia, a major hub for Russia gas exports to Europe, said volumes were steady on Wednesday, and operators in Hungary, Bosnia and Serbia said there was no disruption to their supplies.Igor Gorsky, a spokesman for Gazprom Transgaz Belarus, the Gazprom subsidiary that operates export pipelines via Belarus, said: \"There have been no extraordinary situations from our side, or any maintenance work, which could have an impact on supply volumes.\"Political relations between Warsaw and Moscow are particularly bad. Poland has lobbied the EU hard to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow, and it is to host elements of a new Nato rapid reaction force, created in response to the Russian intevention in Ukrainer.Gazprom supplies a third of Europe's gas and for many EU countries it is the main source of power for homes and industry but the Russian firm is a big revenue earner for the Kremlin and any volume cuts would damage the company and country financially.", "tags": ["Poland", "Gazprom", "Gas", "European Union", "Europe", "World news", "Business", "Ukraine", "Nato", "Energy industry", "Commodities"], "title": "Russia stokes tensions with the west by cutting gas exports to Poland"},{"date": "2014-08-31T15:52:24Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The elevation of Donald Tusk to one of the top jobs in Europe marks a coming of age for his native Poland. Ten years after joining the EU, Poland has secured the presidency of the European council and its prime minister has become the fixer for and mediator between Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Matteo Renzi, David Cameron and other European leaders.Tusk has already won the prestigious Charlemagne prize for leadership. The most recent winner, Herman Van Rompuy of Belgium, described Tusk late on Saturday as a \"European statesman\".Quiet, unassuming, firm and politically ruthless, the German-speaking centre-right liberal from Gdansk, the cradle of Poland's anti-communist, anti-Russian revolution, has been one of the EU's most successful and most pro-European prime ministers of recent years at a time when faith in the EU has been tested.The only Polish prime minister to win a second term since the collapse of communism in 1989, he has had a good crisis. Poland was the only EU country not to fall into recession as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, and the ensuing European debt and currency turmoil. Perhaps more importantly, under Tusk's seven years in charge of Poland and with the help of his anglophile foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, the country performed a strategic shift, redefining the country's national interest.Coming into the EU, Poland was a natural ally of Britain: big enough, on the fringes, liberal, free market and, for historical reasons, wary of the Franco-German dominion that ran the EU until the 2004 enlargement.Tusk inherited a Poland that was hostile to Russia and intensely suspicious of Germany, for good historical reasons. The alliance with the UK was reinforced by Britain's championing of Poland's membership against deep-seated west European reservations and by the UK's open-door policy for Polish migrants from 2004 when most others restricted\u00a0immigration.Under Tusk and Sikorski, this has all changed. The keen pro-Americanism waned, leaving a sour taste. Tusk and Sikorski concluded that Britain and David Cameron in particular were making a mess of their tactics and strategy in Europe and with other EU governments.Tusk bonded with Merkel, the EU's first among equals, cemented a close Polish-German alliance, and concluded that Poland's destiny rested on its closest possible European integration, setting it at odds with a UK travelling in the opposite direction.What impact such policies and strategies will have on his stewardship of EU summits is not clear. By definition, the president of the European council is at the mercy of the other leaders. But the agenda-setting and mediation powers that go with the job also allow him to shape to a degree the EU's direction.\"There are three big fundamental issues for the new president \u2013 the economy, Ukraine and the UK question,\" said a senior EU official. \"We may be on the edge of a new cold war with the Russians. There are huge economic challenges. And the UK issue will be very big.\"On all three, Tusk will have strong views. The rapid pace of change in eastern Europe over 20 years in the transition from communism to capitalism puts him on the Cameron reformist side of the economic argument.On Ukraine and Russia, Tusk and Poland have led the hawks in Europe on getting tough with Putin, although he will not be able to take Germany, France or Italy to places they do not want to go.On Britain, it will fall to Tusk to lead negotiations with Cameron, if he remains in power, on a so-called new deal rewriting the British terms of membership. \"The future of the EU is not about making it smaller, about contraction,\" he said after his appointment. \"No reasonable person can imagine the EU without the UK.\"But Tusk will not be the master of that negotiation, rather the messenger for what other EU leaders deem the limits of the possible in accommodating British demands. \"Now the name of the game for Cameron is to get a strong portfolio in the new commission,\" said the official, in reference to the next stage of the jobs-trading in Brussels, the formation, by Jean-Claude Juncker, of a new European commission over the next\u00a0fortnight.Juncker has considerable powers of discretion here. While he has competing national demands to balance, his priority is to construct a team that will secure the needed endorsement of a majority of the European parliament in October. \"Juncker has the leverage now,\" said the official. \"Cameron can only blame himself for making the Conservatives a fringe group. The British are not playing it very strongly. They have drifted too far away.\"The appointment of Tusk's partner, Federica Mogherini, the Italian foreign minister, as EU foreign policy chief, matters less for the simple reason that European foreign policy is still in gestation. Much will depend on what she is able to make of the job.For Matteo Renzi, the new young centre-left Italian prime minister, winning the post is double-edged. Domestically he will sell it as a triumph for Italy, securing one of the most prestigious posts. But the main decisions in Brussels affecting his country will be economic and financial within the European commission. Mogherini will be wrestling with foreign policy crises, clocking up a colossal number of air miles, and will largely be absent when those decisions are taken.", "tags": ["Europe", "Poland", "World news", "Angela Merkel", "Donald Tusk"], "title": "Donald Tusk's rise to European council president is a big moment for Poland"},{"date": "2014-09-02T13:43:53Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Michel Platini touched down on the runway that separates Spain from Gibraltar in May. Uefa\u2019s president had come to visit its 54th and newest member. He had enjoyed the occasion, he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that the members of Uefa will enjoy football in Gibraltar more when it is returned to us,\u201d snapped the president of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, a one-time member of the far-right political party Fuerza Nueva. \u201cWe\u2019ll invite them then.\u201dBut if Tebas was bitter, and if the political undercurrent is unavoidable, particularly with moves towards official status coming in the midst of a dispute between Spain and the Rock, provoking long queues at the border, warships on the sea and sabre rattling in parliament, for football fans in Gibraltar there is only excitement.Platini had been invited to attend the Rock Cup final. And now, having been accepted as a member of Uefa, Gibraltar are preparing to play their first ever official competitive match, against Poland.Gibraltar was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 and the Gibraltar FA was founded in 1895. They had been trying to gain acceptance to international football since 1999. Fifa passed the decision on to Uefa, which initially resisted on the grounds that Gibraltar is not a sovereign state but it was forced to back down by the Court of Arbitration for Sport because that stipulation was not in force when Gibraltar first applied for membership.Spain resisted, with the national federation threatening to pull out if Gibraltar was included. But in October 2012 it was provisionally allowed in and formal acceptance followed in May 2013. Platini said that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of members had voted to include them. Spain did not. The Gib team\u2019s manager, Allen Bula, insisted that this was no political act and nor were they trying to make a statement; Gibraltar just wanted to play football.Platini\u2019s appearance at the Rock Cup was his first trip to see them. If he wants to do so again this time, he will have to travel 150 miles west. Gibraltar do not have a grass pitch, with games being played on the astroturf at Victoria stadium, right next to the airport runway. A new stadium is being built on Europa Point, on the southside of the rock. But until then they must look elsewhere. Spain\u2019s Football Federation have refused to play Gibraltar and will not host them, so the game will be held in the Est\u00e1dio Algarve in Portugal.They have been there before: around 500 fans travelled for a 0-0 draw with Slovakia in November last year. Since then Gibraltar have celebrated their first ever official goal, Roy Chipolina scoring in a 4-1 loss to the Faroe Islands, and their first ever victory, thanks to a Kyle Casciaro strikeeffort against Malta. Now comes their first ever competitive match. Poland are joined in the group by the world champions, Germany, while Scotland and the Republic of Ireland are there too.With a population of 28,000 Gibraltar are the smallest member of Uefa, just behind San Marino. When their squad was named for this game it included three England-based players: Preston North End\u2019s Scott Wiseman, Jake Gosling from Bristol Rovers and Adam Priestly, who plays for Farsley in the Northern Counties East football League. Gibraltar\u2019s strongest side, Lincoln Red Imps, account for 10 of their players.Gibraltar have played five official games, winning one, drawing two and losing two. They have taken on tiny nations. Now they will take on Robert Lewandowski and his team-mates, then the world champions. They do not expect to qualify and nor do they expect to win often, if at all, but that does not matter, as the excitement surrounding this game and a meeting with Germany shows.

With an emphasis on films challenging cinematic conventions, the festival soon gained cult status and growing audiences, and, in 2006, moved to the city of Wroc\u0142aw. It proved a perfect match. Ensnared by the River Oder on one side and by the city moat on the other, Wroc\u0142aw has a cool, continental feel and an impressive artistic heritage. What\u2019s more, in 2016 the city will be the European Capital of Culture and the Unesco World Book Capital.  Taking place in the chic nine-screen New Horizons Cinema, this year\u2019s 14th edition of the festival is screening 365 films, including 199 features, with 13 of those in the international competition: Sergio Caballero\u2019s The Distance, Benjam\u00edn Naishtat\u2019s History of Fear, and Lorenz Merz\u2019s Cherry Pie among them. Of the three Polish films in competition, Anka and Wilhelm Sasnal\u2019s Parasite was shown at this year\u2019s Berlinale in Germany.  An intriguing Films on Art competition offers gems from Florian Habicht\u2019s Pulp: a Film about Life, Death & Supermarkets to Jordi Morat\u00f3\u2019s delightful documentary, The Creator of the Jungle, about a man obsessed with making wooden tunnels and towers in scrubland near Barcelona. In the Panorama section of the programme, Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth\u2019s shrewdly photographed Nick Cave autobiopic, 20,000 Days on Earth, has proved a festival smash, as has Guillame Nicloux\u2019s Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq, a mockumentary in which the notoriously adversarial French writer has great fun (as does the audience) sending himself up. Among the Polish films, the dark brilliance of The Caged Swallow by Bartosz Warwas stands out. Add sections on European shorts, New Greek Cinema, a Ken Russell retrospective, a tribute to Cahiers du Cinema, and a nightly screening in the city\u2019s attractive market square, then you begin to appreciate the eclecticism of New Horizons. And it doesn\u2019t end there. Accompanying events provide further offbeat fun: marvel at the exhibition of Andrzej Klimowski\u2019s film posters, then head for Caf\u00e9 Cioran, a bar named after the tenebrous Romanian thinker, and open just one hour from midnight each night, before enjoying an aesthetic breakfast at the Glass and Ceramics gallery. On the final Saturday of the festival, Night of Nadodrze transforms the district\u2019s cafes and ateliers into performance spaces, while the city\u2019s medieval Arsenal hosts the festival club, nightly DJ sets with enough booze\u2019n\u2019food stations to supply the hipster picnics beneath the trees.

On Thursday the business newspaper Puls Biznesu published an editorial entitled \u201cStand against Putin: eat apples, drink cider\u201d after Russia banned apple imports from Poland.Several Poles have since endorsed the campaign on social media, publishing tongue-in-cheek photographs of themselves or others eating apples on Twitter with the hashtag #jedzjablka (#eatapples), including the head of the national security bureau, Stanislaw Koziej, MEP Roza Thun and presenters at national broadcaster Telewizja Polska. A Facebook page called Jedz Jablka Na Zlosc Putinowi (\u201cEat apples to annoy Putin\u201d) also sprang up overnight.The Polish agriculture minister, Marek Sawicki, said in an interview with Polish media that Russian consumers would eventually force Putin\u2019s government to overturn the ban. He added that the ministry was hoping to find new markets for its fruit growers in China, Japan and Vietnam.The Russian ban on certain fruit and vegetables, including apples, pears, cherries, nectarines, plums, and varieties of cabbage, was announced on Monday while EU leaders were debating the latest round of sanctions against Russian businesses, and will come into effect on Friday.

Control freak. That\u2019s going to be reported in the Guardian: \u2018Jessie Ware, domestic prisoner\u2019.\u201d She\u2019s joking, but when we meet in her flat in south London to chat over caffeine-free tea, her usually easy-going demeanour is tinged with an undercurrent of mania. It\u2019s not surprising her nearest and dearest are trying to keep her away from any stimulants; a later misunderstanding about a caramel wafer leads to an outburst worthy of an East End gangster. But it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s on edge: as well as trying to organise her impending wedding in Greece (her mum calls during our interview with news on the venue: \u201cI bet that\u2019s my mum \u2026 It\u2019s my fucking mum! Sam, get it!\u201d), there\u2019s also the matter of her forthcoming second album, Tough Love, a mix of refined soul and crystalline pop.This juxtaposition between the artist (gregarious, deliciously foul-mouthed, prone to a good gossip) and the art (delicate, melancholic, sophisticated) is what makes Ware interesting. Cocooned in a loving relationship and on the cusp of marriage, she seems blissfully happy, yet Tough Love is littered with broken relationships. \u201cI\u2019m in a really happy stage of my life, but it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t write about things that affect me or that I relate to from the past,\u201d she says. \u201cSongwriting is about storytelling.\u201dHer new single, the weepy, gospel-tinged Say You Love, for example, was apparently not written with anyone in mind, but subconsciously dealt with the two years when she and Sam had split up. This lyrical focus on the bad times might have something to do with the fact that the mushy love songs she\u2019s written specifically for him tend to be the ones he dislikes. \u201cHe\u2019s never a fan of the ones I\u2019ve written about him,\u201d she laughs, legs tucked up beneath her chin. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Babe, I\u2019ve written you this song.\u2019 Nothing. One new song, You & I (Forever), is me celebrating the memory of the fact that he\u2019s proposed to me and that we\u2019ll be together for ever.\u201d She smiles, but then, and this is a very Jessie Ware thing to do, quickly adds: \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come across as saccharine.\u201dIt\u2019s telling that the creation of both Tough Love and her Mercury-nominated debut, Devotion, were marked by Ware\u2019s surprising lack of self-confidence. An early session for Devotion was curtailed after she burst into tears during an improvised singsong around the piano, while Tough Love featured a similar episode with a member of pop-songwriting royalty she asks me not to name. \u201cThe guy asked me to sit in the middle of the room while he played the piano and he told me to just sing and I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t do that,\u2019 and he said: \u2018No, just sing and I\u2019ll play.\u2019 I went in the other room and it reminded me of when I started writing the first album. I got a lump in my throat and was like: \u2018Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry.\u2019 I hate it. It felt like I was auditioning and soon as I\u2019m auditioning it gets scary.\u201dThis lack of confidence is surprising, I tell her, not least because her debut album peaked in the top five (\u201cIt was a slow week, I think,\u201d she counters) and Tough Love\u2019s featherlight title track and first single became her first UK top 40 single earlier this year. Again, her answer is self-deprecating: \u201cI mean, we say \u2018top 40\u2019 because 34 doesn\u2019t sound so good,\u201d she cackles, dunking a biscuit. \u201cBut no, it tells me my fans are really backing me. I felt very apologetic at the beginning. I felt like I had to earn this relationship and I\u2019m flabbergasted that that was the song that got me into the top 40, but I\u2019m not complaining.\u201dIn a pop world full of cloying ambition and singers swinging around naked on demolition equipment to get people\u2019s attention, the sense that Ware herself can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s all really happening is heartwarming. Ask her if she\u2019s ambitious enough to try to conquer the US, like fellow heart-on-their-sleeve crooners Sam Smith and Adele, and she\u2019ll say, that while it would be nice, she\u2019s keen to get the people in the UK to like her first. \u201cAs long as I can carry on touring and having a career, then I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says. During a recent festival appearance in Finland, a last-minute change in lineup meant she was bumped up the bill. Again, the response isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d imagine from the likes of Jessie J. \u201cI said: \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be on the main stage because no one\u2019s going to be there,\u2019 and my sound guy was just like: \u2018Jessie, shut up, just fucking enjoy it,\u2019 and then I did enjoy it.\u201d While it\u2019s great to have big brash pop stars who are keen to kick down every proverbial door to get where they need to be, Ware feels like a throwback to the likes of Sade or Annie Lennox, creators of classic, universal pop songs about love and heartbreak, delivered with genuine warmth.Nearly 30, and with a debut album released when she was 27 \u2013 practically geriatric in pop terms \u2013 her route to stardom feels almost accidental. The daughter of a news reporter, she studied to become a journalist, briefly working as a sportswriter at the Daily Mirror and then at the Jewish Chronicle, before realising that her love of being nosy couldn\u2019t hide the fact that, as she puts it, she \u201cwasn\u2019t very good at writing\u201d. Asked by her old schoolfriend Jack Pe\u00f1ate to sing backing vocals for him on tour, she met the artist and producer SBTRKT, who asked her to sing on the appropriately titled Nervous. That, in turn, started a working relationship with Red Bull Studios, which offered her a more relaxed environment in which to work on Devotion. \u201cBasically, Red Bull Studios asked me to do Nervous at their Notting Hill carnival party and after that I recorded [debut single] Strangest Feeling at their studio. I still find the idea of writing and recording songs fucking petrifying. It got a bit easier the second time round, but at their studio it\u2019s not intimidating. It\u2019s the most warm and inviting environment.\u201dWith half of Tough Love recorded at Red Bull Studios\u2019 London basement, and partly with their current in-house producer Julio Bashmore, Ware recently embarked on a remix project that involved visiting five of their studios across the world and getting five different producers \u2013 ranging from garage newcomer Preditah to Russian DJ Nina Kraviz \u2013 to remix the multilayered Keep On Lying. \u201cI just knew [Keep On Lying] would exist on the record as an album track but I wanted it to have a bit more of a spotlight on it,\u201d she explains. \u201cBashmore and I worked on it at their studios. He\u2019s the producer in residence there for a year and so I think it was a nice way of being able to thank them.\u201dExpressing gratitude towards an offshoot of a multinational drinks company, albeit a not-for-profit one, might come across as disingenuous. But after spending time with Ware both in the London studio and in Amsterdam for the Kraviz session, it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t do anything she\u2019s not comfortable with (she once turned down a remix from a diminutive pop superstar on the basis that it was rubbish), and that the people she works and surrounds herself with on a daily basis need to be friends first, collaborators second. So while that early recording session for Tough Love may have been intimidating, the finished album features an impressive roster of collaborators \u2013 including Dev Hynes, Ed Sheeran, Miguel and production duo BenZel, AKA Two Inch Punch and Benny Blanco \u2013 who have since become close friends. In fact, such was Ware\u2019s desire to make her two-day studio session with Miguel as relaxed as possible, she got so drunk celebrating the first day that she could barely muster the energy for the second. \u201cI had the worst hangover,\u201d she sighs, resting her head in her hands as if the memory alone has drained all the blood from her body. \u201cI thought I was dying. Vomiting everywhere. Go to the second session and Miguel\u2019s there and he\u2019s fresh and I\u2019m just pale with mascara all over my face. I was just a mess.\u201dThe incongruity of having someone like Blanco \u2013 who has produced global pop hits for the likes of Rihanna, Maroon 5 and Kesha \u2013 working with a singer formerly prone to double-tracking her vocals in order to bury herself in the mix isn\u2019t lost on Ware. \u201cI joked with Benny and told him: \u2018This is going to be your least successful project ever. It has to be,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve developed a whole new group of friends that you would put in the music bracket, but they are very dear to me. Benny and Ben, who are BenZel, these are people I trust and who I call for advice. And yes, one of them happens to be a massive hitmaker, but I have to feel like there\u2019s a magic and trust with the people I work with.\u201dIt was through Blanco \u2013 whom she met in New York via mutual friends \u2013 that she got to work with Sheeran on the acoustic-led and romcom-ready epic Say You Love Me. It is, you feel, her first shot at a proper hit, a suggestion that causes her eyebrows to shoot up to meet her hairline. \u201cI think it\u2019s a classic, really well-written song,\u201d she mumbles sheepishly. \u201cIt shows another edge to my voice. Working with artists like Miguel and Ed pushed me vocally without them really knowing it. They\u2019re so talented and technically gifted so they\u2019d sing something and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yeah, that sounds wicked,\u2019 and then I\u2019d try it and be like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have to practise that.\u2019 For this album, I\u2019ve definitely found a confidence with using my voice. I think I was scared and hiding my vocal on the first one and I didn\u2019t want too much of an identity \u2013 I wanted it to just be smooth.\u201dAs with Devotion, Tough Love is an album the flits effortlessly between Radio 2-friendly ballads, such as the string-drenched Pieces, to the textured, Miguel-assisted Kind of \u2026 Sometimes \u2026 Maybe and the deliriously loved-up Champagne Kisses (which, she\u2019s keen to point out, isn\u2019t about \u201cexpensive blowies\u201d). It\u2019s a reflection of her ability to effortlessly straddle that previously untouched terrain between Best New Music write-ups on Pitchfork on the one hand and a guest appearances on The X Factor in Poland on the other (\u201cI\u2019m massive in Poland, I get like four bodyguards there,\u201d she laughs).\u201cI fucking loved doing The X Factor,\u201d she says unapologetically, when I suggest other artists might see it as bad for the brand. \u201cFor me, that was fucking brilliant. I think that\u2019s cool. I\u2019m very true to myself and I love pop music. So while I want it to sound relatively cool, I\u2019m not going to deny a massive hook.\u201d\u2022 The single Say You Love Me is out on 29 September, followed by the album Tough Love on 13 October, both on PMR/IslandRosie LoweA textured tapestry of burbling electronics and scattershot drum beats, London-based Rosie Lowe\u2019s fragile 2013 EP Right Thing \u2013 co-produced by Ware collaborator Dave Okumu \u2013 announced an intriguing new talent unafraid to manipulate genre barriers. Producer Paul Epworth was so impressed he signed her to his label Wolf Tone and is working on her debut album, due in early 2015. More melancholic perhaps than Ware\u2019s brand of nu soul, Lowe\u2019s songs tend to draw on her varied musical background \u2013 she sang in jazz bands from the age of 13 \u2013 to create moments of unnerving beauty.KwabsGhanaian-born, London-based Kwabena Sarkodee Adjepong, AKA Kwabs, has also worked with Dave Okumu on the undulating soul of Spirit Fade, a track taken from his debut EP, Wrong or Right. It\u2019s the title track \u2013 produced by the enigmatic Sohn, who\u2019s also worked with nu-soul practitioners Banks and Rhye \u2013 that fully showcases Kwabs\u2019 ability to melt his big soulful voice into the fidgety, electronic textures summoned by his producers. While that early EP overflowed with hooky melodies, its slightly inward-looking standpoint has been exploded on new single Walk, a string-drenched stomper aimed directly at radio playlists.Billie BlackWith influences including a host of jazz greats (she studied at the Guildhall School of Music) to sadface electronic singer James Blake and downcast R&B crooner Sampha, 19-year-old Billie Black makes the kind of breathy, modern soul that sounds simultaneously welcoming and strangely unnerving. I Don\u2019t Need Another Lover, for example, pulls off that Jessie Ware-esque trick of encasing a fairly straightforward love song in a constantly shifting, electronic-tinged setting, while I\u2019ve Waited For You sounds like finger tips tapping skin. A recent collaboration with 18-year-old producer Mura Masa on This Simple Pleasure also showcases how versatile her voice is \u2013 its featherlight tones gliding over more vibrant production.", "tags": ["Jessie Ware", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Soul", "Ed Sheeran", "Culture"], "title": "Jessie Ware on Tough Love, working with Miguel and getting mobbed in Poland"},{"date": "2014-09-10T17:32:40Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A decision by Russia to cut gas exports to Poland without warning has rekindled fears about Europe's reliance on Siberian gas at a time of increasing tension between Moscow and the west.The Polish state energy group, PGNiG, said it was trying to find out why volumes had been slashed by up to 24% when it had been exporting gas itself to Ukraine to make up for Russian shortfalls there.Its counterpart in Kiev, Ukrtransgaz, accused Kremlin-controlled Gazprom of penalising Poland and undermining onward gas supplies to Kiev.\"Today Russia started limiting gas supplies to Poland in order to disrupt the reverse (flows) from Poland that we receive ... Poland stopped reverse supplies to Ukraine in the range of 4m cubic metres,\" said Ihor Prokopiv, chief executive of Ukrtransgaz, according to the Russian news agency, RIA.Mutual suspicions are higher than at any point since the collapse of the Soviet Union, following the conflict in Ukraine and western accusations that Russia has augmented the rebellion in the east with its own troops. Moscow denies the claim.Nato last month estimated that more than 1,000 Russian soldiers were operating covertly in Ukraine, as part of a separatist effort to roll back advances by Kiev.Earlier Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said most Russian troops had now been withdrawn. \"According to the latest information I have received from our intelligence, 70% of Russian troops have been moved back across the border,\" he said. \"This further strengthens our hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects.\" Poroshenko said parts of east Ukraine would be given special status. But Ukraine would remain a sovereign and united entity, under a peace deal agreed in Minsk last Friday. But Ukrainians are anticipating a difficult winter ahead, reliant as they are on Russian gas to power their economy and heat their homes.Nick Perry, a British energy consultant, said that it was not surprising that Gazprom's actions had prompted a nervous response. \"Since the 1990s, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has been investigating how Europe would survive if they lost some of its biggest sources of gas for six months. People have been looking at this for a long time.\"But Gazprom sources insisted the shortfall could be attributed to maintenance work that was going on fields and pipelines ahead of the important winter season when demand is at its highest.A statement from the group sidestepped the issue by saying it was pumping gas to all destinations \"according to the resources available for exports and for the continuing pumping to storage facilities in the Russian Federation\".Jonathan Stern, a gas expert at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and a member of the EU-Russia Gas Advisory Council, believed there was more likely a technical, not a political problem.\"If Gazprom wanted to punish the Poles then it would not do so surely when the weather was warm and in breach of its contractual obligations,\" said Stern who met the Russians for a gas summit in Vienna this week. \"The Russians are acutely aware that any (commercial) moves at this time will be interpreted in the worst possible light (by the west).\"But energy has been at the centre of previous conflict. Gazprom cut off gas to Ukraine in June arguing that Kiev had not paid its bills but the move was interpreted in the west as an attempt to destabilise its southerly neighbour. Similar boycotts by Gazprom against Ukraine \u2013 usually in the middle of winter \u2013 have been imposed against Ukraine and others in the past decade.The latest upset comes as the European Union has drawn up deeper sanctions against Russia over its support for separatist rebels who have taken over parts of eastern Ukraine.Slovakia, a major hub for Russia gas exports to Europe, said volumes were steady on Wednesday, and operators in Hungary, Bosnia and Serbia said there was no disruption to their supplies.Igor Gorsky, a spokesman for Gazprom Transgaz Belarus, the Gazprom subsidiary that operates export pipelines via Belarus, said: \"There have been no extraordinary situations from our side, or any maintenance work, which could have an impact on supply volumes.\"Political relations between Warsaw and Moscow are particularly bad. Poland has lobbied the EU hard to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow, and it is to host elements of a new Nato rapid reaction force, created in response to the Russian intevention in Ukrainer.Gazprom supplies a third of Europe's gas and for many EU countries it is the main source of power for homes and industry but the Russian firm is a big revenue earner for the Kremlin and any volume cuts would damage the company and country financially.", "tags": ["Poland", "Gazprom", "Gas", "European Union", "Europe", "World news", "Business", "Ukraine", "Nato", "Energy industry", "Commodities"], "title": "Russia stokes tensions with the west by cutting gas exports to Poland"},{"date": "2014-08-31T15:52:24Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The elevation of Donald Tusk to one of the top jobs in Europe marks a coming of age for his native Poland. Ten years after joining the EU, Poland has secured the presidency of the European council and its prime minister has become the fixer for and mediator between Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Matteo Renzi, David Cameron and other European leaders.Tusk has already won the prestigious Charlemagne prize for leadership. The most recent winner, Herman Van Rompuy of Belgium, described Tusk late on Saturday as a \"European statesman\".Quiet, unassuming, firm and politically ruthless, the German-speaking centre-right liberal from Gdansk, the cradle of Poland's anti-communist, anti-Russian revolution, has been one of the EU's most successful and most pro-European prime ministers of recent years at a time when faith in the EU has been tested.The only Polish prime minister to win a second term since the collapse of communism in 1989, he has had a good crisis. Poland was the only EU country not to fall into recession as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, and the ensuing European debt and currency turmoil. Perhaps more importantly, under Tusk's seven years in charge of Poland and with the help of his anglophile foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, the country performed a strategic shift, redefining the country's national interest.Coming into the EU, Poland was a natural ally of Britain: big enough, on the fringes, liberal, free market and, for historical reasons, wary of the Franco-German dominion that ran the EU until the 2004 enlargement.Tusk inherited a Poland that was hostile to Russia and intensely suspicious of Germany, for good historical reasons. The alliance with the UK was reinforced by Britain's championing of Poland's membership against deep-seated west European reservations and by the UK's open-door policy for Polish migrants from 2004 when most others restricted\u00a0immigration.Under Tusk and Sikorski, this has all changed. The keen pro-Americanism waned, leaving a sour taste. Tusk and Sikorski concluded that Britain and David Cameron in particular were making a mess of their tactics and strategy in Europe and with other EU governments.Tusk bonded with Merkel, the EU's first among equals, cemented a close Polish-German alliance, and concluded that Poland's destiny rested on its closest possible European integration, setting it at odds with a UK travelling in the opposite direction.What impact such policies and strategies will have on his stewardship of EU summits is not clear. By definition, the president of the European council is at the mercy of the other leaders. But the agenda-setting and mediation powers that go with the job also allow him to shape to a degree the EU's direction.\"There are three big fundamental issues for the new president \u2013 the economy, Ukraine and the UK question,\" said a senior EU official. \"We may be on the edge of a new cold war with the Russians. There are huge economic challenges. And the UK issue will be very big.\"On all three, Tusk will have strong views. The rapid pace of change in eastern Europe over 20 years in the transition from communism to capitalism puts him on the Cameron reformist side of the economic argument.On Ukraine and Russia, Tusk and Poland have led the hawks in Europe on getting tough with Putin, although he will not be able to take Germany, France or Italy to places they do not want to go.On Britain, it will fall to Tusk to lead negotiations with Cameron, if he remains in power, on a so-called new deal rewriting the British terms of membership. \"The future of the EU is not about making it smaller, about contraction,\" he said after his appointment. \"No reasonable person can imagine the EU without the UK.\"But Tusk will not be the master of that negotiation, rather the messenger for what other EU leaders deem the limits of the possible in accommodating British demands. \"Now the name of the game for Cameron is to get a strong portfolio in the new commission,\" said the official, in reference to the next stage of the jobs-trading in Brussels, the formation, by Jean-Claude Juncker, of a new European commission over the next\u00a0fortnight.Juncker has considerable powers of discretion here. While he has competing national demands to balance, his priority is to construct a team that will secure the needed endorsement of a majority of the European parliament in October. \"Juncker has the leverage now,\" said the official. \"Cameron can only blame himself for making the Conservatives a fringe group. The British are not playing it very strongly. They have drifted too far away.\"The appointment of Tusk's partner, Federica Mogherini, the Italian foreign minister, as EU foreign policy chief, matters less for the simple reason that European foreign policy is still in gestation. Much will depend on what she is able to make of the job.For Matteo Renzi, the new young centre-left Italian prime minister, winning the post is double-edged. Domestically he will sell it as a triumph for Italy, securing one of the most prestigious posts. But the main decisions in Brussels affecting his country will be economic and financial within the European commission. Mogherini will be wrestling with foreign policy crises, clocking up a colossal number of air miles, and will largely be absent when those decisions are taken.", "tags": ["Europe", "Poland", "World news", "Angela Merkel", "Donald Tusk"], "title": "Donald Tusk's rise to European council president is a big moment for Poland"},{"date": "2014-09-02T13:43:53Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Michel Platini touched down on the runway that separates Spain from Gibraltar in May. Uefa\u2019s president had come to visit its 54th and newest member. He had enjoyed the occasion, he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that the members of Uefa will enjoy football in Gibraltar more when it is returned to us,\u201d snapped the president of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, a one-time member of the far-right political party Fuerza Nueva. \u201cWe\u2019ll invite them then.\u201dBut if Tebas was bitter, and if the political undercurrent is unavoidable, particularly with moves towards official status coming in the midst of a dispute between Spain and the Rock, provoking long queues at the border, warships on the sea and sabre rattling in parliament, for football fans in Gibraltar there is only excitement.Platini had been invited to attend the Rock Cup final. And now, having been accepted as a member of Uefa, Gibraltar are preparing to play their first ever official competitive match, against Poland.Gibraltar was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 and the Gibraltar FA was founded in 1895. They had been trying to gain acceptance to international football since 1999. Fifa passed the decision on to Uefa, which initially resisted on the grounds that Gibraltar is not a sovereign state but it was forced to back down by the Court of Arbitration for Sport because that stipulation was not in force when Gibraltar first applied for membership.Spain resisted, with the national federation threatening to pull out if Gibraltar was included. But in October 2012 it was provisionally allowed in and formal acceptance followed in May 2013. Platini said that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of members had voted to include them. Spain did not. The Gib team\u2019s manager, Allen Bula, insisted that this was no political act and nor were they trying to make a statement; Gibraltar just wanted to play football.Platini\u2019s appearance at the Rock Cup was his first trip to see them. If he wants to do so again this time, he will have to travel 150 miles west. Gibraltar do not have a grass pitch, with games being played on the astroturf at Victoria stadium, right next to the airport runway. A new stadium is being built on Europa Point, on the southside of the rock. But until then they must look elsewhere. Spain\u2019s Football Federation have refused to play Gibraltar and will not host them, so the game will be held in the Est\u00e1dio Algarve in Portugal.They have been there before: around 500 fans travelled for a 0-0 draw with Slovakia in November last year. Since then Gibraltar have celebrated their first ever official goal, Roy Chipolina scoring in a 4-1 loss to the Faroe Islands, and their first ever victory, thanks to a Kyle Casciaro strikeeffort against Malta. Now comes their first ever competitive match. Poland are joined in the group by the world champions, Germany, while Scotland and the Republic of Ireland are there too.With a population of 28,000 Gibraltar are the smallest member of Uefa, just behind San Marino. When their squad was named for this game it included three England-based players: Preston North End\u2019s Scott Wiseman, Jake Gosling from Bristol Rovers and Adam Priestly, who plays for Farsley in the Northern Counties East football League. Gibraltar\u2019s strongest side, Lincoln Red Imps, account for 10 of their players.Gibraltar have played five official games, winning one, drawing two and losing two. They have taken on tiny nations. Now they will take on Robert Lewandowski and his team-mates, then the world champions. They do not expect to qualify and nor do they expect to win often, if at all, but that does not matter, as the excitement surrounding this game and a meeting with Germany shows. Just playing them is something to celebrate.", "tags": ["Gibraltar", "Euro 2016 qualifiers", "Football", "Michel Platini", "Gibraltar", "Poland", "Europe", "Bristol Rovers", "Preston North End", "World news", "Euro 2016"], "title": "Gibraltar head to Portugal to play Poland in first competitive match"},{"date": "2014-07-24T10:56:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland became the first EU country held to account for its involvement in the CIA's extraordinary rendition programme on Thursday when the European court of human rights found it guilty of the unlawful detention and torture of two men at a secret prison in the north of the country after 9/11.In two damning judgments, the court also ruled that the Polish government had failed to conduct a proper investigation into the episode, and ordered it to pay \u20ac100,000 (\u00a379,000) compensation to each of the men, who are currently held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The rulings are the first in a series of cases being brought against European states, with Lithuania and Romania also facing accusations that they allowed the CIA to open secret prisons on their territory.The case against Poland was brought by two men, Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, a Saudi-born Palestinian known as Abu Zubaydah, and Saudi national Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.Abu Zubaydah was initially detained in Pakistan in 2002 and accused of being a senior al-Qaida figure, although there has since been some doubt over the role he may have played. He was flown to Poland from a CIA prison in Thailand in December 2002, remaining there until September the following year.Nashiri is accused of masterminding the October 2000 suicide bomb attack against the USS Cole, in which 17 people died, and is facing prosecution before a military commission. He was flown to Poland on the same executive jet as Abu Zubaydah, and transferred to Morocco the following June.The court heard that the two men were held at a prison codenamed Quartz that the CIA operated at the Stare Kiejkuty military base in the north-east of the country.The judgment in the Abu Zubaydah case recounted how he had described being repeatedly beaten, confined in a small box, and brought out to be repeatedly waterboarded.\"I was\u00a0\u2026 put on what looked like a hospital bed, and strapped down very tightly with belts. A black cloth was then placed over my face and the interrogators used a mineral water bottle to pour water on the cloth so that I could not breathe. After a few minutes the cloth was removed and the bed was rotated into an upright position.\"The bed was then again lowered to horizontal position and the same torture carried out again with the black cloth over my face and water poured on from a bottle. I struggled against the straps, trying to breathe, but it was hopeless. I thought I was going to die.\"The court said that Abu Zubaydah's continuing detention without trial was \"a flagrant denial of justice\". In addition to the compensation, given because of what was described as the \"extreme seriousness of the violations\" of the European convention of human rights, Abu Zubaydah was awarded \u20ac30,000 costs.The judgment in the Nashiri case described how he had been kept naked, subjected to mock executions, hoisted by his wrists while his arms were shackled behind his back, and told that his mother would be sexually abused before him.The two unanimous rulings found that the rendition programme was completely illegal, as its rationale had been \"specifically to remove those persons from any legal protection against torture and enforced disappearance and to strip them of any safeguards afforded by both the US constitution and international law\".The court at Strasbourg said it was inconceivable that the rendition aircraft could have landed in Poland, and that the CIA could have operated the prison on Polish territory, without the Polish authorities being aware. \"It is also inconceivable that activities of that character and scale, possibly vital for the country's military and political interests, could have been undertaken on Polish territory without Poland's knowledge and without the necessary authorisation being given at the appropriate level of the state authorities.\"It also ruled that the Polish government must seek assurances from the US that Nashiri will not face the death penalty.The Guardian reported more than seven years ago on the existence of the secret CIA prison on Polish soil, quoting the former director of a nearby airport who witnessed the rendition aircraft being met by military vehicles with blacked-out windows.\"On one occasion an American lady \u2013 I was told she was from the embassy \u2013 came with the man who made the payments. She was standing in front of the airport office when the military vehicles left. She turned her back on the vehicles. It seemed as if she did not want to be a witness.\"Since then, the Polish authorities have said that they have been conducting their own investigation, but have faced accusations that it has been drawn-out and ineffective. The European court ruled that the Polish response failed to provide an effective remedy, and that it too amounted to a breach of the European convention on human rights.Amrit Singh, a lawyer at the Open Society Justice Initiative who represented Nashiri, said: \"This is a historic ruling by the European court of human rights, which has become the first court to confirm the existence of a secret CIA torture centre on Polish soil between 2002 and 2003, where our client was held and tortured.\"The court's findings include a damning indictment of the US military commission system, where our client is now facing trial for his life, and also a condemnation of the death penalty itself.\"Joseph Margulies, one of Abu Zubaydah's American lawyers, said: \"It's always gratifying when a court speaks truth to power. The question now is whether Poland will listen. The rule of law demands more than words on a page. It demands justice.\"A Polish presidential spokeswoman, Joanna Trzaska-Wieczorek, said: \"The ruling of the tribunal in Strasbourg on CIA jails is embarrassing for Poland and is a burden both in terms of our country's finances as well as its image.\"She added that it was possible the government would appeal.", "tags": ["Poland", "Human rights", "European court of human rights", "Europe", "World news", "Al-Qaida", "CIA", "US news", "Law", "Rendition"], "title": "Poland broke human rights convention on al-Qaida suspects held by the CIA"},{"date": "2014-08-01T12:18:48Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Festival name: MFF T-Mobile New Horizons international film festivalLocation: Wroc\u0142aw, Silesia, PolandWebsite: nowehoryzonty.plDates: Annually, 24 July to 3 August, 2014About: Poland\u2019s best-known film festival, New Horizons started life in Sanok in 2001 before moving to Cieszyn on the Polish/Czech border the following year. With an emphasis on films challenging cinematic conventions, the festival soon gained cult status and growing audiences, and, in 2006, moved to the city of Wroc\u0142aw. It proved a perfect match. Ensnared by the River Oder on one side and by the city moat on the other, Wroc\u0142aw has a cool, continental feel and an impressive artistic heritage. What\u2019s more, in 2016 the city will be the European Capital of Culture and the Unesco World Book Capital.  Taking place in the chic nine-screen New Horizons Cinema, this year\u2019s 14th edition of the festival is screening 365 films, including 199 features, with 13 of those in the international competition: Sergio Caballero\u2019s The Distance, Benjam\u00edn Naishtat\u2019s History of Fear, and Lorenz Merz\u2019s Cherry Pie among them. Of the three Polish films in competition, Anka and Wilhelm Sasnal\u2019s Parasite was shown at this year\u2019s Berlinale in Germany.  An intriguing Films on Art competition offers gems from Florian Habicht\u2019s Pulp: a Film about Life, Death & Supermarkets to Jordi Morat\u00f3\u2019s delightful documentary, The Creator of the Jungle, about a man obsessed with making wooden tunnels and towers in scrubland near Barcelona. In the Panorama section of the programme, Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth\u2019s shrewdly photographed Nick Cave autobiopic, 20,000 Days on Earth, has proved a festival smash, as has Guillame Nicloux\u2019s Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq, a mockumentary in which the notoriously adversarial French writer has great fun (as does the audience) sending himself up. Among the Polish films, the dark brilliance of The Caged Swallow by Bartosz Warwas stands out. Add sections on European shorts, New Greek Cinema, a Ken Russell retrospective, a tribute to Cahiers du Cinema, and a nightly screening in the city\u2019s attractive market square, then you begin to appreciate the eclecticism of New Horizons. And it doesn\u2019t end there. Accompanying events provide further offbeat fun: marvel at the exhibition of Andrzej Klimowski\u2019s film posters, then head for Caf\u00e9 Cioran, a bar named after the tenebrous Romanian thinker, and open just one hour from midnight each night, before enjoying an aesthetic breakfast at the Glass and Ceramics gallery. On the final Saturday of the festival, Night of Nadodrze transforms the district\u2019s cafes and ateliers into performance spaces, while the city\u2019s medieval Arsenal hosts the festival club, nightly DJ sets with enough booze\u2019n\u2019food stations to supply the hipster picnics beneath the trees.  In between this dazzling roster of films and events, a free festival bike will help you cross the 100 or more bridges of Poland\u2019s \u201cLittle Venice\u201d.

Control freak. That\u2019s going to be reported in the Guardian: \u2018Jessie Ware, domestic prisoner\u2019.\u201d She\u2019s joking, but when we meet in her flat in south London to chat over caffeine-free tea, her usually easy-going demeanour is tinged with an undercurrent of mania. It\u2019s not surprising her nearest and dearest are trying to keep her away from any stimulants; a later misunderstanding about a caramel wafer leads to an outburst worthy of an East End gangster. But it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s on edge: as well as trying to organise her impending wedding in Greece (her mum calls during our interview with news on the venue: \u201cI bet that\u2019s my mum \u2026 It\u2019s my fucking mum! Sam, get it!\u201d), there\u2019s also the matter of her forthcoming second album, Tough Love, a mix of refined soul and crystalline pop.This juxtaposition between the artist (gregarious, deliciously foul-mouthed, prone to a good gossip) and the art (delicate, melancholic, sophisticated) is what makes Ware interesting. Cocooned in a loving relationship and on the cusp of marriage, she seems blissfully happy, yet Tough Love is littered with broken relationships. \u201cI\u2019m in a really happy stage of my life, but it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t write about things that affect me or that I relate to from the past,\u201d she says. \u201cSongwriting is about storytelling.\u201dHer new single, the weepy, gospel-tinged Say You Love, for example, was apparently not written with anyone in mind, but subconsciously dealt with the two years when she and Sam had split up. This lyrical focus on the bad times might have something to do with the fact that the mushy love songs she\u2019s written specifically for him tend to be the ones he dislikes. \u201cHe\u2019s never a fan of the ones I\u2019ve written about him,\u201d she laughs, legs tucked up beneath her chin. \u201cI\u2019m like: \u2018Babe, I\u2019ve written you this song.\u2019 Nothing. One new song, You & I (Forever), is me celebrating the memory of the fact that he\u2019s proposed to me and that we\u2019ll be together for ever.\u201d She smiles, but then, and this is a very Jessie Ware thing to do, quickly adds: \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t come across as saccharine.\u201dIt\u2019s telling that the creation of both Tough Love and her Mercury-nominated debut, Devotion, were marked by Ware\u2019s surprising lack of self-confidence. An early session for Devotion was curtailed after she burst into tears during an improvised singsong around the piano, while Tough Love featured a similar episode with a member of pop-songwriting royalty she asks me not to name. \u201cThe guy asked me to sit in the middle of the room while he played the piano and he told me to just sing and I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t do that,\u2019 and he said: \u2018No, just sing and I\u2019ll play.\u2019 I went in the other room and it reminded me of when I started writing the first album. I got a lump in my throat and was like: \u2018Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry.\u2019 I hate it. It felt like I was auditioning and soon as I\u2019m auditioning it gets scary.\u201dThis lack of confidence is surprising, I tell her, not least because her debut album peaked in the top five (\u201cIt was a slow week, I think,\u201d she counters) and Tough Love\u2019s featherlight title track and first single became her first UK top 40 single earlier this year. Again, her answer is self-deprecating: \u201cI mean, we say \u2018top 40\u2019 because 34 doesn\u2019t sound so good,\u201d she cackles, dunking a biscuit. \u201cBut no, it tells me my fans are really backing me. I felt very apologetic at the beginning. I felt like I had to earn this relationship and I\u2019m flabbergasted that that was the song that got me into the top 40, but I\u2019m not complaining.\u201dIn a pop world full of cloying ambition and singers swinging around naked on demolition equipment to get people\u2019s attention, the sense that Ware herself can\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s all really happening is heartwarming. Ask her if she\u2019s ambitious enough to try to conquer the US, like fellow heart-on-their-sleeve crooners Sam Smith and Adele, and she\u2019ll say, that while it would be nice, she\u2019s keen to get the people in the UK to like her first. \u201cAs long as I can carry on touring and having a career, then I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says. During a recent festival appearance in Finland, a last-minute change in lineup meant she was bumped up the bill. Again, the response isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019d imagine from the likes of Jessie J. \u201cI said: \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be on the main stage because no one\u2019s going to be there,\u2019 and my sound guy was just like: \u2018Jessie, shut up, just fucking enjoy it,\u2019 and then I did enjoy it.\u201d While it\u2019s great to have big brash pop stars who are keen to kick down every proverbial door to get where they need to be, Ware feels like a throwback to the likes of Sade or Annie Lennox, creators of classic, universal pop songs about love and heartbreak, delivered with genuine warmth.Nearly 30, and with a debut album released when she was 27 \u2013 practically geriatric in pop terms \u2013 her route to stardom feels almost accidental. The daughter of a news reporter, she studied to become a journalist, briefly working as a sportswriter at the Daily Mirror and then at the Jewish Chronicle, before realising that her love of being nosy couldn\u2019t hide the fact that, as she puts it, she \u201cwasn\u2019t very good at writing\u201d. Asked by her old schoolfriend Jack Pe\u00f1ate to sing backing vocals for him on tour, she met the artist and producer SBTRKT, who asked her to sing on the appropriately titled Nervous. That, in turn, started a working relationship with Red Bull Studios, which offered her a more relaxed environment in which to work on Devotion. \u201cBasically, Red Bull Studios asked me to do Nervous at their Notting Hill carnival party and after that I recorded [debut single] Strangest Feeling at their studio. I still find the idea of writing and recording songs fucking petrifying. It got a bit easier the second time round, but at their studio it\u2019s not intimidating. It\u2019s the most warm and inviting environment.\u201dWith half of Tough Love recorded at Red Bull Studios\u2019 London basement, and partly with their current in-house producer Julio Bashmore, Ware recently embarked on a remix project that involved visiting five of their studios across the world and getting five different producers \u2013 ranging from garage newcomer Preditah to Russian DJ Nina Kraviz \u2013 to remix the multilayered Keep On Lying. \u201cI just knew [Keep On Lying] would exist on the record as an album track but I wanted it to have a bit more of a spotlight on it,\u201d she explains. \u201cBashmore and I worked on it at their studios. He\u2019s the producer in residence there for a year and so I think it was a nice way of being able to thank them.\u201dExpressing gratitude towards an offshoot of a multinational drinks company, albeit a not-for-profit one, might come across as disingenuous. But after spending time with Ware both in the London studio and in Amsterdam for the Kraviz session, it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t do anything she\u2019s not comfortable with (she once turned down a remix from a diminutive pop superstar on the basis that it was rubbish), and that the people she works and surrounds herself with on a daily basis need to be friends first, collaborators second. So while that early recording session for Tough Love may have been intimidating, the finished album features an impressive roster of collaborators \u2013 including Dev Hynes, Ed Sheeran, Miguel and production duo BenZel, AKA Two Inch Punch and Benny Blanco \u2013 who have since become close friends. In fact, such was Ware\u2019s desire to make her two-day studio session with Miguel as relaxed as possible, she got so drunk celebrating the first day that she could barely muster the energy for the second. \u201cI had the worst hangover,\u201d she sighs, resting her head in her hands as if the memory alone has drained all the blood from her body. \u201cI thought I was dying. Vomiting everywhere. Go to the second session and Miguel\u2019s there and he\u2019s fresh and I\u2019m just pale with mascara all over my face. I was just a mess.\u201dThe incongruity of having someone like Blanco \u2013 who has produced global pop hits for the likes of Rihanna, Maroon 5 and Kesha \u2013 working with a singer formerly prone to double-tracking her vocals in order to bury herself in the mix isn\u2019t lost on Ware. \u201cI joked with Benny and told him: \u2018This is going to be your least successful project ever. It has to be,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve developed a whole new group of friends that you would put in the music bracket, but they are very dear to me. Benny and Ben, who are BenZel, these are people I trust and who I call for advice. And yes, one of them happens to be a massive hitmaker, but I have to feel like there\u2019s a magic and trust with the people I work with.\u201dIt was through Blanco \u2013 whom she met in New York via mutual friends \u2013 that she got to work with Sheeran on the acoustic-led and romcom-ready epic Say You Love Me. It is, you feel, her first shot at a proper hit, a suggestion that causes her eyebrows to shoot up to meet her hairline. \u201cI think it\u2019s a classic, really well-written song,\u201d she mumbles sheepishly. \u201cIt shows another edge to my voice. Working with artists like Miguel and Ed pushed me vocally without them really knowing it. They\u2019re so talented and technically gifted so they\u2019d sing something and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yeah, that sounds wicked,\u2019 and then I\u2019d try it and be like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to have to practise that.\u2019 For this album, I\u2019ve definitely found a confidence with using my voice. I think I was scared and hiding my vocal on the first one and I didn\u2019t want too much of an identity \u2013 I wanted it to just be smooth.\u201dAs with Devotion, Tough Love is an album the flits effortlessly between Radio 2-friendly ballads, such as the string-drenched Pieces, to the textured, Miguel-assisted Kind of \u2026 Sometimes \u2026 Maybe and the deliriously loved-up Champagne Kisses (which, she\u2019s keen to point out, isn\u2019t about \u201cexpensive blowies\u201d). It\u2019s a reflection of her ability to effortlessly straddle that previously untouched terrain between Best New Music write-ups on Pitchfork on the one hand and a guest appearances on The X Factor in Poland on the other (\u201cI\u2019m massive in Poland, I get like four bodyguards there,\u201d she laughs).\u201cI fucking loved doing The X Factor,\u201d she says unapologetically, when I suggest other artists might see it as bad for the brand. \u201cFor me, that was fucking brilliant. I think that\u2019s cool. I\u2019m very true to myself and I love pop music. So while I want it to sound relatively cool, I\u2019m not going to deny a massive hook.\u201d\u2022 The single Say You Love Me is out on 29 September, followed by the album Tough Love on 13 October, both on PMR/IslandRosie LoweA textured tapestry of burbling electronics and scattershot drum beats, London-based Rosie Lowe\u2019s fragile 2013 EP Right Thing \u2013 co-produced by Ware collaborator Dave Okumu \u2013 announced an intriguing new talent unafraid to manipulate genre barriers. Producer Paul Epworth was so impressed he signed her to his label Wolf Tone and is working on her debut album, due in early 2015. More melancholic perhaps than Ware\u2019s brand of nu soul, Lowe\u2019s songs tend to draw on her varied musical background \u2013 she sang in jazz bands from the age of 13 \u2013 to create moments of unnerving beauty.KwabsGhanaian-born, London-based Kwabena Sarkodee Adjepong, AKA Kwabs, has also worked with Dave Okumu on the undulating soul of Spirit Fade, a track taken from his debut EP, Wrong or Right. It\u2019s the title track \u2013 produced by the enigmatic Sohn, who\u2019s also worked with nu-soul practitioners Banks and Rhye \u2013 that fully showcases Kwabs\u2019 ability to melt his big soulful voice into the fidgety, electronic textures summoned by his producers. While that early EP overflowed with hooky melodies, its slightly inward-looking standpoint has been exploded on new single Walk, a string-drenched stomper aimed directly at radio playlists.Billie BlackWith influences including a host of jazz greats (she studied at the Guildhall School of Music) to sadface electronic singer James Blake and downcast R&B crooner Sampha, 19-year-old Billie Black makes the kind of breathy, modern soul that sounds simultaneously welcoming and strangely unnerving. I Don\u2019t Need Another Lover, for example, pulls off that Jessie Ware-esque trick of encasing a fairly straightforward love song in a constantly shifting, electronic-tinged setting, while I\u2019ve Waited For You sounds like finger tips tapping skin. A recent collaboration with 18-year-old producer Mura Masa on This Simple Pleasure also showcases how versatile her voice is \u2013 its featherlight tones gliding over more vibrant production.", "tags": ["Jessie Ware", "Music", "Pop and rock", "Soul", "Ed Sheeran", "Culture"], "title": "Jessie Ware on Tough Love, working with Miguel and getting mobbed in Poland"},{"date": "2014-09-10T17:32:40Z", "country": "poland", "content": "A decision by Russia to cut gas exports to Poland without warning has rekindled fears about Europe's reliance on Siberian gas at a time of increasing tension between Moscow and the west.The Polish state energy group, PGNiG, said it was trying to find out why volumes had been slashed by up to 24% when it had been exporting gas itself to Ukraine to make up for Russian shortfalls there.Its counterpart in Kiev, Ukrtransgaz, accused Kremlin-controlled Gazprom of penalising Poland and undermining onward gas supplies to Kiev.\"Today Russia started limiting gas supplies to Poland in order to disrupt the reverse (flows) from Poland that we receive ... Poland stopped reverse supplies to Ukraine in the range of 4m cubic metres,\" said Ihor Prokopiv, chief executive of Ukrtransgaz, according to the Russian news agency, RIA.Mutual suspicions are higher than at any point since the collapse of the Soviet Union, following the conflict in Ukraine and western accusations that Russia has augmented the rebellion in the east with its own troops. Moscow denies the claim.Nato last month estimated that more than 1,000 Russian soldiers were operating covertly in Ukraine, as part of a separatist effort to roll back advances by Kiev.Earlier Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said most Russian troops had now been withdrawn. \"According to the latest information I have received from our intelligence, 70% of Russian troops have been moved back across the border,\" he said. \"This further strengthens our hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects.\" Poroshenko said parts of east Ukraine would be given special status. But Ukraine would remain a sovereign and united entity, under a peace deal agreed in Minsk last Friday. But Ukrainians are anticipating a difficult winter ahead, reliant as they are on Russian gas to power their economy and heat their homes.Nick Perry, a British energy consultant, said that it was not surprising that Gazprom's actions had prompted a nervous response. \"Since the 1990s, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has been investigating how Europe would survive if they lost some of its biggest sources of gas for six months. People have been looking at this for a long time.\"But Gazprom sources insisted the shortfall could be attributed to maintenance work that was going on fields and pipelines ahead of the important winter season when demand is at its highest.A statement from the group sidestepped the issue by saying it was pumping gas to all destinations \"according to the resources available for exports and for the continuing pumping to storage facilities in the Russian Federation\".Jonathan Stern, a gas expert at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies and a member of the EU-Russia Gas Advisory Council, believed there was more likely a technical, not a political problem.\"If Gazprom wanted to punish the Poles then it would not do so surely when the weather was warm and in breach of its contractual obligations,\" said Stern who met the Russians for a gas summit in Vienna this week. \"The Russians are acutely aware that any (commercial) moves at this time will be interpreted in the worst possible light (by the west).\"But energy has been at the centre of previous conflict. Gazprom cut off gas to Ukraine in June arguing that Kiev had not paid its bills but the move was interpreted in the west as an attempt to destabilise its southerly neighbour. Similar boycotts by Gazprom against Ukraine \u2013 usually in the middle of winter \u2013 have been imposed against Ukraine and others in the past decade.The latest upset comes as the European Union has drawn up deeper sanctions against Russia over its support for separatist rebels who have taken over parts of eastern Ukraine.Slovakia, a major hub for Russia gas exports to Europe, said volumes were steady on Wednesday, and operators in Hungary, Bosnia and Serbia said there was no disruption to their supplies.Igor Gorsky, a spokesman for Gazprom Transgaz Belarus, the Gazprom subsidiary that operates export pipelines via Belarus, said: \"There have been no extraordinary situations from our side, or any maintenance work, which could have an impact on supply volumes.\"Political relations between Warsaw and Moscow are particularly bad. Poland has lobbied the EU hard to impose tougher sanctions on Moscow, and it is to host elements of a new Nato rapid reaction force, created in response to the Russian intevention in Ukrainer.Gazprom supplies a third of Europe's gas and for many EU countries it is the main source of power for homes and industry but the Russian firm is a big revenue earner for the Kremlin and any volume cuts would damage the company and country financially.", "tags": ["Poland", "Gazprom", "Gas", "European Union", "Europe", "World news", "Business", "Ukraine", "Nato", "Energy industry", "Commodities"], "title": "Russia stokes tensions with the west by cutting gas exports to Poland"},{"date": "2014-08-31T15:52:24Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The elevation of Donald Tusk to one of the top jobs in Europe marks a coming of age for his native Poland. Ten years after joining the EU, Poland has secured the presidency of the European council and its prime minister has become the fixer for and mediator between Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Matteo Renzi, David Cameron and other European leaders.Tusk has already won the prestigious Charlemagne prize for leadership. The most recent winner, Herman Van Rompuy of Belgium, described Tusk late on Saturday as a \"European statesman\".Quiet, unassuming, firm and politically ruthless, the German-speaking centre-right liberal from Gdansk, the cradle of Poland's anti-communist, anti-Russian revolution, has been one of the EU's most successful and most pro-European prime ministers of recent years at a time when faith in the EU has been tested.The only Polish prime minister to win a second term since the collapse of communism in 1989, he has had a good crisis. Poland was the only EU country not to fall into recession as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, and the ensuing European debt and currency turmoil. Perhaps more importantly, under Tusk's seven years in charge of Poland and with the help of his anglophile foreign minister, Radek Sikorski, the country performed a strategic shift, redefining the country's national interest.Coming into the EU, Poland was a natural ally of Britain: big enough, on the fringes, liberal, free market and, for historical reasons, wary of the Franco-German dominion that ran the EU until the 2004 enlargement.Tusk inherited a Poland that was hostile to Russia and intensely suspicious of Germany, for good historical reasons. The alliance with the UK was reinforced by Britain's championing of Poland's membership against deep-seated west European reservations and by the UK's open-door policy for Polish migrants from 2004 when most others restricted\u00a0immigration.Under Tusk and Sikorski, this has all changed. The keen pro-Americanism waned, leaving a sour taste. Tusk and Sikorski concluded that Britain and David Cameron in particular were making a mess of their tactics and strategy in Europe and with other EU governments.Tusk bonded with Merkel, the EU's first among equals, cemented a close Polish-German alliance, and concluded that Poland's destiny rested on its closest possible European integration, setting it at odds with a UK travelling in the opposite direction.What impact such policies and strategies will have on his stewardship of EU summits is not clear. By definition, the president of the European council is at the mercy of the other leaders. But the agenda-setting and mediation powers that go with the job also allow him to shape to a degree the EU's direction.\"There are three big fundamental issues for the new president \u2013 the economy, Ukraine and the UK question,\" said a senior EU official. \"We may be on the edge of a new cold war with the Russians. There are huge economic challenges. And the UK issue will be very big.\"On all three, Tusk will have strong views. The rapid pace of change in eastern Europe over 20 years in the transition from communism to capitalism puts him on the Cameron reformist side of the economic argument.On Ukraine and Russia, Tusk and Poland have led the hawks in Europe on getting tough with Putin, although he will not be able to take Germany, France or Italy to places they do not want to go.On Britain, it will fall to Tusk to lead negotiations with Cameron, if he remains in power, on a so-called new deal rewriting the British terms of membership. \"The future of the EU is not about making it smaller, about contraction,\" he said after his appointment. \"No reasonable person can imagine the EU without the UK.\"But Tusk will not be the master of that negotiation, rather the messenger for what other EU leaders deem the limits of the possible in accommodating British demands. \"Now the name of the game for Cameron is to get a strong portfolio in the new commission,\" said the official, in reference to the next stage of the jobs-trading in Brussels, the formation, by Jean-Claude Juncker, of a new European commission over the next\u00a0fortnight.Juncker has considerable powers of discretion here. While he has competing national demands to balance, his priority is to construct a team that will secure the needed endorsement of a majority of the European parliament in October. \"Juncker has the leverage now,\" said the official. \"Cameron can only blame himself for making the Conservatives a fringe group. The British are not playing it very strongly. They have drifted too far away.\"The appointment of Tusk's partner, Federica Mogherini, the Italian foreign minister, as EU foreign policy chief, matters less for the simple reason that European foreign policy is still in gestation. Much will depend on what she is able to make of the job.For Matteo Renzi, the new young centre-left Italian prime minister, winning the post is double-edged. Domestically he will sell it as a triumph for Italy, securing one of the most prestigious posts. But the main decisions in Brussels affecting his country will be economic and financial within the European commission. Mogherini will be wrestling with foreign policy crises, clocking up a colossal number of air miles, and will largely be absent when those decisions are taken.", "tags": ["Europe", "Poland", "World news", "Angela Merkel", "Donald Tusk"], "title": "Donald Tusk's rise to European council president is a big moment for Poland"},{"date": "2014-09-02T13:43:53Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Michel Platini touched down on the runway that separates Spain from Gibraltar in May. Uefa\u2019s president had come to visit its 54th and newest member. He had enjoyed the occasion, he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that the members of Uefa will enjoy football in Gibraltar more when it is returned to us,\u201d snapped the president of the Spanish league, Javier Tebas, a one-time member of the far-right political party Fuerza Nueva. \u201cWe\u2019ll invite them then.\u201dBut if Tebas was bitter, and if the political undercurrent is unavoidable, particularly with moves towards official status coming in the midst of a dispute between Spain and the Rock, provoking long queues at the border, warships on the sea and sabre rattling in parliament, for football fans in Gibraltar there is only excitement.Platini had been invited to attend the Rock Cup final. And now, having been accepted as a member of Uefa, Gibraltar are preparing to play their first ever official competitive match, against Poland.Gibraltar was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 and the Gibraltar FA was founded in 1895. They had been trying to gain acceptance to international football since 1999. Fifa passed the decision on to Uefa, which initially resisted on the grounds that Gibraltar is not a sovereign state but it was forced to back down by the Court of Arbitration for Sport because that stipulation was not in force when Gibraltar first applied for membership.Spain resisted, with the national federation threatening to pull out if Gibraltar was included. But in October 2012 it was provisionally allowed in and formal acceptance followed in May 2013. Platini said that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of members had voted to include them. Spain did not. The Gib team\u2019s manager, Allen Bula, insisted that this was no political act and nor were they trying to make a statement; Gibraltar just wanted to play football.Platini\u2019s appearance at the Rock Cup was his first trip to see them. If he wants to do so again this time, he will have to travel 150 miles west. Gibraltar do not have a grass pitch, with games being played on the astroturf at Victoria stadium, right next to the airport runway. A new stadium is being built on Europa Point, on the southside of the rock. But until then they must look elsewhere. Spain\u2019s Football Federation have refused to play Gibraltar and will not host them, so the game will be held in the Est\u00e1dio Algarve in Portugal.They have been there before: around 500 fans travelled for a 0-0 draw with Slovakia in November last year. Since then Gibraltar have celebrated their first ever official goal, Roy Chipolina scoring in a 4-1 loss to the Faroe Islands, and their first ever victory, thanks to a Kyle Casciaro strikeeffort against Malta. Now comes their first ever competitive match. Poland are joined in the group by the world champions, Germany, while Scotland and the Republic of Ireland are there too.With a population of 28,000 Gibraltar are the smallest member of Uefa, just behind San Marino. When their squad was named for this game it included three England-based players: Preston North End\u2019s Scott Wiseman, Jake Gosling from Bristol Rovers and Adam Priestly, who plays for Farsley in the Northern Counties East football League. Gibraltar\u2019s strongest side, Lincoln Red Imps, account for 10 of their players.Gibraltar have played five official games, winning one, drawing two and losing two. They have taken on tiny nations. Now they will take on Robert Lewandowski and his team-mates, then the world champions. They do not expect to qualify and nor do they expect to win often, if at all, but that does not matter, as the excitement surrounding this game and a meeting with Germany shows. Just playing them is something to celebrate.", "tags": ["Gibraltar", "Euro 2016 qualifiers", "Football", "Michel Platini", "Gibraltar", "Poland", "Europe", "Bristol Rovers", "Preston North End", "World news", "Euro 2016"], "title": "Gibraltar head to Portugal to play Poland in first competitive match"},{"date": "2014-07-24T10:56:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland became the first EU country held to account for its involvement in the CIA's extraordinary rendition programme on Thursday when the European court of human rights found it guilty of the unlawful detention and torture of two men at a secret prison in the north of the country after 9/11.In two damning judgments, the court also ruled that the Polish government had failed to conduct a proper investigation into the episode, and ordered it to pay \u20ac100,000 (\u00a379,000) compensation to each of the men, who are currently held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The rulings are the first in a series of cases being brought against European states, with Lithuania and Romania also facing accusations that they allowed the CIA to open secret prisons on their territory.The case against Poland was brought by two men, Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, a Saudi-born Palestinian known as Abu Zubaydah, and Saudi national Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.Abu Zubaydah was initially detained in Pakistan in 2002 and accused of being a senior al-Qaida figure, although there has since been some doubt over the role he may have played. He was flown to Poland from a CIA prison in Thailand in December 2002, remaining there until September the following year.Nashiri is accused of masterminding the October 2000 suicide bomb attack against the USS Cole, in which 17 people died, and is facing prosecution before a military commission. He was flown to Poland on the same executive jet as Abu Zubaydah, and transferred to Morocco the following June.The court heard that the two men were held at a prison codenamed Quartz that the CIA operated at the Stare Kiejkuty military base in the north-east of the country.The judgment in the Abu Zubaydah case recounted how he had described being repeatedly beaten, confined in a small box, and brought out to be repeatedly waterboarded.\"I was\u00a0\u2026 put on what looked like a hospital bed, and strapped down very tightly with belts.

After a few minutes the cloth was removed and the bed was rotated into an upright position.\"The bed was then again lowered to horizontal position and the same torture carried out again with the black cloth over my face and water poured on from a bottle. I struggled against the straps, trying to breathe, but it was hopeless. I thought I was going to die.\"The court said that Abu Zubaydah's continuing detention without trial was \"a flagrant denial of justice\". In addition to the compensation, given because of what was described as the \"extreme seriousness of the violations\" of the European convention of human rights, Abu Zubaydah was awarded \u20ac30,000 costs.The judgment in the Nashiri case described how he had been kept naked, subjected to mock executions, hoisted by his wrists while his arms were shackled behind his back, and told that his mother would be sexually abused before him.The two unanimous rulings found that the rendition programme was completely illegal, as its rationale had been \"specifically to remove those persons from any legal protection against torture and enforced disappearance and to strip them of any safeguards afforded by both the US constitution and international law\".The court at Strasbourg said it was inconceivable that the rendition aircraft could have landed in Poland, and that the CIA could have operated the prison on Polish territory, without the Polish authorities being aware. \"It is also inconceivable that activities of that character and scale, possibly vital for the country's military and political interests, could have been undertaken on Polish territory without Poland's knowledge and without the necessary authorisation being given at the appropriate level of the state authorities.\"It also ruled that the Polish government must seek assurances from the US that Nashiri will not face the death penalty.The Guardian reported more than seven years ago on the existence of the secret CIA prison on Polish soil, quoting the former director of a nearby airport who witnessed the rendition aircraft being met by military vehicles with blacked-out windows.\"On one occasion an American lady \u2013 I was told she was from the embassy \u2013 came with the man who made the payments. She was standing in front of the airport office when the military vehicles left. She turned her back on the vehicles. It seemed as if she did not want to be a witness.\"Since then, the Polish authorities have said that they have been conducting their own investigation, but have faced accusations that it has been drawn-out and ineffective. The European court ruled that the Polish response failed to provide an effective remedy, and that it too amounted to a breach of the European convention on human rights.Amrit Singh, a lawyer at the Open Society Justice Initiative who represented Nashiri, said: \"This is a historic ruling by the European court of human rights, which has become the first court to confirm the existence of a secret CIA torture centre on Polish soil between 2002 and 2003, where our client was held and tortured.\"The court's findings include a damning indictment of the US military commission system, where our client is now facing trial for his life, and also a condemnation of the death penalty itself.\"Joseph Margulies, one of Abu Zubaydah's American lawyers, said: \"It's always gratifying when a court speaks truth to power. The question now is whether Poland will listen. The rule of law demands more than words on a page. It demands justice.\"A Polish presidential spokeswoman, Joanna Trzaska-Wieczorek, said: \"The ruling of the tribunal in Strasbourg on CIA jails is embarrassing for Poland and is a burden both in terms of our country's finances as well as its image.\"She added that it was possible the government would appeal.", "tags": ["Poland", "Human rights", "European court of human rights", "Europe", "World news", "Al-Qaida", "CIA", "US news", "Law", "Rendition"], "title": "Poland broke human rights convention on al-Qaida suspects held by the CIA"},{"date": "2014-07-22T11:55:36Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The UK and Germany lead a  list of the EU\u2019s most polluting coal-fired power stations compiled by environmental campaigners, who say coal emissions are undermining efforts to combat climate change. Both countries have nine of the so-called \u201cdirty 30\u201d and the campaigners say coal burning is increasing due to the relatively low price of the fuel compared to gas.\u201cGermany and the UK are the self-declared climate champions of the EU,\u201d says the new report. \u201cHowever, Germany uses more coal to generate electricity than any other EU country, while the UK comes third in absolute coal consumption for power after Poland.\u201d The report argues current EU policy on climate, energy and air pollution in the power sector is not strong enough to achieve the switch from coal to renewable energy and energy efficiency.Poland\u2019s Belchatow plant came top of the list, with annual CO2 emissions of 37m tonnes in 2013. The UK\u2019s largest coal plant, Drax, was sixth, with four German plants occupying second to fifth place.Germany\u2019s increase in coal burning has been criticised by supporters of nuclear energy because Germany opted to phase out all nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster. The report shows that the electricity generation lost from the closed nuclear plants (43 TWh from 2010-2013) was more than compensated for by the increase in renewable electricity (47 TWh 2010-2103). The increase in the proportion of electricity generated from coal (3.6 percentage points between 2010 and 2013) was the same as the reduction of electricity from gas burning. Germany also exported a record amount of electricity in 2013 (33 TWh).The total emissions from the EU energy sector fell modestly in 2013 but the campaigners say the rising use of cheap coal puts the EU in danger of not meeting future climate targets. The price of pollution permits in the EU\u2019s emission trading scheme remains far below the level which would make it more economic to use gas, which produces about half as much carbon emissions. According the International Energy Agency, the share of coal in EU electricity generation must be below 4% by 2035 but is currently about 25%.The report also highlights the negative health impacts of coal burning, stating that air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulates and mercury is estimated to cause 1,600 deaths a year in the UK.\u201cOur political leaders are justifiably proud of their record on supporting tackling climate change on the global stage,\u201d said Jenny Banks at WWF-UK, one of the groups that produced the report. \u201cBut they must make sure they\u2019re not saying one thing and doing another. Coal is by far the most polluting source of electricity. Tackling climate change means making sure that emissions from coal power are phased out over the next decade.\u201d\u201cEach of the largest coal power stations in Europe is responsible for hundreds of millions of external health costs,\u201d said Julia Huscher, at the Health and Environment Alliance, another group behind the report.\u201dThe phase-out of coal in Europe will be a win-win, because it will help to achieve clean air for more people, and avoid further health damage from climate change.\u201dThe report said rising emissions from coal plants were due to increasing use of existing facilities, rather than new ones opening. It warned policymakers against allowing extensions to the lifetimes of coal plants, most of which were built in the 1960s and 1970s.", "tags": ["Coal", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "UK news", "Germany", "Europe", "World news", "Poland", "Nuclear power", "European Union"], "title": "Germany, UK and Poland top \u2018dirty 30\u2019 list of EU coal-fired power stations"},{"date": "2014-11-07T13:35:47Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland and other eastern Europe countries have categorically rejected the target put forward by the world\u2019s top climate scientists to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2100 to avoid dangerous global warming, leaked documents show.On Sunday, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that fossil fuels must be entirely phased out by the end of the century to keep temperatures from rising as high as 5C above pre-industrial levels, a level that would have catastrophic impacts worldwide.On 28 October, a few days before the IPCC synthesis report was published, EU environment and energy ministers meeting in Brussels were presented with a proposal by states including Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany to incorporate the IPCC target into EU policy.However, it was judged not to have \u201csufficient support\u201d because of opposition from Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Latvia who \u201ccategorically rejected\u201d it, according to a internal briefing note seen by the Guardian.Poland has vetoed past EU attempts to set climate objectives, and invested political capital in positioning itself as a leader of the Visegrad countries in the run up to the EU\u2019s decision on climate targets for 2030.The European commission (EC), represented by the outgoing climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, gave only lukewarm support to the zero emissions idea, saying it was \u201call in favour of having a direction in which we should be going but it might be a bit premature to state it so directly \u2013 not all member states will probably be ready to do so\u201d.Detlef van Vuuren, a lead author on the IPCC report, told the Guardian: \u201cI\u2019m quite surprised that this would be an important thing for the Visegrad countries to be worried about, because for them the question has been more about near-term reductions.\u201d\u201cTo reach the 2C target, being at or below zero emissions is a requirement,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is not possible to have any form of stabilisation of the climate by 2100 without that.\u201d \u201cI really find this a disgrace,\u201d the Dutch Green MEP Bas Eickhout said. \u201cAfter the IPCC report, everyone again said it was shocking, the science is clear, we should no longer delay action.

At the close of the last of the concerts, in Pozna\u0144, he performed a composition specially written for his Polish listeners. He titled it Dziekuje \u2013 Thank you \u2013 and introduced it with a solo piano section inspired by Chopin. When the piece finished, there was a moment of silence during which Brubeck suddenly feared that he might have insulted the memory of the nation\u2019s greatest musical hero. Then the waves of applause crashed around him.Among those flocking to hear Brubeck was a 16-year-old trumpeter about to begin his studies at the academy of music in Krak\u00f3w. To the eager Tomasz Sta\u0144ko, jazz represented \u201cthe opposite of communism. It was the synonym of freedom. It was the symbol of everything good.\u201d His knowledge of the music had been developed by listening to Willis Conover\u2019s Jazz Hour, broadcast nightly via the Voice of America radio network \u2013 another State Department initiative aimed at using jazz as a weapon in the cold war.Over the years, Sta\u0144ko would become a leading member of the generation of Polish musicians who established themselves, and their national scene, as a significant force in jazz. He and some of his compatriots \u2013 including the pianists Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer and Marcin Masecki, the singer Alice Zawadski and the violinist and saxophonist Micha\u0142 Urbaniak \u2013 are appearing this month at the London Jazz festival, which also features an evening devoted to the launch of Jazz in Polish Cinema, a box set of film soundtracks dating from the late 1950s to the mid 1960s.Cinema was the medium through which several of Sta\u0144ko\u2019s contemporaries and collaborators gained their first international exposure. When the cineastes of the time heard Krzysztof Komeda\u2019s soundtrack to Roman Polanski\u2019s Knife in the Water in 1962, they were impressed by the way the cool modernity of the music\u2019s timbres and cadences enhanced the young director\u2019s sophisticated vision.The generation of Sta\u0144ko and Komeda benefited from the loosening of Poland\u2019s cultural corset in the years that followed the death of Stalin in 1953. Under W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka and Edward Gierek, it became the Iron Curtain country most open to western influence, its artistic life flourishing until the imposition of martial law by General Wojciech Jaruzelski\u2019s military government in 1981.But jazz had been a familiar part of the country\u2019s cultural landscape since long before the arrival of communism. The Karasinski and Kataszek Jazz-Tango Orchestra, believed to be the first Polish jazz band, came into existence in 1923, and was followed by many others. The celebrated trumpeter Eddie Rosner, born in Berlin in 1910 to Polish-Jewish parents, spent time in Warsaw after fleeing the Nazis and before moving on to Russia in an attempt to escape further persecution. Trying to return to Poland in 1946 he was arrested and spent eight years in a Siberian gulag.Like Hitler, Stalin detested jazz and all it stood for. It was a prejudice aped by his postwar Polish puppets, who forced musicians in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w and elsewhere to endure what became known as the \u201ccatacomb period\u201d, when jazz could be played only in private houses. But in the warmer climate of the middle 1950s, the creativity of Poland\u2019s film makers and musicians began to emerge. In 1958, the year Andrzej Wajda\u2019s Ashes and Diamonds appeared, completing the great director\u2019s Kanal trilogy, the tenor saxophonist Jan \u201cPtaszyn\u201d Wroblewski became the first Polish jazz musician to appear at the Newport Jazz festival, taking his place in a specially created ensemble of outstanding young musicians from around the world: an explicit recognition that Polish jazz was blossoming.That year, too, saw the first edition of a three-day Jazz Jamboree in Warsaw, organised by enthusiasts on the foundations laid in 1955-56 by a small festival in Sopot. The magazine Jazz Forum, launched as a quarterly in 1964, became so influential that it was eventually distributed in more than 100 countries, published in English and German as well as Polish. Later this month the 56th edition of Jazz Jamboree takes place in what has been, with some overtones of irony, its home since 1965: the spectacular Palace of Culture and Science, designed by Stalin\u2019s architects and built by workers from the Soviet Union.Komeda\u2019s soundtracks helped spread the reputation of Polish jazz, as did an appearance by the Wreckers, a group led by the pianist Andrzej Trzaskowski, at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1962 and a visit to Britain in the summer of 1964 by the alto saxophonist Zbigniew Namyslowski. When Namyslowski\u2019s quartet appeared in London, critics noted that these very young Polish musicians had clearly absorbed the latest trends in American jazz, exemplified by the work of Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane.The young Namyslowski provides the model for a character in Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s recent film Ida, set in and around \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in the early 60s. When a novice nun, searching for the truth about the wartime murder of her Jewish parents, meets an aspiring saxophonist (played by Davwid Ogrodnik, a rising star of the current Polish cinema), she hears his group rehearsing tunes by Coltrane, imbuing them with a kind of lyrical sadness that seems specifically Polish.Their sound recalls the reply of Manfred Eicher, the head of ECM Records and Tomasz Sta\u0144ko\u2019s producer for the past 20 years, when I once asked him to define the essence of Polish jazz: \u201cA certain kind of melancholy that cries out, and certain kinds of intonations and colours.\u201dJan Kopinski, the English-born saxophonist and founder of the band Pinski Zoo, describes it by using the Polish word \u017cal: \u201cIt means a longing for something that\u2019s disappeared.\u201d The equivalent, in fact, of the Portuguese saudade and the Welsh hiraeth. \u201cYou can feel that in Coltrane, just as you can feel it in Chopin,\u201d he says. \u201cThey both make Romantic music, in a sense.\u201dThe son of a father who flew bombers with a Polish squadron during the war, Kopinski has performed in Poland on many occasions since the end of martial law in 1983. His playing is equally marked by his Polish heritage and by the profound influence of Coltrane.It is the mystical element in Coltrane\u2019s music, he says, that appeals to the Polish mentality. \u201cSome people call it spirituality. I prefer to think of it as transcendence. And that touched a real nerve among Polish musicians. A friend once said to me, \u2018We consider Coltrane to be like a saint.\u2019\u201dColtrane changed the course of jazz, and no Polish musician has managed that. But, individually and collectively, they continue to add a distinctive flavour to the mix, their existence also providing an important reminder of the music\u2019s wider social significance and of its role in a turbulent time.\u2022 Jazz in Polish Cinema (Out of the Underground 1958-67) is released on CD next week.

And then as soon as it comes to political decisions, they step back from that. It just seems to be empty words every time. This is one of the key reasons why people don\u2019t trust politics anymore.\u201dMinisters at the summit, which was attended by the UK energy secretary, Ed Davey, also agreed not to insist on an assessment of countries\u2019 carbon-cutting pledges ahead of next year\u2019s climate summit in Paris, after opposition from France, Poland and the Czech Republic.An assessment had been supported by powerful EU players including the UK, Germany and the EC, mindful of failure at the Copenhagen summit in 2009, when climate pledges were not telegraphed beforehand. But the final text said only that contributions would be \u201cproperly considered and analysed in advance of the Paris conference\u201d.The EU ministers also agreed to leave the question of binding resource efficiency targets off a review agenda for the rest of the decade, after opposition from around half of the bloc\u2019s nations.The argument that waste recycling, management and prevention goals would \u2018dilute\u2019 Europe\u2019s focus on other 2020 targets was made by countries such as Britain, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Romania. Poland led other states arguing that it would be premature to adopt such goals without a more robust set of indicators.The outgoing environment commissioner Janez Potocnik responded that far from being premature, \u201cwe were already too late and needed to catch up; the world has changed since the Europe 2020 targets were set in 2010\u201d.A consensus was finally reached to ask the commission to integrate resource efficiency into the EU\u2019s 2020 strategy by \u201cthe introduction of an EU non-binding aspirational target\u201d.", "tags": ["Climate change", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Poland", "Environment", "European commission", "Europe", "European Union"], "title": "Poland rejects IPCC target of zero emissions by 2100"},{"date": "2014-10-09T15:44:41Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The German chancellor Angela Merkel held a meeting with the new Polish prime minister Ewa Kopacz today, discussing many of the issues that the two neighbours face together.Both now have female leaders. Merkel is the first for Germany and Kopacz the second for Poland. But while the countries share a lot of common factors, there are also some big differences.As is the norm with central European countries at the moment, Poland is growing faster than many western nations.This is not to say that a year on year GDP growth rate of 1.6% is massive but it stands in clear contrast to the powerful, but slowing, German economy. German companies invested $4.5bn (\u00a32.77bn) in Poland during 2012, which was almost a billion more than any other country spent there. Although Germans spent more than four times as much in the UK, Poland was their fifth biggest destination for foreign direct investment. Despite the similarities and connections, the working life of people in each country is very different. Median earnings were five and a quarter times higher in Germany during 2012 than they were for Poles. Not only do they earn considerably less, fewer people in Poland are employed and they produce a lot less for the hours they do work. We do need to bear in mind here that Poland would be a much cheaper country to live in than Germany but these stats show just how far apart the two currently are economically. Poland is the 9th most populous country in Europe and just under half the size of Germany (the most populous).Unsurprisingly for two neighbouring nations, many of each nationality have decided to move across the border. However, equally unsurprisingly, that\u2019s skewed very much towards the more economically powerful nation - Germany has ten times more Poles than Poland has Germans. But there are a lot of cultural similarities. Both countries drink a lot of alcohol relative to their population size - you\u2019re most likely to be given an Oettinger in Germany and a Tyskie in Poland, by the way. Each country loves their pork, which makes up the bulk of meat consumption in both nations. The richer nation of Germany has the vast majority of its adult population on the internet but Poland only fares badly by comparison here. Getting 65% of its adults online puts it at a roughly comparable stage to Italy (66%). Germany and Poland are two very similar nations, which is why they are such good partners. That will perhaps all be briefly forgotten for 90 minutes on Saturday as the German football team are welcomed in Poland for a European qualification match.

At the close of the last of the concerts, in Pozna\u0144, he performed a composition specially written for his Polish listeners. He titled it Dziekuje \u2013 Thank you \u2013 and introduced it with a solo piano section inspired by Chopin. When the piece finished, there was a moment of silence during which Brubeck suddenly feared that he might have insulted the memory of the nation\u2019s greatest musical hero. Then the waves of applause crashed around him.Among those flocking to hear Brubeck was a 16-year-old trumpeter about to begin his studies at the academy of music in Krak\u00f3w. To the eager Tomasz Sta\u0144ko, jazz represented \u201cthe opposite of communism. It was the synonym of freedom. It was the symbol of everything good.\u201d His knowledge of the music had been developed by listening to Willis Conover\u2019s Jazz Hour, broadcast nightly via the Voice of America radio network \u2013 another State Department initiative aimed at using jazz as a weapon in the cold war.Over the years, Sta\u0144ko would become a leading member of the generation of Polish musicians who established themselves, and their national scene, as a significant force in jazz. He and some of his compatriots \u2013 including the pianists Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer and Marcin Masecki, the singer Alice Zawadski and the violinist and saxophonist Micha\u0142 Urbaniak \u2013 are appearing this month at the London Jazz festival, which also features an evening devoted to the launch of Jazz in Polish Cinema, a box set of film soundtracks dating from the late 1950s to the mid 1960s.Cinema was the medium through which several of Sta\u0144ko\u2019s contemporaries and collaborators gained their first international exposure. When the cineastes of the time heard Krzysztof Komeda\u2019s soundtrack to Roman Polanski\u2019s Knife in the Water in 1962, they were impressed by the way the cool modernity of the music\u2019s timbres and cadences enhanced the young director\u2019s sophisticated vision.The generation of Sta\u0144ko and Komeda benefited from the loosening of Poland\u2019s cultural corset in the years that followed the death of Stalin in 1953. Under W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka and Edward Gierek, it became the Iron Curtain country most open to western influence, its artistic life flourishing until the imposition of martial law by General Wojciech Jaruzelski\u2019s military government in 1981.But jazz had been a familiar part of the country\u2019s cultural landscape since long before the arrival of communism. The Karasinski and Kataszek Jazz-Tango Orchestra, believed to be the first Polish jazz band, came into existence in 1923, and was followed by many others. The celebrated trumpeter Eddie Rosner, born in Berlin in 1910 to Polish-Jewish parents, spent time in Warsaw after fleeing the Nazis and before moving on to Russia in an attempt to escape further persecution. Trying to return to Poland in 1946 he was arrested and spent eight years in a Siberian gulag.Like Hitler, Stalin detested jazz and all it stood for. It was a prejudice aped by his postwar Polish puppets, who forced musicians in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w and elsewhere to endure what became known as the \u201ccatacomb period\u201d, when jazz could be played only in private houses. But in the warmer climate of the middle 1950s, the creativity of Poland\u2019s film makers and musicians began to emerge. In 1958, the year Andrzej Wajda\u2019s Ashes and Diamonds appeared, completing the great director\u2019s Kanal trilogy, the tenor saxophonist Jan \u201cPtaszyn\u201d Wroblewski became the first Polish jazz musician to appear at the Newport Jazz festival, taking his place in a specially created ensemble of outstanding young musicians from around the world: an explicit recognition that Polish jazz was blossoming.That year, too, saw the first edition of a three-day Jazz Jamboree in Warsaw, organised by enthusiasts on the foundations laid in 1955-56 by a small festival in Sopot. The magazine Jazz Forum, launched as a quarterly in 1964, became so influential that it was eventually distributed in more than 100 countries, published in English and German as well as Polish. Later this month the 56th edition of Jazz Jamboree takes place in what has been, with some overtones of irony, its home since 1965: the spectacular Palace of Culture and Science, designed by Stalin\u2019s architects and built by workers from the Soviet Union.Komeda\u2019s soundtracks helped spread the reputation of Polish jazz, as did an appearance by the Wreckers, a group led by the pianist Andrzej Trzaskowski, at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1962 and a visit to Britain in the summer of 1964 by the alto saxophonist Zbigniew Namyslowski.

The reason they do it in Poland first is because it takes longer [before they can start work at the warehouse].\u201dThe company has hired about 500 British and 240 Polish people for a total of 840 warehouse roles required over the Christmas shopping and January sales period. The spokesman said the jobs were advertised on Next\u2019s website, in jobcentres and on UK recruitment websites. Next is still actively recruiting in the UK and Poland for 100 more staff.The Yorkshire and Humber region has the second-highest unemployment rate in the country, after the north-east, with 7.2% of people out of work compared with the national average of 6.1%.Next and its Polish recruitment agency have arranged a fleet of buses to drive the 240 Polish recruits 1,180 miles from Warsaw directly to its warehouse in South Elmsall, West Yorkshire. The first of the buses began arriving last month, with up to seven coaches travelling in convey according to the Daily Mirror, which first reported the Polish recruitment drive.The Polish workers are charged \u00a3100 a head for the journey, which takes about 19 hours not including stops according to Google Maps.When they arrive at Next\u2019s warehouse, the Polish recruits are charged \u00a350-\u00a365 each per week for shared room accommodation provided by local landlords.The Next spokesman said the accommodation, which is arranged by its Polish recruitment agency, was \u201cmaximum two people per room\u201d.Next said the posts vary from a few weeks to a few months. Staff aged over 21 will be paid \u00a36.50 an hour \u2013 the minimum wage. The spokesman said they could be eligible for a bonus worth up to 60% more, but not until they completed 12 weeks\u2019 service.The GMB union, which represents Next workers and has embarked on a nationwide tour demanding staff are paid the living wage of \u00a37.85, said it was outrageous that jobs were being offered in Poland before the UK.Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, which represents Next workers, said: \u201cAll over Europe there are labour agencies exploiting posted workers on a massive scale. Internal EU-wide union estimates show that approximately one million workers are exploited as posted workers annually.\u201d\u201cFrom Lindsey Oil Refinery to food production, we have seen workers recruited in certain member states by agencies and exploited. They were shipped in literally in order to undermine the terms and conditions of existing workers on those contracts. Both sets of workers have been let down by UK government, the European commission and the European court.\u201cOn exploitation \u2013 don\u2019t blame the exploited; damn those who exploit. This has been repeated up and down the country over recent years. And that is part of the discontent that extreme political parties turn into xenophobic rhetoric to win votes.\u201dThe GMB said it met Polish workers off the buses and handed them leaflets in Polish encouraging them to join the union.Wolfson, who owns 1% of Next\u2019s shares worth more than \u00a3100m, was paid \u00a34.6m last year. In the current year, his basic salary rises 2% to \u00a31.1m but his total pay is likely to exceed \u00a36.2m with his long-term incentive plan and annual bonus included \u2013 even after excluding a bonus he has chosen to share among staff for the last two years.Wolfson has donated more than \u00a3400,000 to the Tories since 2006 and advised the party on economic policy before the last general election.

The film director faced a jail term after he pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with Samantha Gailey (now Geimer), then aged 13. His plea was part of a bargain that saw other more serious charges, including rape, dropped. Polanski absconded before the sentencing, however, and has lived in France ever since.Poland is receiving the request because Polanski has been visiting Krakow, preparing for his film An Officer and a Spy. The US made an initial attempt in October last year, by filing an arrest warrant when Polanski travelled to Warsaw. The director was brought in for questioning by the Polish authorities but was not arrested.However, justice ministry spokesman Mateusz Martyniuk said that the Polish statute of limitations (preventing prosecutions in cases where a number of years have lapsed since the crime) \u201cdoes not apply to US requests\u201d, meaning that Polanski could yet be sent back to the US. Last year Martyniuk said that the director was free to travel as no extradition request had been made \u2013 the director could now potentially see that freedom curtailed. Regarding the new request, Martyniuk acknowledged: \u201cProsecutors will want to summon Polanski for questioning.\u201dOne of Polanski\u2019s Polish lawyers, Jerzy Stachowicz, told Reuters: \u201cIn our view no new circumstances have arisen which could lead to a change in the decision by the prosecutor\u2019s office in October.\u201dPolanski has risked extradition before \u2013 in 2009 he was arrested in Switzerland when he went to a film festival there, but the case collapsed.In December 2014 he unsuccessfully bid to have the original case dismissed. A judge in the original case allegedly discussed the case with journalists and lawyers as it was ongoing, and this misconduct, Polanski\u2019s legal team hoped, would help exonerate him. But a judge ruled that Polanski\u2019s fugitive status means that the case cannot be thrown out.In an interview with Vanity Fair last year, Polanski described his reasons for fleeing the US. \u201cIt was such a shock to learn that it\u2019s not finished, after they let you out of prison,\u201d he said, referring to the 42 days he served behind bars as part of the plea bargain. \u201cFree! With your bundle under your arm, with the lawyer waiting for you outside; standing there, in your mind it\u2019s all over, it\u2019s finished. And then the judge changed his mind. And I have to go back to prison, and nobody knows how long.

The film director faced a jail term after he pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with Samantha Gailey (now Geimer), then aged 13. His plea was part of a bargain that saw other more serious charges, including rape, dropped. Polanski absconded before the sentencing, however, and has lived in France ever since.Poland is receiving the request because Polanski has been visiting Krakow, preparing for his film An Officer and a Spy. The US made an initial attempt in October last year, by filing an arrest warrant when Polanski travelled to Warsaw. The director was brought in for questioning by the Polish authorities but was not arrested.However, justice ministry spokesman Mateusz Martyniuk said that the Polish statute of limitations (preventing prosecutions in cases where a number of years have lapsed since the crime) \u201cdoes not apply to US requests\u201d, meaning that Polanski could yet be sent back to the US. Last year Martyniuk said that the director was free to travel as no extradition request had been made \u2013 the director could now potentially see that freedom curtailed. Regarding the new request, Martyniuk acknowledged: \u201cProsecutors will want to summon Polanski for questioning.\u201dOne of Polanski\u2019s Polish lawyers, Jerzy Stachowicz, told Reuters: \u201cIn our view no new circumstances have arisen which could lead to a change in the decision by the prosecutor\u2019s office in October.\u201dPolanski has risked extradition before \u2013 in 2009 he was arrested in Switzerland when he went to a film festival there, but the case collapsed.In December 2014 he unsuccessfully bid to have the original case dismissed. A judge in the original case allegedly discussed the case with journalists and lawyers as it was ongoing, and this misconduct, Polanski\u2019s legal team hoped, would help exonerate him. But a judge ruled that Polanski\u2019s fugitive status means that the case cannot be thrown out.In an interview with Vanity Fair last year, Polanski described his reasons for fleeing the US. \u201cIt was such a shock to learn that it\u2019s not finished, after they let you out of prison,\u201d he said, referring to the 42 days he served behind bars as part of the plea bargain. \u201cFree! With your bundle under your arm, with the lawyer waiting for you outside; standing there, in your mind it\u2019s all over, it\u2019s finished. And then the judge changed his mind. And I have to go back to prison, and nobody knows how long.

David is taken home by his grandfather, who will look after him until his mother returns in June. The eight-year-old is what has become known as a \u201cEuro-sierota\u201d or \u201cEuro-orphan\u201d \u2013 a child left behind in Poland with relatives while its parents go abroad to work, a phenomenon from the era before Poland joined the European Union in 2004, but which has only grown since then.Katarzyna, one of a very vaguely estimated two million Poles who are living and working abroad, has been doing a similar stint for 12 years. But in a study last week the World Bank warned that towns across eastern Europe, like Radom \u2013 which lies about 75 miles south of Warsaw \u2013 are growing prematurely old due to the extensive migration that has taken place in recent years, coupled with drastically falling birthrates. A glance at the statistics is enough to realise the demographic squeeze that is already taking place in Radom and will only worsen as its population both ages and shrinks. If the trend continues, according to the study, it will have a huge impact on pensions, the public purse and economic growth.Statisticians have called Radom, with its 220,000 inhabitants and its roots in the middle ages, one of the fastest-shrinking towns in Poland and eastern Europe. The latest figures, taken from Poland\u2019s Central Office of Statistics, show that in 2012 the proportion of under-17s was 17%, the 18- to 65-year-olds made up 64% of the population and those 65 and over, 19%. By 2035 those figures are expected to be 15%, 56% and 29%. And the trend of ever fewer births and an ageing population, supported by an ever smaller \u201cproductive middle\u201d, is only set to continue. According to the World Bank report, if trends continue the entire region\u2019s workforce can be expected to fall by almost 14 million by 2060.Critically, 2012 marked the point that the number of deaths in Radom exceeded the number of births, making the front-page story of Friday\u2019s edition of the local daily, Echo Dnia, seem particularly fitting. \u201cThe crematorium is nearly ready,\u201d ran the headline over a report about how a new state-of-the-art facility run by a local company would open after Easter, offering employment to five locals and cremations for 650 zloty (\u00a3112).Wlodzimierz Wolski has often been the one who has been forced to pick up the pieces when families have been separated as parents disappear to work abroad.\u201cI frequently witness the psychological harm that is done to hundreds of thousands of children whose parents have gone abroad, leaving them with grandparents or aunts and uncles,\u201d the 64-year-old psychologist and director of Radom\u2019s Centre for Crisis Intervention said. \u201cIn every case we\u2019ve been made aware of, we contact the parents and urge them to come back.\u201dHis most recent \u201cEuro-orphans\u201d case involved two teenage daughters left in the care of their overwhelmed grandmother while their mother and father went to London to work as a dishwasher and a construction worker. \u201cThe 14-year-old went off the rails and her grandmother came to us desperately seeking help,\u201d Wolski says. \u201cI rang the mother, who immediately expressed her shame but said she had had little choice but to go six months beforehand, because they could barely afford to feed the kids in Poland.\u201dJust two days later the mother had returned. The father is continuing to work on a UK building site and to send money back to his family. \u201cFor me, as for all Poles, it\u2019s a very upsetting situation,\u201d Wolski said. \u201cAnd because it is a pure sense of need that is sending many Poles to work abroad, how it hurts to listen to David Cameron saying he wants to put restrictions on people working, even though he must realise how dependent the British economy is on Polish workers.\u201dAt Radom\u2019s job centre, its director, Jozef Bakula, talks of the daily struggle of living in a shrinking town \u2013 with its unemployment rate of more than 20%, and an average gross monthly wage of 3,411 zloty (\u00a3586), one of the lowest in the country (Warsaw\u2019s is 5,077 zloty). \u201cWe have a huge shortage of certain types of workers, because they\u2019ve gone elsewhere to find work that is better paid,\u201d he said.\u201cThe city is 10 GPs short, and we\u2019re also missing IT workers, carpenters, plumbers and construction workers who\u2019ve gone elsewhere to work. The situation is paradoxical because we have absorbed the cost of their education and training and often their upkeep, and then they go abroad and we\u2019re no longer the beneficiary of their skills or the GDP they\u2019re creating,\u201d he said, from his fourth-floor office overlooking the city\u2019s colourful communist-era housing blocks. When Bakula met his Dublin counterpart during a recent EU-funded study trip to Ireland, \u201cthey told us Polish accession is the best thing that could have happened to them, that \u2018the brightest and best Poles came here\u2019,\u201d he recalled.In contrast, he says, teachers, many of whom have been laid off as the city\u2019s population has shrunk, are in abundance, along with many manual labourers, often metal workers formerly employed at the local arms factory whose skills have not been updated since communist times.In the corridor where scores of job hunters \u2013 most of whom, Bakula said, are invariably unqualified or wrongly skilled \u2013 sit looking downtrodden and bored, the green screen flickers above them with an apparent abundance of fresh work opportunities, from pharmacists, to car mechanics, welders to turners \u2013 all vacancies that are hard to fill.Bakula\u2019s son is a trainee anaesthetist. He hoped he would choose to stay in Poland \u2013 \u201cbut I can\u2019t stop him doing what he wants\u201d, he said.Government initiatives have tried to encourage workers to return to Poland. A returnee programme called Powroty (Returns), which offered incentives for people to come back and use their skills in Poland, was \u2013 even the government admits \u2013 a flop.But Izabela Grabowska-Lusinska, professor at the Centre of Migration Research in Warsaw, warned against simplifying the issues, arguing that the Polish economy is still suffering from the \u201ctransformation shock\u201d of switching from a centrally planned economy to a market-based one. \u201cThere is a huge mismatch between skills workers have and those the economy needs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for the labour office to match those huge gaps, and so the decisions workers take to go abroad are very rational ones, even if the decision itself is often high-risk. Often migration is the only way in which the labour market can move and it\u2019s a good thing.\u201dAt a pensioners\u2019 day centre on Henryka Sienkiewicza Street in Radom\u2019s picturesque city centre, some played cards, while others sipped tea and chatted about their concerns for the future. Everyone had a story to tell of a loved one who had migrated abroad. Halina Swiderska, 67, its manager, broke down as she spoke of the hopes she had had for her handsome son, Tomasz, who she had helped get a job as a security guard in Cork 10 years ago. \u201cBut after just a few years he came back home in a coffin \u2013 he had had a brain tumour,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes. Her grandson Dominik, seven, is still there, with her daughter-in-law who works for an American pharmaceutical company. Meanwhile she has managed to keep her two older daughters close to her in Radom. \u201cBut only because I subsidise them both with my 1,300 zloty monthly pension,\u201d she said. Life \u2013 their attempts to have normality and to afford basic things \u2013 \u201cwas such a struggle for them, they have both decided against having more than one child\u201d, she said. Other members tell very similar stories.\u201cWhich leads to the question,\u201d Swiderska said, \u201cwhen we and our children are infirm, who will be left to look after us?\u201d", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "As Poland loses its doctors and builders, \u2018Euro-orphans\u2019 are left at home to suffer"},{"date": "2015-03-29T06:00:05Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Hubert the anarchist is showing me around Centrum Reanimacji Kultury (CRK), a non-profit, post-punk commune epitomising the spirit of resistance in Wroc\u0142aw (pronounced \u201cVrots-wav\u201d), Poland\u2019s fourth largest city. CRK\u2019s courtyard is covered in street art, including early work by Mariusz Waras (aka M-City), and from rehearsal rooms I can hear violins and vocals that remind me of Warsaw Village Band.Inspired by London\u2019s Reclaim the Streets collective, Hubert set about developing this \u201cDIY social/cultural centre\u201d in Nadodrze, a downbeat former industrial area. Nowadays, he focuses on his band, Kurws, and, as a cultural activist, on protecting the right to drink alcohol outdoors on the city-centre island between two arms of the Oder river \u2013 home to summer gigs and screenings. Until recently, it was the only place in Poland where it was legal to drink in the open.Next year, Wroc\u0142aw becomes European Capital of Culture and World Book Capital City, and Hubert wants to see some of the official money find its way to Nadodrze: \u201cWroc\u0142aw 2016 must leave a legacy for areas such as this, too \u2013 and not blow all the money on fireworks.\u2019\u2019Under communist rule, Wroc\u0142aw was the \u201cfortress of Solidarity\u201d, the centre of resistance when Poland\u2019s epoch-making trade union was made illegal under martial law in the early 1980s, and that spirit remains in these post-punk venues, in former breweries and in big German hofs (courtyards), an architectural legacy of Wroc\u0142aw\u2019s time as German Breslau.

The film director faced a jail term after he pleaded guilty to having unlawful sex with Samantha Gailey (now Geimer), then aged 13. His plea was part of a bargain that saw other more serious charges, including rape, dropped. Polanski absconded before the sentencing, however, and has lived in France ever since.Poland is receiving the request because Polanski has been visiting Krakow, preparing for his film An Officer and a Spy. The US made an initial attempt in October last year, by filing an arrest warrant when Polanski travelled to Warsaw. The director was brought in for questioning by the Polish authorities but was not arrested.However, justice ministry spokesman Mateusz Martyniuk said that the Polish statute of limitations (preventing prosecutions in cases where a number of years have lapsed since the crime) \u201cdoes not apply to US requests\u201d, meaning that Polanski could yet be sent back to the US. Last year Martyniuk said that the director was free to travel as no extradition request had been made \u2013 the director could now potentially see that freedom curtailed. Regarding the new request, Martyniuk acknowledged: \u201cProsecutors will want to summon Polanski for questioning.\u201dOne of Polanski\u2019s Polish lawyers, Jerzy Stachowicz, told Reuters: \u201cIn our view no new circumstances have arisen which could lead to a change in the decision by the prosecutor\u2019s office in October.\u201dPolanski has risked extradition before \u2013 in 2009 he was arrested in Switzerland when he went to a film festival there, but the case collapsed.In December 2014 he unsuccessfully bid to have the original case dismissed. A judge in the original case allegedly discussed the case with journalists and lawyers as it was ongoing, and this misconduct, Polanski\u2019s legal team hoped, would help exonerate him. But a judge ruled that Polanski\u2019s fugitive status means that the case cannot be thrown out.In an interview with Vanity Fair last year, Polanski described his reasons for fleeing the US. \u201cIt was such a shock to learn that it\u2019s not finished, after they let you out of prison,\u201d he said, referring to the 42 days he served behind bars as part of the plea bargain. \u201cFree! With your bundle under your arm, with the lawyer waiting for you outside; standing there, in your mind it\u2019s all over, it\u2019s finished. And then the judge changed his mind. And I have to go back to prison, and nobody knows how long. I just could not go through that.\u201d", "tags": ["Roman Polanski", "Film", "Culture", "Poland", "US news", "Europe"], "title": "US sends Poland extradition request for Roman Polanski"},{"date": "2015-03-15T00:05:05Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Hopping on the spot at platform 19 of Radom bus station, dressed in electric-blue drainpipe jeans, Katarzyna tries to keep warm despite the icy drizzle and to make light of her imminent departure from her son David, as he tucks into the ice-cream she has bought him.The 35-year-old is travelling to the town of Treia in the central Marche in Italy, where she\u2019ll spend three months working in a restaurant, earning around \u20ac1,035 (\u00a3736) a month, cash in hand. \u201cIt\u2019s six times what I\u2019d earn in Poland \u2013 that is, if I could even get a job here,\u201d she says, hastily drawing on a cigarette before her bus departs. David is taken home by his grandfather, who will look after him until his mother returns in June. The eight-year-old is what has become known as a \u201cEuro-sierota\u201d or \u201cEuro-orphan\u201d \u2013 a child left behind in Poland with relatives while its parents go abroad to work, a phenomenon from the era before Poland joined the European Union in 2004, but which has only grown since then.Katarzyna, one of a very vaguely estimated two million Poles who are living and working abroad, has been doing a similar stint for 12 years. But in a study last week the World Bank warned that towns across eastern Europe, like Radom \u2013 which lies about 75 miles south of Warsaw \u2013 are growing prematurely old due to the extensive migration that has taken place in recent years, coupled with drastically falling birthrates. A glance at the statistics is enough to realise the demographic squeeze that is already taking place in Radom and will only worsen as its population both ages and shrinks. If the trend continues, according to the study, it will have a huge impact on pensions, the public purse and economic growth.Statisticians have called Radom, with its 220,000 inhabitants and its roots in the middle ages, one of the fastest-shrinking towns in Poland and eastern Europe. The latest figures, taken from Poland\u2019s Central Office of Statistics, show that in 2012 the proportion of under-17s was 17%, the 18- to 65-year-olds made up 64% of the population and those 65 and over, 19%. By 2035 those figures are expected to be 15%, 56% and 29%. And the trend of ever fewer births and an ageing population, supported by an ever smaller \u201cproductive middle\u201d, is only set to continue. According to the World Bank report, if trends continue the entire region\u2019s workforce can be expected to fall by almost 14 million by 2060.Critically, 2012 marked the point that the number of deaths in Radom exceeded the number of births, making the front-page story of Friday\u2019s edition of the local daily, Echo Dnia, seem particularly fitting. \u201cThe crematorium is nearly ready,\u201d ran the headline over a report about how a new state-of-the-art facility run by a local company would open after Easter, offering employment to five locals and cremations for 650 zloty (\u00a3112).Wlodzimierz Wolski has often been the one who has been forced to pick up the pieces when families have been separated as parents disappear to work abroad.\u201cI frequently witness the psychological harm that is done to hundreds of thousands of children whose parents have gone abroad, leaving them with grandparents or aunts and uncles,\u201d the 64-year-old psychologist and director of Radom\u2019s Centre for Crisis Intervention said. \u201cIn every case we\u2019ve been made aware of, we contact the parents and urge them to come back.\u201dHis most recent \u201cEuro-orphans\u201d case involved two teenage daughters left in the care of their overwhelmed grandmother while their mother and father went to London to work as a dishwasher and a construction worker. \u201cThe 14-year-old went off the rails and her grandmother came to us desperately seeking help,\u201d Wolski says. \u201cI rang the mother, who immediately expressed her shame but said she had had little choice but to go six months beforehand, because they could barely afford to feed the kids in Poland.\u201dJust two days later the mother had returned. The father is continuing to work on a UK building site and to send money back to his family. \u201cFor me, as for all Poles, it\u2019s a very upsetting situation,\u201d Wolski said. \u201cAnd because it is a pure sense of need that is sending many Poles to work abroad, how it hurts to listen to David Cameron saying he wants to put restrictions on people working, even though he must realise how dependent the British economy is on Polish workers.\u201dAt Radom\u2019s job centre, its director, Jozef Bakula, talks of the daily struggle of living in a shrinking town \u2013 with its unemployment rate of more than 20%, and an average gross monthly wage of 3,411 zloty (\u00a3586), one of the lowest in the country (Warsaw\u2019s is 5,077 zloty). \u201cWe have a huge shortage of certain types of workers, because they\u2019ve gone elsewhere to find work that is better paid,\u201d he said.\u201cThe city is 10 GPs short, and we\u2019re also missing IT workers, carpenters, plumbers and construction workers who\u2019ve gone elsewhere to work. The situation is paradoxical because we have absorbed the cost of their education and training and often their upkeep, and then they go abroad and we\u2019re no longer the beneficiary of their skills or the GDP they\u2019re creating,\u201d he said, from his fourth-floor office overlooking the city\u2019s colourful communist-era housing blocks. When Bakula met his Dublin counterpart during a recent EU-funded study trip to Ireland, \u201cthey told us Polish accession is the best thing that could have happened to them, that \u2018the brightest and best Poles came here\u2019,\u201d he recalled.In contrast, he says, teachers, many of whom have been laid off as the city\u2019s population has shrunk, are in abundance, along with many manual labourers, often metal workers formerly employed at the local arms factory whose skills have not been updated since communist times.In the corridor where scores of job hunters \u2013 most of whom, Bakula said, are invariably unqualified or wrongly skilled \u2013 sit looking downtrodden and bored, the green screen flickers above them with an apparent abundance of fresh work opportunities, from pharmacists, to car mechanics, welders to turners \u2013 all vacancies that are hard to fill.Bakula\u2019s son is a trainee anaesthetist. He hoped he would choose to stay in Poland \u2013 \u201cbut I can\u2019t stop him doing what he wants\u201d, he said.Government initiatives have tried to encourage workers to return to Poland. A returnee programme called Powroty (Returns), which offered incentives for people to come back and use their skills in Poland, was \u2013 even the government admits \u2013 a flop.But Izabela Grabowska-Lusinska, professor at the Centre of Migration Research in Warsaw, warned against simplifying the issues, arguing that the Polish economy is still suffering from the \u201ctransformation shock\u201d of switching from a centrally planned economy to a market-based one. \u201cThere is a huge mismatch between skills workers have and those the economy needs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for the labour office to match those huge gaps, and so the decisions workers take to go abroad are very rational ones, even if the decision itself is often high-risk. Often migration is the only way in which the labour market can move and it\u2019s a good thing.\u201dAt a pensioners\u2019 day centre on Henryka Sienkiewicza Street in Radom\u2019s picturesque city centre, some played cards, while others sipped tea and chatted about their concerns for the future. Everyone had a story to tell of a loved one who had migrated abroad. Halina Swiderska, 67, its manager, broke down as she spoke of the hopes she had had for her handsome son, Tomasz, who she had helped get a job as a security guard in Cork 10 years ago. \u201cBut after just a few years he came back home in a coffin \u2013 he had had a brain tumour,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes. Her grandson Dominik, seven, is still there, with her daughter-in-law who works for an American pharmaceutical company. Meanwhile she has managed to keep her two older daughters close to her in Radom. \u201cBut only because I subsidise them both with my 1,300 zloty monthly pension,\u201d she said. Life \u2013 their attempts to have normality and to afford basic things \u2013 \u201cwas such a struggle for them, they have both decided against having more than one child\u201d, she said. Other members tell very similar stories.\u201cWhich leads to the question,\u201d Swiderska said, \u201cwhen we and our children are infirm, who will be left to look after us?\u201d", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "As Poland loses its doctors and builders, \u2018Euro-orphans\u2019 are left at home to suffer"},{"date": "2015-02-23T04:38:58Z", "country": "poland", "content": "When the house lights go down for the 87th Academy Awards in Hollywood on 22 February, much of the speculation will be about Birdman, Boyhood and whether JK Simmons, star of Whiplash, will berate the orchestra for being slightly off-tempo. But Oscar observers know that the movies to keep an eye on are not always in English, and that the best foreign language film category can be one of the most intriguing. Several films on this year\u2019s shortlist have been lauded over the past year by critics and viewers worldwide, and some have stirred major controversy in their own countries.Submissions to the best foreign language film category are sometimes seen as PR exercises for a country\u2019s film industry, or more generally for its culture: any country can put forward one film for Academy consideration. But this year the two frontrunners on the five-strong shortlist have spurred intense debate at home, with critics arguing that one, Polish film Ida, misrepresents the country\u2019s past, and that another, Andrei Zvyaginstev\u2019s Leviathan, spreads calumny on Russia\u2019s present and its ruling regime.Russian director Zvyagintsev made a striking debut with road movie The Return in 2003. Leviathan, his fourth feature, won best screenplay in Cannes last May; this year, it was named best foreign language film in the Golden Globes and by the London Critics\u2019 Circle, while in Russia Zvyagintsev won the Golden Eagle for best director. Set on the Baltic coast, Leviathan shows a man falling foul of a crooked mayor. The film is slyly but, for most critics, unmistakably critical of the Putin regime: in one scene, characters use portraits of Russian leaders from Lenin to Gorbachev for target practice, before the hero asks, \u201cHaven\u2019t you got anyone more recent?\u201dThe film impresses with its political bravery, but also with its austere visuals and Dostoevskian seriousness of tone. Surprisingly, it received substantial state funding. But Leviathan has been widely attacked at home: church groups have objected to its depiction of a corrupt Orthodox priest; the head of the town where it was shot complained that the film shows a \u201cdirty, unwashed Russia\u201d; and culture minister Vladimir Medinsky commented that films \u201cwith a sense of despair and hopelessness over our existence should not be financed with taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d.In Cannes, Zvyagintsev told the Guardian: \u201cMy goal was certainly not to confront power\u2026 What we are doing is creating a work of art. Art must provide light. It should give people hope.\u201dBut after profanity laws meant a cut-down version of the film went on general release in Russia, the director encouraged his compatriots to download a version illegally; some estimate that there have been over 4m downloads so far.Equally feted and controversial is Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s Ida, set in Poland in 1962. It is about a novice nun who discovers she is Jewish and ventures into the secular world, where she and her aunt \u2013 once a feared state prosecutor \u2013 uncover painful truths about Poland in the second world war and 1950s. Scripted by Pawlikowski with British playwright Rebecca Lenkiewicz, Ida has grossed more than $3.7m in the US and been a major hit in France. Voted best film in the European Film Awards, it won the best foreign language film Bafta and numerous festival prizes. Tonight Ida could triumph twice: its luminous black-and-white camerawork has earned it a best cinematography nomination.Born in Poland, Pawlikowski moved to Britain in his teens and established himself as a documentarist before making Last Resort  in 2000 and My Summer of Love in 2004, the latter launching Emily Blunt\u2019s screen career.Ida is the first film Pawlikowski has made in Poland, where he now lives; it has won numerous awards there too, but hasn\u2019t pleased everyone. The Polish Anti-Defamation League accused the film of failing to acknowledge Germany\u2019s wartime occupation of the country and launched a petition, now signed by around 40,000 people, demanding that Ida be screened with captions outlining the historical context. And leftwing magazine Krytyka Polityczna detected \u201cvulgar antisemitic tropes\u201d in one character.Speaking on Skype, Pawlikowski told me he\u2019d intended to make \u201ca film that was in dialogue with the Poland of the early 1960s \u2013 not just cinema, but novels, music, theatre, the whole attitude of the period, which I love. It\u2019s about my parents\u2019 generation.\u201dHe attributes the antagonism to Ida mainly to \u201ca right wing in Poland that\u2019s off its head and generates this feeling that we\u2019re being besieged, under some permanent struggle \u2013 completely ignoring the reality of Poland.\u201d Pointing to the problems faced in Russia by Leviathan \u2013 a film he greatly admires \u2013 Pawlikowski says: \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018patriotic\u2019 element, in inverted commas, in most countries that feels films are there to sell a good image of the country and don\u2019t have the autonomy to be just good films.\u201dBut he is delighted, and not a little surprised, at Ida\u2019s Oscar nominations. \u201cIt\u2019s a quiet film about withdrawal from the world. To have it suddenly in that context is surreal, but wonderful.\u201dLeviathan and Ida are not without competition. One strong contender is Timbuktu, by Mauritanian director Abderrahmane Sissako, which swept the board at France\u2019s C\u00e9sar awards. It is a loosely structured panoramic account of the advent of jihadism in Mali, an angry, compassionate film, more effective for its initial light touch, before it turns increasingly tragic. But academy voters prefer something less troubling, theymay opt for sleekly entertaining Argentinian comedy Wild Tales, by Dami\u00e1n Szifr\u00f3n, an up-and-comer widely tipped for a Hollywood career. With Pedro Almod\u00f3var among his producers, Szifr\u00f3n offers sketches showing that beneath our civilised veneer, we\u2019re all wild at heart.The remaining title is Estonian-Georgian Tangerines, a solid but artistically modest anti-war statement. There was surprise at its inclusion in the shortlist at the expense of Force Majeure, an unsettling Swedish psychodrama about a man\u2019s breakdown during a ski holiday. No one, it seems, was more surprised at this film\u2019s snub than its director Ruben \u00d6stlund, seen in a YouTube clip listening to the nomination announcements. But \u00d6stlund appears to be having the last laugh; the clip is posted on Force Majeure\u2019s Facebook page, under the tagline \u2018Worst Man Cry Ever.\u2019Whichever film triumphs, it will be in illustrious company. Auteurs who have won include Federico Fellini (four times), Ingmar Bergman (three times), Akira Kurosawa and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. But the academy has not always been on the ball. Two magnificent films by Zhang Yimou, Ju Dou and Raise the Red Lantern \u2013 which helped put modern Chinese cinema on the map \u2013 were trumped by since-forgotten Swiss and Italian titles in 1991 and 1992 respectively. The 1977 swansong of surrealist maestro Luis Bu\u00f1uel, That Obscure Object of Desire, was beaten by a French film rarely mentioned today, Madame Rosa \u2013 perhaps because the latter didn\u2019t baffle voters by having two actresses play one part. The most egregious gaffe came in 1966, when glossy French romance A Man and a Woman (best remembered now for its \u201csha-ba-da-ba-da\u201d theme tune) beat Gillo Pontecorvo\u2019s The Battle of Algiers, today acknowledged as a masterpiece of political cinema. A key reference point for directors including Oliver Stone, Spike Lee and Paul Greengrass, as well as being considered essential viewing in its day by the Black Panther movement, The Battle of Algiers is a classic case of a film too uncompromising for Academy voters.The Academy is often accused of taking the soft option with foreign films, but in recent years it has proved open to challenging themes and forms. The past three foreign language Oscars have gone to Iranian marital drama A Separation, Michael Haneke\u2019s severe look at old age, Amour, and the extravagantly stylised Italian film The Great Beauty.Even so, I suspect the academy will balk at the intensity of Timbuktu, which leaves the field to Leviathan and Ida \u2013 and either would be a deserving winner. One way or another, expect to order a vodka chaser with your Oscar night champagne. Whether it\u2019s Russian or Polish remains to be seen.Babette\u2019s Feast, 1987 Gabriel Axel\u2019s 19th-century Danish drama about two adult sisters, an austere father, French refugee Babette \u2013 and a massive meal.Life is Beautiful, 1988 Italian Roberto Benigni\u2019s surprise comedy hit about the Holocaust picked up three Oscars.All About My Mother, 1999 Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s film about a mother returning to Barcelona, the place of her birth, and resuming relations with various characters from her past.Amour, 2012 Michael Haneke\u2019s painful chamber drama about the aftermath of a stroke for an octogenarian couple.", "tags": ["Oscars 2015", "World cinema", "Film", "Ida", "Leviathan"], "title": "Ida and Leviathan: under attack at home, but heading for Oscar glory"},{"date": "2015-04-24T18:00:36Z", "country": "poland", "content": " Related: Poland demands apology for FBI chief's comment on Holocaust The government of Poland has asked the American toy maker Mattel to withdraw a party game, over a reference to \u201cNazi Poland\u201d on one of its cards.

This was higher than the western European average of 82 and Britain\u2019s 74. Poland reformed its schooling system in 2009 to introduce compulsory education between the ages of six and 18 as well as statutory entitlement to a year of pre-school. Poland is ahead of the UK when it comes to teacher-to-pupil ratio and levels of tertiary enrolment. In both of those measures, the UK has been falling behind the average improvement for the rest of the world. Although its overall well-being score at 71.6 was lower than Britain\u2019s 81.1, Poland also slightly outperformed the UK on the health dimension of the Seda score. Poland\u2019s improvement in overall wellbeing between 2006 and 2013 was higher than any other country when adjusted for how much each economy grew during that period. The only area where it stuttered was what the report describes as its \u201cweak\u201d infrastructure, with Poland\u2019s recent performance in this measure lagging behind comparable economies. Polish ministers were angered last year after UK prime minister David Cameron gave a speech judged to be negatively singling out Polish migrants to the UK. Douglas Beal, a partner who leads BCG\u2019s global economic development work in the firm\u2019s Public Sector practice and is a co-author of the report, said: \u201cEmigration from Poland continued until 2006-07 when the net outflow stopped. The timing of this goes hand in hand with the improvements in well-being that we have seen.\u201dAnother co-author, senior BCG economics advisor Enrique Rueda-Sabater, said: \u201cIt is actually a pretty positive story. They [Poland] are not improving well-being by sending everyone to the UK. Domestic job growth and their performance on our employment dimension confirms that.\u201dNorway was judged to be the country where citizens have the best wellbeing in the world followed by Luxembourg and then Switzerland. Singapore was the only non-European country to make it into the top 10. At the bottom of the rankings was the Central African Republic, with Chad, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ranking just above.BCG also gave a score based on how countries had improved well-being between 2006 and 2013 and at the top of that list were Rwanda and Ethiopia. This partially reflects big steps forward in health for countries in sub-Saharan Africa generally. Other than health and education, the dimensions analysed by the report are: income, economic stability, employment, infrastructure, income equality, civil society, governance and environment. Across these dimensions, the analysis draws on nearly 50,000 different data points. Beal explains the rationale behind Seda: \u201cAs the world finally emerges from the global recession, policy makers are focusing on how to sustain and accelerate their country\u2019s growth rates. Leaders must now embark upon a new era and actively pursue well-being\u2014not just GDP\u2014as the primary goal. \u201cThey can and should measure well-being, and hold themselves against it. As one of the new leaders in well-being revealed in this year\u2019s report, Poland shows that you don\u2019t necessarily need high GDP growth to improve the lives of citizens, and that countries that focus on well-being seem to succeed on more fronts.\u201dThe report is being released before the conclusion of discussions in September to finalise what targets for economic and social outcomes by 2030 will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. In his foreword to the report, Nobel prize-winning economist A. Michael Spence said: \u201cTo pursue wellbeing effectively, countries need to achieve economic growth that is both socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable.

The request, made through the embassy in Washington, came a week after the US ambassador in Warsaw was summoned to the Polish foreign ministry over remarks made by the FBI director, James Comey, about the Holocaust and \u201cthe murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary\u201d.The Mattel game, Apples to Apples, asks players to compare things \u2013 in its original version, nouns and adjectives \u2013 in order to create \u201ccrazy combinations\u201d in a game \u201cas unique as the individuals who are playing\u201d. The game has sold in the millions and comes in many versions, including junior, kids Disney and Bible editions.The card, which came to the attention of the Polish government, is entitled Schindler\u2019s List and contains the text: \u201c1993 Steven Spielberg film. Powerful, real-life story of a Catholic businessman who eventually saved over 1,000 Jews in Nazi Poland.\u201dA statement from the Polish embassy said the wording was \u201ccompletely inconsistent with the historical truth and detrimental to the good name of our country\u201d.Mattel did not immediately comment. It was not clear which edition of the game contained the card in question.Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany during the second world war. Millions of Polish citizens were killed. Death camps, including Auschwitz, Belzec, Treblinka and Sobibor, were operated by the Nazis on Polish soil. Among Poles, correct terminology and attribution when discussing such issues remains a key concern.The Polish embassy website, for example, offers readers a \u201chow-to guide: against Polish death/concentration camps\u201d. The text notes \u201can increase in the occurrence of factually incorrect slurs as \u2018Polish death camps\u2019 in news articles\u201d and encourages readers to comment on and protest over such usages. \u201cWe react whenever we see such slurs,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe need you to do the same.\u201dComey\u2019s remarks were contained in a speech he gave at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington last week, which was subsequently published as an op-ed piece for the Washington Post. In his speech, which was titled Why I require FBI agents to visit the Holocaust Museum, Comey discussed \u201cways to fight evil to ensure it doesn\u2019t hold the field\u201d.In the passage which became contentious, he said: \u201cIn their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn\u2019t do something evil.\u201dIn response, the Polish prime minister Ewa Kopacz, said: \u201cTo those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way, I want to say that Poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of world war two.\u201dOn Wednesday, in a letter to the Polish ambassador, Comey said: \u201cI regret linking Germany and Poland in my speech because Poland was invaded and occupied by Germany. The Polish state bears no responsibility for the horrors imposed by the Nazis. I wish I had not used any other country names because my point was a universal one about human nature.\u201d The Polish foreign minister, Grzegorz Schetyna, said Comey\u2019s letter was \u201cbetter late than never\u201d and added that the matter was closed.Prime Minister Kopacz, however, said: \u201cTo be sure, every Pole had expected more.\u201dThe FBI director is not the highest-placed US official to have experienced such embarrassment.

Poland, a strictly Roman Catholic country, is one of the few places in Europe where women can get a legal abortion only if there is proof of rape or incest, the mother\u2019s life is endangered or the foetus is severely malformed. The group said it had chosen the unusual method of delivery in order to highlight Poland\u2019s restrictive abortion laws. Other European countries such as Portugal, Spain and the UK \u2013 except for Northern Ireland \u2013 offer abortions on request as long as certain conditions are met.Rebecca Gomperts, a doctor and founder of Women on Waves, said: \u201cWe want to create awareness about women\u2019s right to a safe abortion. The drone is another way to use the different laws in different countries in order to draw attention to the social injustice that women who are living in places where abortion is illegal are subject to.\u201cIn Poland, even women who could have an abortion under Polish law are often denied it because Catholic hospitals don\u2019t help them, even if their life is in danger. Rich people can go to Germany or the UK to have abortions, but it\u2019s the women who don\u2019t have the means or access to information who are suffering.\u201dGomperts said the abortion drone did not require authorisation from the Polish or German government as it would not be flying through controlled airspace, was not for commercial purposes and weighed less than 5kg. The pills \u2013 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2013 can be taken up to nine weeks into a pregnancy. Women on Waves provides medical abortion pills around the world, usually by post after women place orders online.It is estimated that at least 50,000 underground abortions take place in Poland each year. Doctors who perform them illegally often use outdated tools and procedures, and charge up to \u20ac4,000 (\u00a32,850). \u201cWoman who have abortions in Poland are not criminalised, it\u2019s the people who provide the abortions who are acting illegally,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cWe want to create awareness among Polish women that there is medicine that is safe to use. So that whenever they look for abortions they will make sure it is safe.\u201dThe exact location of the drone dropoff will be announced on Friday. Pro-life groups have reportedly vowed to shoot it down. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to shoot down a drone and fortunately guns are not that easy to get in Europe,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cBut it\u2019s problematic because it\u2019s a very aggressive strategy that\u2019s intended to make people afraid. And it\u2019s nonsense because it will not stop women from needing an abortion.\u201dIf the mission is successful, Women on Waves hopes to send drones to other countries in Europe that criminalise abortion, such as Ireland and Malta. \u201cWe would definitely be able to extend this programme,\u201d Gompert said.", "tags": ["Abortion", "Poland", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "'Abortion drone' to fly pills across border into Poland"},{"date": "2015-05-28T06:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland is outperforming the UK when it comes to education as well as being the world leader in converting economic growth into the well-being of its citizens, according to a new report.The Sustainable economic development assessment (Seda) by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) measures wellbeing across 149 countries.Under the education dimension of Seda, Poland got a score of 90 (the best country gets 100 and the worst zero). This was higher than the western European average of 82 and Britain\u2019s 74. Poland reformed its schooling system in 2009 to introduce compulsory education between the ages of six and 18 as well as statutory entitlement to a year of pre-school. Poland is ahead of the UK when it comes to teacher-to-pupil ratio and levels of tertiary enrolment. In both of those measures, the UK has been falling behind the average improvement for the rest of the world. Although its overall well-being score at 71.6 was lower than Britain\u2019s 81.1, Poland also slightly outperformed the UK on the health dimension of the Seda score. Poland\u2019s improvement in overall wellbeing between 2006 and 2013 was higher than any other country when adjusted for how much each economy grew during that period. The only area where it stuttered was what the report describes as its \u201cweak\u201d infrastructure, with Poland\u2019s recent performance in this measure lagging behind comparable economies. Polish ministers were angered last year after UK prime minister David Cameron gave a speech judged to be negatively singling out Polish migrants to the UK. Douglas Beal, a partner who leads BCG\u2019s global economic development work in the firm\u2019s Public Sector practice and is a co-author of the report, said: \u201cEmigration from Poland continued until 2006-07 when the net outflow stopped. The timing of this goes hand in hand with the improvements in well-being that we have seen.\u201dAnother co-author, senior BCG economics advisor Enrique Rueda-Sabater, said: \u201cIt is actually a pretty positive story. They [Poland] are not improving well-being by sending everyone to the UK. Domestic job growth and their performance on our employment dimension confirms that.\u201dNorway was judged to be the country where citizens have the best wellbeing in the world followed by Luxembourg and then Switzerland. Singapore was the only non-European country to make it into the top 10. At the bottom of the rankings was the Central African Republic, with Chad, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ranking just above.BCG also gave a score based on how countries had improved well-being between 2006 and 2013 and at the top of that list were Rwanda and Ethiopia. This partially reflects big steps forward in health for countries in sub-Saharan Africa generally. Other than health and education, the dimensions analysed by the report are: income, economic stability, employment, infrastructure, income equality, civil society, governance and environment. Across these dimensions, the analysis draws on nearly 50,000 different data points. Beal explains the rationale behind Seda: \u201cAs the world finally emerges from the global recession, policy makers are focusing on how to sustain and accelerate their country\u2019s growth rates. Leaders must now embark upon a new era and actively pursue well-being\u2014not just GDP\u2014as the primary goal. \u201cThey can and should measure well-being, and hold themselves against it. As one of the new leaders in well-being revealed in this year\u2019s report, Poland shows that you don\u2019t necessarily need high GDP growth to improve the lives of citizens, and that countries that focus on well-being seem to succeed on more fronts.\u201dThe report is being released before the conclusion of discussions in September to finalise what targets for economic and social outcomes by 2030 will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. In his foreword to the report, Nobel prize-winning economist A. Michael Spence said: \u201cTo pursue wellbeing effectively, countries need to achieve economic growth that is both socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The importance of a decisive, broad-based effort in this regard cannot be overemphasised. It is very good and encouraging to see the kind of contribution that this report, developed by strategy experts focused on wellbeing, makes to that effort.\u201d ", "tags": ["World news", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Business", "Economics"], "title": "Poland outperforms UK in education and health, report finds"},{"date": "2015-05-13T05:00:02Z", "country": "poland", "content": "  As sunlight streams through the windows of Warsaw\u2019s Church of the Basilian Fathers, a priest in gold robes swings a clanking censer around the altar.

The group said it still planned to ride to Berlin, but would find alternative ways to do so.The Night Wolves are controversial due to their support for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and their role in the annexation of Crimea last year and subsequently in east Ukraine. Their leader, Alexander Zaldostanov, is known as \u201cthe Surgeon\u201d and is one of the founders of Anti-Maidan, a Russian group that has promised to crush liberal protesters it believes are determined to create a Ukrainian-style revolution in Russia. The Surgeon is seen as friendly with Putin, and the Russian president has previously ridden with the gang in a photo opportunity aimed at boosting his macho image.A group of around 15 riders made it to the border between the Belarusian town of Brest and the Polish town of Terespol on Monday, with five of them saying they had no visas for Poland but were there to wave off their friends. The 10 were allowed through by Belarusian guards but were turned back by the Poles.\u201cThese people will not cross into Poland.

Other Poles have spoken out against the bikers and have demanded they be banned from the country. However, some Polish bikers supported the rally, and had planned to escort the Night Wolves through the country. About 100 of them gathered on the Polish side of the border and honked horns in protest against the ban.The Night Wolves have said they will continue with their plans to ride to Berlin even if they are turned away by Poland.\u201cOther people who will not say they are Night Wolves will travel by other routes and accomplish this mission,\u201d Zaldostanov told Russian agency LifeNews.Zaldostanov himself was not travelling with the column, and has remained in Moscow, as his passport is currently at the embassy of a European country awaiting a visa decision, the biker group said. Zaldostanov had said he would catch up with the column as soon as he gets a visa.The original route was due to take them from Belarus through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, to reach Berlin in time for 9 May.Russia has lavish plans for Victory Day this year, with a parade of 16,000 soldiers on Red Square and the newest military vehicles and planes on display. Putin will host a number of world leaders, including the leaders of China, India and Brazil, and Kim Jong-un, the reclusive leader of North Korea.

Poland, a strictly Roman Catholic country, is one of the few places in Europe where women can get a legal abortion only if there is proof of rape or incest, the mother\u2019s life is endangered or the foetus is severely malformed. The group said it had chosen the unusual method of delivery in order to highlight Poland\u2019s restrictive abortion laws. Other European countries such as Portugal, Spain and the UK \u2013 except for Northern Ireland \u2013 offer abortions on request as long as certain conditions are met.Rebecca Gomperts, a doctor and founder of Women on Waves, said: \u201cWe want to create awareness about women\u2019s right to a safe abortion. The drone is another way to use the different laws in different countries in order to draw attention to the social injustice that women who are living in places where abortion is illegal are subject to.\u201cIn Poland, even women who could have an abortion under Polish law are often denied it because Catholic hospitals don\u2019t help them, even if their life is in danger. Rich people can go to Germany or the UK to have abortions, but it\u2019s the women who don\u2019t have the means or access to information who are suffering.\u201dGomperts said the abortion drone did not require authorisation from the Polish or German government as it would not be flying through controlled airspace, was not for commercial purposes and weighed less than 5kg. The pills \u2013 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2013 can be taken up to nine weeks into a pregnancy. Women on Waves provides medical abortion pills around the world, usually by post after women place orders online.It is estimated that at least 50,000 underground abortions take place in Poland each year. Doctors who perform them illegally often use outdated tools and procedures, and charge up to \u20ac4,000 (\u00a32,850). \u201cWoman who have abortions in Poland are not criminalised, it\u2019s the people who provide the abortions who are acting illegally,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cWe want to create awareness among Polish women that there is medicine that is safe to use. So that whenever they look for abortions they will make sure it is safe.\u201dThe exact location of the drone dropoff will be announced on Friday. Pro-life groups have reportedly vowed to shoot it down. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to shoot down a drone and fortunately guns are not that easy to get in Europe,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cBut it\u2019s problematic because it\u2019s a very aggressive strategy that\u2019s intended to make people afraid. And it\u2019s nonsense because it will not stop women from needing an abortion.\u201dIf the mission is successful, Women on Waves hopes to send drones to other countries in Europe that criminalise abortion, such as Ireland and Malta. \u201cWe would definitely be able to extend this programme,\u201d Gompert said.", "tags": ["Abortion", "Poland", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "'Abortion drone' to fly pills across border into Poland"},{"date": "2015-05-28T06:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland is outperforming the UK when it comes to education as well as being the world leader in converting economic growth into the well-being of its citizens, according to a new report.The Sustainable economic development assessment (Seda) by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) measures wellbeing across 149 countries.Under the education dimension of Seda, Poland got a score of 90 (the best country gets 100 and the worst zero). This was higher than the western European average of 82 and Britain\u2019s 74. Poland reformed its schooling system in 2009 to introduce compulsory education between the ages of six and 18 as well as statutory entitlement to a year of pre-school. Poland is ahead of the UK when it comes to teacher-to-pupil ratio and levels of tertiary enrolment. In both of those measures, the UK has been falling behind the average improvement for the rest of the world. Although its overall well-being score at 71.6 was lower than Britain\u2019s 81.1, Poland also slightly outperformed the UK on the health dimension of the Seda score. Poland\u2019s improvement in overall wellbeing between 2006 and 2013 was higher than any other country when adjusted for how much each economy grew during that period. The only area where it stuttered was what the report describes as its \u201cweak\u201d infrastructure, with Poland\u2019s recent performance in this measure lagging behind comparable economies. Polish ministers were angered last year after UK prime minister David Cameron gave a speech judged to be negatively singling out Polish migrants to the UK. Douglas Beal, a partner who leads BCG\u2019s global economic development work in the firm\u2019s Public Sector practice and is a co-author of the report, said: \u201cEmigration from Poland continued until 2006-07 when the net outflow stopped. The timing of this goes hand in hand with the improvements in well-being that we have seen.\u201dAnother co-author, senior BCG economics advisor Enrique Rueda-Sabater, said: \u201cIt is actually a pretty positive story. They [Poland] are not improving well-being by sending everyone to the UK. Domestic job growth and their performance on our employment dimension confirms that.\u201dNorway was judged to be the country where citizens have the best wellbeing in the world followed by Luxembourg and then Switzerland. Singapore was the only non-European country to make it into the top 10. At the bottom of the rankings was the Central African Republic, with Chad, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ranking just above.BCG also gave a score based on how countries had improved well-being between 2006 and 2013 and at the top of that list were Rwanda and Ethiopia. This partially reflects big steps forward in health for countries in sub-Saharan Africa generally. Other than health and education, the dimensions analysed by the report are: income, economic stability, employment, infrastructure, income equality, civil society, governance and environment. Across these dimensions, the analysis draws on nearly 50,000 different data points. Beal explains the rationale behind Seda: \u201cAs the world finally emerges from the global recession, policy makers are focusing on how to sustain and accelerate their country\u2019s growth rates. Leaders must now embark upon a new era and actively pursue well-being\u2014not just GDP\u2014as the primary goal. \u201cThey can and should measure well-being, and hold themselves against it. As one of the new leaders in well-being revealed in this year\u2019s report, Poland shows that you don\u2019t necessarily need high GDP growth to improve the lives of citizens, and that countries that focus on well-being seem to succeed on more fronts.\u201dThe report is being released before the conclusion of discussions in September to finalise what targets for economic and social outcomes by 2030 will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. In his foreword to the report, Nobel prize-winning economist A. Michael Spence said: \u201cTo pursue wellbeing effectively, countries need to achieve economic growth that is both socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The importance of a decisive, broad-based effort in this regard cannot be overemphasised. It is very good and encouraging to see the kind of contribution that this report, developed by strategy experts focused on wellbeing, makes to that effort.\u201d ", "tags": ["World news", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Business", "Economics"], "title": "Poland outperforms UK in education and health, report finds"},{"date": "2015-05-13T05:00:02Z", "country": "poland", "content": "  As sunlight streams through the windows of Warsaw\u2019s Church of the Basilian Fathers, a priest in gold robes swings a clanking censer around the altar. He chants with a low intonation, and a choir in an upper gallery responds, their voices filling the airy church interior, which is dominated by huge oil paintings and numerous small icons of haloed saints.The congregation is mostly made up of ethnic Ukrainians, members of a community that numbers hundreds of thousands and has been growing rapidly since the start of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.Last year Poland issued 331,000 permits for short-term work to Ukrainians, up 50% on 2013, says Marta Jaroszewicz, a migration expert at the Centre For Eastern Studies (OSW), an independent Warsaw thinktank funded by the Polish government.She estimates that there are now 300,000-400,000 Ukrainians in Poland, as many as twice the officially recognised number. In January and February, the number of residence applications by Ukrainians in the Mazovian voivodeship \u2013 the province which includes Warsaw \u2013 was up 180% on the same months of 2014.The migrants have largely been welcomed, with some taking jobs vacated by Poles who have left for western Europe. But the numbers are a new phenomenon in a country more used to emigration than immigration.  Galyna, an elegantly dressed 42-year-old housekeeper from Ternopil in western Ukraine, stops to examine a church notice board. She has been in Warsaw for two years with her teenage daughter and son. \u201cI\u2019m here for my two years and I\u2019m staying for my children,\u201d she says. \u201cThis church is incredible, it\u2019s of enormous importance for us. We can be with other Ukrainians, and even if we didn\u2019t get on at home, here we are united and are brothers and sisters. It\u2019s hard to be here when our friends are at home and things are so hard, but with help from God the sun will rise after the darkness.\u201d \u201cWe are seeing many more people since the war,\u201d adds Katarzyna Sirocka, an ethnic-Ukrainian Polish citizen and head of the Association of Ukrainian Women in Poland. \u201cThose lucky enough to have papers in order work here as cleaners, construction workers and drivers. But many well-educated people who were psychologists and musicians in Ukraine are doing \u2018black work\u2019 [working illegally] here.\u201d Many of the congregation are working-class migrants from western Ukraine fleeing not the war itself, but its devastating economic fallout. But at the nearby Ukrainian World centre established by the Open Dialogue Foundation, a Polish NGO, to support the community, refugees from war-torn eastern Ukraine gather to seek help. \u201cWar is the reason we left,\u201d says Tetiana, 46, who left Luhansk for Warsaw, 1,000 miles away. \u201cWe lost our homes, our everything. The only way to survive was to go somewhere, and we decided to try to move to Poland. We want to stay here to try to live another life. When the situation in Ukraine improves, we will return \u2013 but we don\u2019t actually have a place to return to as our house was destroyed.\u201d Ukrainian World was established in 2014 and receives 100 visitors a day, with increasing numbers arriving from eastern Ukraine.  \u201cThose from the east are in the most difficulty,\u201d says Mateusz Kramek, the office co-ordinator at Ukrainian World. \u201cThey don\u2019t know Polish, don\u2019t know Warsaw, and often ran from their homes with just a few bags.\u201d  The centre provides practical help and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians, supplying donated clothes and food and assisting in applications for Polish visas and refugee status. There is a resident psychologist working in an upstairs room; outside, a girl waits for her appointment on a soggy sofa, while typing on a laptop.About 70% of those coming to the centre are seeking work or places at universities, while 30% want to register as refugees, says Kramek. Some hope to stay in Poland only briefly, before moving on to the west. The centre doubles as a home of political activity for supporting Ukraine, and regular meetings and events are held. There is a small \u201cLibrary of Maidan\u201d with Ukrainian books, and a museum consisting of a few cases of memorabilia from the Maidan \u2013 Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, the focus of the uprising. Photos of Maidan protesters and Ukrainian banners adorn the walls. A Ukrainian flag signed by government soldiers in eastern Ukraine hangs over a postbox for \u201cletters of hope\u201d to the front. In another room, a bizarre papier-mache model of Vladimir Putin as a Russian doll, complete with a Nazi tie, stands in a cage next to a model of one of the \u201clittle green men\u201d \u2013 soldiers involved in the Russian seizure of Crimea. Related: Russia shelled Ukrainians from within its own territory, says study  Poland\u2019s government has been one of the EU\u2019s most vocal supporters of Ukraine and opponents of Russia\u2019s actions. In this, it enjoys widespread support from the Polish electorate, and Poles donate generously to Ukrainian World, says Kramek. However, relations between Ukrainians and Poles have not always been so cordial, and memories of massacres and forced deportations during and after the second world war linger in some parts. Kramek says that there are some \u201chaters\u201d who take to the organisation\u2019s Facebook page to complain about Ukrainians, but there have been no reports of physical violence.  \u201cIt\u2019s about 50/50 \u2013 one half help us and supports Ukraine, the other half doesn\u2019t like it, and says that we should go back and stay,\u201d says Bogdan Bak, a 29-year-old Ukrainian in jeans and a leather jacket working with three friends on one of the free computers at Ukrainian World.

Poland is one of the most homogenous societies in the EU. Only 0.2% of the population are foreigners Similarities in culture between Poland and western Ukraine in particular have generally made integration of Ukrainian migrants relatively straightforward. Poland\u2019s economic growth ageing population and emigration levels had meant immigration was likely to have become an issue. But the recent influx of Ukrainians may trigger a debate that Polish politicians have previously avoided. \u201cPoland is one of the most homogenous societies in the EU. Only 0.2% of the population are foreigners,\u201d says Jaroszewicz, of the OSW thinktank. \u201cPublic debate on migration is still focused on the issue of post-accession emigration of Poles to the UK and other EU locations.

The group said it still planned to ride to Berlin, but would find alternative ways to do so.The Night Wolves are controversial due to their support for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and their role in the annexation of Crimea last year and subsequently in east Ukraine. Their leader, Alexander Zaldostanov, is known as \u201cthe Surgeon\u201d and is one of the founders of Anti-Maidan, a Russian group that has promised to crush liberal protesters it believes are determined to create a Ukrainian-style revolution in Russia. The Surgeon is seen as friendly with Putin, and the Russian president has previously ridden with the gang in a photo opportunity aimed at boosting his macho image.A group of around 15 riders made it to the border between the Belarusian town of Brest and the Polish town of Terespol on Monday, with five of them saying they had no visas for Poland but were there to wave off their friends. The 10 were allowed through by Belarusian guards but were turned back by the Poles.\u201cThese people will not cross into Poland. Each of them will receive a separate refusal,\u201d said Dariusz Sienicki, a spokesperson for the Polish border guards. One of the bikers said they had been searched by the Poles \u201cdown to the last sock\u201d before being turned away.The Polish prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, had previously called the rally a \u201cprovocation\u201d possibly aimed at putting Poles \u201cin danger of distress\u201d. Other Poles have spoken out against the bikers and have demanded they be banned from the country. However, some Polish bikers supported the rally, and had planned to escort the Night Wolves through the country. About 100 of them gathered on the Polish side of the border and honked horns in protest against the ban.The Night Wolves have said they will continue with their plans to ride to Berlin even if they are turned away by Poland.\u201cOther people who will not say they are Night Wolves will travel by other routes and accomplish this mission,\u201d Zaldostanov told Russian agency LifeNews.Zaldostanov himself was not travelling with the column, and has remained in Moscow, as his passport is currently at the embassy of a European country awaiting a visa decision, the biker group said. Zaldostanov had said he would catch up with the column as soon as he gets a visa.The original route was due to take them from Belarus through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, to reach Berlin in time for 9 May.Russia has lavish plans for Victory Day this year, with a parade of 16,000 soldiers on Red Square and the newest military vehicles and planes on display. Putin will host a number of world leaders, including the leaders of China, India and Brazil, and Kim Jong-un, the reclusive leader of North Korea.

Related: 50 Conservative MPs ready to lead campaign for EU exit The minister, who reiterates his country\u2019s refusal to accept Cameron\u2019s central demand \u2013 that social benefits should be denied to all EU migrants for at least four years after arriving in the UK \u2013 says Britain would no longer be an important player, in Europe or the world, if it left the EU. He warns that the ability of British people to travel as freely as they do now, and to work and buy homes in other EU countries, would also be lost, and that UK businesses would suddenly face new problems, as the country would no longer be able to influence the rules of the internal market.Trzaskowski, reflecting growing fears in the EU that the UK government is setting itself unrealistic targets for reform which British people are being led to believe are achievable, says all European leaders want Britain to stay in the EU, but not if it means undermining EU principles, such as the free movement of labour. \u201cNo one in Europe says, \u2018We don\u2019t care, take it or leave it.\u2019 No, we say, \u2018Guys, OK, some of your fears are justified, some of your sensibilities should be taken into account, and some of your idiosyncrasies, even though for us they might seem strange. We should talk about it.\u2019 We do not say ship out. But there are certain red lines. We cannot start questioning the cornerstones of integration, because it will have far-reaching consequences.\u201dAsked whether he fears the British people might vote to leave, he says: \u201cIt really depends on how the whole thing is depicted by British political parties to the British people \u2013 what kind of alternative is painted. If you say you can leave and still be part of the internal market, keep your [second] houses, that you will still be free to travel, that there will be no customs duties, and so on \u2013 but that you will not have to accept free movement of workers, and you will not pay into the EU budget, of course people will vote [to leave] \u2026 but this is simply not true.\u201dTrzaskowski adds: \u201cIf Great Britain leaves, it will minimise its role. I am not trying to be patronising. I think we have to be frank with the British people when we talk about their future in the European Union. Many people in Europe want to be accommodating \u2026 but if the demands are too extreme, they are not going to be met.\u201cYou cannot keep all the goodies and forget about the costs. Britain will still have to pay into the EU budget, just as the Swiss and Norwegians do. It would have no influence over the decisions yet it would have to subscribe to all the rules. London would not be that sexy a place for capital movement because it would have much looser links to Europe.\u201dGerman chancellor Angela Merkel suggested last week that her country would do all in its power to try to meet British demands during a wide-ranging renegotiation of its membership ahead of the referendum. But it is understood that Berlin also believes that the key British demand \u2013 to deny migrants who are in work the same social benefits as UK residents \u2013 would amount to a fundamental breach of EU law.Cameron is now urging fellow European leaders to reach an outline deal on the UK\u2019s demands, which also include an opt-out from the EU commitment to \u201cever-closer union\u201d, by the end of this year, in time for the referendum to be held next year.

Poland, a strictly Roman Catholic country, is one of the few places in Europe where women can get a legal abortion only if there is proof of rape or incest, the mother\u2019s life is endangered or the foetus is severely malformed. The group said it had chosen the unusual method of delivery in order to highlight Poland\u2019s restrictive abortion laws. Other European countries such as Portugal, Spain and the UK \u2013 except for Northern Ireland \u2013 offer abortions on request as long as certain conditions are met.Rebecca Gomperts, a doctor and founder of Women on Waves, said: \u201cWe want to create awareness about women\u2019s right to a safe abortion. The drone is another way to use the different laws in different countries in order to draw attention to the social injustice that women who are living in places where abortion is illegal are subject to.\u201cIn Poland, even women who could have an abortion under Polish law are often denied it because Catholic hospitals don\u2019t help them, even if their life is in danger. Rich people can go to Germany or the UK to have abortions, but it\u2019s the women who don\u2019t have the means or access to information who are suffering.\u201dGomperts said the abortion drone did not require authorisation from the Polish or German government as it would not be flying through controlled airspace, was not for commercial purposes and weighed less than 5kg. The pills \u2013 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2013 can be taken up to nine weeks into a pregnancy. Women on Waves provides medical abortion pills around the world, usually by post after women place orders online.It is estimated that at least 50,000 underground abortions take place in Poland each year. Doctors who perform them illegally often use outdated tools and procedures, and charge up to \u20ac4,000 (\u00a32,850). \u201cWoman who have abortions in Poland are not criminalised, it\u2019s the people who provide the abortions who are acting illegally,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cWe want to create awareness among Polish women that there is medicine that is safe to use. So that whenever they look for abortions they will make sure it is safe.\u201dThe exact location of the drone dropoff will be announced on Friday. Pro-life groups have reportedly vowed to shoot it down. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to shoot down a drone and fortunately guns are not that easy to get in Europe,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cBut it\u2019s problematic because it\u2019s a very aggressive strategy that\u2019s intended to make people afraid. And it\u2019s nonsense because it will not stop women from needing an abortion.\u201dIf the mission is successful, Women on Waves hopes to send drones to other countries in Europe that criminalise abortion, such as Ireland and Malta. \u201cWe would definitely be able to extend this programme,\u201d Gompert said.", "tags": ["Abortion", "Poland", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "'Abortion drone' to fly pills across border into Poland"},{"date": "2015-05-28T06:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland is outperforming the UK when it comes to education as well as being the world leader in converting economic growth into the well-being of its citizens, according to a new report.The Sustainable economic development assessment (Seda) by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) measures wellbeing across 149 countries.Under the education dimension of Seda, Poland got a score of 90 (the best country gets 100 and the worst zero). This was higher than the western European average of 82 and Britain\u2019s 74. Poland reformed its schooling system in 2009 to introduce compulsory education between the ages of six and 18 as well as statutory entitlement to a year of pre-school. Poland is ahead of the UK when it comes to teacher-to-pupil ratio and levels of tertiary enrolment. In both of those measures, the UK has been falling behind the average improvement for the rest of the world. Although its overall well-being score at 71.6 was lower than Britain\u2019s 81.1, Poland also slightly outperformed the UK on the health dimension of the Seda score. Poland\u2019s improvement in overall wellbeing between 2006 and 2013 was higher than any other country when adjusted for how much each economy grew during that period. The only area where it stuttered was what the report describes as its \u201cweak\u201d infrastructure, with Poland\u2019s recent performance in this measure lagging behind comparable economies. Polish ministers were angered last year after UK prime minister David Cameron gave a speech judged to be negatively singling out Polish migrants to the UK. Douglas Beal, a partner who leads BCG\u2019s global economic development work in the firm\u2019s Public Sector practice and is a co-author of the report, said: \u201cEmigration from Poland continued until 2006-07 when the net outflow stopped. The timing of this goes hand in hand with the improvements in well-being that we have seen.\u201dAnother co-author, senior BCG economics advisor Enrique Rueda-Sabater, said: \u201cIt is actually a pretty positive story. They [Poland] are not improving well-being by sending everyone to the UK. Domestic job growth and their performance on our employment dimension confirms that.\u201dNorway was judged to be the country where citizens have the best wellbeing in the world followed by Luxembourg and then Switzerland. Singapore was the only non-European country to make it into the top 10. At the bottom of the rankings was the Central African Republic, with Chad, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ranking just above.BCG also gave a score based on how countries had improved well-being between 2006 and 2013 and at the top of that list were Rwanda and Ethiopia. This partially reflects big steps forward in health for countries in sub-Saharan Africa generally. Other than health and education, the dimensions analysed by the report are: income, economic stability, employment, infrastructure, income equality, civil society, governance and environment. Across these dimensions, the analysis draws on nearly 50,000 different data points. Beal explains the rationale behind Seda: \u201cAs the world finally emerges from the global recession, policy makers are focusing on how to sustain and accelerate their country\u2019s growth rates. Leaders must now embark upon a new era and actively pursue well-being\u2014not just GDP\u2014as the primary goal. \u201cThey can and should measure well-being, and hold themselves against it. As one of the new leaders in well-being revealed in this year\u2019s report, Poland shows that you don\u2019t necessarily need high GDP growth to improve the lives of citizens, and that countries that focus on well-being seem to succeed on more fronts.\u201dThe report is being released before the conclusion of discussions in September to finalise what targets for economic and social outcomes by 2030 will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. In his foreword to the report, Nobel prize-winning economist A. Michael Spence said: \u201cTo pursue wellbeing effectively, countries need to achieve economic growth that is both socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The importance of a decisive, broad-based effort in this regard cannot be overemphasised. It is very good and encouraging to see the kind of contribution that this report, developed by strategy experts focused on wellbeing, makes to that effort.\u201d ", "tags": ["World news", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Business", "Economics"], "title": "Poland outperforms UK in education and health, report finds"},{"date": "2015-05-13T05:00:02Z", "country": "poland", "content": "  As sunlight streams through the windows of Warsaw\u2019s Church of the Basilian Fathers, a priest in gold robes swings a clanking censer around the altar. He chants with a low intonation, and a choir in an upper gallery responds, their voices filling the airy church interior, which is dominated by huge oil paintings and numerous small icons of haloed saints.The congregation is mostly made up of ethnic Ukrainians, members of a community that numbers hundreds of thousands and has been growing rapidly since the start of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.Last year Poland issued 331,000 permits for short-term work to Ukrainians, up 50% on 2013, says Marta Jaroszewicz, a migration expert at the Centre For Eastern Studies (OSW), an independent Warsaw thinktank funded by the Polish government.She estimates that there are now 300,000-400,000 Ukrainians in Poland, as many as twice the officially recognised number. In January and February, the number of residence applications by Ukrainians in the Mazovian voivodeship \u2013 the province which includes Warsaw \u2013 was up 180% on the same months of 2014.The migrants have largely been welcomed, with some taking jobs vacated by Poles who have left for western Europe. But the numbers are a new phenomenon in a country more used to emigration than immigration.  Galyna, an elegantly dressed 42-year-old housekeeper from Ternopil in western Ukraine, stops to examine a church notice board. She has been in Warsaw for two years with her teenage daughter and son. \u201cI\u2019m here for my two years and I\u2019m staying for my children,\u201d she says. \u201cThis church is incredible, it\u2019s of enormous importance for us. We can be with other Ukrainians, and even if we didn\u2019t get on at home, here we are united and are brothers and sisters. It\u2019s hard to be here when our friends are at home and things are so hard, but with help from God the sun will rise after the darkness.\u201d \u201cWe are seeing many more people since the war,\u201d adds Katarzyna Sirocka, an ethnic-Ukrainian Polish citizen and head of the Association of Ukrainian Women in Poland. \u201cThose lucky enough to have papers in order work here as cleaners, construction workers and drivers. But many well-educated people who were psychologists and musicians in Ukraine are doing \u2018black work\u2019 [working illegally] here.\u201d Many of the congregation are working-class migrants from western Ukraine fleeing not the war itself, but its devastating economic fallout. But at the nearby Ukrainian World centre established by the Open Dialogue Foundation, a Polish NGO, to support the community, refugees from war-torn eastern Ukraine gather to seek help. \u201cWar is the reason we left,\u201d says Tetiana, 46, who left Luhansk for Warsaw, 1,000 miles away. \u201cWe lost our homes, our everything. The only way to survive was to go somewhere, and we decided to try to move to Poland. We want to stay here to try to live another life. When the situation in Ukraine improves, we will return \u2013 but we don\u2019t actually have a place to return to as our house was destroyed.\u201d Ukrainian World was established in 2014 and receives 100 visitors a day, with increasing numbers arriving from eastern Ukraine.  \u201cThose from the east are in the most difficulty,\u201d says Mateusz Kramek, the office co-ordinator at Ukrainian World. \u201cThey don\u2019t know Polish, don\u2019t know Warsaw, and often ran from their homes with just a few bags.\u201d  The centre provides practical help and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians, supplying donated clothes and food and assisting in applications for Polish visas and refugee status. There is a resident psychologist working in an upstairs room; outside, a girl waits for her appointment on a soggy sofa, while typing on a laptop.About 70% of those coming to the centre are seeking work or places at universities, while 30% want to register as refugees, says Kramek. Some hope to stay in Poland only briefly, before moving on to the west. The centre doubles as a home of political activity for supporting Ukraine, and regular meetings and events are held. There is a small \u201cLibrary of Maidan\u201d with Ukrainian books, and a museum consisting of a few cases of memorabilia from the Maidan \u2013 Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, the focus of the uprising. Photos of Maidan protesters and Ukrainian banners adorn the walls. A Ukrainian flag signed by government soldiers in eastern Ukraine hangs over a postbox for \u201cletters of hope\u201d to the front. In another room, a bizarre papier-mache model of Vladimir Putin as a Russian doll, complete with a Nazi tie, stands in a cage next to a model of one of the \u201clittle green men\u201d \u2013 soldiers involved in the Russian seizure of Crimea. Related: Russia shelled Ukrainians from within its own territory, says study  Poland\u2019s government has been one of the EU\u2019s most vocal supporters of Ukraine and opponents of Russia\u2019s actions. In this, it enjoys widespread support from the Polish electorate, and Poles donate generously to Ukrainian World, says Kramek. However, relations between Ukrainians and Poles have not always been so cordial, and memories of massacres and forced deportations during and after the second world war linger in some parts. Kramek says that there are some \u201chaters\u201d who take to the organisation\u2019s Facebook page to complain about Ukrainians, but there have been no reports of physical violence.  \u201cIt\u2019s about 50/50 \u2013 one half help us and supports Ukraine, the other half doesn\u2019t like it, and says that we should go back and stay,\u201d says Bogdan Bak, a 29-year-old Ukrainian in jeans and a leather jacket working with three friends on one of the free computers at Ukrainian World.

Poland is one of the most homogenous societies in the EU. Only 0.2% of the population are foreigners Similarities in culture between Poland and western Ukraine in particular have generally made integration of Ukrainian migrants relatively straightforward. Poland\u2019s economic growth ageing population and emigration levels had meant immigration was likely to have become an issue. But the recent influx of Ukrainians may trigger a debate that Polish politicians have previously avoided. \u201cPoland is one of the most homogenous societies in the EU. Only 0.2% of the population are foreigners,\u201d says Jaroszewicz, of the OSW thinktank. \u201cPublic debate on migration is still focused on the issue of post-accession emigration of Poles to the UK and other EU locations.

The group said it still planned to ride to Berlin, but would find alternative ways to do so.The Night Wolves are controversial due to their support for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and their role in the annexation of Crimea last year and subsequently in east Ukraine. Their leader, Alexander Zaldostanov, is known as \u201cthe Surgeon\u201d and is one of the founders of Anti-Maidan, a Russian group that has promised to crush liberal protesters it believes are determined to create a Ukrainian-style revolution in Russia. The Surgeon is seen as friendly with Putin, and the Russian president has previously ridden with the gang in a photo opportunity aimed at boosting his macho image.A group of around 15 riders made it to the border between the Belarusian town of Brest and the Polish town of Terespol on Monday, with five of them saying they had no visas for Poland but were there to wave off their friends. The 10 were allowed through by Belarusian guards but were turned back by the Poles.\u201cThese people will not cross into Poland. Each of them will receive a separate refusal,\u201d said Dariusz Sienicki, a spokesperson for the Polish border guards. One of the bikers said they had been searched by the Poles \u201cdown to the last sock\u201d before being turned away.The Polish prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, had previously called the rally a \u201cprovocation\u201d possibly aimed at putting Poles \u201cin danger of distress\u201d. Other Poles have spoken out against the bikers and have demanded they be banned from the country. However, some Polish bikers supported the rally, and had planned to escort the Night Wolves through the country. About 100 of them gathered on the Polish side of the border and honked horns in protest against the ban.The Night Wolves have said they will continue with their plans to ride to Berlin even if they are turned away by Poland.\u201cOther people who will not say they are Night Wolves will travel by other routes and accomplish this mission,\u201d Zaldostanov told Russian agency LifeNews.Zaldostanov himself was not travelling with the column, and has remained in Moscow, as his passport is currently at the embassy of a European country awaiting a visa decision, the biker group said. Zaldostanov had said he would catch up with the column as soon as he gets a visa.The original route was due to take them from Belarus through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, to reach Berlin in time for 9 May.Russia has lavish plans for Victory Day this year, with a parade of 16,000 soldiers on Red Square and the newest military vehicles and planes on display. Putin will host a number of world leaders, including the leaders of China, India and Brazil, and Kim Jong-un, the reclusive leader of North Korea.

Related: 50 Conservative MPs ready to lead campaign for EU exit The minister, who reiterates his country\u2019s refusal to accept Cameron\u2019s central demand \u2013 that social benefits should be denied to all EU migrants for at least four years after arriving in the UK \u2013 says Britain would no longer be an important player, in Europe or the world, if it left the EU. He warns that the ability of British people to travel as freely as they do now, and to work and buy homes in other EU countries, would also be lost, and that UK businesses would suddenly face new problems, as the country would no longer be able to influence the rules of the internal market.Trzaskowski, reflecting growing fears in the EU that the UK government is setting itself unrealistic targets for reform which British people are being led to believe are achievable, says all European leaders want Britain to stay in the EU, but not if it means undermining EU principles, such as the free movement of labour. \u201cNo one in Europe says, \u2018We don\u2019t care, take it or leave it.\u2019 No, we say, \u2018Guys, OK, some of your fears are justified, some of your sensibilities should be taken into account, and some of your idiosyncrasies, even though for us they might seem strange. We should talk about it.\u2019 We do not say ship out. But there are certain red lines. We cannot start questioning the cornerstones of integration, because it will have far-reaching consequences.\u201dAsked whether he fears the British people might vote to leave, he says: \u201cIt really depends on how the whole thing is depicted by British political parties to the British people \u2013 what kind of alternative is painted. If you say you can leave and still be part of the internal market, keep your [second] houses, that you will still be free to travel, that there will be no customs duties, and so on \u2013 but that you will not have to accept free movement of workers, and you will not pay into the EU budget, of course people will vote [to leave] \u2026 but this is simply not true.\u201dTrzaskowski adds: \u201cIf Great Britain leaves, it will minimise its role. I am not trying to be patronising. I think we have to be frank with the British people when we talk about their future in the European Union. Many people in Europe want to be accommodating \u2026 but if the demands are too extreme, they are not going to be met.\u201cYou cannot keep all the goodies and forget about the costs. Britain will still have to pay into the EU budget, just as the Swiss and Norwegians do. It would have no influence over the decisions yet it would have to subscribe to all the rules. London would not be that sexy a place for capital movement because it would have much looser links to Europe.\u201dGerman chancellor Angela Merkel suggested last week that her country would do all in its power to try to meet British demands during a wide-ranging renegotiation of its membership ahead of the referendum. But it is understood that Berlin also believes that the key British demand \u2013 to deny migrants who are in work the same social benefits as UK residents \u2013 would amount to a fundamental breach of EU law.Cameron is now urging fellow European leaders to reach an outline deal on the UK\u2019s demands, which also include an opt-out from the EU commitment to \u201cever-closer union\u201d, by the end of this year, in time for the referendum to be held next year.

Former cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and John Redwood are among backers of the newly formed Conservatives for Britain (CfB) that will initially support the prime minister\u2019s bid to renegotiate terms of membership for the UK, according to the Sunday Telegraph.Poland, whose economy has strengthened since it joined the EU in 2004, now sees itself as a central player in the union and is determined to defend the rights of the 700,000 Polish citizens in the UK, the vast majority of whom are in work.Trzaskowski says that just because Cameron feels strengthened by his general election victory, Poland will not roll over. \u201cWe cannot say simply that we sit around the table and you say, \u2018This is my manifesto and I won the elections on the basis of it, so cave in and accept it.\u2019\u201dUkip leader Nigel Farage said that his party must waste no time before beginning a \u201cground war\u201d to leave the European Union.

In his speech, which was titled Why I require FBI agents to visit the Holocaust Museum, Comey discussed \u201cways to fight evil to ensure it doesn\u2019t hold the field\u201d.In the passage which became contentious, he said: \u201cIn their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn\u2019t do something evil.\u201dIn response, the Polish prime minister Ewa Kopacz, said: \u201cTo those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way, I want to say that Poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of world war two.\u201dOn Wednesday, in a letter to the Polish ambassador, Comey said: \u201cI regret linking Germany and Poland in my speech because Poland was invaded and occupied by Germany. The Polish state bears no responsibility for the horrors imposed by the Nazis. I wish I had not used any other country names because my point was a universal one about human nature.\u201d The Polish foreign minister, Grzegorz Schetyna, said Comey\u2019s letter was \u201cbetter late than never\u201d and added that the matter was closed.Prime Minister Kopacz, however, said: \u201cTo be sure, every Pole had expected more.\u201dThe FBI director is not the highest-placed US official to have experienced such embarrassment.

Poland, a strictly Roman Catholic country, is one of the few places in Europe where women can get a legal abortion only if there is proof of rape or incest, the mother\u2019s life is endangered or the foetus is severely malformed. The group said it had chosen the unusual method of delivery in order to highlight Poland\u2019s restrictive abortion laws. Other European countries such as Portugal, Spain and the UK \u2013 except for Northern Ireland \u2013 offer abortions on request as long as certain conditions are met.Rebecca Gomperts, a doctor and founder of Women on Waves, said: \u201cWe want to create awareness about women\u2019s right to a safe abortion. The drone is another way to use the different laws in different countries in order to draw attention to the social injustice that women who are living in places where abortion is illegal are subject to.\u201cIn Poland, even women who could have an abortion under Polish law are often denied it because Catholic hospitals don\u2019t help them, even if their life is in danger. Rich people can go to Germany or the UK to have abortions, but it\u2019s the women who don\u2019t have the means or access to information who are suffering.\u201dGomperts said the abortion drone did not require authorisation from the Polish or German government as it would not be flying through controlled airspace, was not for commercial purposes and weighed less than 5kg. The pills \u2013 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2013 can be taken up to nine weeks into a pregnancy. Women on Waves provides medical abortion pills around the world, usually by post after women place orders online.It is estimated that at least 50,000 underground abortions take place in Poland each year. Doctors who perform them illegally often use outdated tools and procedures, and charge up to \u20ac4,000 (\u00a32,850). \u201cWoman who have abortions in Poland are not criminalised, it\u2019s the people who provide the abortions who are acting illegally,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cWe want to create awareness among Polish women that there is medicine that is safe to use. So that whenever they look for abortions they will make sure it is safe.\u201dThe exact location of the drone dropoff will be announced on Friday. Pro-life groups have reportedly vowed to shoot it down. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to shoot down a drone and fortunately guns are not that easy to get in Europe,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cBut it\u2019s problematic because it\u2019s a very aggressive strategy that\u2019s intended to make people afraid. And it\u2019s nonsense because it will not stop women from needing an abortion.\u201dIf the mission is successful, Women on Waves hopes to send drones to other countries in Europe that criminalise abortion, such as Ireland and Malta. \u201cWe would definitely be able to extend this programme,\u201d Gompert said.", "tags": ["Abortion", "Poland", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "'Abortion drone' to fly pills across border into Poland"},{"date": "2015-05-28T06:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland is outperforming the UK when it comes to education as well as being the world leader in converting economic growth into the well-being of its citizens, according to a new report.The Sustainable economic development assessment (Seda) by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) measures wellbeing across 149 countries.Under the education dimension of Seda, Poland got a score of 90 (the best country gets 100 and the worst zero). This was higher than the western European average of 82 and Britain\u2019s 74. Poland reformed its schooling system in 2009 to introduce compulsory education between the ages of six and 18 as well as statutory entitlement to a year of pre-school. Poland is ahead of the UK when it comes to teacher-to-pupil ratio and levels of tertiary enrolment. In both of those measures, the UK has been falling behind the average improvement for the rest of the world. Although its overall well-being score at 71.6 was lower than Britain\u2019s 81.1, Poland also slightly outperformed the UK on the health dimension of the Seda score. Poland\u2019s improvement in overall wellbeing between 2006 and 2013 was higher than any other country when adjusted for how much each economy grew during that period. The only area where it stuttered was what the report describes as its \u201cweak\u201d infrastructure, with Poland\u2019s recent performance in this measure lagging behind comparable economies. Polish ministers were angered last year after UK prime minister David Cameron gave a speech judged to be negatively singling out Polish migrants to the UK. Douglas Beal, a partner who leads BCG\u2019s global economic development work in the firm\u2019s Public Sector practice and is a co-author of the report, said: \u201cEmigration from Poland continued until 2006-07 when the net outflow stopped. The timing of this goes hand in hand with the improvements in well-being that we have seen.\u201dAnother co-author, senior BCG economics advisor Enrique Rueda-Sabater, said: \u201cIt is actually a pretty positive story. They [Poland] are not improving well-being by sending everyone to the UK. Domestic job growth and their performance on our employment dimension confirms that.\u201dNorway was judged to be the country where citizens have the best wellbeing in the world followed by Luxembourg and then Switzerland. Singapore was the only non-European country to make it into the top 10. At the bottom of the rankings was the Central African Republic, with Chad, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ranking just above.BCG also gave a score based on how countries had improved well-being between 2006 and 2013 and at the top of that list were Rwanda and Ethiopia. This partially reflects big steps forward in health for countries in sub-Saharan Africa generally. Other than health and education, the dimensions analysed by the report are: income, economic stability, employment, infrastructure, income equality, civil society, governance and environment. Across these dimensions, the analysis draws on nearly 50,000 different data points. Beal explains the rationale behind Seda: \u201cAs the world finally emerges from the global recession, policy makers are focusing on how to sustain and accelerate their country\u2019s growth rates. Leaders must now embark upon a new era and actively pursue well-being\u2014not just GDP\u2014as the primary goal. \u201cThey can and should measure well-being, and hold themselves against it. As one of the new leaders in well-being revealed in this year\u2019s report, Poland shows that you don\u2019t necessarily need high GDP growth to improve the lives of citizens, and that countries that focus on well-being seem to succeed on more fronts.\u201dThe report is being released before the conclusion of discussions in September to finalise what targets for economic and social outcomes by 2030 will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. In his foreword to the report, Nobel prize-winning economist A. Michael Spence said: \u201cTo pursue wellbeing effectively, countries need to achieve economic growth that is both socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The importance of a decisive, broad-based effort in this regard cannot be overemphasised. It is very good and encouraging to see the kind of contribution that this report, developed by strategy experts focused on wellbeing, makes to that effort.\u201d ", "tags": ["World news", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Business", "Economics"], "title": "Poland outperforms UK in education and health, report finds"},{"date": "2015-05-13T05:00:02Z", "country": "poland", "content": "  As sunlight streams through the windows of Warsaw\u2019s Church of the Basilian Fathers, a priest in gold robes swings a clanking censer around the altar. He chants with a low intonation, and a choir in an upper gallery responds, their voices filling the airy church interior, which is dominated by huge oil paintings and numerous small icons of haloed saints.The congregation is mostly made up of ethnic Ukrainians, members of a community that numbers hundreds of thousands and has been growing rapidly since the start of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.Last year Poland issued 331,000 permits for short-term work to Ukrainians, up 50% on 2013, says Marta Jaroszewicz, a migration expert at the Centre For Eastern Studies (OSW), an independent Warsaw thinktank funded by the Polish government.She estimates that there are now 300,000-400,000 Ukrainians in Poland, as many as twice the officially recognised number. In January and February, the number of residence applications by Ukrainians in the Mazovian voivodeship \u2013 the province which includes Warsaw \u2013 was up 180% on the same months of 2014.The migrants have largely been welcomed, with some taking jobs vacated by Poles who have left for western Europe. But the numbers are a new phenomenon in a country more used to emigration than immigration.  Galyna, an elegantly dressed 42-year-old housekeeper from Ternopil in western Ukraine, stops to examine a church notice board. She has been in Warsaw for two years with her teenage daughter and son. \u201cI\u2019m here for my two years and I\u2019m staying for my children,\u201d she says. \u201cThis church is incredible, it\u2019s of enormous importance for us. We can be with other Ukrainians, and even if we didn\u2019t get on at home, here we are united and are brothers and sisters. It\u2019s hard to be here when our friends are at home and things are so hard, but with help from God the sun will rise after the darkness.\u201d \u201cWe are seeing many more people since the war,\u201d adds Katarzyna Sirocka, an ethnic-Ukrainian Polish citizen and head of the Association of Ukrainian Women in Poland. \u201cThose lucky enough to have papers in order work here as cleaners, construction workers and drivers. But many well-educated people who were psychologists and musicians in Ukraine are doing \u2018black work\u2019 [working illegally] here.\u201d Many of the congregation are working-class migrants from western Ukraine fleeing not the war itself, but its devastating economic fallout. But at the nearby Ukrainian World centre established by the Open Dialogue Foundation, a Polish NGO, to support the community, refugees from war-torn eastern Ukraine gather to seek help. \u201cWar is the reason we left,\u201d says Tetiana, 46, who left Luhansk for Warsaw, 1,000 miles away. \u201cWe lost our homes, our everything. The only way to survive was to go somewhere, and we decided to try to move to Poland. We want to stay here to try to live another life. When the situation in Ukraine improves, we will return \u2013 but we don\u2019t actually have a place to return to as our house was destroyed.\u201d Ukrainian World was established in 2014 and receives 100 visitors a day, with increasing numbers arriving from eastern Ukraine.  \u201cThose from the east are in the most difficulty,\u201d says Mateusz Kramek, the office co-ordinator at Ukrainian World. \u201cThey don\u2019t know Polish, don\u2019t know Warsaw, and often ran from their homes with just a few bags.\u201d  The centre provides practical help and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians, supplying donated clothes and food and assisting in applications for Polish visas and refugee status. There is a resident psychologist working in an upstairs room; outside, a girl waits for her appointment on a soggy sofa, while typing on a laptop.About 70% of those coming to the centre are seeking work or places at universities, while 30% want to register as refugees, says Kramek. Some hope to stay in Poland only briefly, before moving on to the west. The centre doubles as a home of political activity for supporting Ukraine, and regular meetings and events are held. There is a small \u201cLibrary of Maidan\u201d with Ukrainian books, and a museum consisting of a few cases of memorabilia from the Maidan \u2013 Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, the focus of the uprising. Photos of Maidan protesters and Ukrainian banners adorn the walls. A Ukrainian flag signed by government soldiers in eastern Ukraine hangs over a postbox for \u201cletters of hope\u201d to the front. In another room, a bizarre papier-mache model of Vladimir Putin as a Russian doll, complete with a Nazi tie, stands in a cage next to a model of one of the \u201clittle green men\u201d \u2013 soldiers involved in the Russian seizure of Crimea.

In this, it enjoys widespread support from the Polish electorate, and Poles donate generously to Ukrainian World, says Kramek. However, relations between Ukrainians and Poles have not always been so cordial, and memories of massacres and forced deportations during and after the second world war linger in some parts. Kramek says that there are some \u201chaters\u201d who take to the organisation\u2019s Facebook page to complain about Ukrainians, but there have been no reports of physical violence.  \u201cIt\u2019s about 50/50 \u2013 one half help us and supports Ukraine, the other half doesn\u2019t like it, and says that we should go back and stay,\u201d says Bogdan Bak, a 29-year-old Ukrainian in jeans and a leather jacket working with three friends on one of the free computers at Ukrainian World.

Poland is one of the most homogenous societies in the EU. Only 0.2% of the population are foreigners Similarities in culture between Poland and western Ukraine in particular have generally made integration of Ukrainian migrants relatively straightforward. Poland\u2019s economic growth ageing population and emigration levels had meant immigration was likely to have become an issue. But the recent influx of Ukrainians may trigger a debate that Polish politicians have previously avoided. \u201cPoland is one of the most homogenous societies in the EU. Only 0.2% of the population are foreigners,\u201d says Jaroszewicz, of the OSW thinktank. \u201cPublic debate on migration is still focused on the issue of post-accession emigration of Poles to the UK and other EU locations.

The group said it still planned to ride to Berlin, but would find alternative ways to do so.The Night Wolves are controversial due to their support for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and their role in the annexation of Crimea last year and subsequently in east Ukraine. Their leader, Alexander Zaldostanov, is known as \u201cthe Surgeon\u201d and is one of the founders of Anti-Maidan, a Russian group that has promised to crush liberal protesters it believes are determined to create a Ukrainian-style revolution in Russia. The Surgeon is seen as friendly with Putin, and the Russian president has previously ridden with the gang in a photo opportunity aimed at boosting his macho image.A group of around 15 riders made it to the border between the Belarusian town of Brest and the Polish town of Terespol on Monday, with five of them saying they had no visas for Poland but were there to wave off their friends. The 10 were allowed through by Belarusian guards but were turned back by the Poles.\u201cThese people will not cross into Poland. Each of them will receive a separate refusal,\u201d said Dariusz Sienicki, a spokesperson for the Polish border guards. One of the bikers said they had been searched by the Poles \u201cdown to the last sock\u201d before being turned away.The Polish prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, had previously called the rally a \u201cprovocation\u201d possibly aimed at putting Poles \u201cin danger of distress\u201d. Other Poles have spoken out against the bikers and have demanded they be banned from the country. However, some Polish bikers supported the rally, and had planned to escort the Night Wolves through the country. About 100 of them gathered on the Polish side of the border and honked horns in protest against the ban.The Night Wolves have said they will continue with their plans to ride to Berlin even if they are turned away by Poland.\u201cOther people who will not say they are Night Wolves will travel by other routes and accomplish this mission,\u201d Zaldostanov told Russian agency LifeNews.Zaldostanov himself was not travelling with the column, and has remained in Moscow, as his passport is currently at the embassy of a European country awaiting a visa decision, the biker group said. Zaldostanov had said he would catch up with the column as soon as he gets a visa.The original route was due to take them from Belarus through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, to reach Berlin in time for 9 May.Russia has lavish plans for Victory Day this year, with a parade of 16,000 soldiers on Red Square and the newest military vehicles and planes on display. Putin will host a number of world leaders, including the leaders of China, India and Brazil, and Kim Jong-un, the reclusive leader of North Korea.

Related: 50 Conservative MPs ready to lead campaign for EU exit The minister, who reiterates his country\u2019s refusal to accept Cameron\u2019s central demand \u2013 that social benefits should be denied to all EU migrants for at least four years after arriving in the UK \u2013 says Britain would no longer be an important player, in Europe or the world, if it left the EU. He warns that the ability of British people to travel as freely as they do now, and to work and buy homes in other EU countries, would also be lost, and that UK businesses would suddenly face new problems, as the country would no longer be able to influence the rules of the internal market.Trzaskowski, reflecting growing fears in the EU that the UK government is setting itself unrealistic targets for reform which British people are being led to believe are achievable, says all European leaders want Britain to stay in the EU, but not if it means undermining EU principles, such as the free movement of labour. \u201cNo one in Europe says, \u2018We don\u2019t care, take it or leave it.\u2019 No, we say, \u2018Guys, OK, some of your fears are justified, some of your sensibilities should be taken into account, and some of your idiosyncrasies, even though for us they might seem strange. We should talk about it.\u2019 We do not say ship out. But there are certain red lines. We cannot start questioning the cornerstones of integration, because it will have far-reaching consequences.\u201dAsked whether he fears the British people might vote to leave, he says: \u201cIt really depends on how the whole thing is depicted by British political parties to the British people \u2013 what kind of alternative is painted. If you say you can leave and still be part of the internal market, keep your [second] houses, that you will still be free to travel, that there will be no customs duties, and so on \u2013 but that you will not have to accept free movement of workers, and you will not pay into the EU budget, of course people will vote [to leave] \u2026 but this is simply not true.\u201dTrzaskowski adds: \u201cIf Great Britain leaves, it will minimise its role. I am not trying to be patronising. I think we have to be frank with the British people when we talk about their future in the European Union. Many people in Europe want to be accommodating \u2026 but if the demands are too extreme, they are not going to be met.\u201cYou cannot keep all the goodies and forget about the costs. Britain will still have to pay into the EU budget, just as the Swiss and Norwegians do. It would have no influence over the decisions yet it would have to subscribe to all the rules. London would not be that sexy a place for capital movement because it would have much looser links to Europe.\u201dGerman chancellor Angela Merkel suggested last week that her country would do all in its power to try to meet British demands during a wide-ranging renegotiation of its membership ahead of the referendum. But it is understood that Berlin also believes that the key British demand \u2013 to deny migrants who are in work the same social benefits as UK residents \u2013 would amount to a fundamental breach of EU law.Cameron is now urging fellow European leaders to reach an outline deal on the UK\u2019s demands, which also include an opt-out from the EU commitment to \u201cever-closer union\u201d, by the end of this year, in time for the referendum to be held next year.

Former cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and John Redwood are among backers of the newly formed Conservatives for Britain (CfB) that will initially support the prime minister\u2019s bid to renegotiate terms of membership for the UK, according to the Sunday Telegraph.Poland, whose economy has strengthened since it joined the EU in 2004, now sees itself as a central player in the union and is determined to defend the rights of the 700,000 Polish citizens in the UK, the vast majority of whom are in work.Trzaskowski says that just because Cameron feels strengthened by his general election victory, Poland will not roll over. \u201cWe cannot say simply that we sit around the table and you say, \u2018This is my manifesto and I won the elections on the basis of it, so cave in and accept it.\u2019\u201dUkip leader Nigel Farage said that his party must waste no time before beginning a \u201cground war\u201d to leave the European Union.

The adaptable SNJO can operate as a powerful contemporary band, or in repertory guise; they recently performed a Sinatra programme with US vocalist Kurt Elling, and they\u2019ve remade music as different as the jazz-fusion of the Yellowjackets and Duke Ellington tunes.

Still one of the best known living composers, in Britain at least, his pieces have been heard less and less often. This week, as part of a festival celebrating the music of Poland, he is at the Royal Northern College Of Music, conducting the UK premiere of his Symphony No 7, Seven Gates Of Jerusalem (Fri).

The game has sold in the millions and comes in many versions, including junior, kids Disney and Bible editions.The card, which came to the attention of the Polish government, is entitled Schindler\u2019s List and contains the text: \u201c1993 Steven Spielberg film. Powerful, real-life story of a Catholic businessman who eventually saved over 1,000 Jews in Nazi Poland.\u201dA statement from the Polish embassy said the wording was \u201ccompletely inconsistent with the historical truth and detrimental to the good name of our country\u201d.Mattel did not immediately comment. It was not clear which edition of the game contained the card in question.Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany during the second world war. Millions of Polish citizens were killed. Death camps, including Auschwitz, Belzec, Treblinka and Sobibor, were operated by the Nazis on Polish soil. Among Poles, correct terminology and attribution when discussing such issues remains a key concern.The Polish embassy website, for example, offers readers a \u201chow-to guide: against Polish death/concentration camps\u201d. The text notes \u201can increase in the occurrence of factually incorrect slurs as \u2018Polish death camps\u2019 in news articles\u201d and encourages readers to comment on and protest over such usages. \u201cWe react whenever we see such slurs,\u201d it reads. \u201cWe need you to do the same.\u201dComey\u2019s remarks were contained in a speech he gave at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington last week, which was subsequently published as an op-ed piece for the Washington Post. In his speech, which was titled Why I require FBI agents to visit the Holocaust Museum, Comey discussed \u201cways to fight evil to ensure it doesn\u2019t hold the field\u201d.In the passage which became contentious, he said: \u201cIn their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland, and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn\u2019t do something evil.\u201dIn response, the Polish prime minister Ewa Kopacz, said: \u201cTo those who are incapable of presenting the historic truth in an honest way, I want to say that Poland was not a perpetrator but a victim of world war two.\u201dOn Wednesday, in a letter to the Polish ambassador, Comey said: \u201cI regret linking Germany and Poland in my speech because Poland was invaded and occupied by Germany. The Polish state bears no responsibility for the horrors imposed by the Nazis. I wish I had not used any other country names because my point was a universal one about human nature.\u201d The Polish foreign minister, Grzegorz Schetyna, said Comey\u2019s letter was \u201cbetter late than never\u201d and added that the matter was closed.Prime Minister Kopacz, however, said: \u201cTo be sure, every Pole had expected more.\u201dThe FBI director is not the highest-placed US official to have experienced such embarrassment.

Poland, a strictly Roman Catholic country, is one of the few places in Europe where women can get a legal abortion only if there is proof of rape or incest, the mother\u2019s life is endangered or the foetus is severely malformed. The group said it had chosen the unusual method of delivery in order to highlight Poland\u2019s restrictive abortion laws. Other European countries such as Portugal, Spain and the UK \u2013 except for Northern Ireland \u2013 offer abortions on request as long as certain conditions are met.Rebecca Gomperts, a doctor and founder of Women on Waves, said: \u201cWe want to create awareness about women\u2019s right to a safe abortion. The drone is another way to use the different laws in different countries in order to draw attention to the social injustice that women who are living in places where abortion is illegal are subject to.\u201cIn Poland, even women who could have an abortion under Polish law are often denied it because Catholic hospitals don\u2019t help them, even if their life is in danger. Rich people can go to Germany or the UK to have abortions, but it\u2019s the women who don\u2019t have the means or access to information who are suffering.\u201dGomperts said the abortion drone did not require authorisation from the Polish or German government as it would not be flying through controlled airspace, was not for commercial purposes and weighed less than 5kg. The pills \u2013 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2013 can be taken up to nine weeks into a pregnancy. Women on Waves provides medical abortion pills around the world, usually by post after women place orders online.It is estimated that at least 50,000 underground abortions take place in Poland each year. Doctors who perform them illegally often use outdated tools and procedures, and charge up to \u20ac4,000 (\u00a32,850). \u201cWoman who have abortions in Poland are not criminalised, it\u2019s the people who provide the abortions who are acting illegally,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cWe want to create awareness among Polish women that there is medicine that is safe to use. So that whenever they look for abortions they will make sure it is safe.\u201dThe exact location of the drone dropoff will be announced on Friday. Pro-life groups have reportedly vowed to shoot it down. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to shoot down a drone and fortunately guns are not that easy to get in Europe,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cBut it\u2019s problematic because it\u2019s a very aggressive strategy that\u2019s intended to make people afraid. And it\u2019s nonsense because it will not stop women from needing an abortion.\u201dIf the mission is successful, Women on Waves hopes to send drones to other countries in Europe that criminalise abortion, such as Ireland and Malta. \u201cWe would definitely be able to extend this programme,\u201d Gompert said.", "tags": ["Abortion", "Poland", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "'Abortion drone' to fly pills across border into Poland"},{"date": "2015-05-28T06:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland is outperforming the UK when it comes to education as well as being the world leader in converting economic growth into the well-being of its citizens, according to a new report.The Sustainable economic development assessment (Seda) by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) measures wellbeing across 149 countries.Under the education dimension of Seda, Poland got a score of 90 (the best country gets 100 and the worst zero). This was higher than the western European average of 82 and Britain\u2019s 74. Poland reformed its schooling system in 2009 to introduce compulsory education between the ages of six and 18 as well as statutory entitlement to a year of pre-school. Poland is ahead of the UK when it comes to teacher-to-pupil ratio and levels of tertiary enrolment. In both of those measures, the UK has been falling behind the average improvement for the rest of the world. Although its overall well-being score at 71.6 was lower than Britain\u2019s 81.1, Poland also slightly outperformed the UK on the health dimension of the Seda score. Poland\u2019s improvement in overall wellbeing between 2006 and 2013 was higher than any other country when adjusted for how much each economy grew during that period. The only area where it stuttered was what the report describes as its \u201cweak\u201d infrastructure, with Poland\u2019s recent performance in this measure lagging behind comparable economies. Polish ministers were angered last year after UK prime minister David Cameron gave a speech judged to be negatively singling out Polish migrants to the UK. Douglas Beal, a partner who leads BCG\u2019s global economic development work in the firm\u2019s Public Sector practice and is a co-author of the report, said: \u201cEmigration from Poland continued until 2006-07 when the net outflow stopped. The timing of this goes hand in hand with the improvements in well-being that we have seen.\u201dAnother co-author, senior BCG economics advisor Enrique Rueda-Sabater, said: \u201cIt is actually a pretty positive story. They [Poland] are not improving well-being by sending everyone to the UK. Domestic job growth and their performance on our employment dimension confirms that.\u201dNorway was judged to be the country where citizens have the best wellbeing in the world followed by Luxembourg and then Switzerland. Singapore was the only non-European country to make it into the top 10. At the bottom of the rankings was the Central African Republic, with Chad, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ranking just above.BCG also gave a score based on how countries had improved well-being between 2006 and 2013 and at the top of that list were Rwanda and Ethiopia. This partially reflects big steps forward in health for countries in sub-Saharan Africa generally. Other than health and education, the dimensions analysed by the report are: income, economic stability, employment, infrastructure, income equality, civil society, governance and environment. Across these dimensions, the analysis draws on nearly 50,000 different data points. Beal explains the rationale behind Seda: \u201cAs the world finally emerges from the global recession, policy makers are focusing on how to sustain and accelerate their country\u2019s growth rates. Leaders must now embark upon a new era and actively pursue well-being\u2014not just GDP\u2014as the primary goal. \u201cThey can and should measure well-being, and hold themselves against it. As one of the new leaders in well-being revealed in this year\u2019s report, Poland shows that you don\u2019t necessarily need high GDP growth to improve the lives of citizens, and that countries that focus on well-being seem to succeed on more fronts.\u201dThe report is being released before the conclusion of discussions in September to finalise what targets for economic and social outcomes by 2030 will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. In his foreword to the report, Nobel prize-winning economist A. Michael Spence said: \u201cTo pursue wellbeing effectively, countries need to achieve economic growth that is both socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The importance of a decisive, broad-based effort in this regard cannot be overemphasised. It is very good and encouraging to see the kind of contribution that this report, developed by strategy experts focused on wellbeing, makes to that effort.\u201d ", "tags": ["World news", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Business", "Economics"], "title": "Poland outperforms UK in education and health, report finds"},{"date": "2015-05-13T05:00:02Z", "country": "poland", "content": "  As sunlight streams through the windows of Warsaw\u2019s Church of the Basilian Fathers, a priest in gold robes swings a clanking censer around the altar. He chants with a low intonation, and a choir in an upper gallery responds, their voices filling the airy church interior, which is dominated by huge oil paintings and numerous small icons of haloed saints.The congregation is mostly made up of ethnic Ukrainians, members of a community that numbers hundreds of thousands and has been growing rapidly since the start of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.Last year Poland issued 331,000 permits for short-term work to Ukrainians, up 50% on 2013, says Marta Jaroszewicz, a migration expert at the Centre For Eastern Studies (OSW), an independent Warsaw thinktank funded by the Polish government.She estimates that there are now 300,000-400,000 Ukrainians in Poland, as many as twice the officially recognised number. In January and February, the number of residence applications by Ukrainians in the Mazovian voivodeship \u2013 the province which includes Warsaw \u2013 was up 180% on the same months of 2014.The migrants have largely been welcomed, with some taking jobs vacated by Poles who have left for western Europe. But the numbers are a new phenomenon in a country more used to emigration than immigration.  Galyna, an elegantly dressed 42-year-old housekeeper from Ternopil in western Ukraine, stops to examine a church notice board. She has been in Warsaw for two years with her teenage daughter and son. \u201cI\u2019m here for my two years and I\u2019m staying for my children,\u201d she says. \u201cThis church is incredible, it\u2019s of enormous importance for us. We can be with other Ukrainians, and even if we didn\u2019t get on at home, here we are united and are brothers and sisters. It\u2019s hard to be here when our friends are at home and things are so hard, but with help from God the sun will rise after the darkness.\u201d \u201cWe are seeing many more people since the war,\u201d adds Katarzyna Sirocka, an ethnic-Ukrainian Polish citizen and head of the Association of Ukrainian Women in Poland. \u201cThose lucky enough to have papers in order work here as cleaners, construction workers and drivers. But many well-educated people who were psychologists and musicians in Ukraine are doing \u2018black work\u2019 [working illegally] here.\u201d Many of the congregation are working-class migrants from western Ukraine fleeing not the war itself, but its devastating economic fallout. But at the nearby Ukrainian World centre established by the Open Dialogue Foundation, a Polish NGO, to support the community, refugees from war-torn eastern Ukraine gather to seek help. \u201cWar is the reason we left,\u201d says Tetiana, 46, who left Luhansk for Warsaw, 1,000 miles away. \u201cWe lost our homes, our everything. The only way to survive was to go somewhere, and we decided to try to move to Poland. We want to stay here to try to live another life. When the situation in Ukraine improves, we will return \u2013 but we don\u2019t actually have a place to return to as our house was destroyed.\u201d Ukrainian World was established in 2014 and receives 100 visitors a day, with increasing numbers arriving from eastern Ukraine.  \u201cThose from the east are in the most difficulty,\u201d says Mateusz Kramek, the office co-ordinator at Ukrainian World. \u201cThey don\u2019t know Polish, don\u2019t know Warsaw, and often ran from their homes with just a few bags.\u201d  The centre provides practical help and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians, supplying donated clothes and food and assisting in applications for Polish visas and refugee status. There is a resident psychologist working in an upstairs room; outside, a girl waits for her appointment on a soggy sofa, while typing on a laptop.About 70% of those coming to the centre are seeking work or places at universities, while 30% want to register as refugees, says Kramek. Some hope to stay in Poland only briefly, before moving on to the west. The centre doubles as a home of political activity for supporting Ukraine, and regular meetings and events are held. There is a small \u201cLibrary of Maidan\u201d with Ukrainian books, and a museum consisting of a few cases of memorabilia from the Maidan \u2013 Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, the focus of the uprising. Photos of Maidan protesters and Ukrainian banners adorn the walls. A Ukrainian flag signed by government soldiers in eastern Ukraine hangs over a postbox for \u201cletters of hope\u201d to the front. In another room, a bizarre papier-mache model of Vladimir Putin as a Russian doll, complete with a Nazi tie, stands in a cage next to a model of one of the \u201clittle green men\u201d \u2013 soldiers involved in the Russian seizure of Crimea.

In this, it enjoys widespread support from the Polish electorate, and Poles donate generously to Ukrainian World, says Kramek. However, relations between Ukrainians and Poles have not always been so cordial, and memories of massacres and forced deportations during and after the second world war linger in some parts. Kramek says that there are some \u201chaters\u201d who take to the organisation\u2019s Facebook page to complain about Ukrainians, but there have been no reports of physical violence.  \u201cIt\u2019s about 50/50 \u2013 one half help us and supports Ukraine, the other half doesn\u2019t like it, and says that we should go back and stay,\u201d says Bogdan Bak, a 29-year-old Ukrainian in jeans and a leather jacket working with three friends on one of the free computers at Ukrainian World.

Poland is one of the most homogenous societies in the EU. Only 0.2% of the population are foreigners Similarities in culture between Poland and western Ukraine in particular have generally made integration of Ukrainian migrants relatively straightforward. Poland\u2019s economic growth ageing population and emigration levels had meant immigration was likely to have become an issue. But the recent influx of Ukrainians may trigger a debate that Polish politicians have previously avoided. \u201cPoland is one of the most homogenous societies in the EU. Only 0.2% of the population are foreigners,\u201d says Jaroszewicz, of the OSW thinktank. \u201cPublic debate on migration is still focused on the issue of post-accession emigration of Poles to the UK and other EU locations.

The group said it still planned to ride to Berlin, but would find alternative ways to do so.The Night Wolves are controversial due to their support for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and their role in the annexation of Crimea last year and subsequently in east Ukraine. Their leader, Alexander Zaldostanov, is known as \u201cthe Surgeon\u201d and is one of the founders of Anti-Maidan, a Russian group that has promised to crush liberal protesters it believes are determined to create a Ukrainian-style revolution in Russia. The Surgeon is seen as friendly with Putin, and the Russian president has previously ridden with the gang in a photo opportunity aimed at boosting his macho image.A group of around 15 riders made it to the border between the Belarusian town of Brest and the Polish town of Terespol on Monday, with five of them saying they had no visas for Poland but were there to wave off their friends. The 10 were allowed through by Belarusian guards but were turned back by the Poles.\u201cThese people will not cross into Poland. Each of them will receive a separate refusal,\u201d said Dariusz Sienicki, a spokesperson for the Polish border guards. One of the bikers said they had been searched by the Poles \u201cdown to the last sock\u201d before being turned away.The Polish prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, had previously called the rally a \u201cprovocation\u201d possibly aimed at putting Poles \u201cin danger of distress\u201d. Other Poles have spoken out against the bikers and have demanded they be banned from the country. However, some Polish bikers supported the rally, and had planned to escort the Night Wolves through the country. About 100 of them gathered on the Polish side of the border and honked horns in protest against the ban.The Night Wolves have said they will continue with their plans to ride to Berlin even if they are turned away by Poland.\u201cOther people who will not say they are Night Wolves will travel by other routes and accomplish this mission,\u201d Zaldostanov told Russian agency LifeNews.Zaldostanov himself was not travelling with the column, and has remained in Moscow, as his passport is currently at the embassy of a European country awaiting a visa decision, the biker group said. Zaldostanov had said he would catch up with the column as soon as he gets a visa.The original route was due to take them from Belarus through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, to reach Berlin in time for 9 May.Russia has lavish plans for Victory Day this year, with a parade of 16,000 soldiers on Red Square and the newest military vehicles and planes on display. Putin will host a number of world leaders, including the leaders of China, India and Brazil, and Kim Jong-un, the reclusive leader of North Korea.

Related: 50 Conservative MPs ready to lead campaign for EU exit The minister, who reiterates his country\u2019s refusal to accept Cameron\u2019s central demand \u2013 that social benefits should be denied to all EU migrants for at least four years after arriving in the UK \u2013 says Britain would no longer be an important player, in Europe or the world, if it left the EU. He warns that the ability of British people to travel as freely as they do now, and to work and buy homes in other EU countries, would also be lost, and that UK businesses would suddenly face new problems, as the country would no longer be able to influence the rules of the internal market.Trzaskowski, reflecting growing fears in the EU that the UK government is setting itself unrealistic targets for reform which British people are being led to believe are achievable, says all European leaders want Britain to stay in the EU, but not if it means undermining EU principles, such as the free movement of labour. \u201cNo one in Europe says, \u2018We don\u2019t care, take it or leave it.\u2019 No, we say, \u2018Guys, OK, some of your fears are justified, some of your sensibilities should be taken into account, and some of your idiosyncrasies, even though for us they might seem strange. We should talk about it.\u2019 We do not say ship out. But there are certain red lines. We cannot start questioning the cornerstones of integration, because it will have far-reaching consequences.\u201dAsked whether he fears the British people might vote to leave, he says: \u201cIt really depends on how the whole thing is depicted by British political parties to the British people \u2013 what kind of alternative is painted. If you say you can leave and still be part of the internal market, keep your [second] houses, that you will still be free to travel, that there will be no customs duties, and so on \u2013 but that you will not have to accept free movement of workers, and you will not pay into the EU budget, of course people will vote [to leave] \u2026 but this is simply not true.\u201dTrzaskowski adds: \u201cIf Great Britain leaves, it will minimise its role. I am not trying to be patronising. I think we have to be frank with the British people when we talk about their future in the European Union. Many people in Europe want to be accommodating \u2026 but if the demands are too extreme, they are not going to be met.\u201cYou cannot keep all the goodies and forget about the costs. Britain will still have to pay into the EU budget, just as the Swiss and Norwegians do. It would have no influence over the decisions yet it would have to subscribe to all the rules. London would not be that sexy a place for capital movement because it would have much looser links to Europe.\u201dGerman chancellor Angela Merkel suggested last week that her country would do all in its power to try to meet British demands during a wide-ranging renegotiation of its membership ahead of the referendum. But it is understood that Berlin also believes that the key British demand \u2013 to deny migrants who are in work the same social benefits as UK residents \u2013 would amount to a fundamental breach of EU law.Cameron is now urging fellow European leaders to reach an outline deal on the UK\u2019s demands, which also include an opt-out from the EU commitment to \u201cever-closer union\u201d, by the end of this year, in time for the referendum to be held next year.

Neutral Sweden has agreed to increase its military spending by about 15% over five years. It has also made a unilateral \u201csolidarity declaration\u201d to provide support to any EU member of the Nordic nations that comes under armed attack, the Sipri report notes.However, the report makes clear that the countries registering the biggest increases have started from a low base and their spending plans, especially Ukraine\u2019s and Russia\u2019s, remain vulnerable to economic pressures.Though Russia\u2019s spending on arms will rise by 60%, its overall defence budget \u2013 including spending on personnel and infrastructure \u2013 will increase by 15%, according to Sipri. Most of the increases were planned before the Ukraine crisis and Russia\u2019s economic crisis last year, it says.\u201cModernisation of the Russian armed forces has been a major priority since 2011, with the aim of rearming 70% of the armed forces with new equipment by 2020,\u201d says the report. Recent weapons projects include the Su-34 long-range combat aircraft and Verba and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems.China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have all substantially increased their military spending, though they still fall well behind the US, which remains the world\u2019s largest spender on arms despite a 20% cut in its defence budget since its peak in 2010.The US defence budget amounted to $610bn (\u00a3415bn) last year, compared with China\u2019s estimated $216bn and Russia\u2019s estimated $84.5bn, according to Sipri.The US accounted for 34% of world military expenditure last year, followed by China (12%), Russia (4.8%) and Saudi Arabia(4.5%).Total world military expenditure last year amounted to \u00a31.8tn, a slight fall in real terms compared with 2013. Cuts in the US and western Europe were almost matched by increases in Asia, the Middle East, eastern Europe and Africa, where Algeria and Angola registered the biggest increases, financed by oil revenues.\u201cWhile total world military spending is almost unchanged, some regions, such as the Middle East and much of Africa, are continuing to see rapid build-ups that are placing an increasingly high burden on many economies,\u201d said Sam Perlo-Freeman, head of Sipri\u2019s military expenditure project.\u201cThese increases partly reflect worsening security situations, but in many cases they are also the product of corruption, vested interests and autocratic governance.\u201dUnless tensions with Russia escalate significantly, it is unlikely that many Nato countries will meet the target of 2% of GDP on defence spending \u2013 including Britain \u2013 for the first time since before the second world war.", "tags": ["Nato", "World news", "US defence spending", "Defence policy", "Arms trade", "Russia", "Sweden", "Ukraine", "Europe"], "title": "Eastern Europe is boosting military budgets, but US is still the big spender"},{"date": "2015-04-24T18:00:36Z", "country": "poland", "content": " Related: Poland demands apology for FBI chief's comment on Holocaust The government of Poland has asked the American toy maker Mattel to withdraw a party game, over a reference to \u201cNazi Poland\u201d on one of its cards.

Poland, a strictly Roman Catholic country, is one of the few places in Europe where women can get a legal abortion only if there is proof of rape or incest, the mother\u2019s life is endangered or the foetus is severely malformed. The group said it had chosen the unusual method of delivery in order to highlight Poland\u2019s restrictive abortion laws. Other European countries such as Portugal, Spain and the UK \u2013 except for Northern Ireland \u2013 offer abortions on request as long as certain conditions are met.Rebecca Gomperts, a doctor and founder of Women on Waves, said: \u201cWe want to create awareness about women\u2019s right to a safe abortion. The drone is another way to use the different laws in different countries in order to draw attention to the social injustice that women who are living in places where abortion is illegal are subject to.\u201cIn Poland, even women who could have an abortion under Polish law are often denied it because Catholic hospitals don\u2019t help them, even if their life is in danger. Rich people can go to Germany or the UK to have abortions, but it\u2019s the women who don\u2019t have the means or access to information who are suffering.\u201dGomperts said the abortion drone did not require authorisation from the Polish or German government as it would not be flying through controlled airspace, was not for commercial purposes and weighed less than 5kg. The pills \u2013 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2013 can be taken up to nine weeks into a pregnancy. Women on Waves provides medical abortion pills around the world, usually by post after women place orders online.It is estimated that at least 50,000 underground abortions take place in Poland each year. Doctors who perform them illegally often use outdated tools and procedures, and charge up to \u20ac4,000 (\u00a32,850). \u201cWoman who have abortions in Poland are not criminalised, it\u2019s the people who provide the abortions who are acting illegally,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cWe want to create awareness among Polish women that there is medicine that is safe to use. So that whenever they look for abortions they will make sure it is safe.\u201dThe exact location of the drone dropoff will be announced on Friday. Pro-life groups have reportedly vowed to shoot it down. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to shoot down a drone and fortunately guns are not that easy to get in Europe,\u201d Gomperts said. \u201cBut it\u2019s problematic because it\u2019s a very aggressive strategy that\u2019s intended to make people afraid. And it\u2019s nonsense because it will not stop women from needing an abortion.\u201dIf the mission is successful, Women on Waves hopes to send drones to other countries in Europe that criminalise abortion, such as Ireland and Malta. \u201cWe would definitely be able to extend this programme,\u201d Gompert said.", "tags": ["Abortion", "Poland", "Germany", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "'Abortion drone' to fly pills across border into Poland"},{"date": "2015-05-28T06:01:00Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland is outperforming the UK when it comes to education as well as being the world leader in converting economic growth into the well-being of its citizens, according to a new report.The Sustainable economic development assessment (Seda) by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) measures wellbeing across 149 countries.Under the education dimension of Seda, Poland got a score of 90 (the best country gets 100 and the worst zero). This was higher than the western European average of 82 and Britain\u2019s 74. Poland reformed its schooling system in 2009 to introduce compulsory education between the ages of six and 18 as well as statutory entitlement to a year of pre-school. Poland is ahead of the UK when it comes to teacher-to-pupil ratio and levels of tertiary enrolment. In both of those measures, the UK has been falling behind the average improvement for the rest of the world. Although its overall well-being score at 71.6 was lower than Britain\u2019s 81.1, Poland also slightly outperformed the UK on the health dimension of the Seda score. Poland\u2019s improvement in overall wellbeing between 2006 and 2013 was higher than any other country when adjusted for how much each economy grew during that period. The only area where it stuttered was what the report describes as its \u201cweak\u201d infrastructure, with Poland\u2019s recent performance in this measure lagging behind comparable economies. Polish ministers were angered last year after UK prime minister David Cameron gave a speech judged to be negatively singling out Polish migrants to the UK. Douglas Beal, a partner who leads BCG\u2019s global economic development work in the firm\u2019s Public Sector practice and is a co-author of the report, said: \u201cEmigration from Poland continued until 2006-07 when the net outflow stopped. The timing of this goes hand in hand with the improvements in well-being that we have seen.\u201dAnother co-author, senior BCG economics advisor Enrique Rueda-Sabater, said: \u201cIt is actually a pretty positive story. They [Poland] are not improving well-being by sending everyone to the UK. Domestic job growth and their performance on our employment dimension confirms that.\u201dNorway was judged to be the country where citizens have the best wellbeing in the world followed by Luxembourg and then Switzerland. Singapore was the only non-European country to make it into the top 10. At the bottom of the rankings was the Central African Republic, with Chad, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the Congo ranking just above.BCG also gave a score based on how countries had improved well-being between 2006 and 2013 and at the top of that list were Rwanda and Ethiopia. This partially reflects big steps forward in health for countries in sub-Saharan Africa generally. Other than health and education, the dimensions analysed by the report are: income, economic stability, employment, infrastructure, income equality, civil society, governance and environment. Across these dimensions, the analysis draws on nearly 50,000 different data points. Beal explains the rationale behind Seda: \u201cAs the world finally emerges from the global recession, policy makers are focusing on how to sustain and accelerate their country\u2019s growth rates. Leaders must now embark upon a new era and actively pursue well-being\u2014not just GDP\u2014as the primary goal. \u201cThey can and should measure well-being, and hold themselves against it. As one of the new leaders in well-being revealed in this year\u2019s report, Poland shows that you don\u2019t necessarily need high GDP growth to improve the lives of citizens, and that countries that focus on well-being seem to succeed on more fronts.\u201dThe report is being released before the conclusion of discussions in September to finalise what targets for economic and social outcomes by 2030 will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. In his foreword to the report, Nobel prize-winning economist A. Michael Spence said: \u201cTo pursue wellbeing effectively, countries need to achieve economic growth that is both socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The importance of a decisive, broad-based effort in this regard cannot be overemphasised. It is very good and encouraging to see the kind of contribution that this report, developed by strategy experts focused on wellbeing, makes to that effort.\u201d ", "tags": ["World news", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Business", "Economics"], "title": "Poland outperforms UK in education and health, report finds"},{"date": "2015-05-13T05:00:02Z", "country": "poland", "content": "  As sunlight streams through the windows of Warsaw\u2019s Church of the Basilian Fathers, a priest in gold robes swings a clanking censer around the altar. He chants with a low intonation, and a choir in an upper gallery responds, their voices filling the airy church interior, which is dominated by huge oil paintings and numerous small icons of haloed saints.The congregation is mostly made up of ethnic Ukrainians, members of a community that numbers hundreds of thousands and has been growing rapidly since the start of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.Last year Poland issued 331,000 permits for short-term work to Ukrainians, up 50% on 2013, says Marta Jaroszewicz, a migration expert at the Centre For Eastern Studies (OSW), an independent Warsaw thinktank funded by the Polish government.She estimates that there are now 300,000-400,000 Ukrainians in Poland, as many as twice the officially recognised number. In January and February, the number of residence applications by Ukrainians in the Mazovian voivodeship \u2013 the province which includes Warsaw \u2013 was up 180% on the same months of 2014.The migrants have largely been welcomed, with some taking jobs vacated by Poles who have left for western Europe. But the numbers are a new phenomenon in a country more used to emigration than immigration.  Galyna, an elegantly dressed 42-year-old housekeeper from Ternopil in western Ukraine, stops to examine a church notice board. She has been in Warsaw for two years with her teenage daughter and son. \u201cI\u2019m here for my two years and I\u2019m staying for my children,\u201d she says. \u201cThis church is incredible, it\u2019s of enormous importance for us. We can be with other Ukrainians, and even if we didn\u2019t get on at home, here we are united and are brothers and sisters. It\u2019s hard to be here when our friends are at home and things are so hard, but with help from God the sun will rise after the darkness.\u201d \u201cWe are seeing many more people since the war,\u201d adds Katarzyna Sirocka, an ethnic-Ukrainian Polish citizen and head of the Association of Ukrainian Women in Poland. \u201cThose lucky enough to have papers in order work here as cleaners, construction workers and drivers.

But at the nearby Ukrainian World centre established by the Open Dialogue Foundation, a Polish NGO, to support the community, refugees from war-torn eastern Ukraine gather to seek help. \u201cWar is the reason we left,\u201d says Tetiana, 46, who left Luhansk for Warsaw, 1,000 miles away. \u201cWe lost our homes, our everything. The only way to survive was to go somewhere, and we decided to try to move to Poland. We want to stay here to try to live another life. When the situation in Ukraine improves, we will return \u2013 but we don\u2019t actually have a place to return to as our house was destroyed.\u201d Ukrainian World was established in 2014 and receives 100 visitors a day, with increasing numbers arriving from eastern Ukraine.  \u201cThose from the east are in the most difficulty,\u201d says Mateusz Kramek, the office co-ordinator at Ukrainian World. \u201cThey don\u2019t know Polish, don\u2019t know Warsaw, and often ran from their homes with just a few bags.\u201d  The centre provides practical help and humanitarian aid for Ukrainians, supplying donated clothes and food and assisting in applications for Polish visas and refugee status. There is a resident psychologist working in an upstairs room; outside, a girl waits for her appointment on a soggy sofa, while typing on a laptop.About 70% of those coming to the centre are seeking work or places at universities, while 30% want to register as refugees, says Kramek. Some hope to stay in Poland only briefly, before moving on to the west. The centre doubles as a home of political activity for supporting Ukraine, and regular meetings and events are held. There is a small \u201cLibrary of Maidan\u201d with Ukrainian books, and a museum consisting of a few cases of memorabilia from the Maidan \u2013 Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, the focus of the uprising. Photos of Maidan protesters and Ukrainian banners adorn the walls. A Ukrainian flag signed by government soldiers in eastern Ukraine hangs over a postbox for \u201cletters of hope\u201d to the front.

In this, it enjoys widespread support from the Polish electorate, and Poles donate generously to Ukrainian World, says Kramek. However, relations between Ukrainians and Poles have not always been so cordial, and memories of massacres and forced deportations during and after the second world war linger in some parts. Kramek says that there are some \u201chaters\u201d who take to the organisation\u2019s Facebook page to complain about Ukrainians, but there have been no reports of physical violence.  \u201cIt\u2019s about 50/50 \u2013 one half help us and supports Ukraine, the other half doesn\u2019t like it, and says that we should go back and stay,\u201d says Bogdan Bak, a 29-year-old Ukrainian in jeans and a leather jacket working with three friends on one of the free computers at Ukrainian World.

Poland is one of the most homogenous societies in the EU. Only 0.2% of the population are foreigners Similarities in culture between Poland and western Ukraine in particular have generally made integration of Ukrainian migrants relatively straightforward. Poland\u2019s economic growth ageing population and emigration levels had meant immigration was likely to have become an issue.

The group said it still planned to ride to Berlin, but would find alternative ways to do so.The Night Wolves are controversial due to their support for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and their role in the annexation of Crimea last year and subsequently in east Ukraine. Their leader, Alexander Zaldostanov, is known as \u201cthe Surgeon\u201d and is one of the founders of Anti-Maidan, a Russian group that has promised to crush liberal protesters it believes are determined to create a Ukrainian-style revolution in Russia. The Surgeon is seen as friendly with Putin, and the Russian president has previously ridden with the gang in a photo opportunity aimed at boosting his macho image.A group of around 15 riders made it to the border between the Belarusian town of Brest and the Polish town of Terespol on Monday, with five of them saying they had no visas for Poland but were there to wave off their friends. The 10 were allowed through by Belarusian guards but were turned back by the Poles.\u201cThese people will not cross into Poland. Each of them will receive a separate refusal,\u201d said Dariusz Sienicki, a spokesperson for the Polish border guards. One of the bikers said they had been searched by the Poles \u201cdown to the last sock\u201d before being turned away.The Polish prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, had previously called the rally a \u201cprovocation\u201d possibly aimed at putting Poles \u201cin danger of distress\u201d. Other Poles have spoken out against the bikers and have demanded they be banned from the country. However, some Polish bikers supported the rally, and had planned to escort the Night Wolves through the country. About 100 of them gathered on the Polish side of the border and honked horns in protest against the ban.The Night Wolves have said they will continue with their plans to ride to Berlin even if they are turned away by Poland.\u201cOther people who will not say they are Night Wolves will travel by other routes and accomplish this mission,\u201d Zaldostanov told Russian agency LifeNews.Zaldostanov himself was not travelling with the column, and has remained in Moscow, as his passport is currently at the embassy of a European country awaiting a visa decision, the biker group said. Zaldostanov had said he would catch up with the column as soon as he gets a visa.The original route was due to take them from Belarus through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria, to reach Berlin in time for 9 May.Russia has lavish plans for Victory Day this year, with a parade of 16,000 soldiers on Red Square and the newest military vehicles and planes on display. Putin will host a number of world leaders, including the leaders of China, India and Brazil, and Kim Jong-un, the reclusive leader of North Korea. However, most western leaders will stay away, in protest against Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine.

Related: 50 Conservative MPs ready to lead campaign for EU exit The minister, who reiterates his country\u2019s refusal to accept Cameron\u2019s central demand \u2013 that social benefits should be denied to all EU migrants for at least four years after arriving in the UK \u2013 says Britain would no longer be an important player, in Europe or the world, if it left the EU. He warns that the ability of British people to travel as freely as they do now, and to work and buy homes in other EU countries, would also be lost, and that UK businesses would suddenly face new problems, as the country would no longer be able to influence the rules of the internal market.Trzaskowski, reflecting growing fears in the EU that the UK government is setting itself unrealistic targets for reform which British people are being led to believe are achievable, says all European leaders want Britain to stay in the EU, but not if it means undermining EU principles, such as the free movement of labour. \u201cNo one in Europe says, \u2018We don\u2019t care, take it or leave it.\u2019 No, we say, \u2018Guys, OK, some of your fears are justified, some of your sensibilities should be taken into account, and some of your idiosyncrasies, even though for us they might seem strange. We should talk about it.\u2019 We do not say ship out. But there are certain red lines. We cannot start questioning the cornerstones of integration, because it will have far-reaching consequences.\u201dAsked whether he fears the British people might vote to leave, he says: \u201cIt really depends on how the whole thing is depicted by British political parties to the British people \u2013 what kind of alternative is painted. If you say you can leave and still be part of the internal market, keep your [second] houses, that you will still be free to travel, that there will be no customs duties, and so on \u2013 but that you will not have to accept free movement of workers, and you will not pay into the EU budget, of course people will vote [to leave] \u2026 but this is simply not true.\u201dTrzaskowski adds: \u201cIf Great Britain leaves, it will minimise its role. I am not trying to be patronising. I think we have to be frank with the British people when we talk about their future in the European Union. Many people in Europe want to be accommodating \u2026 but if the demands are too extreme, they are not going to be met.\u201cYou cannot keep all the goodies and forget about the costs. Britain will still have to pay into the EU budget, just as the Swiss and Norwegians do. It would have no influence over the decisions yet it would have to subscribe to all the rules. London would not be that sexy a place for capital movement because it would have much looser links to Europe.\u201dGerman chancellor Angela Merkel suggested last week that her country would do all in its power to try to meet British demands during a wide-ranging renegotiation of its membership ahead of the referendum. But it is understood that Berlin also believes that the key British demand \u2013 to deny migrants who are in work the same social benefits as UK residents \u2013 would amount to a fundamental breach of EU law.Cameron is now urging fellow European leaders to reach an outline deal on the UK\u2019s demands, which also include an opt-out from the EU commitment to \u201cever-closer union\u201d, by the end of this year, in time for the referendum to be held next year. Should he fail to secure reform on his terms, more than 50 Tory MPs are poised to lead the campaign for the UK to quit the EU. Former cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and John Redwood are among backers of the newly formed Conservatives for Britain (CfB) that will initially support the prime minister\u2019s bid to renegotiate terms of membership for the UK, according to the Sunday Telegraph.Poland, whose economy has strengthened since it joined the EU in 2004, now sees itself as a central player in the union and is determined to defend the rights of the 700,000 Polish citizens in the UK, the vast majority of whom are in work.Trzaskowski says that just because Cameron feels strengthened by his general election victory, Poland will not roll over. \u201cWe cannot say simply that we sit around the table and you say, \u2018This is my manifesto and I won the elections on the basis of it, so cave in and accept it.\u2019\u201dUkip leader Nigel Farage said that his party must waste no time before beginning a \u201cground war\u201d to leave the European Union.

Still only 25, Swift\u2019s 10 years in the music business and her stylistic move from pop-country to pure pop haven\u2019t altered her core values: her persona is of a kind of ageless, hip high school nerd, her experience measured in her persistent wit and lyrical grace rather than sexuality or attitude.

A schoolfriend of White\u2019s, Prass similarly seems the product of a good record collection, her own voice having some of the sweetness and laser clarity that characterised the classics of Diana Ross. Indeed, against the rich background of brass and strings that White and his friends supply, on her eponymous debut album the singer seems to channel classic 70s soul, a golden age of compositional heartbreak.Body & Soul festival, Meath, Sun; Mono, Glasgow, Mon; Islington Assembly Hall, N1, Wed; The Deaf Institute, Manchester, Thu; Thekla, Bristol, FriJRThere\u2019s only one thing that\u2019s predictable about Glastonbury these days, and that\u2019s the outcry when the main stage headliner is revealed to be a hip-hop artist.

Neutral Sweden has agreed to increase its military spending by about 15% over five years. It has also made a unilateral \u201csolidarity declaration\u201d to provide support to any EU member of the Nordic nations that comes under armed attack, the Sipri report notes.However, the report makes clear that the countries registering the biggest increases have started from a low base and their spending plans, especially Ukraine\u2019s and Russia\u2019s, remain vulnerable to economic pressures.Though Russia\u2019s spending on arms will rise by 60%, its overall defence budget \u2013 including spending on personnel and infrastructure \u2013 will increase by 15%, according to Sipri. Most of the increases were planned before the Ukraine crisis and Russia\u2019s economic crisis last year, it says.\u201cModernisation of the Russian armed forces has been a major priority since 2011, with the aim of rearming 70% of the armed forces with new equipment by 2020,\u201d says the report. Recent weapons projects include the Su-34 long-range combat aircraft and Verba and S-400 surface-to-air missile systems.China, Russia and Saudi Arabia have all substantially increased their military spending, though they still fall well behind the US, which remains the world\u2019s largest spender on arms despite a 20% cut in its defence budget since its peak in 2010.The US defence budget amounted to $610bn (\u00a3415bn) last year, compared with China\u2019s estimated $216bn and Russia\u2019s estimated $84.5bn, according to Sipri.The US accounted for 34% of world military expenditure last year, followed by China (12%), Russia (4.8%) and Saudi Arabia(4.5%).Total world military expenditure last year amounted to \u00a31.8tn, a slight fall in real terms compared with 2013. Cuts in the US and western Europe were almost matched by increases in Asia, the Middle East, eastern Europe and Africa, where Algeria and Angola registered the biggest increases, financed by oil revenues.\u201cWhile total world military spending is almost unchanged, some regions, such as the Middle East and much of Africa, are continuing to see rapid build-ups that are placing an increasingly high burden on many economies,\u201d said Sam Perlo-Freeman, head of Sipri\u2019s military expenditure project.\u201cThese increases partly reflect worsening security situations, but in many cases they are also the product of corruption, vested interests and autocratic governance.\u201dUnless tensions with Russia escalate significantly, it is unlikely that many Nato countries will meet the target of 2% of GDP on defence spending \u2013 including Britain \u2013 for the first time since before the second world war.", "tags": ["Nato", "World news", "US defence spending", "Defence policy", "Arms trade", "Russia", "Sweden", "Ukraine", "Europe"], "title": "Eastern Europe is boosting military budgets, but US is still the big spender"},{"date": "2015-06-17T17:04:01Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Dozens of Nato landing craft churned through the Baltic\u2019s grey waters. Further out at sea, huge warships \u2013 the US\u2019s San Antonio, Britain\u2019s Ocean and Poland\u2019s Lublin \u2013 filled the horizon. On the beach, DVs \u2013 short for distinguished visitors \u2013 including the UK defence secretary, Michael Fallon, were watching.The landing craft, especially the mega hovercraft of the Americans, were monstrous, on a scale that would have awed D-day veterans. Eurofighter Typhoons flew overhead. Marines raced out to disappear into the woods. A reminder that even the most carefully planned operations can go wrong came when a Polish transport vessel sank, ignominiously, about 100ft from shore.The mock landing at Ustka, Poland, on Wednesday was the climax of a two-week Nato exercise called Baltops. Forty-nine naval vessels from 17 countries and 5,900 personnel were involved in this major show of strength.It was a dangerous game. One of Russia\u2019s most important naval bases, Kaliningrad, is just over 100 miles to the east, and the Kremlin may view such exercises as a provocation at a time of heightened tension over the Ukraine crisis. Related: Vladimir Putin opens Russian 'military Disneyland' Patriot Park Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, this week announced plans to buy 40 intercontinental ballistic missiles this year. The US, two years after pulling all its armour out of Europe, is preparing to send 250 tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery to bases in eastern Europe.On Wednesday journalists from around the world were invited to witness Natio\u2019s elaborate exercise in the Baltic. The US-led alliance wants to show that it is doing something, that it is not feeble in the confrontation with Putin. Fallon, when asked about Baltops, said: \u201cIt is absolutely not a game.\u201d Asked whether it was provocative to be conducting such exercises so close to Russia, he told the Guardian: \u201cIt is not Nato threatening Russia. This is Russia directly trying to intimidate the eastern and northern members of Nato through these flights, through its submarine activity and talk of renewing its ballistic missiles. Nato is not threatening anyone.\u201cNato has no quarrel with the Russian people. We do have a quarrel with Putin, or Russia, trying to change borders by force.\u201dAsked about the danger of a renewed arms race in light of Putin\u2019s pledge on ballistic missiles \u2013 though Russia is talking about updating existing missiles rather than adding more \u2013 Fallon said: \u201cRussia is clearly modernising its nuclear defence as well as its conventional arms. Nato likewise is committed to increasing defence spending and increasing the percentage of defence spending that goes on new equipment. Nato is ready to match this kind of sabre-rattling from Russia.\u201dIn recent days, Russian planes have been buzzing low over Nato ships, one just 500ft above the destroyer USS Jason Dunham, according to the US defence department. On Wednesday, Eurofighter Typhoons based in Estonia intercepted Russian military aircraft, bringing to 11 the number of interventions since they were deployed six weeks ago. Five of these have been in the last 10 days, coinciding with Baltops.A US naval officer reported that Russian ships, too, had come \u201cuncomfortably close\u201d \u2013 less than a mile from the Nato flotilla. It is in international waters and the Russians have as much right as Nato to be there.Lt Gen Ben Hodges, commander of the US army Europe, briefing journalists in London this week, said: \u201cI am sure the Russians have no desire to go into a head-to-head fight with Nato. But what is a little worrisome is the airspace violations, without transponders, the big exercises right on the border. All of these things heighten the chance and risk of an accident or something unintended happening.\u201dThe response of Nato to the crisis in Ukraine has been feeble: there is no desire on the part of the US to go to war with Russia over a country that is not even a Nato member. Nato has made a mistake lagging behind Russian moves. To recapture the initiative, it has to be more aggressiveBut it wants to send a clear message to Russia that the Baltic states are Nato members and they will be defended. The increased frequency and size of Nato exercises in the Baltic are meant to send that message and Kaliningrad, Russia\u2019s gateway to the west, is a good place to make the point.During the cold war, Kaliningrad was regularly described as the most militarised place on Earth. Afterwards, that started to change, but against the present crisis it has regained some of its former prominence, with about 50 vessels, almost the same number as those in the Nato exercise, stationed there. The US and the UK devote much of their intelligence capability to monitoring vessels going in and out.Hodges said: \u201cOne of the things that concerns me is the amount of capability that the Russians have put into Kaliningrad. They have the ability to deny access up into the Baltic Sea through anti-ship missiles. They recently did an exercise where they put in an Iskander missile there. That is a range of 300km, a nuclear-capable system which could easily range Riga.\u201dThe importance of Kaliningrad to Russia is that Russian ships from St Petersburg would be vulnerable passing between Estonia and Finland: Kaliningrad has no such vulnerability.Scandinavian and Baltic countries have reported an increase in Russian naval activity close to their waters, especially involving submarines. The Kremlin has responded by pointing to similar tests of its airspace by Nato planes, and exercises such as Baltops.Nato may say it is ready to match the Kremlin\u2019s sabre-rattling, but reality is different from the rhetoric. The US is cutting back on defence spending and the size of its forces. A Jane\u2019s report this week said Russia, suffering an economic downturn due partly to sanctions from the US and European nations, is scaling back plans for big rises in defence spending next year, but there will still be an increase. Even with that, Russia\u2019s defence spending is dwarfed by that of the US, which is about 10 times bigger.Igor Sutyagin, a Russian military specialist at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute, said the standoff in the Baltics is complicated, with both sides using exercises to send messages. \u201cFor Nato, the message is: \u2018We will defend the Baltic states, don\u2019t mess with us, we will defend our interests, we mean business,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe messages have become more confrontational.\u201cNato has made a mistake lagging behind Russian moves. To recapture the initiative, it has to be more aggressive. That is why it is confrontational. It is that Nato recognises that it is necessary to regain dominance and that means being more aggressive than its opponent. It is dangerous.\u201dOne of the contentious issues between Nato and Russia is a pact not to have permanent bases in eastern Europe. Nato has tried to get around this by stationing \u201crotational\u201d troops in the Baltic states and Poland. They are there all-year round but Nato claims they are not permanent. Russia views this as semantics. \u201cRussia would be left with no other option but to boost its troops and forces on the western flank,\u201d said Gen Yuri Yakubov, responding to US plans for increased troops and equipment in eastern Europe. Among Russia\u2019s options, Yabukov said, would be to deploy its new Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad.", "tags": ["Nato", "Russia", "UK news", "Michael Fallon", "Europe", "US news", "Politics", "World news", "Vladimir Putin", "Poland"], "title": "Nato shows its teeth to Russia with elaborate Baltic training exercise"},{"date": "2015-09-12T06:00:07Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The last leg of our 5,000-mile European tour started with a long drive north.

Despite TV scenes of a crowded continent under siege, we had come away with the recurring impression of empty spaces: the pine forests of northern Greece, the vast uninhabited swathes of the Bulgarian Rhodope mountains and now, Poland\u2019s forests.North of Krakow, we wandered off into those forests along smaller roads, eventually finding a good hotel near Ogrodzieniec castle, one of a clutch of spectacular fortifications in the area.Next day, we continued north to the coast. The only time I\u2019d swum in the Baltic, the water had been at precisely 0C and I was hoping to find it warmer. Poland has, effectively, one beach \u2013 a broad white strand that runs east for hundreds of kilometres from the German border.

T-67 tanks, Gaz jeeps, massive old Zil lorries, plus a hangar full of the weird and wonderful smaller stuff: weapons, uniforms and insignia. I was bargaining hard for a second world war vintage amphibious landing craft when Sophie dragged me away (it\u2019s just out of town on Highway 11, if you\u2019re interested).The coast road rarely gives sight of the sea: it sticks to the forest, and often heads into the hinterland. We stuck to our task, exploring every lane that led beachwards, parking wherever we found a handful of cars and tramping through soft-footed pines to the beach. At Ustronie Morskie, we discovered a good cafe in a stilted cabin over the breakers with views of endless sand, colourfully chequered by windbreaks \u2013 essential here.

Green groups said that the EU was not doing enough.The bloc\u2019s joint position published on Friday calls for five yearly reviews of countries\u2019 carbon emission cuts after any deal is reached in December, something many parties are now calling for. It also says the nearly 200 countries meeting in Paris should commit to a long-term vision for \u201cclimate neutrality and climate resilience in the second half of this century\u201d. The phrase \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d replaced the word \u201cdecarbonisation\u201d in an earlier version of the position, emphasising action on all greenhouse gases rather than just carbon dioxide emissions. In a new addition to the text, other countries around the world were called upon to reduce their emissions to near zero or below by 2100. The G7 agreed in June to phase out all fossil fuels by the end of the century.Ca\u00f1ete said the EU was asking all countries to peak their emissions by 2020 to avoid dangerous global warming, in line with a report published by the UN\u2019s climate science panel the IPCC. The EU said that the issue of transferring funds from developed to developing countries to help them with climate change would be of great importance at Paris.\u201cPublic finance alone will not be enough to meet the challenge and we also need to attract better private climate finance,\u201d Ca\u00f1ete said. Green groups said the environment ministers\u2019 position today still held out the hope of of avoiding dangerous warming, but more was needed.Greenpeace EU energy policy adviser Jiri Jerabek said: \u201cThe EU\u2019s position is still far from what is needed to reach an effective global deal.\u201dGenevi\u00e8ve Pons Deladri\u00e8re, director of the WWF European policy office, said: \u201cAs climate change is speeding up and getting worse, it\u2019s regrettable that EU environment ministers failed to spell out how the EU intends to increase its own climate and energy targets.\u201dHowever, Amber Rudd, the UK energy and climate secretary, who was at the meeting, said she was pleased with the agreement: \u201cI welcome today\u2019s agreement, which the UK has been driving forward and will enable businesses to remain competitive and grow as we move to a low carbon future.\u201dActivists in Brussels staged a tug-of-war contest between fossil fuels and renewable energy, and called on the ministers to go further than their commitment of cutting emissions 40% by 2030.

There was a European migration crisis in progress, but at the Slovak border deep in the Tatra mountains \u2013 surely one of the prettiest in Europe \u2013 there were just lines of parked Polish cars, their occupants busy buying cheap beer on the Slovak side. Despite TV scenes of a crowded continent under siege, we had come away with the recurring impression of empty spaces: the pine forests of northern Greece, the vast uninhabited swathes of the Bulgarian Rhodope mountains and now, Poland\u2019s forests.North of Krakow, we wandered off into those forests along smaller roads, eventually finding a good hotel near Ogrodzieniec castle, one of a clutch of spectacular fortifications in the area.Next day, we continued north to the coast. The only time I\u2019d swum in the Baltic, the water had been at precisely 0C and I was hoping to find it warmer. Poland has, effectively, one beach \u2013 a broad white strand that runs east for hundreds of kilometres from the German border. We stayed in Ko\u0142obrzeg, a seaside place with an old town and port, a scurf of more-or-less tatty concrete blocks of flats and some chi-chi spa hotels. Related: Warsaw city guide: a day in Sr\u00f3dmiescie \u201cBournemouth-on-borscht,\u201d said my wife Sophie when we arrived in rain. But next day, in glorious sunshine, she revised her opinion. It was not Bournemouth, but neither was it borscht \u2013 we couldn\u2019t see anything but pizza on offer.Ko\u0142obrzeg beach was busy, backed by souvenir stands and cafes, but we wanted empty spaces and nature, so set off east. We had barely left town, however, when I spotted something quite different: an old military camp packed with ex-Soviet equipment for sale. I was in heaven. T-67 tanks, Gaz jeeps, massive old Zil lorries, plus a hangar full of the weird and wonderful smaller stuff: weapons, uniforms and insignia. I was bargaining hard for a second world war vintage amphibious landing craft when Sophie dragged me away (it\u2019s just out of town on Highway 11, if you\u2019re interested).The coast road rarely gives sight of the sea: it sticks to the forest, and often heads into the hinterland. We stuck to our task, exploring every lane that led beachwards, parking wherever we found a handful of cars and tramping through soft-footed pines to the beach. At Ustronie Morskie, we discovered a good cafe in a stilted cabin over the breakers with views of endless sand, colourfully chequered by windbreaks \u2013 essential here. I chatted to a lifeguard. \u201cIt\u2019s a short summer season,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get lots of Germans, but you\u2019re the first British I\u2019ve met.\u201dAnd the water? \u201cBetween 9C and 20C.

Midges? Mosquitoes? He shook his head. \u201cAlmost none.\u201dFor a few weeks then, for those of us who don\u2019t like extreme heat or get itchy at the whine of a mozzie, this place is heaven-sent. Don\u2019t expect bags of style, however: we lunched on pizza in the village of Sarbinowo, having failed to find anything else. It was freshly baked, but still, it was pizza, and what we wanted was traditional Polish cooking.This coast is scattered with places where the beach becomes a narrow spit, threaded by pines and squeezed between the sea and a lake. Dziwnow in the west near the German border is one; there is another at Dzwirzyno a few kilometres west of Ko\u0142obrzeg. They all have something a little magical \u2013 the extra light, plus the option of canoeing past dense reedbeds then picnicking where there is a clearing. We still had not found what we wanted, but a few miles east, near the village of \u0141azy, we spotted a single car parked in the forest beside the beginnings of a narrow sandy footpath. A short walk away we found a solitary windbreak on a long expanse of warm fine sand that whistled gently when walked upon.

Later, a few strollers watched in puzzlement as we played cricket with pine cones and foraged sticks. One man joined in, but we struggled to explain the rules. Why did we shout \u201csix!\u201d when it went in the sea?At sunset we drove back towards Ko\u0142obrzeg, some of us determined to starve rather than eat pizza. Near the old port, with its impressive lighthouse, we finally discovered some Polish cuisine in Cafe Winogranami: golonka (pork knuckle), \u017eurek (sour bread soup) and sledz (herring in oil). On another evening, we explored the delights of pierogi (Polish dumplings) and gol\u0105bki (cabbage rolls).We had arrived at the Baltic coast via a marathon exploration of central Europe and the Balkans, but now we turned for home, breaking our journey in Osnabruck \u2013 a small German city well-positioned for overnights between Poland and Zeebrugge.It had been a long, and memorable journey and one I would highly recommend. We\u2019d learned the cyrillic alphabet (essential for Bulgaria), a few dozen words in as many languages, tasted delights such as lacror (Albania) and trivarica (Croatia), slept under the stars, ridden in hay carts, explored lost communist monuments (the Buzludzha in Bulgaria) and seen a thousand places where we would like to have lingered longer.We had been apprehensive about driving through places like Albania, but had found nothing but kindness. Over the course of the six weeks, we had met people who talked of further places, too \u2013 Kosovo, Ukraine and Moldova \u2013 with affection and without mentioning the usual tales of woe.

It was freshly baked, but still, it was pizza, and what we wanted was traditional Polish cooking.This coast is scattered with places where the beach becomes a narrow spit, threaded by pines and squeezed between the sea and a lake. Dziwnow in the west near the German border is one; there is another at Dzwirzyno a few kilometres west of Ko\u0142obrzeg. They all have something a little magical \u2013 the extra light, plus the option of canoeing past dense reedbeds then picnicking where there is a clearing. We still had not found what we wanted, but a few miles east, near the village of \u0141azy, we spotted a single car parked in the forest beside the beginnings of a narrow sandy footpath. A short walk away we found a solitary windbreak on a long expanse of warm fine sand that whistled gently when walked upon.

Later, a few strollers watched in puzzlement as we played cricket with pine cones and foraged sticks. One man joined in, but we struggled to explain the rules. Why did we shout \u201csix!\u201d when it went in the sea?At sunset we drove back towards Ko\u0142obrzeg, some of us determined to starve rather than eat pizza. Near the old port, with its impressive lighthouse, we finally discovered some Polish cuisine in Cafe Winogranami: golonka (pork knuckle), \u017eurek (sour bread soup) and sledz (herring in oil). On another evening, we explored the delights of pierogi (Polish dumplings) and gol\u0105bki (cabbage rolls).We had arrived at the Baltic coast via a marathon exploration of central Europe and the Balkans, but now we turned for home, breaking our journey in Osnabruck \u2013 a small German city well-positioned for overnights between Poland and Zeebrugge.It had been a long, and memorable journey and one I would highly recommend. We\u2019d learned the cyrillic alphabet (essential for Bulgaria), a few dozen words in as many languages, tasted delights such as lacror (Albania) and trivarica (Croatia), slept under the stars, ridden in hay carts, explored lost communist monuments (the Buzludzha in Bulgaria) and seen a thousand places where we would like to have lingered longer.We had been apprehensive about driving through places like Albania, but had found nothing but kindness. Over the course of the six weeks, we had met people who talked of further places, too \u2013 Kosovo, Ukraine and Moldova \u2013 with affection and without mentioning the usual tales of woe. Our horizons had expanded and internal barriers had come down.

About half a million Ukrainians live and work in Poland, and they are welcome, which is not well known in the west.Despite little enthusiasm for a mandatory quota system imposed on us, Poland is willing to respond positively and to welcome some refugees from other regions than eastern Europe. We are working on procedural and legal aspects of such a decision. We need a complex endeavour to identify migrants who really need to be protected and to prepare centres that would house them.

Green groups said that the EU was not doing enough.The bloc\u2019s joint position published on Friday calls for five yearly reviews of countries\u2019 carbon emission cuts after any deal is reached in December, something many parties are now calling for. It also says the nearly 200 countries meeting in Paris should commit to a long-term vision for \u201cclimate neutrality and climate resilience in the second half of this century\u201d. The phrase \u201cclimate neutrality\u201d replaced the word \u201cdecarbonisation\u201d in an earlier version of the position, emphasising action on all greenhouse gases rather than just carbon dioxide emissions. In a new addition to the text, other countries around the world were called upon to reduce their emissions to near zero or below by 2100. The G7 agreed in June to phase out all fossil fuels by the end of the century.Ca\u00f1ete said the EU was asking all countries to peak their emissions by 2020 to avoid dangerous global warming, in line with a report published by the UN\u2019s climate science panel the IPCC. The EU said that the issue of transferring funds from developed to developing countries to help them with climate change would be of great importance at Paris.\u201cPublic finance alone will not be enough to meet the challenge and we also need to attract better private climate finance,\u201d Ca\u00f1ete said.

Europe as a whole had equivalent mortality costs of between \u20ac21bn and \u20ac60.6bn, according to the authors.The report, from the NGO umbrella group Climate Action Network Europe (Cane), also found that the UK was the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide from coal burning after Germany and Poland.\u201cThe British government has not caught up with reality,\u201d Kathrin Gutmann, Cane\u2019s coal policy coordinator told the Guardian. \u201cIt urgently needs a proactive strategy to manage a coal phase out. Energy utilities are already starting to spend billions of euros to shed some of their coal plants but governments like the UK are just hiding behind this power sector transformation.\u201dLast month, Germany began a process of mothballing its largest coal plants. The new survey says that it is still Europe\u2019s biggest coal subsidiser though, coughing up \u20ac30bn between 1999 and 2011.In the UK, coal was responsible for some 87 million tonnes of CO2 emissions last year \u2013 16% of all the country\u2019s greenhouse gas output \u2013 a figure eight times higher than in France.Cane calculated the health costs by mapping Europe\u2019s 280 coal power plants and then multiplying their polluting emissions by the European Environment Agency\u2019s estimate of the cost of mortality associated with those emissions. The range of figures reflects different estimates of the cost to the economy of individual deaths. Julia Huscher, the coal officer for Health and Environment Alliance said that the new overview provided the first snapshot of how individual countries were contributing to Europe\u2019s trans-boundary air pollution problem.\u201cWe can now see that British power plants are responsible for very substantial emissions of classic air pollutants \u2013 nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides \u2013 and for the average European, that translates into more chronic illnesses like bronchitis, heart disease and asthma, and more premature deaths,\u201d she said.UK air quality has been in breach of EU standards for years and an estimated 29,000 Britons die prematurely each year from long-term exposure to air pollution. That figure includes emissions from vehicles. In April the supreme court ordered the government to produce a plan for tackling the air pollution problem.That plan is due to be presented this month, but environmental lawyers say that the roll-back of green policies could delay the clean up of Britain\u2019s skies. Since the election, the UK has cut renewable energy subsidy schemes.Alan Andrews, a lawyer for Client Earth said: \u201cWhile the Department of Food and Rural Affairs is furiously working away on their air quality plans, there seems to be a clear disconnect and lack of joined up thinking with other government departments going in the opposite direction and rolling back policies that will have a negative effect towards this toxic soup of pollution, which is harming the health of people in the UK.\u201d Coal emits more CO2 for the amount of energy produced than gas and oil but it still makes up over a third of the country\u2019s energy supply, although its percentage of the UK\u2019s generation mix was slightly down last year.Because the vast majority of British pits were closed down in the 1980s and 90s, this coal has to be imported. In 2013, Russia supplied around a third of the UK\u2019s stockpile, with the US, Colombia and other countries also contributing.

They\u2019ve come to rival the pork pie as the country\u2019s patriotic snack of choice. But are they really as British as we assume? History, and the Scotch egg\u2019s doppelgangers around the world, suggest otherwise.Fortnum & Mason would like to take the glory for inventing the Scotch egg \u2013 a portable snack for coach travellers first sold in 1738, they say. Food historian Annie Gray is not convinced. \u201cAnyone who has eaten one will know the breadcrumbs fall off; I\u2019m sure they started life as part of dinner, not as a traveller\u2019s food,\u201d she points out. \u201cPlus, if you\u2019re travelling and rich enough to shop at Fortnum\u2019s, you\u2019d be stopping at an inn for lunch, not stuffing an egg in your pocket.\u201dIf we follow the breadcrumb trail right back, Scotch eggs do indeed begin life on a dinner plate \u2013 with a dollop of gravy, as they appear in the 19th-century domestic bibles of Maria Rundell, Margaret Dods and Mrs Beeton. Could the great ladies of British housekeeping have been inspired by something they\u2019d eaten before? Related: How to cook the perfect scotch egg \u201cI think you can pin down the Scotch egg\u2019s introduction to Britain to the late 17th or early 18th century, and I suspect it came from India,\u201d says Gray. Its forebear may well have been the nargisi kofta or \u201cnarcissus kofta\u201d \u2013 named after the flower\u2019s white-and-yellow petals \u2013 which came to India from Persia with the Mughal emperors, according to The Oxford Companion to Food, and is a popular Indian supper dish today. \u201cThe Mughals influenced two major regions with their cuisine \u2013 Awadh and Hyderabad \u2013 hence there is a spicy and a non-spicy version of nargisi kofta,\u201d says Deep Arneja, chef at the Oberoi hotel in Agra. \u201cThe egg is generally wrapped inside lamb mince and fried, then served in a brown, yoghurt-based gravy.\u201dThe Dutch and Flemish-speaking Belgians\u2019 riff on the Scotch egg is known variously as vogelnestje (\u201cbird\u2019s nest\u201d) and gehaktbal kiekeboe (\u201cpeekaboo meatball\u201d), not forgetting the to-the-point eierbal (\u201cegg ball\u201d). Food writer Suzanne Vandyck publishes a recipe in her book 150 Dutch and Belgian Recipes, serving the bird\u2019s nests with tomato sauce and potato puree. She traces the dish to Catholics in medieval times, when it was a way of using up the eggs \u2013 forbidden during Lent \u2013 that had been boiled to make them last the 40-day fast. Another school of thought traces the Dutch egg-in-a-meat-jacket tradition back to the Dutch East Indies, with the rijsttafel (\u201crice table\u201d) \u2013 an elaborate colonial feast of dishes from across the region. One such dish might have been bakso telur (\u201cmeatball eggs\u201d) which Jakarta resident Ditya Wicaksono thinks originated in Java. Served in a veal broth with noodles and bok choy, the bakso telur are made with a smooth minced beef paste seasoned with garlic and white pepper. \u201cSweet sauce and a bit of vinegar and chilli sauce spice the broth up, and the secret to good meatballs is to have the meat a little bit chewy,\u201d says Ditya.The Dutch and Belgians don\u2019t have the monopoly on edible bird\u2019s nests \u2013 Polish Scotch eggs, jask\u00f3\u0142cze gniazda, have the same moniker, and are also served with potato, although with a fresh horseradish cream sauce. \u201cIt came from Silesia, a working-class mining region,\u201d says Andrzej Wica, a Polish chef who serves the dish in his S\u00e3o Paulo restaurant Maria Escaleira. \u201cIt started off as a big egg-stuffed roulade, and over time it transformed into an individual ball with an egg inside.\u201dAlways embracing passing fads, the residents of S\u00e3o Paulo have developed a taste for the bolovo \u2013 a nominal fusion of the bolinho (deep-fried croquettes that are the mainstay of Brazilian bar menus) and ovo (egg) that\u2019s almost identical to the Scotch egg, albeit with minced beef. Now as modish as its British counterpart (there\u2019s even a food truck cruising the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo that serves nothing else), it was, until recently, a little-known gem on the odd bar menu in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s countryside towns, although its origins are hazy. It may have come to the city with British immigrants, or with the Lebanese, via their egg-stuffed meat loaf, kafta bi beid, in the late 18th century. Meatballs, meatloaves, burgers, koftas \u2013 they\u2019re all just variants on a theme, and have been gracing tables for centuries. Who can say at what point \u2013 and where \u2013 one or more bright sparks thought to slip in an egg \u2013 a no-brainer, surely? Or do we have the Mughal Empire to thank for the Scotch egg?

That law would require the constitutional tribunal reach a two-thirds majority to issue rulings and block legislation, raising the bar from a simple majority. Thirteen of its 15 judges would have to be present for contentious cases, rather than nine as at present. Related: Poland's government carries through on threat to constitutional court Critics say the law virtually eliminates the court as a check on the power of the government, which controls both houses of parliament after October elections.The PiS-led government was sworn in on 16 November, with Beata Szyd\u0142o as prime minister. But critics say the shots are being called by what they say is the party\u2019s divisive and vindictive chief, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski.\u201cThis government acts against Poland, against our achievements, freedom, democracy, not to mention the fact that it ridicules us in the world,\u201d Wa\u0142\u0119sa told Radio Zet. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to travel abroad.\u201dWa\u0142\u0119sa, now 72, wields little political power but is symbolically important as the embodiment of the Solidarity revolution. His successor as president, Andrzej Duda, a PiS member, came under attack from the opposition for putting party loyalty before the requirements of office. He swore in five PiS appointees to the tribunal in the middle of the night earlier this month.\u201cWe are in an unusual situation where the president is not the president. He is doing the bidding of his party chief rather than putting the interests of the country and of democracy first,\u2019\u2019 said Jakub Stefaniak, spokesman for the Polish People\u2019s party, which has 16 MPs. \u201cHe is neglecting his primary, non-partisan role as the guardian of the constitution.\u2019\u2019 The law also enforces delays of three to six months between the time a request for a ruling is made and a verdict, compared with two weeks at present. In a written opinion on the law, Poland\u2019s supreme court said it interfered with the tribunal\u2019s independence and aimed to hobble its proper functioning. This \u201cpresages huge potential delays and, in fact, the paralysis [of the tribunal]\u201d, the court said.The political crisis has brought thousands of protesters out on the streets against the government\u2019s actions, and critical scrutiny from the EU. Martin Schulz, the European parliament\u2019s president, described PiS\u2019s actions as having the \u201ccharacteristics of a coup\u201d, drawing outrage from the Polish government and demands for an apology, which Schulz refused to give. The European parliament is due to debate the political situation in Poland on 19 January. Related: Protests in Poland as proposed laws curtail women's rights The PiS government also caused alarm at Nato and in neighbouring Slovakia last week, when it sent military police to raid a Nato-affiliated counter-intelligence centre in Warsaw run in partnership with Slovakia, with the aim of removing its director, who had been appointed by the previous government.In the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s vote, tens of thousands of people joined demonstrations in Polish cities under the banner of a non-partisan civic movement, Komitet Obrony Demokracji (KOD - Committee for the Defence of Democracy). KOD has cross-party opposition support but demonstrators have included Duda and PiS voters. An opinion poll by Ibris on 15 December put support for the government at 27%, sharply down from its election high.On Wednesday, the KOD leader, Mateusz Kijowski, presented the outline of a compromise \u201cexit strategy\u201d at a press conference in Warsaw. Kijowski said KOD would draft its own \u201cconciliatory\u201d bill on the constitutional tribunal, raise a petition and present it to parliament. Kijowski said: \u201cAt the same time we appeal to the president, who took the oath to uphold the constitution, not to sign yesterday\u2019s bill before considering its serious implications.\u201dJacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, a Warsaw thinktank, said: \u201cLast time Law and Justice was in power, in 2005-07, this court stood in the way of many of its ambitions.

The strategic area includes Hitler\u2019s command post at the grandiose Ksiaz Castle (formerly known as F\u00fcrstenstein) and Project Riese, a suspected secret weapons programme. Project Riese was a network of underground tunnels and chambers dug out beneath the Owl Mountains by an estimated 30,000 prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners. The earth embankment that will be surveyed this week by teams including one from Krakow\u2019s mining academy rises up alongside the existing Wroclaw-Walbrzych railway line. It will be checked with magnetic field detectors, thermal imaging cameras and radars. The site, on the outskirts of Walbrzych, has been under police guard since August when Koper and his friend, German-born Andreas Richter, showed the authorities images they had taken with a \u00a37,000 ground-penetrating radar kit. \u201cFour years ago, we were given information by a witness who was in Walbrzych at the time the train disappeared in April 1945. Radar technology has become affordable so we were able to check the information,\u201d said Koper, who would not reveal if he knew anything about the hiding places of the other two supposed trains. \u201cThe Nazis dug out the embankment, created a junction and laid track to divert the train off to the side. Then they parked the train, which is 90 metres long, removed the rails and put back the soil.\u201dSince August, the Polish military has cleared vegetation from an area the size of a football pitch. Soldiers have swept for mines and analysed the ground for the presence of poison gas. During the holocaust, Zyklon B \u2013 for use in gas chambers \u2013 is believed to have been transported on the line. The treasure hunters\u2019 images show only the outline of what appears to be a train. \u201cWe do not know what is inside, only that it is armoured, which suggests a precious cargo,\u201d said Koper. \u201cThere could be gold but that is not what interests us. In fact, we were looking for a tunnel when we found the train.\u201d The men have hired a lawyer and applied to the Polish treasury for a reward of 10% of the eventual value of the train and its contents. \u201cWe have worked for four years to get to the bottom of legends that have flown around our city for 70 years. It has become a fascination,\u201d said Koper, who added that he and Richter were well out of pocket for having self-funded all their research. But others in Walbrzych, a depressed coal mining town with smog-stained blocks of flats and 20% unemployment, are already cashing in. Initial reports of the discovery, in August, brought a stream of tourists bearing metal detectors. Walbrzych now has a Gold Train Car Wash, a Gold Train Skoda dealership and a line in souvenirs including fridge magnets, stickers, bags and gold ingot paperweights. At the city\u2019s museum, there is a waiting list for gold train mugs.\u201cI\u2019m no Indiana Jones,\u201d said the district governor, Jacek Cichura, \u201cbut my colleagues in the rest of Poland now call me the gold governor. We are in a special economic zone. Life is tough. The young people are leaving to work abroad. But the gold train has brought a tourism boom.\u201d The influx of visitors is being felt across the district - from the towering Ksiaz Castle to the mist-clad Owl Mountains 10 miles (15km) to the south. According to local legend, the F\u00fchrer\u2019s castle lair is linked by at least one secret tunnel to Walbrzych and onwards to Project Riese\u2019s underground network. Riese means giant in German, and this was where Hitler\u2019s Wunderwaffe (magic weapons) were supposedly under development.It is unclear to what extent the underground mega city and arms factory actually functioned and how much of what we know is simply surviving propaganda. But for the past 12 years, carpenter Krzysztof Szpakowski, 56, has dowsed his way to uncovering thousands of metres of passages dynamited into the pine-clad Owl Mountains. Some tunnels are flooded but in others he has found German machine guns and prisoner-of-war graffiti. An eclectic mix of visitors \u2013 from militaria maniacs to bat fanciers \u2013 sign up for his guided tours. But Szpakowski himself has the exploration bug.

But to the dismay of women\u2019s rights activists, no protests greeted the government\u2019s first concrete policy move \u2013 to scrap subsidies for IVF in public hospitals. Since the Law & Justice party gained an absolute majority in parliament in October, it has not fully declared that it will ban abortion but its MPs attempted the move under the previous coalition with the centrist Civic Platform party.The avowed feminist politician Barbara Nowacka, leader of the United Left coalition, called for defenders of the constitution to embrace women\u2019s rights. \u201cThe defence of democracy and equality go together. Poland has taken several steps backwards in the past couple of weeks. Issues such as women\u2019s equality and LGBT rights seem suddenly to have been cancelled as unimportant.\u201d Law & Justice triumphed in the elections on a mix of social and nationalistic promises: hostility to migrants, pledging to stand up to exploitative foreign investors and banks, reducing the retirement age and introducing a 500 z\u0142oty (\u00a386) a month child grant. Crucially, the campaign had the blessing of conservative bishops.\u201cIt\u2019s payback time for the church,\u201d said Jacek Kucharczyk of the Institute of Public Affairs. \u201cLaw & Justice swept up the armies of people who had stood on church steps for eight years, bearing petitions against abortion and IVF. They were part of the church\u2019s campaign against what it sees as morally regressive so-called gender ideology, perceived as being imposed by western Europe.\u201d Law & Justice\u2019s success at conflating Europe with moral decay creates a difficult challenge for rights activists whose strongest weapons are often international treaties. Among the government\u2019s ambitions is to withdraw from the Council of Europe\u2019s convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, known as the Istanbul convention.Women\u2019s leaders want to regain lost ground. In a special joint communique entitled Congress of Women against Law & Justice, activists denounce a ruling party that \u201cevokes the stereotype of the traditional role of women and seeks to limit the autonomy and freedom of women\u201d. The congress, one of the largest women\u2019s associations in eastern Europe, says it intends to launch an ongoing audit of the government\u2019s record on human rights. It will focus on the promised child grant, which it fears could negatively affect existing means-tested benefits for poorer women. Congress committee member Agnieszka Graff said: \u201cThe general philosophy [of Law and Justice] is the rejection of individual rights in favour of family rights. Abortion is high on the list. It would be banned even in the case of rape. There is speculation that the government is looking at introducing a three-year prison sentence for doctors who perform illegal abortions.\u201cThere will be moves against gender studies in universities and a clampdown against schools that try to offer sex education. Subsidised cultural institutions will be very exposed.\u201d An early signal was sent in November, when the culture minister tried to ban a \u201cpornographic\u201d production of a play by the feminist writer Elfriede Jelinek.

The strategic area includes Hitler\u2019s command post at the grandiose Ksiaz Castle (formerly known as F\u00fcrstenstein) and Project Riese, a suspected secret weapons programme. Project Riese was a network of underground tunnels and chambers dug out beneath the Owl Mountains by an estimated 30,000 prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners. The earth embankment that will be surveyed this week by teams including one from Krakow\u2019s mining academy rises up alongside the existing Wroclaw-Walbrzych railway line. It will be checked with magnetic field detectors, thermal imaging cameras and radars. The site, on the outskirts of Walbrzych, has been under police guard since August when Koper and his friend, German-born Andreas Richter, showed the authorities images they had taken with a \u00a37,000 ground-penetrating radar kit. \u201cFour years ago, we were given information by a witness who was in Walbrzych at the time the train disappeared in April 1945. Radar technology has become affordable so we were able to check the information,\u201d said Koper, who would not reveal if he knew anything about the hiding places of the other two supposed trains. \u201cThe Nazis dug out the embankment, created a junction and laid track to divert the train off to the side. Then they parked the train, which is 90 metres long, removed the rails and put back the soil.\u201dSince August, the Polish military has cleared vegetation from an area the size of a football pitch. Soldiers have swept for mines and analysed the ground for the presence of poison gas. During the holocaust, Zyklon B \u2013 for use in gas chambers \u2013 is believed to have been transported on the line. The treasure hunters\u2019 images show only the outline of what appears to be a train. \u201cWe do not know what is inside, only that it is armoured, which suggests a precious cargo,\u201d said Koper. \u201cThere could be gold but that is not what interests us. In fact, we were looking for a tunnel when we found the train.\u201d The men have hired a lawyer and applied to the Polish treasury for a reward of 10% of the eventual value of the train and its contents. \u201cWe have worked for four years to get to the bottom of legends that have flown around our city for 70 years. It has become a fascination,\u201d said Koper, who added that he and Richter were well out of pocket for having self-funded all their research. But others in Walbrzych, a depressed coal mining town with smog-stained blocks of flats and 20% unemployment, are already cashing in. Initial reports of the discovery, in August, brought a stream of tourists bearing metal detectors. Walbrzych now has a Gold Train Car Wash, a Gold Train Skoda dealership and a line in souvenirs including fridge magnets, stickers, bags and gold ingot paperweights. At the city\u2019s museum, there is a waiting list for gold train mugs.\u201cI\u2019m no Indiana Jones,\u201d said the district governor, Jacek Cichura, \u201cbut my colleagues in the rest of Poland now call me the gold governor. We are in a special economic zone. Life is tough. The young people are leaving to work abroad. But the gold train has brought a tourism boom.\u201d The influx of visitors is being felt across the district - from the towering Ksiaz Castle to the mist-clad Owl Mountains 10 miles (15km) to the south. According to local legend, the F\u00fchrer\u2019s castle lair is linked by at least one secret tunnel to Walbrzych and onwards to Project Riese\u2019s underground network. Riese means giant in German, and this was where Hitler\u2019s Wunderwaffe (magic weapons) were supposedly under development.It is unclear to what extent the underground mega city and arms factory actually functioned and how much of what we know is simply surviving propaganda. But for the past 12 years, carpenter Krzysztof Szpakowski, 56, has dowsed his way to uncovering thousands of metres of passages dynamited into the pine-clad Owl Mountains. Some tunnels are flooded but in others he has found German machine guns and prisoner-of-war graffiti. An eclectic mix of visitors \u2013 from militaria maniacs to bat fanciers \u2013 sign up for his guided tours. But Szpakowski himself has the exploration bug. He broke his arm last week when he slipped in one of the Riese\u2019s dank, eerie tunnels. \u201cThis was a closed military area \u2013 first Russian, then Polish \u2013 until 1991.

Critics say the move will slow down the court and is intended to force it to include the five new judges, who are seen as close to PiS, or leave it unable to pass rulings.PiS gained an absolute majority in the 25 October parliamentary elections, five months after Duda, who is also from the party, was elected. It is the first time since the end of communism that Poland has been ruled by a single party.But critics say PiS has a hardline agenda, similar to that of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. In its first weeks in government, PiS removed the provision of IVF under the national health system. Laws currently in parliament include anti-terror legislation that critics say will curtail freedom of movement and expression.Opposition politician Barbara Nowacka, the leader of the United Left coalition, said: \u201cThis is only the beginning.

The Polish government will have to listen to those threats and, through them, could perhaps be forced to see reason.\u2019\u2019Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza quoted US sources saying Barack Obama had objections and had let it be known he would delay meeting Duda.

It will focus on the promised child grant, which it fears could negatively affect existing means-tested benefits for poorer women.

It would be banned even in the case of rape.

The strategic area includes Hitler\u2019s command post at the grandiose Ksiaz Castle (formerly known as F\u00fcrstenstein) and Project Riese, a suspected secret weapons programme. Project Riese was a network of underground tunnels and chambers dug out beneath the Owl Mountains by an estimated 30,000 prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners. The earth embankment that will be surveyed this week by teams including one from Krakow\u2019s mining academy rises up alongside the existing Wroclaw-Walbrzych railway line. It will be checked with magnetic field detectors, thermal imaging cameras and radars. The site, on the outskirts of Walbrzych, has been under police guard since August when Koper and his friend, German-born Andreas Richter, showed the authorities images they had taken with a \u00a37,000 ground-penetrating radar kit. \u201cFour years ago, we were given information by a witness who was in Walbrzych at the time the train disappeared in April 1945. Radar technology has become affordable so we were able to check the information,\u201d said Koper, who would not reveal if he knew anything about the hiding places of the other two supposed trains. \u201cThe Nazis dug out the embankment, created a junction and laid track to divert the train off to the side. Then they parked the train, which is 90 metres long, removed the rails and put back the soil.\u201dSince August, the Polish military has cleared vegetation from an area the size of a football pitch. Soldiers have swept for mines and analysed the ground for the presence of poison gas. During the holocaust, Zyklon B \u2013 for use in gas chambers \u2013 is believed to have been transported on the line. The treasure hunters\u2019 images show only the outline of what appears to be a train. \u201cWe do not know what is inside, only that it is armoured, which suggests a precious cargo,\u201d said Koper. \u201cThere could be gold but that is not what interests us. In fact, we were looking for a tunnel when we found the train.\u201d The men have hired a lawyer and applied to the Polish treasury for a reward of 10% of the eventual value of the train and its contents. \u201cWe have worked for four years to get to the bottom of legends that have flown around our city for 70 years. It has become a fascination,\u201d said Koper, who added that he and Richter were well out of pocket for having self-funded all their research. But others in Walbrzych, a depressed coal mining town with smog-stained blocks of flats and 20% unemployment, are already cashing in. Initial reports of the discovery, in August, brought a stream of tourists bearing metal detectors. Walbrzych now has a Gold Train Car Wash, a Gold Train Skoda dealership and a line in souvenirs including fridge magnets, stickers, bags and gold ingot paperweights. At the city\u2019s museum, there is a waiting list for gold train mugs.\u201cI\u2019m no Indiana Jones,\u201d said the district governor, Jacek Cichura, \u201cbut my colleagues in the rest of Poland now call me the gold governor. We are in a special economic zone. Life is tough. The young people are leaving to work abroad. But the gold train has brought a tourism boom.\u201d The influx of visitors is being felt across the district - from the towering Ksiaz Castle to the mist-clad Owl Mountains 10 miles (15km) to the south. According to local legend, the F\u00fchrer\u2019s castle lair is linked by at least one secret tunnel to Walbrzych and onwards to Project Riese\u2019s underground network. Riese means giant in German, and this was where Hitler\u2019s Wunderwaffe (magic weapons) were supposedly under development.It is unclear to what extent the underground mega city and arms factory actually functioned and how much of what we know is simply surviving propaganda. But for the past 12 years, carpenter Krzysztof Szpakowski, 56, has dowsed his way to uncovering thousands of metres of passages dynamited into the pine-clad Owl Mountains. Some tunnels are flooded but in others he has found German machine guns and prisoner-of-war graffiti. An eclectic mix of visitors \u2013 from militaria maniacs to bat fanciers \u2013 sign up for his guided tours. But Szpakowski himself has the exploration bug. He broke his arm last week when he slipped in one of the Riese\u2019s dank, eerie tunnels. \u201cThis was a closed military area \u2013 first Russian, then Polish \u2013 until 1991. The soldiers were looking for something. When I was a teenager we knew something had gone on here. But there was no one to ask because all the [German] residents were shipped out of the area and replaced by Poles after the Potsdam agreement.\u201d Szpakowski, Koper and Richter collaborate in their treasure-hunting by lending each other equipment. But they have different views of what is on board the \u201cgold train\u201d. Szpakowski believes it contains top-secret strategic equipment. He said: \u201cThe Nazis wanted to develop an atomic bomb. They were working on anti-gravity propulsion. There is something on that train that was intended for Riese. We only know 5% of what went on in this part of the world,\u201d he said.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Second world war", "Nazism"], "title": "'Nazi gold train' investigators start surveying site in Poland"},{"date": "2015-12-28T14:33:26Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The leader of Poland\u2019s new pro-democracy movement said the government has \u201cbroken the country\u201d after the president, Andrzej Duda, enacted a measure critics say could open the path to authoritarian rule.The amendment radically changes how rulings are made by the highest legislative court, the constitutional tribunal, and its signing by Duda follows warnings from the European Union and nationwide street protests.

Critics say the move will slow down the court and is intended to force it to include the five new judges, who are seen as close to PiS, or leave it unable to pass rulings.PiS gained an absolute majority in the 25 October parliamentary elections, five months after Duda, who is also from the party, was elected. It is the first time since the end of communism that Poland has been ruled by a single party.But critics say PiS has a hardline agenda, similar to that of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.

But I was lucky; for those who live further from the hills, getting into snowsports can be even harder. It can involve paying a small fortune for flights, transfers, accommodation and lift pass \u2013 just to spend all week on the lower slopes, watching others head for the peaks. For this reason, it\u2019s wise to avoid super-resorts when you\u2019re only looking to pick up the basics.On a recent visit to Zakopane, at the foot of the Tatra mountain range in southern Poland, I discovered what may well be the ideal destination for beginners. Sorry Scotland!My cheap flight to Krakow got me within two hours\u2019 drive of the resort, where the guys from WhiteSide Holidays (one week from \u00a3389pp with lift pass, transfers, lessons, ski hire and self-catering accommodation) met me for the last leg. They\u2019re on hand all week to shuttle guests among the many small resorts that surround the town, sometimes ticking off two in a day.As most offered pay-as-you-go lift passes, we only paid for the runs we did. A full day of fast laps would still be a bargain for experienced skiers, and beginners would pay just a fraction of what they might in a mainstream resort.The slopes were well-groomed and unchallenging, with friendly, English-speaking instructors on hand. As experienced snowboarders my friends and I might have got frustrated had it not been for the terrain parks at Wit\u00f3w, Bia\u0142ka Tatrzanska and Gubal\u00f3wka, which were stocked with enough jumps and features to keep us busy. There were steeper slopes, too, at Kasprowy Wierch.Unless you want out-and-out luxury, Zakopane rivals any resort in Europe for off-the-hill charm. It\u2019s impossible not to be taken by the region\u2019s unique dress, folk music and cuisine. Like everything else in Zakopane, eating out was an absolute bargain, and we took full advantage of the low bar prices too; thanks to those pay-as-you-go lift passes, there was no need to feel guilty about the late start next morning \u2026\u2022 Andrew Duthie is deputy editor of Whitelines magazine", "tags": ["Ski resorts", "Skiing holidays", "Poland holidays", "Snowboarding", "Travel", "Europe holidays"], "title": "The perfect beginners\u2019 ski resort: Zakopane, Poland"},{"date": "2015-12-23T17:05:38Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, the leader of Poland\u2019s Solidarity movement in the 1980s, has warned democracy is at risk after the country\u2019s rightwing governing party sought to curb the power of the constitutional court.Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who served as president for five years after the fall of communism, called for a referendum to reverse a law passed on Tuesday night by the Law and Justice party (PiS). That law would require the constitutional tribunal reach a two-thirds majority to issue rulings and block legislation, raising the bar from a simple majority. Thirteen of its 15 judges would have to be present for contentious cases, rather than nine as at present.

Crucially, the campaign had the blessing of conservative bishops.\u201cIt\u2019s payback time for the church,\u201d said Jacek Kucharczyk of the Institute of Public Affairs. \u201cLaw & Justice swept up the armies of people who had stood on church steps for eight years, bearing petitions against abortion and IVF. They were part of the church\u2019s campaign against what it sees as morally regressive so-called gender ideology, perceived as being imposed by western Europe.\u201d Law & Justice\u2019s success at conflating Europe with moral decay creates a difficult challenge for rights activists whose strongest weapons are often international treaties. Among the government\u2019s ambitions is to withdraw from the Council of Europe\u2019s convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, known as the Istanbul convention.Women\u2019s leaders want to regain lost ground. In a special joint communique entitled Congress of Women against Law & Justice, activists denounce a ruling party that \u201cevokes the stereotype of the traditional role of women and seeks to limit the autonomy and freedom of women\u201d. The congress, one of the largest women\u2019s associations in eastern Europe, says it intends to launch an ongoing audit of the government\u2019s record on human rights. It will focus on the promised child grant, which it fears could negatively affect existing means-tested benefits for poorer women. Congress committee member Agnieszka Graff said: \u201cThe general philosophy [of Law and Justice] is the rejection of individual rights in favour of family rights. Abortion is high on the list. It would be banned even in the case of rape. There is speculation that the government is looking at introducing a three-year prison sentence for doctors who perform illegal abortions.\u201cThere will be moves against gender studies in universities and a clampdown against schools that try to offer sex education. Subsidised cultural institutions will be very exposed.\u201d An early signal was sent in November, when the culture minister tried to ban a \u201cpornographic\u201d production of a play by the feminist writer Elfriede Jelinek.

The strategic area includes Hitler\u2019s command post at the grandiose Ksiaz Castle (formerly known as F\u00fcrstenstein) and Project Riese, a suspected secret weapons programme. Project Riese was a network of underground tunnels and chambers dug out beneath the Owl Mountains by an estimated 30,000 prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners. The earth embankment that will be surveyed this week by teams including one from Krakow\u2019s mining academy rises up alongside the existing Wroclaw-Walbrzych railway line. It will be checked with magnetic field detectors, thermal imaging cameras and radars. The site, on the outskirts of Walbrzych, has been under police guard since August when Koper and his friend, German-born Andreas Richter, showed the authorities images they had taken with a \u00a37,000 ground-penetrating radar kit. \u201cFour years ago, we were given information by a witness who was in Walbrzych at the time the train disappeared in April 1945. Radar technology has become affordable so we were able to check the information,\u201d said Koper, who would not reveal if he knew anything about the hiding places of the other two supposed trains. \u201cThe Nazis dug out the embankment, created a junction and laid track to divert the train off to the side. Then they parked the train, which is 90 metres long, removed the rails and put back the soil.\u201dSince August, the Polish military has cleared vegetation from an area the size of a football pitch. Soldiers have swept for mines and analysed the ground for the presence of poison gas. During the holocaust, Zyklon B \u2013 for use in gas chambers \u2013 is believed to have been transported on the line. The treasure hunters\u2019 images show only the outline of what appears to be a train. \u201cWe do not know what is inside, only that it is armoured, which suggests a precious cargo,\u201d said Koper. \u201cThere could be gold but that is not what interests us. In fact, we were looking for a tunnel when we found the train.\u201d The men have hired a lawyer and applied to the Polish treasury for a reward of 10% of the eventual value of the train and its contents. \u201cWe have worked for four years to get to the bottom of legends that have flown around our city for 70 years. It has become a fascination,\u201d said Koper, who added that he and Richter were well out of pocket for having self-funded all their research. But others in Walbrzych, a depressed coal mining town with smog-stained blocks of flats and 20% unemployment, are already cashing in. Initial reports of the discovery, in August, brought a stream of tourists bearing metal detectors. Walbrzych now has a Gold Train Car Wash, a Gold Train Skoda dealership and a line in souvenirs including fridge magnets, stickers, bags and gold ingot paperweights. At the city\u2019s museum, there is a waiting list for gold train mugs.\u201cI\u2019m no Indiana Jones,\u201d said the district governor, Jacek Cichura, \u201cbut my colleagues in the rest of Poland now call me the gold governor. We are in a special economic zone. Life is tough. The young people are leaving to work abroad. But the gold train has brought a tourism boom.\u201d The influx of visitors is being felt across the district - from the towering Ksiaz Castle to the mist-clad Owl Mountains 10 miles (15km) to the south. According to local legend, the F\u00fchrer\u2019s castle lair is linked by at least one secret tunnel to Walbrzych and onwards to Project Riese\u2019s underground network. Riese means giant in German, and this was where Hitler\u2019s Wunderwaffe (magic weapons) were supposedly under development.It is unclear to what extent the underground mega city and arms factory actually functioned and how much of what we know is simply surviving propaganda. But for the past 12 years, carpenter Krzysztof Szpakowski, 56, has dowsed his way to uncovering thousands of metres of passages dynamited into the pine-clad Owl Mountains. Some tunnels are flooded but in others he has found German machine guns and prisoner-of-war graffiti. An eclectic mix of visitors \u2013 from militaria maniacs to bat fanciers \u2013 sign up for his guided tours. But Szpakowski himself has the exploration bug. He broke his arm last week when he slipped in one of the Riese\u2019s dank, eerie tunnels. \u201cThis was a closed military area \u2013 first Russian, then Polish \u2013 until 1991. The soldiers were looking for something. When I was a teenager we knew something had gone on here. But there was no one to ask because all the [German] residents were shipped out of the area and replaced by Poles after the Potsdam agreement.\u201d Szpakowski, Koper and Richter collaborate in their treasure-hunting by lending each other equipment. But they have different views of what is on board the \u201cgold train\u201d. Szpakowski believes it contains top-secret strategic equipment. He said: \u201cThe Nazis wanted to develop an atomic bomb. They were working on anti-gravity propulsion. There is something on that train that was intended for Riese. We only know 5% of what went on in this part of the world,\u201d he said.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Second world war", "Nazism"], "title": "'Nazi gold train' investigators start surveying site in Poland"},{"date": "2015-12-28T14:33:26Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The leader of Poland\u2019s new pro-democracy movement said the government has \u201cbroken the country\u201d after the president, Andrzej Duda, enacted a measure critics say could open the path to authoritarian rule.The amendment radically changes how rulings are made by the highest legislative court, the constitutional tribunal, and its signing by Duda follows warnings from the European Union and nationwide street protests.

Critics say the move will slow down the court and is intended to force it to include the five new judges, who are seen as close to PiS, or leave it unable to pass rulings.PiS gained an absolute majority in the 25 October parliamentary elections, five months after Duda, who is also from the party, was elected. It is the first time since the end of communism that Poland has been ruled by a single party.But critics say PiS has a hardline agenda, similar to that of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. In its first weeks in government, PiS removed the provision of IVF under the national health system. Laws currently in parliament include anti-terror legislation that critics say will curtail freedom of movement and expression.Opposition politician Barbara Nowacka, the leader of the United Left coalition, said: \u201cThis is only the beginning.

But if they came, the situation would worsen for the unskilled people who are here now,\u201d said Krystyna Gorska, 58, a jobcentre clerk.Polish monthly unemployment benefits range from 522 z\u0142oty (\u00a3104) to 997 z\u0142oty, depending on the jobseeker\u2019s circumstances. On Wednesday, Gorska had two job offers on her desk, one from the Mlekpol dairy for a machine operator, and another from a farm. The monthly salaries, she thought, were about 3,000 z\u0142oty.\u201cWe may be able to find a machine operator for Mlekpol but we will not be able to fill the farm job, which requires a graduate from an agriculture college,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no shortage of unskilled workers in this town but those with skills have left.\u201d Among them is Gorska\u2019s 34-year-old cousin, who works as a factory supervisor in a town in the UK, the name of which she cannot remember. \u201cShe went on a visit seven years ago and stayed. She quickly learned English. Now she has a baby. She would easily find a job in Poland now.

On Monday morning, the latest Ipsos poll gave the Law and Justice party 37.7% and Civic Platform 23.6%.Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, Law and Justice\u2019s chairman and the twin brother of Poland\u2019s late president Lech, immediately declared victory. Speaking to supporters at his party headquarters in central Warsaw, a triumphant Kaczynski said: \u201cWe will not kick those who have fallen... We need to show that Polish public life can be different.\u201dIf the latest polling is confirmed, the result would give Law and Justice 232 seats in the 460-member lower house of parliament, meaning the party could govern alone and that its lead candidate, 52-year-old Beata Szyd\u0142o, is likely to be appointed prime minister.Distrustful of Germany and the EU, Law and Justice wants more sovereign control and believes a strong Nato hand is required to deal with Russia. The party promises more welfare spending, a lower retirement age and new taxes on foreign banks.Szyd\u0142o has also campaigned against the EU forcing member states to accept a set number of refugees from the Middle East and north Africa. The British prime minister, David Cameron, has in the past expressed support for Law and Justice and has included his Conservative party in the same European parliamentary grouping, but the Polish shift to the right may not necessarily be supportive of his efforts to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU. Two million Poles working abroad \u2013 including an estimated 700,000 in Britain \u2013 depend on the freedom of movement the EU allows. Polish Euroscepticism is also different from the British variety. It feeds to some degree on frustrations over sovereign influence and the economic dominance of neighbouring Germany, but for the large part it is linked to the country\u2019s conservative family values and worry over gender politics and perceived secularist trends that are seen as undermining the influence of the Catholic church. One Warsaw voter, Ma\u0142gorzata Cyganik, a 37-year-old translator, said she was afraid the election would lead to individual freedoms being curtailed. \u201cThe ideology that is coming into Polish politics [with Law and Justice] is frightening,\u201d she said.

Where have all the Polish businesses gone? We have opened our doors too much and we have lost control of our own economy. We must say stop.\u201dPoland\u2019s economy is expected to grow by 3.5% this year and next, and unemployment recently fell below 10%. Voters, however, have responded favourably to introspective rhetoric and claims that secular and gender politics in the EU, and the multi-ethnicity of western Europe, are a threat to traditional Catholic values and national sovereignty. The governing Civic Platform has never recovered from a 2014 eavesdropping scandal that discredited high-profile government ministers. The Polish electorate is also faced with a left wing that has failed to rebuild itself since the end of communism. It remains a messy mix of greens, socialists, radicals and post-communists who fell short of the 8% of the vote needed to enter parliament. After voting in the Saska K\u0119pa district of Warsaw, the United Left leader, Barbara Nowacka, said she hoped the election would mark a breakthrough for small parties such as hers. \u201cIt looks like Law and Justice will win, but what is even clearer to me is that voters in Poland want change. You see this because of the way voters are capable of moving from one small party to another. They are looking for a credible system change.\u201d  Law and Justice said Szyd\u0142o would be its prime minister if it formed a government, but the party is also strongly associated with the controversial former prime minister Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski.

As experienced snowboarders my friends and I might have got frustrated had it not been for the terrain parks at Wit\u00f3w, Bia\u0142ka Tatrzanska and Gubal\u00f3wka, which were stocked with enough jumps and features to keep us busy.

It\u2019s impossible not to be taken by the region\u2019s unique dress, folk music and cuisine.

Related: Protests in Poland as proposed laws curtail women's rights The PiS government also caused alarm at Nato and in neighbouring Slovakia last week, when it sent military police to raid a Nato-affiliated counter-intelligence centre in Warsaw run in partnership with Slovakia, with the aim of removing its director, who had been appointed by the previous government.In the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s vote, tens of thousands of people joined demonstrations in Polish cities under the banner of a non-partisan civic movement, Komitet Obrony Demokracji (KOD - Committee for the Defence of Democracy). KOD has cross-party opposition support but demonstrators have included Duda and PiS voters. An opinion poll by Ibris on 15 December put support for the government at 27%, sharply down from its election high.On Wednesday, the KOD leader, Mateusz Kijowski, presented the outline of a compromise \u201cexit strategy\u201d at a press conference in Warsaw. Kijowski said KOD would draft its own \u201cconciliatory\u201d bill on the constitutional tribunal, raise a petition and present it to parliament. Kijowski said: \u201cAt the same time we appeal to the president, who took the oath to uphold the constitution, not to sign yesterday\u2019s bill before considering its serious implications.\u201dJacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, a Warsaw thinktank, said: \u201cLast time Law and Justice was in power, in 2005-07, this court stood in the way of many of its ambitions. The government\u2019s ability to ignore the tribunal\u2019s own rulings, as it did twice in November, and operate out-of-hours, is worrying. The government plans legislation with implications for human rights. It includes a so-called \u2018anti-terror\u2019 law that could curtail free speech and the right of assembly \u2026 the constitutional tribunal, rendered partisan and slow, will simply be ineffectual.\u2019\u2019A further worrying sign for human rights defenders in Poland came after a street protest against immigration on 18 November in Wroc\u0142aw. Even though the Polish constitution bans hate crimes, no official condemnation was made after extremists from the Ob\u00f3z Narodowo-Radykalny (National Radical Camp) burned an effigy of a Hassidic Jew holding an EU flag. Rafa\u0142 Pa\u0144kowski of the Never Again association said: \u201cThe lack of condemnation of an incident like this, and the fact that police simply stood and watched, makes groups like ONR feel empowered. This year in Poland we have registered more hate crimes against minorities than at any time in our 20-year history as an association.\u2019\u2019 ", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Human rights", "Law", "European Union"], "title": "Poland: Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa warns against 'undemocratic' curbs on court"},{"date": "2015-12-23T12:57:09Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Campaigners are planning to step up resistance to Poland\u2019s ultra-conservative government after it cleared a constitutional path for hardline law changes, expected to include a total ban on abortion and curbs to gender and human rights.Tens of thousands joined mass demonstrations in the run-up to the law change, which would curtail the independence of the constitutional tribunal \u2013 the country\u2019s highest legislative court. But to the dismay of women\u2019s rights activists, no protests greeted the government\u2019s first concrete policy move \u2013 to scrap subsidies for IVF in public hospitals. Since the Law & Justice party gained an absolute majority in parliament in October, it has not fully declared that it will ban abortion but its MPs attempted the move under the previous coalition with the centrist Civic Platform party.The avowed feminist politician Barbara Nowacka, leader of the United Left coalition, called for defenders of the constitution to embrace women\u2019s rights. \u201cThe defence of democracy and equality go together. Poland has taken several steps backwards in the past couple of weeks. Issues such as women\u2019s equality and LGBT rights seem suddenly to have been cancelled as unimportant.\u201d Law & Justice triumphed in the elections on a mix of social and nationalistic promises: hostility to migrants, pledging to stand up to exploitative foreign investors and banks, reducing the retirement age and introducing a 500 z\u0142oty (\u00a386) a month child grant. Crucially, the campaign had the blessing of conservative bishops.\u201cIt\u2019s payback time for the church,\u201d said Jacek Kucharczyk of the Institute of Public Affairs. \u201cLaw & Justice swept up the armies of people who had stood on church steps for eight years, bearing petitions against abortion and IVF. They were part of the church\u2019s campaign against what it sees as morally regressive so-called gender ideology, perceived as being imposed by western Europe.\u201d Law & Justice\u2019s success at conflating Europe with moral decay creates a difficult challenge for rights activists whose strongest weapons are often international treaties. Among the government\u2019s ambitions is to withdraw from the Council of Europe\u2019s convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, known as the Istanbul convention.Women\u2019s leaders want to regain lost ground. In a special joint communique entitled Congress of Women against Law & Justice, activists denounce a ruling party that \u201cevokes the stereotype of the traditional role of women and seeks to limit the autonomy and freedom of women\u201d. The congress, one of the largest women\u2019s associations in eastern Europe, says it intends to launch an ongoing audit of the government\u2019s record on human rights. It will focus on the promised child grant, which it fears could negatively affect existing means-tested benefits for poorer women. Congress committee member Agnieszka Graff said: \u201cThe general philosophy [of Law and Justice] is the rejection of individual rights in favour of family rights. Abortion is high on the list. It would be banned even in the case of rape. There is speculation that the government is looking at introducing a three-year prison sentence for doctors who perform illegal abortions.\u201cThere will be moves against gender studies in universities and a clampdown against schools that try to offer sex education. Subsidised cultural institutions will be very exposed.\u201d An early signal was sent in November, when the culture minister tried to ban a \u201cpornographic\u201d production of a play by the feminist writer Elfriede Jelinek.

The strategic area includes Hitler\u2019s command post at the grandiose Ksiaz Castle (formerly known as F\u00fcrstenstein) and Project Riese, a suspected secret weapons programme. Project Riese was a network of underground tunnels and chambers dug out beneath the Owl Mountains by an estimated 30,000 prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners. The earth embankment that will be surveyed this week by teams including one from Krakow\u2019s mining academy rises up alongside the existing Wroclaw-Walbrzych railway line. It will be checked with magnetic field detectors, thermal imaging cameras and radars. The site, on the outskirts of Walbrzych, has been under police guard since August when Koper and his friend, German-born Andreas Richter, showed the authorities images they had taken with a \u00a37,000 ground-penetrating radar kit. \u201cFour years ago, we were given information by a witness who was in Walbrzych at the time the train disappeared in April 1945. Radar technology has become affordable so we were able to check the information,\u201d said Koper, who would not reveal if he knew anything about the hiding places of the other two supposed trains. \u201cThe Nazis dug out the embankment, created a junction and laid track to divert the train off to the side. Then they parked the train, which is 90 metres long, removed the rails and put back the soil.\u201dSince August, the Polish military has cleared vegetation from an area the size of a football pitch. Soldiers have swept for mines and analysed the ground for the presence of poison gas. During the holocaust, Zyklon B \u2013 for use in gas chambers \u2013 is believed to have been transported on the line. The treasure hunters\u2019 images show only the outline of what appears to be a train. \u201cWe do not know what is inside, only that it is armoured, which suggests a precious cargo,\u201d said Koper. \u201cThere could be gold but that is not what interests us. In fact, we were looking for a tunnel when we found the train.\u201d The men have hired a lawyer and applied to the Polish treasury for a reward of 10% of the eventual value of the train and its contents. \u201cWe have worked for four years to get to the bottom of legends that have flown around our city for 70 years. It has become a fascination,\u201d said Koper, who added that he and Richter were well out of pocket for having self-funded all their research. But others in Walbrzych, a depressed coal mining town with smog-stained blocks of flats and 20% unemployment, are already cashing in. Initial reports of the discovery, in August, brought a stream of tourists bearing metal detectors. Walbrzych now has a Gold Train Car Wash, a Gold Train Skoda dealership and a line in souvenirs including fridge magnets, stickers, bags and gold ingot paperweights. At the city\u2019s museum, there is a waiting list for gold train mugs.\u201cI\u2019m no Indiana Jones,\u201d said the district governor, Jacek Cichura, \u201cbut my colleagues in the rest of Poland now call me the gold governor. We are in a special economic zone. Life is tough. The young people are leaving to work abroad. But the gold train has brought a tourism boom.\u201d The influx of visitors is being felt across the district - from the towering Ksiaz Castle to the mist-clad Owl Mountains 10 miles (15km) to the south. According to local legend, the F\u00fchrer\u2019s castle lair is linked by at least one secret tunnel to Walbrzych and onwards to Project Riese\u2019s underground network. Riese means giant in German, and this was where Hitler\u2019s Wunderwaffe (magic weapons) were supposedly under development.It is unclear to what extent the underground mega city and arms factory actually functioned and how much of what we know is simply surviving propaganda. But for the past 12 years, carpenter Krzysztof Szpakowski, 56, has dowsed his way to uncovering thousands of metres of passages dynamited into the pine-clad Owl Mountains. Some tunnels are flooded but in others he has found German machine guns and prisoner-of-war graffiti. An eclectic mix of visitors \u2013 from militaria maniacs to bat fanciers \u2013 sign up for his guided tours. But Szpakowski himself has the exploration bug. He broke his arm last week when he slipped in one of the Riese\u2019s dank, eerie tunnels. \u201cThis was a closed military area \u2013 first Russian, then Polish \u2013 until 1991. The soldiers were looking for something. When I was a teenager we knew something had gone on here. But there was no one to ask because all the [German] residents were shipped out of the area and replaced by Poles after the Potsdam agreement.\u201d Szpakowski, Koper and Richter collaborate in their treasure-hunting by lending each other equipment. But they have different views of what is on board the \u201cgold train\u201d. Szpakowski believes it contains top-secret strategic equipment. He said: \u201cThe Nazis wanted to develop an atomic bomb. They were working on anti-gravity propulsion. There is something on that train that was intended for Riese. We only know 5% of what went on in this part of the world,\u201d he said.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Second world war", "Nazism"], "title": "'Nazi gold train' investigators start surveying site in Poland"},{"date": "2015-12-28T14:33:26Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The leader of Poland\u2019s new pro-democracy movement said the government has \u201cbroken the country\u201d after the president, Andrzej Duda, enacted a measure critics say could open the path to authoritarian rule.The amendment radically changes how rulings are made by the highest legislative court, the constitutional tribunal, and its signing by Duda follows warnings from the European Union and nationwide street protests.

Critics say the move will slow down the court and is intended to force it to include the five new judges, who are seen as close to PiS, or leave it unable to pass rulings.PiS gained an absolute majority in the 25 October parliamentary elections, five months after Duda, who is also from the party, was elected. It is the first time since the end of communism that Poland has been ruled by a single party.But critics say PiS has a hardline agenda, similar to that of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. In its first weeks in government, PiS removed the provision of IVF under the national health system.

But if they came, the situation would worsen for the unskilled people who are here now,\u201d said Krystyna Gorska, 58, a jobcentre clerk.Polish monthly unemployment benefits range from 522 z\u0142oty (\u00a3104) to 997 z\u0142oty, depending on the jobseeker\u2019s circumstances. On Wednesday, Gorska had two job offers on her desk, one from the Mlekpol dairy for a machine operator, and another from a farm. The monthly salaries, she thought, were about 3,000 z\u0142oty.\u201cWe may be able to find a machine operator for Mlekpol but we will not be able to fill the farm job, which requires a graduate from an agriculture college,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no shortage of unskilled workers in this town but those with skills have left.\u201d Among them is Gorska\u2019s 34-year-old cousin, who works as a factory supervisor in a town in the UK, the name of which she cannot remember. \u201cShe went on a visit seven years ago and stayed.

On Monday morning, the latest Ipsos poll gave the Law and Justice party 37.7% and Civic Platform 23.6%.Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, Law and Justice\u2019s chairman and the twin brother of Poland\u2019s late president Lech, immediately declared victory. Speaking to supporters at his party headquarters in central Warsaw, a triumphant Kaczynski said: \u201cWe will not kick those who have fallen... We need to show that Polish public life can be different.\u201dIf the latest polling is confirmed, the result would give Law and Justice 232 seats in the 460-member lower house of parliament, meaning the party could govern alone and that its lead candidate, 52-year-old Beata Szyd\u0142o, is likely to be appointed prime minister.Distrustful of Germany and the EU, Law and Justice wants more sovereign control and believes a strong Nato hand is required to deal with Russia. The party promises more welfare spending, a lower retirement age and new taxes on foreign banks.Szyd\u0142o has also campaigned against the EU forcing member states to accept a set number of refugees from the Middle East and north Africa. The British prime minister, David Cameron, has in the past expressed support for Law and Justice and has included his Conservative party in the same European parliamentary grouping, but the Polish shift to the right may not necessarily be supportive of his efforts to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU. Two million Poles working abroad \u2013 including an estimated 700,000 in Britain \u2013 depend on the freedom of movement the EU allows. Polish Euroscepticism is also different from the British variety. It feeds to some degree on frustrations over sovereign influence and the economic dominance of neighbouring Germany, but for the large part it is linked to the country\u2019s conservative family values and worry over gender politics and perceived secularist trends that are seen as undermining the influence of the Catholic church. One Warsaw voter, Ma\u0142gorzata Cyganik, a 37-year-old translator, said she was afraid the election would lead to individual freedoms being curtailed. \u201cThe ideology that is coming into Polish politics [with Law and Justice] is frightening,\u201d she said.

Where have all the Polish businesses gone? We have opened our doors too much and we have lost control of our own economy. We must say stop.\u201dPoland\u2019s economy is expected to grow by 3.5% this year and next, and unemployment recently fell below 10%. Voters, however, have responded favourably to introspective rhetoric and claims that secular and gender politics in the EU, and the multi-ethnicity of western Europe, are a threat to traditional Catholic values and national sovereignty. The governing Civic Platform has never recovered from a 2014 eavesdropping scandal that discredited high-profile government ministers. The Polish electorate is also faced with a left wing that has failed to rebuild itself since the end of communism. It remains a messy mix of greens, socialists, radicals and post-communists who fell short of the 8% of the vote needed to enter parliament. After voting in the Saska K\u0119pa district of Warsaw, the United Left leader, Barbara Nowacka, said she hoped the election would mark a breakthrough for small parties such as hers. \u201cIt looks like Law and Justice will win, but what is even clearer to me is that voters in Poland want change. You see this because of the way voters are capable of moving from one small party to another. They are looking for a credible system change.\u201d  Law and Justice said Szyd\u0142o would be its prime minister if it formed a government, but the party is also strongly associated with the controversial former prime minister Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski.

After losing parliamentary elections in 2011, Kaczy\u0144ski vowed: \u201cOne day, we will have a Budapest in Warsaw.\u201d Today, the party says if it wins power it will ensure children receive \u201cmore patriotic upbringing\u201d in schools and the role of public media will be to \u201cbuild national identity\u201d. Some fear Law and Justice wants to stifle media freedom and limit the judiciary\u2019s independence. Adam Michnik, editor-in-chief of Poland\u2019s largest broadsheet, Gazeta Wyborcza, and one of the country\u2019s most respected journalists, has said he worries about a \u201cPutin-style state\u201d if Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s party wins.Aware of the fear many Poles harbour of him wielding such power, the wily 66-year-old Kaczy\u0144ski has made a mild-mannered MP, Beata Szyd\u0142o, his party\u2019s prime ministerial candidate. However, few in Poland doubt who would really be in charge should Law and Justice take power. Some suggest Szyd\u0142o is just a campaign tactic and will be told to step down for the party leader after a brief stint in office. Kaczy\u0144ski founded Law and Justice in 2001 and has maintained an iron grip on the party ever since. On one occasion, when Szyd\u0142o was asked her opinion about a controversial statement Kaczy\u0144ski had made, she replied: \u201cThe chairman is always right.\u201dBut aside from fears of a heavy-handed Law and Justice on the domestic front, what could be the consequences of the party\u2019s victory for the rest of Europe? David Cameron\u2019s negotiations prior to the UK referendum on EU membership will likely be high on the European agenda in the coming months. In the European parliament, Law and Justice MEPs sit with David Cameron\u2019s Tories in the eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists group. \u201cNo further integration and no more powers for Brussels. This is where Law and Justice and the Tories agree,\u201d said Ma\u0142gorzata Bonikowska, head of the Centre for International Relations.However, regarding freedom of movement within the EU, Cameron cannot expect anything different from the current Polish government\u2019s position. \u201cAny kind of restriction on the free movement of people targeted at citizens from our region is unacceptable and non-negotiable,\u201d said Witold Waszczykowski, a Law and Justice MP tipped as potential foreign minister by Kaczy\u0144ski. No surprise there. The opposition party engages in constant chest-thumping about how uncompromising it is when fighting for Polish interests. Considering Polish citizens would likely be adversely affected by any freedom-of-movement restrictions, Law and Justice can hardly be expected to take a softer stance on this issue than the current government.A Law and Justice victory would result in a Poland that is less oriented towards western Europe than under the current government. \u201cCivic Platform considers Poland part of a western team facing global challenges together. Meanwhile, Law and Justice want to focus on ties within the [central and eastern European] region; after that come ties with western Europe. The US and Russia matter, but as for the rest of the world, they\u2019re not really interested,\u201d said Bonikowska. Related: Fear and xenophobia poison Polish polls Meanwhile, though Polish-German relations are currently at a historic high, they may not stay that way for long. Bonikowska says Law and Justice would pursue a \u201cmore assertive policy towards Berlin\u201d. The party intends to push Germany hard for it to agree to a permanent Nato base in Poland, something Berlin has consistently opposed for fear of provoking Russia, which received assurances in 1997 there would be no Nato military bases in eastern Europe. Waszczykowski says those assurances were given to \u201cYeltsin\u2019s Russia, which was relatively weak and cooperative with the west. Today\u2019s Russia is aggressive and imperialistic, there\u2019s no reason we should respect that agreement.\u201d He insists, though, that his party does not intend to escalate existing tensions with Moscow.But there is a personal element at play as well. In 2010, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, then president of Poland and Jaros\u0142aw\u2019s twin brother, died in a plane crash in Smolensk, Russia, along with 95 other people, including many prominent Law and Justice politicians. At one point, Kaczy\u0144ski said he believed his brother had been assassinated and vowed not to rest till he got to the bottom of the matter. Five years later, Russia has yet to return the plane wreckage to Poland, coming up with one excuse after another. It is quite difficult to imagine this issue not casting a long shadow over Polish-Russian relations under a Law and Justice government.Yet paradoxically a Law and Justice victory in Poland could be good news for Vladimir Putin. It would mean a strengthening of the forces that seek to weaken the EU and an ever more divided Europe. It would also mean an unfortunate triumph for those forces who believe that a more nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-liberal Europe is the way forward.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "A Law and Justice victory in Poland could be good news for Putin | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2015-10-10T06:00:12Z", "country": "poland", "content": "For me, learning to snowboard was a painful process, spent fighting the elements over a bleak weekend at Cairngorm Mountain in the late 1990s. But I was lucky; for those who live further from the hills, getting into snowsports can be even harder. It can involve paying a small fortune for flights, transfers, accommodation and lift pass \u2013 just to spend all week on the lower slopes, watching others head for the peaks. For this reason, it\u2019s wise to avoid super-resorts when you\u2019re only looking to pick up the basics.On a recent visit to Zakopane, at the foot of the Tatra mountain range in southern Poland, I discovered what may well be the ideal destination for beginners. Sorry Scotland!My cheap flight to Krakow got me within two hours\u2019 drive of the resort, where the guys from WhiteSide Holidays (one week from \u00a3389pp with lift pass, transfers, lessons, ski hire and self-catering accommodation) met me for the last leg. They\u2019re on hand all week to shuttle guests among the many small resorts that surround the town, sometimes ticking off two in a day.As most offered pay-as-you-go lift passes, we only paid for the runs we did. A full day of fast laps would still be a bargain for experienced skiers, and beginners would pay just a fraction of what they might in a mainstream resort.The slopes were well-groomed and unchallenging, with friendly, English-speaking instructors on hand. As experienced snowboarders my friends and I might have got frustrated had it not been for the terrain parks at Wit\u00f3w, Bia\u0142ka Tatrzanska and Gubal\u00f3wka, which were stocked with enough jumps and features to keep us busy. There were steeper slopes, too, at Kasprowy Wierch.Unless you want out-and-out luxury, Zakopane rivals any resort in Europe for off-the-hill charm. It\u2019s impossible not to be taken by the region\u2019s unique dress, folk music and cuisine. Like everything else in Zakopane, eating out was an absolute bargain, and we took full advantage of the low bar prices too; thanks to those pay-as-you-go lift passes, there was no need to feel guilty about the late start next morning \u2026\u2022 Andrew Duthie is deputy editor of Whitelines magazine", "tags": ["Ski resorts", "Skiing holidays", "Poland holidays", "Snowboarding", "Travel", "Europe holidays"], "title": "The perfect beginners\u2019 ski resort: Zakopane, Poland"},{"date": "2015-12-23T17:05:38Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa, the leader of Poland\u2019s Solidarity movement in the 1980s, has warned democracy is at risk after the country\u2019s rightwing governing party sought to curb the power of the constitutional court.Wa\u0142\u0119sa, who served as president for five years after the fall of communism, called for a referendum to reverse a law passed on Tuesday night by the Law and Justice party (PiS). That law would require the constitutional tribunal reach a two-thirds majority to issue rulings and block legislation, raising the bar from a simple majority. Thirteen of its 15 judges would have to be present for contentious cases, rather than nine as at present. Related: Poland's government carries through on threat to constitutional court Critics say the law virtually eliminates the court as a check on the power of the government, which controls both houses of parliament after October elections.The PiS-led government was sworn in on 16 November, with Beata Szyd\u0142o as prime minister. But critics say the shots are being called by what they say is the party\u2019s divisive and vindictive chief, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski.\u201cThis government acts against Poland, against our achievements, freedom, democracy, not to mention the fact that it ridicules us in the world,\u201d Wa\u0142\u0119sa told Radio Zet. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to travel abroad.\u201dWa\u0142\u0119sa, now 72, wields little political power but is symbolically important as the embodiment of the Solidarity revolution. His successor as president, Andrzej Duda, a PiS member, came under attack from the opposition for putting party loyalty before the requirements of office. He swore in five PiS appointees to the tribunal in the middle of the night earlier this month.\u201cWe are in an unusual situation where the president is not the president. He is doing the bidding of his party chief rather than putting the interests of the country and of democracy first,\u2019\u2019 said Jakub Stefaniak, spokesman for the Polish People\u2019s party, which has 16 MPs. \u201cHe is neglecting his primary, non-partisan role as the guardian of the constitution.\u2019\u2019 The law also enforces delays of three to six months between the time a request for a ruling is made and a verdict, compared with two weeks at present. In a written opinion on the law, Poland\u2019s supreme court said it interfered with the tribunal\u2019s independence and aimed to hobble its proper functioning. This \u201cpresages huge potential delays and, in fact, the paralysis [of the tribunal]\u201d, the court said.The political crisis has brought thousands of protesters out on the streets against the government\u2019s actions, and critical scrutiny from the EU. Martin Schulz, the European parliament\u2019s president, described PiS\u2019s actions as having the \u201ccharacteristics of a coup\u201d, drawing outrage from the Polish government and demands for an apology, which Schulz refused to give. The European parliament is due to debate the political situation in Poland on 19 January. Related: Protests in Poland as proposed laws curtail women's rights The PiS government also caused alarm at Nato and in neighbouring Slovakia last week, when it sent military police to raid a Nato-affiliated counter-intelligence centre in Warsaw run in partnership with Slovakia, with the aim of removing its director, who had been appointed by the previous government.In the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s vote, tens of thousands of people joined demonstrations in Polish cities under the banner of a non-partisan civic movement, Komitet Obrony Demokracji (KOD - Committee for the Defence of Democracy). KOD has cross-party opposition support but demonstrators have included Duda and PiS voters. An opinion poll by Ibris on 15 December put support for the government at 27%, sharply down from its election high.On Wednesday, the KOD leader, Mateusz Kijowski, presented the outline of a compromise \u201cexit strategy\u201d at a press conference in Warsaw. Kijowski said KOD would draft its own \u201cconciliatory\u201d bill on the constitutional tribunal, raise a petition and present it to parliament. Kijowski said: \u201cAt the same time we appeal to the president, who took the oath to uphold the constitution, not to sign yesterday\u2019s bill before considering its serious implications.\u201dJacek Kucharczyk, president of the Institute of Public Affairs, a Warsaw thinktank, said: \u201cLast time Law and Justice was in power, in 2005-07, this court stood in the way of many of its ambitions. The government\u2019s ability to ignore the tribunal\u2019s own rulings, as it did twice in November, and operate out-of-hours, is worrying. The government plans legislation with implications for human rights. It includes a so-called \u2018anti-terror\u2019 law that could curtail free speech and the right of assembly \u2026 the constitutional tribunal, rendered partisan and slow, will simply be ineffectual.\u2019\u2019A further worrying sign for human rights defenders in Poland came after a street protest against immigration on 18 November in Wroc\u0142aw. Even though the Polish constitution bans hate crimes, no official condemnation was made after extremists from the Ob\u00f3z Narodowo-Radykalny (National Radical Camp) burned an effigy of a Hassidic Jew holding an EU flag. Rafa\u0142 Pa\u0144kowski of the Never Again association said: \u201cThe lack of condemnation of an incident like this, and the fact that police simply stood and watched, makes groups like ONR feel empowered.

But to the dismay of women\u2019s rights activists, no protests greeted the government\u2019s first concrete policy move \u2013 to scrap subsidies for IVF in public hospitals. Since the Law & Justice party gained an absolute majority in parliament in October, it has not fully declared that it will ban abortion but its MPs attempted the move under the previous coalition with the centrist Civic Platform party.The avowed feminist politician Barbara Nowacka, leader of the United Left coalition, called for defenders of the constitution to embrace women\u2019s rights. \u201cThe defence of democracy and equality go together. Poland has taken several steps backwards in the past couple of weeks. Issues such as women\u2019s equality and LGBT rights seem suddenly to have been cancelled as unimportant.\u201d Law & Justice triumphed in the elections on a mix of social and nationalistic promises: hostility to migrants, pledging to stand up to exploitative foreign investors and banks, reducing the retirement age and introducing a 500 z\u0142oty (\u00a386) a month child grant. Crucially, the campaign had the blessing of conservative bishops.\u201cIt\u2019s payback time for the church,\u201d said Jacek Kucharczyk of the Institute of Public Affairs. \u201cLaw & Justice swept up the armies of people who had stood on church steps for eight years, bearing petitions against abortion and IVF. They were part of the church\u2019s campaign against what it sees as morally regressive so-called gender ideology, perceived as being imposed by western Europe.\u201d Law & Justice\u2019s success at conflating Europe with moral decay creates a difficult challenge for rights activists whose strongest weapons are often international treaties. Among the government\u2019s ambitions is to withdraw from the Council of Europe\u2019s convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, known as the Istanbul convention.Women\u2019s leaders want to regain lost ground. In a special joint communique entitled Congress of Women against Law & Justice, activists denounce a ruling party that \u201cevokes the stereotype of the traditional role of women and seeks to limit the autonomy and freedom of women\u201d. The congress, one of the largest women\u2019s associations in eastern Europe, says it intends to launch an ongoing audit of the government\u2019s record on human rights. It will focus on the promised child grant, which it fears could negatively affect existing means-tested benefits for poorer women. Congress committee member Agnieszka Graff said: \u201cThe general philosophy [of Law and Justice] is the rejection of individual rights in favour of family rights. Abortion is high on the list. It would be banned even in the case of rape. There is speculation that the government is looking at introducing a three-year prison sentence for doctors who perform illegal abortions.\u201cThere will be moves against gender studies in universities and a clampdown against schools that try to offer sex education.

The strategic area includes Hitler\u2019s command post at the grandiose Ksiaz Castle (formerly known as F\u00fcrstenstein) and Project Riese, a suspected secret weapons programme. Project Riese was a network of underground tunnels and chambers dug out beneath the Owl Mountains by an estimated 30,000 prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners. The earth embankment that will be surveyed this week by teams including one from Krakow\u2019s mining academy rises up alongside the existing Wroclaw-Walbrzych railway line. It will be checked with magnetic field detectors, thermal imaging cameras and radars. The site, on the outskirts of Walbrzych, has been under police guard since August when Koper and his friend, German-born Andreas Richter, showed the authorities images they had taken with a \u00a37,000 ground-penetrating radar kit. \u201cFour years ago, we were given information by a witness who was in Walbrzych at the time the train disappeared in April 1945. Radar technology has become affordable so we were able to check the information,\u201d said Koper, who would not reveal if he knew anything about the hiding places of the other two supposed trains. \u201cThe Nazis dug out the embankment, created a junction and laid track to divert the train off to the side. Then they parked the train, which is 90 metres long, removed the rails and put back the soil.\u201dSince August, the Polish military has cleared vegetation from an area the size of a football pitch. Soldiers have swept for mines and analysed the ground for the presence of poison gas. During the holocaust, Zyklon B \u2013 for use in gas chambers \u2013 is believed to have been transported on the line. The treasure hunters\u2019 images show only the outline of what appears to be a train. \u201cWe do not know what is inside, only that it is armoured, which suggests a precious cargo,\u201d said Koper. \u201cThere could be gold but that is not what interests us. In fact, we were looking for a tunnel when we found the train.\u201d The men have hired a lawyer and applied to the Polish treasury for a reward of 10% of the eventual value of the train and its contents. \u201cWe have worked for four years to get to the bottom of legends that have flown around our city for 70 years. It has become a fascination,\u201d said Koper, who added that he and Richter were well out of pocket for having self-funded all their research. But others in Walbrzych, a depressed coal mining town with smog-stained blocks of flats and 20% unemployment, are already cashing in. Initial reports of the discovery, in August, brought a stream of tourists bearing metal detectors. Walbrzych now has a Gold Train Car Wash, a Gold Train Skoda dealership and a line in souvenirs including fridge magnets, stickers, bags and gold ingot paperweights. At the city\u2019s museum, there is a waiting list for gold train mugs.\u201cI\u2019m no Indiana Jones,\u201d said the district governor, Jacek Cichura, \u201cbut my colleagues in the rest of Poland now call me the gold governor. We are in a special economic zone. Life is tough. The young people are leaving to work abroad. But the gold train has brought a tourism boom.\u201d The influx of visitors is being felt across the district - from the towering Ksiaz Castle to the mist-clad Owl Mountains 10 miles (15km) to the south. According to local legend, the F\u00fchrer\u2019s castle lair is linked by at least one secret tunnel to Walbrzych and onwards to Project Riese\u2019s underground network. Riese means giant in German, and this was where Hitler\u2019s Wunderwaffe (magic weapons) were supposedly under development.It is unclear to what extent the underground mega city and arms factory actually functioned and how much of what we know is simply surviving propaganda. But for the past 12 years, carpenter Krzysztof Szpakowski, 56, has dowsed his way to uncovering thousands of metres of passages dynamited into the pine-clad Owl Mountains. Some tunnels are flooded but in others he has found German machine guns and prisoner-of-war graffiti. An eclectic mix of visitors \u2013 from militaria maniacs to bat fanciers \u2013 sign up for his guided tours. But Szpakowski himself has the exploration bug. He broke his arm last week when he slipped in one of the Riese\u2019s dank, eerie tunnels. \u201cThis was a closed military area \u2013 first Russian, then Polish \u2013 until 1991. The soldiers were looking for something. When I was a teenager we knew something had gone on here. But there was no one to ask because all the [German] residents were shipped out of the area and replaced by Poles after the Potsdam agreement.\u201d Szpakowski, Koper and Richter collaborate in their treasure-hunting by lending each other equipment. But they have different views of what is on board the \u201cgold train\u201d. Szpakowski believes it contains top-secret strategic equipment. He said: \u201cThe Nazis wanted to develop an atomic bomb. They were working on anti-gravity propulsion. There is something on that train that was intended for Riese. We only know 5% of what went on in this part of the world,\u201d he said.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news", "Second world war", "Nazism"], "title": "'Nazi gold train' investigators start surveying site in Poland"},{"date": "2015-12-28T14:33:26Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The leader of Poland\u2019s new pro-democracy movement said the government has \u201cbroken the country\u201d after the president, Andrzej Duda, enacted a measure critics say could open the path to authoritarian rule.The amendment radically changes how rulings are made by the highest legislative court, the constitutional tribunal, and its signing by Duda follows warnings from the European Union and nationwide street protests.

Critics say the move will slow down the court and is intended to force it to include the five new judges, who are seen as close to PiS, or leave it unable to pass rulings.PiS gained an absolute majority in the 25 October parliamentary elections, five months after Duda, who is also from the party, was elected. It is the first time since the end of communism that Poland has been ruled by a single party.But critics say PiS has a hardline agenda, similar to that of Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.

The town\u2019s population is \u201c22,000 people with nothing to do\u201d, said Urszula Malicka, 17, a student. Malicka has an aunt in New York and a friend in Sheffield, but she wants to give Warsaw a try before leaving the country. \u201cI would like to go to university in Warsaw to see what it\u2019s like. If I am disappointed I might get in touch with my friends and relatives abroad and go and join them,\u201d she said. But there is little to keep her in Grajewo. \u201cWe have five churches. Why do we need five? What the young people here need is somewhere to just chill. There is nowhere, so you go home.\u201d When he is not doing his homework, her classmate Bartek Partyka mostly plays Iron Maiden songs and video games in his room. His dad is driving him to Gda\u0144sk this week to see Judas Priest. Grajewo does not get international acts. \u201cOn a misty day, Grajewo looks like Chernobyl,\u201d said Partyka, 17. He said he was likely to leave next year to go to university. \u201cWe have low self-esteem in this town,\u201d said Magda Jagielska, 43, owner of a beauty salon. \u201cEvery family has someone who has emigrated to the United States or Canada or the UK over the past 30 years. It is as though we all assume it is better to leave. The brave ones leave and the others just stay here feeling inferior.\u201dLike others in the town, Jagielska is annoyed by suggestions that Poles are benefit scroungers in the UK. \u201cEven if that is true, British people should know that they are getting back more than the Poles are costing them. The Poles work hard, pay taxes and assimilate in the countries they move to. They also have old-fashioned family values that Britain perhaps could do with more of.\u201d Whether or not they take their values to Britain, there is an increasing trend towards entire families migrating to western Europe from towns like Grajewo, according to Anne White, a professor of Polish studies at University College London. \u201cWhen I first visited Grajewo in 2008, the migrants were mainly people migrating without children, going away for shorter periods,\u201d said White. \u201cNow whole families more often migrate abroad. One reason seems to be that people feel things are not improving fast enough in Poland. \u201cThe possibilities for transnational lifestyles mean that migration has changed. People leave, but thanks to Skype and other technology they keep in touch with Poland.\u201d", "tags": ["Poland", "Migration", "European Union", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "Staying put in Poland: \u2018The brave ones leave and the others feel inferior\u2019"},{"date": "2015-10-26T08:51:34Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland has consolidated its rightwing shift after exit polls showed voters had handed an absolute majority in its parliamentary election to Law and Justice, a Eurosceptic party that is against immigration, wants family-focused welfare spending and has threatened to ban abortion and in-vitro fertilisation.The current ruling party, Civic Platform, conceded defeat following the first exit poll, published by Ipsos moments after polling stations closed at 9pm (8pm GMT) on Sunday, which gave the national conservative Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 (Law and Justice party) 39.1% of the vote, putting it far ahead of Civic Platform on 23.4%. On Monday morning, the latest Ipsos poll gave the Law and Justice party 37.7% and Civic Platform 23.6%.Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, Law and Justice\u2019s chairman and the twin brother of Poland\u2019s late president Lech, immediately declared victory. Speaking to supporters at his party headquarters in central Warsaw, a triumphant Kaczynski said: \u201cWe will not kick those who have fallen... We need to show that Polish public life can be different.\u201dIf the latest polling is confirmed, the result would give Law and Justice 232 seats in the 460-member lower house of parliament, meaning the party could govern alone and that its lead candidate, 52-year-old Beata Szyd\u0142o, is likely to be appointed prime minister.Distrustful of Germany and the EU, Law and Justice wants more sovereign control and believes a strong Nato hand is required to deal with Russia. The party promises more welfare spending, a lower retirement age and new taxes on foreign banks.Szyd\u0142o has also campaigned against the EU forcing member states to accept a set number of refugees from the Middle East and north Africa. The British prime minister, David Cameron, has in the past expressed support for Law and Justice and has included his Conservative party in the same European parliamentary grouping, but the Polish shift to the right may not necessarily be supportive of his efforts to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU. Two million Poles working abroad \u2013 including an estimated 700,000 in Britain \u2013 depend on the freedom of movement the EU allows. Polish Euroscepticism is also different from the British variety. It feeds to some degree on frustrations over sovereign influence and the economic dominance of neighbouring Germany, but for the large part it is linked to the country\u2019s conservative family values and worry over gender politics and perceived secularist trends that are seen as undermining the influence of the Catholic church. One Warsaw voter, Ma\u0142gorzata Cyganik, a 37-year-old translator, said she was afraid the election would lead to individual freedoms being curtailed. \u201cThe ideology that is coming into Polish politics [with Law and Justice] is frightening,\u201d she said. Related: 'The name is Szyd\u0142o, Beata Szyd\u0142o': Poland's PM in waiting emerges from obscurity  \u201cPeople are voting to protect what they see as the things that are special about Poland and that are threatened by the outside, but with that may come a big step backwards.\u201d Lucas Miszczyk, a 48-year-old sound technician, took the opposite view, saying he felt Law and Justice was the only party that has Polish interests at heart. \u201cIf you look at Warsaw, you see only foreign shops, banks and brands \u2013 C&A, Bank Millennium, H&M, Carrefour. Where have all the Polish businesses gone? We have opened our doors too much and we have lost control of our own economy. We must say stop.\u201dPoland\u2019s economy is expected to grow by 3.5% this year and next, and unemployment recently fell below 10%. Voters, however, have responded favourably to introspective rhetoric and claims that secular and gender politics in the EU, and the multi-ethnicity of western Europe, are a threat to traditional Catholic values and national sovereignty. The governing Civic Platform has never recovered from a 2014 eavesdropping scandal that discredited high-profile government ministers. The Polish electorate is also faced with a left wing that has failed to rebuild itself since the end of communism. It remains a messy mix of greens, socialists, radicals and post-communists who fell short of the 8% of the vote needed to enter parliament. After voting in the Saska K\u0119pa district of Warsaw, the United Left leader, Barbara Nowacka, said she hoped the election would mark a breakthrough for small parties such as hers. \u201cIt looks like Law and Justice will win, but what is even clearer to me is that voters in Poland want change. You see this because of the way voters are capable of moving from one small party to another. They are looking for a credible system change.\u201d  Law and Justice said Szyd\u0142o would be its prime minister if it formed a government, but the party is also strongly associated with the controversial former prime minister Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski. Related: In deepest rural Poland, politics is shaped by love of church \u2026 and hatred of Brussels  He won political capital during the campaign by playing up fears linked to Europe\u2019s migration crisis. He claimed refugees were bringing \u201ccholera to the Greek islands, dysentery to Vienna, various types of parasites\u201d. Civic Platform has fought to keep Poland\u2019s refugee quota down, finally agreeing to take just short of 7,000 refugees. Law and Justice last held power from 2005 to 2007, when Kaczy\u0144ski governed in tandem with his twin brother, the late president Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, who died in a plane crash in Smolensk, western Russia, in 2010. Their time in power was marked by internal political turmoil triggered by their combative style and international tensions brought about by their anti-German and anti-Russian views. Since his brother\u2019s death, Kaczy\u0144ski has hinted several times that he believes the plane crash was Russia\u2019s work. \u201cIf Law and Justice end up governing alone with an allied president, Poland will become another Hungary,\u201d said Prof Rados\u0142aw Markowski of the Polish Academy of Sciences, a reference to the extremist rightwing views of the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "Migration", "Germany", "Nato", "European Union", "Refugees", "Abortion", "Health", "Society", "World news"], "title": "Poland lurches to right with election of Law and Justice party"},{"date": "2015-10-24T11:00:05Z", "country": "poland", "content": "Poland\u2019s Law and Justice, a rightwing eurosceptic party, is likely to oust the ruling pro-EU Civic Platform in parliamentary elections scheduled this Sunday, further evidence that anti-liberal, anti-EU and anti-immigrant movements are gaining momentum in Europe.

Some of his critics have drawn parallels between these comments and Nazi propaganda, which portrayed Jews as carriers of lice and typhus. But Kaczy\u0144ski brushes off the accusations as \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d.The Law and Justice leader\u2019s great idol is Viktor Orb\u00e1n, whose authoritarian tendencies and nationalist rhetoric have drawn strong condemnation in western Europe. After losing parliamentary elections in 2011, Kaczy\u0144ski vowed: \u201cOne day, we will have a Budapest in Warsaw.\u201d Today, the party says if it wins power it will ensure children receive \u201cmore patriotic upbringing\u201d in schools and the role of public media will be to \u201cbuild national identity\u201d. Some fear Law and Justice wants to stifle media freedom and limit the judiciary\u2019s independence. Adam Michnik, editor-in-chief of Poland\u2019s largest broadsheet, Gazeta Wyborcza, and one of the country\u2019s most respected journalists, has said he worries about a \u201cPutin-style state\u201d if Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s party wins.Aware of the fear many Poles harbour of him wielding such power, the wily 66-year-old Kaczy\u0144ski has made a mild-mannered MP, Beata Szyd\u0142o, his party\u2019s prime ministerial candidate. However, few in Poland doubt who would really be in charge should Law and Justice take power. Some suggest Szyd\u0142o is just a campaign tactic and will be told to step down for the party leader after a brief stint in office. Kaczy\u0144ski founded Law and Justice in 2001 and has maintained an iron grip on the party ever since. On one occasion, when Szyd\u0142o was asked her opinion about a controversial statement Kaczy\u0144ski had made, she replied: \u201cThe chairman is always right.\u201dBut aside from fears of a heavy-handed Law and Justice on the domestic front, what could be the consequences of the party\u2019s victory for the rest of Europe? David Cameron\u2019s negotiations prior to the UK referendum on EU membership will likely be high on the European agenda in the coming months. In the European parliament, Law and Justice MEPs sit with David Cameron\u2019s Tories in the eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists group. \u201cNo further integration and no more powers for Brussels. This is where Law and Justice and the Tories agree,\u201d said Ma\u0142gorzata Bonikowska, head of the Centre for International Relations.However, regarding freedom of movement within the EU, Cameron cannot expect anything different from the current Polish government\u2019s position. \u201cAny kind of restriction on the free movement of people targeted at citizens from our region is unacceptable and non-negotiable,\u201d said Witold Waszczykowski, a Law and Justice MP tipped as potential foreign minister by Kaczy\u0144ski. No surprise there. The opposition party engages in constant chest-thumping about how uncompromising it is when fighting for Polish interests. Considering Polish citizens would likely be adversely affected by any freedom-of-movement restrictions, Law and Justice can hardly be expected to take a softer stance on this issue than the current government.A Law and Justice victory would result in a Poland that is less oriented towards western Europe than under the current government. \u201cCivic Platform considers Poland part of a western team facing global challenges together. Meanwhile, Law and Justice want to focus on ties within the [central and eastern European] region; after that come ties with western Europe. The US and Russia matter, but as for the rest of the world, they\u2019re not really interested,\u201d said Bonikowska. Related: Fear and xenophobia poison Polish polls Meanwhile, though Polish-German relations are currently at a historic high, they may not stay that way for long. Bonikowska says Law and Justice would pursue a \u201cmore assertive policy towards Berlin\u201d. The party intends to push Germany hard for it to agree to a permanent Nato base in Poland, something Berlin has consistently opposed for fear of provoking Russia, which received assurances in 1997 there would be no Nato military bases in eastern Europe. Waszczykowski says those assurances were given to \u201cYeltsin\u2019s Russia, which was relatively weak and cooperative with the west. Today\u2019s Russia is aggressive and imperialistic, there\u2019s no reason we should respect that agreement.\u201d He insists, though, that his party does not intend to escalate existing tensions with Moscow.But there is a personal element at play as well. In 2010, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, then president of Poland and Jaros\u0142aw\u2019s twin brother, died in a plane crash in Smolensk, Russia, along with 95 other people, including many prominent Law and Justice politicians. At one point, Kaczy\u0144ski said he believed his brother had been assassinated and vowed not to rest till he got to the bottom of the matter. Five years later, Russia has yet to return the plane wreckage to Poland, coming up with one excuse after another. It is quite difficult to imagine this issue not casting a long shadow over Polish-Russian relations under a Law and Justice government.Yet paradoxically a Law and Justice victory in Poland could be good news for Vladimir Putin. It would mean a strengthening of the forces that seek to weaken the EU and an ever more divided Europe. It would also mean an unfortunate triumph for those forces who believe that a more nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-liberal Europe is the way forward.", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "A Law and Justice victory in Poland could be good news for Putin | Remi Adekoya"},{"date": "2015-10-24T23:05:13Z", "country": "poland", "content": "The gigantic green-and-yellow tractor should be the pride and joy of Janusz Wnorowski\u2019s humble farmyard. But the 57-year-old milk farmer associates the John Deere with the debt and bureaucracy that have visited him since Poland joined the European Union.\u201cWhom I vote for is a religious decision, not a political one,\u2019\u2019 he says, suggesting he will choose the ultra-conservative Law and Justice party of President Andrzej Duda. Tacitly endorsed by the powerful Roman Catholic Church, Law and Justice is seen in this village as a tool for Jesus Christ to give John Deere \u2013 and thus the EU \u2013 a good hiding.Law and Justice may not win Sunday\u2019s parliamentary and senate elections outright. But surveys suggest its rise will consolidate Poland\u2019s shift to the right. It is expected to finish first, at least 10% ahead of the governing centrist Civic Platform. Law and Justice flirts with racism, homophobia and antisemitism. But in Kulesze Ko\u015bcielne, a village about 200km northeast of Warsaw, it is all about milk.\u201cSince we joined the EU in 2004, our government has not fought for Poland,\u2019\u2019 says Wnorowski, who has 95 cows. \u201cAll this,\u2019\u2019 he says, pointing to the John Deere and a range of alterations imposed by EU rules, \u201cis unnecessary on our small farms.\u2019\u2019 One outbuilding carries an EU plaque, showing that it was built with a grant.\u201cWe have received money, but we have also had to take out loans. Now people in Brussels are deciding that grain farmers should be better compensated for last summer\u2019s drought than beef and milk farmers. It is nonsensical. Poland did not decide to impose sanctions on Russia, yet we have been the first to suffer the consequences of them.\u2019\u2019Kulesze Ko\u015bcielne, a farming community dating back to the 15th century, takes a bleak view of the future it believes is being shaped for it by the EU: the death of small farms. In a meeting room full of sports trophies, mayor J\u00f3zef Grochowski, 60, describes an incredibly united village. \u201cWe stick together. We are all milk farmers or have been. Last year, we were the Polish village whose cows produced the highest amount of milk per cow.\u201cBut now the rules have changed. If you produce too much milk, you are fined. One of our farmers faces certain ruin. He has to pay a fine of 600,000 z\u0142otys (\u00a3101,000). He is not the only one facing punishment. It is madness.\u2019\u2019A crucifix hangs over the meeting room door. \u201cThe municipality was built up around the church. We are very close,\u2019\u2019 says the mayor, who often reads the lesson on Sundays in front of \u201c500 people at an average mass \u2013 1,000 on feast days\u2019\u2019.The huge, white Bleeding Heart of Jesus Christ church is just two minutes\u2019 walk from the town hall. To reach it you pass three electoral banners displayed on the church railings, all of them hung by Law and Justice. The noticeboard carries \u201cpro-life\u2019\u2019 posters. \u201cThe priest does not tell people which political party to support,\u2019\u2019 says the mayor, \u201cbut he advises us to vote for a politician who is a good Catholic, from a party that represents the ideals of the church. Everyone knows.\u2019\u2019The message was crystal clear at the presidential elections in May. That was when the 3,300-strong population of Kulesze Ko\u015bcielne set a national record that is more in keeping with the times than its bumper milk harvest. On a 63.7% turnout \u2013 exceptionally high in Polish terms \u2013 93.5% of voters chose Andrzej Duda.Analysts say homogeneous, isolated villages such as Kulesze Ko\u015bcielne have proved ideal electoral building blocks for Law and Justice. The gradual campaign has lasted for the eight years that the secular Civic Platform has been in power. Its targets have been smallholder farmers in remote locations, who are naturally rightwing for having resisted nationalisation under communism. They are devout and hostile to taking orders from faraway mortals, let alone suited townies in Brussels.Institute of Public Affairs director Jacek Kucharczyk says the Catholic Church in Poland has become increasingly politicised: \u201cSince the Polish pope John Paul II died in 2005, the church has become anti-European and reactionary. It wants a total ban on abortion in Poland and objects to the Civic Platform\u2019s law (in September 2015) that made in-vitro fertilisation broadly available.\u201cPeople in Law and Justice have been close to successive so-called \u2018citizens referendums\u2019 petitions calling for a ban on abortion, for instance. Those signatures have been collected after Sunday mass, on church steps. This has been one of Law and Justice\u2019s most effective tools,\u2019\u2019 he says.While the support for Law and Justice from conservative bishops is largely implicit, the party has received explicit support from a Catholic media empire, including the nationwide broadcaster Radio Maryja, which in some remote locations has the FM band to itself.Kucharczyk says that during the recent parliamentary election campaign Law and Justice dropped issues with a moralistic flavour, such as abortion. Even though party chairman Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski last week claimed \u201cmigrants carry very dangerous diseases\u2019\u2019, this was a rare rant in a middle-of-the-road campaign that has addressed issues many Poles care about.Law and Justice accuses the Civic Platform of allowing Poland to become Germany\u2019s political lapdog in the EU, especially in the wake of its support for German chancellor Angela Merkel on issues such as the conflict in Ukraine and the Greek debt crisis.It claims that the government has allowed greedy foreign investors and banks to run roughshod over Poland, failing to protect the country\u2019s labour force and small borrowers. The Law and Justice party\u2019s campaign pledges to raise taxes on banks and retailers, fire up social spending and reduce the retirement age.Protestations from Civic Platform that it has done a good job \u2013 building Poland into the EU\u2019s sixth largest economy \u2013 seem hollow. A good job for whom, asks village shopkeeper Maria Kulesza, 69. \u201cAt the end of each month, I have several customers who can only afford to buy bread if I offer it to them on credit.\u201cHere in the village, we look after one another, so my shop can survive. But in bigger towns and cities the foreign supermarkets have taken over. The small shops have closed. I want a government that will invest in homegrown industry so that the young people stop leaving Poland to work elsewhere,\u2019\u2019 says Kulesza.She worries that one of her five children, her 45-year-old son, may soon have no option but to seek work abroad.\u201cHe was running a sweet shop for me at the school. But then new rules were introduced, saying you could only sell healthy things in schools. But children want to buy sweets! If we just meekly accept all the EU rules, all our sons will have to go and work elsewhere.\u2019\u2019Neither she nor the other villagers seem to think Law and Justice is racist or opposed to immigrants. She is shocked at the thought. \u201cAs a principle, we must help and respect others. But Poland is a poor country that can barely help itself. How can we hope to help others when we can\u2019t help ourselves?", "tags": ["Poland", "Europe", "World news"], "title": "In deepest rural Poland, politics is shaped by love of church \u2026 and hatred of Brussels"}]
